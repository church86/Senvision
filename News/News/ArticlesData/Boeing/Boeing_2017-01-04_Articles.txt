Bloomberg News Jan 5, 2017 at 4:00 pm | Print View The unprecedented jetliner shopping spree that’s spanned more than a decade is drawing to a close. That’s bad news for Boeing and Airbus Group, which face slowing jet sales and the highest level of airplane-delivery deferrals in at least 15 years. Final 2016 tallies to be unveiled over the next few days probably will show aircraft orders trailing shipments, a sign of a weakening market. Airline profits are poised to fall from last year’s peak, with even Persian Gulf juggernauts Emirates and Etihad Airways tempering growth. Unlike past retrenchments triggered by terrorism or recession, demand also has been hurt by the relatively low cost of fuel. While oil has risen in the past year, prices are hovering at about $50 a barrel, half of what they were in mid-2014. That gives airlines less incentive to retire older jetliners or order newer, more efficient models. The glut of jets is sapping interest in wide-body planes and threatening production increases that Boeing and Airbus have plotted over the next two years for the lucrative 737 and A320 families of single-aisle aircraft. With last week’s revelation that Emirates is postponing a dozen Airbus A380 superjumbos, the total number of delivery delays for the year reached 251, the most since at least 2001, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s not that the sky is falling, but we are definitely late in the cycle,” said Ron Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Corp. So far, planemakers have been able to find other takers for production slots that have been vacated as carriers such as United Continental and Southwest Airlines postpone deliveries and scan the secondary market for bargains.

Credit: NASA In a significant step towards restoring America’s indigenous human spaceflight capability and fostering the new era of commercial space fight, NASA has awarded a slew of additional astronaut taxi flights from Boeing and SpaceX to carry crews to the International Space Station (ISS). NASA’s new announcement entails awarding an additional four crew rotation missions each to commercial partners, Boeing and SpaceX, on top of the two demonstration fights previously awarded to each company under the agency’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) initiative, in a Jan. 3 statement. However, the newly awarded crew rotation missions will only take place after NASA has certified that each provider is fully and satisfactorily meeting NASA’s long list of stringent safety and reliability requirements to ensure the private missions will be safe to fly with humans aboard from NASA and its partner entities. And NASA officials were careful to point out that these orders “do not include payments at this time.” In other words, NASA will pay for performance, not mere promises of performance – because human lives are on the line. “They fall under the current Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contracts, and bring the total number of missions awarded to each provider to six,” NASA officials announced.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The goal of the CCP program is to ensure robust and reliable crew transportation to the International Space Station in this decade and beyond – using American rockets and capsules launching from American soil. A further goal is to end America’s sole reliance on Russia for transporting American astronauts to and from the space station using Russia’s Soyuz crew capsules. Since the forced retirement of NASA’s Space Shuttle’s in July 2011, NASA astronauts and its partners have been 100% dependent on Russia for rides to space – currently to the tune of over $80 million per seat. By awarding these new contracts, Boeing and SpaceX should be able to plan further ahead in the future, order long lead time hardware and software, and ultimately cut costs through economy of scale. “Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,” said Phil McAlister, director, NASA’s Commercial Spaceflight Development Division, in a statement. “The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program.” Each spaceship can deliver a crew of four and 220 pounds of cargo, experiments and gear to the million pound science laboratory orbiting Earth at an altitude of appox. 250 miles (400 km). They also serve as a lifeboat in case the occupants need to evacuate the station for any reason. Boeing and SpaceX are building private spaceships to resume launching US astronauts from US soil to the International Space Station in 2018. Credit: NASA Boeing and SpaceX were awarded contracts by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden in September 2014 worth $6.8 Billion to complete the development and manufacture of the privately developed Starliner CST-100 and Crew Dragon astronaut transporters, respectively, under the agency’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) program and NASA’s Launch America initiative. The CCP initiative was started back in 2010 under the Obama Administration to replace NASA’s outgoing space shuttle orbiters. However, launch targets for first fight by the Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon have been repeatedly postponed from 2015 to 2018 – in the latest iteration – due to severe and extremely shortsighted funding cutbacks by Congress year after year. Thus NASA has been forced to order several years more additional Soyuz taxi seat flights and send hundreds and hundreds of millions of more US dollars to Putin’s Russia – thanks to the US Congress. Congress enjoys whining about Russia on one hand, while at the same time they put America’s aerospace workers on the unemployment line by curtailing NASA’s ability to move forward and put Americans back to work. There is ample bipartisan blame for this sad state of affairs. The Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon are both Made in America.

Blastoff of the first SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft on its first unmanned test flight, or Demonstration Mission 1, is postponed from May 2017 to November 2017, according to the latest quarterly revision just released by NASA last month in Dec. 2016. Liftoff of the first piloted Crew Dragon with a pair of NASA astronauts strapped in has slipped from August 2017 to May 2018. Launch of the first uncrewed Boeing Starliner, known as an Orbital Flight Test, has slipped to June 2018. Liftoff of the first crewed Starliner is now slated for August 2018, possibly several months after SpaceX. But the schedules keep changing so it’s anyone’s guess as to when these commercial crew launches will actually occur. Boeing’s uncrewed flight test, known as an Orbital Flight Test, is currently scheduled for June 2018 and its crewed flight test currently is planned for August 2018. “Once the flight tests are complete and NASA certifies the providers for flight, the post-certification missions to the space station can begin,” NASA official said.

(J.B. Forbes/St. Louis Post-Dispatch) At 87, the pink slip catches up to longtime Boeing engineer Thu Jan 5th, 2017 1:31pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Jesse Bogan, St. Louis Post-Dispatch KIRKWOOD, Mo. — The day the boss man finally came for Bob King was July 22. That day started out as routine. King stuffed a low-sodium breakfast and lunch into a brown sack and nosed his 2011 Toyota Camry north on Lindbergh Boulevard all the way to Boeing. The stalwart employee found a parking space on the sprawling lot near the airport and ambled to the front door, cane in hand. Then he went down a long hall to the elevator, up a few floors, across another hallway and a few more stairs to Building No. 32, where he settled into a cubicle. King, 87, ran his blue eyes over spreadsheets and databases. In his latest gig as a systems engineer in Off-Boeing Programs, he kept track of the labyrinth of regulations and directions on how to install new wings on the A-10 Warthog used by the U.S. Air Force. In his seat that memorable day last summer, a manager — about the age of King’s children — tapped him on the shoulder. His career, which spanned more than a half-century of aerospace innovation, was coming to an end. “I got caught in a RIF,” said King, perturbed. “You know what that is?” King was part of a reduction in force at the $97 billion behemoth. All of a sudden, he had 60 days to prepare for retirement and pass along parting knowledge. There had been celebrations for him throughout his tenure, marking 40 years of service, 45 and 50. In September, after 53 years with Boeing, a cake-cutting marked his forced retirement. A layoff, even this late in life, stings. King was one of the oldest of 14,000 Boeing employees in the St. Louis area. Yet he still sounded a little bitter. Then he yielded. “God knew I was never going to retire and he said, ‘I have news for you,’” said King, a devout member of Trinity Lutheran Church. “I’d have worked forever.” And so King has come home to Kirkwood. He and his wife, Donamay, live in a ranch home with three bedrooms and one bath. They bought it in 1964 for $18,500 and raised six children there born within a span of seven years. While Bob chipped away at missiles and electronic equipment, Donamay ran the packed home on Cherry Street. “Some guys will do anything to get out of the house and get out of yard work,” Donamay, finally coming out to talk, said laughing. “He’s a workaholic with airplanes and other stuff. Nothing around here.” They met as children in a rural area near Toledo, Ohio, where, at times, they grew up without running water. Sometimes he cut asparagus and picked tomatoes for Donamay’s father, who had a vegetable and fruit business. “Maybe my dad was a little bit like my husband because my dad just worked and worked and worked. So did my mom,” Donamay said. “Sometimes he was so tired, he’d be sitting there eating an apple and he’d fall asleep. He was a good guy.” Bob King was valedictorian of his high school class of 18 students, according to a newspaper clip. He studied engineering at the University of Toledo and taught radar repair in the Marine Corps. Starting in the 1950s, he cut his teeth for a decade at Convair in San Diego by helping develop flight control systems for the F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart. “Those were good days when I would go out and work on the aircraft and go down to production and teach them how to rig the flight control,” he said. Upon moving to St. Louis in 1963 to work at McDonnell Aircraft, what would eventually become Boeing through a series of mergers, he developed the reputation of a tenacious analyzer. “I have excellent skills at seeing the big picture and the little details all at the same time and keeping it all in the proper perspective,” he said. Tim Bartlett, director of Off-Boeing Programs, confirmed as much. King was recently one of 300 employees under Bartlett’s wing. He said none of them, other than King, worked beyond their 60s. Boeing didn’t provide broader personnel demographics but pointed to stories a few years ago about Elinor Otto, a 93-year-old “Rosie the Riveter” who still worked for the company in California at the time. Bartlett said King was respected late in his career for his intelligence: “A lot of wisdom. A lot of history. He’s also attuned to state-of-the-art systems.” Bartlett, 47, shares the same birthday with his former employee. “Bob is definitely good at giving me feedback,” he said. “I valued it at different times for sure.” King previously held management positions and, as part of the corporate planning department, researched ways the company could diversify product lines and possibly get out of others. “Should we build buses? Trains?” King said. “We even looked at Peabody (Energy) at one time and said, ‘No way.’” In the 1970s, he was involved with the suspended maneuvering system, which was supposed to help fire departments pluck people from burning high-rises. “We felt there was a need for it,” King said. But it didn’t become mass-produced because the system required a medium-size helicopter to deploy. Most cities had small helicopters that couldn’t support the weight. Reflecting on the project, King talked about the complexity of bringing a new product to market. “There is a long way between an idea and design and development and production,” he said. He was also an engineer on the cruise missile and Tomahawk weapons system. He said he was a “trusted agent” with the Navy. He justified helping manufacture lethal weapons by weighing the alternative. “We are building what we need to keep the peace,” he said. “Hopefully, we never use it, but you can’t afford to be without it.” King’s health eventually became an obstacle along his career path. He had a heart attack in 1989. A 2005 stroke limited use of his right arm. More recently, he’s had a stent put in his left carotid artery. With congestive heart failure, fluid sometimes needs to be drained from his body. He’s limited to consuming no more than 64 ounces of water per day. He still spends a lot of time behind a desk, only now it’s at home, where he studies various Excel spreadsheets. Each cell has Bible verses and other details for his “Kingdom of God” book project. He watchdogs his investments, which have included tuition for grandchildren and great-grandchildren, donations to many charities and his own retirement. As part of his layoff package, he was paid one week’s salary for every year he worked. Sounding disappointed again, he said Boeing capped the payout at 26 years of service. Not that he needs the extra money. The house and family car are paid for many times over. He said he wants to tutor math and stay involved in other projects. He said it’s time to spend time at home with Donamay. “People ask me about Bob, and I say he’s going to do what he’s going to do,” she said. “He probably says the same about me.” They are getting to know each other again.

By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the Paris Air Show in 2015. Boeing and rival Airbus Group face slowing jet sales and the highest level of airplane-delivery deferrals in at least 15 years. A glut of jets is sapping interest in wide-body planes and threatening production increases that Boeing and Airbus have plotted over the next two years. (Remy de la Mauviniere / AP) The unprecedented jetliner shopping spree that’s spanned more than a decade is drawing to a close. That’s bad news for Boeing and Airbus Group, which face slowing jet sales and the highest level of airplane-delivery deferrals in at least 15 years. Final 2016 tallies to be unveiled over the next few days will probably show aircraft orders trailing shipments, a sign of a weakening market. Airline profits are poised to fall from last year’s peak, with even Persian Gulf juggernauts Emirates and Etihad Airways tempering growth. Unlike past retrenchments triggered by terrorism or recession, demand has also been hurt by the relatively low cost of fuel. While oil has risen in the past year, prices are hovering at about $50 a barrel, half of what they were in mid-2014. That gives airlines less incentive to retire older jetliners or order newer, more efficient models. The glut of jets is sapping interest in wide-body planes and threatening production increases that Boeing and Airbus have plotted over the next two years for the lucrative 737 and A320 families of single-aisle aircraft. With last week’s revelation that Emirates is postponing a dozen Airbus A380 superjumbos, the total number of delivery delays for the year reached 251, the most since at least 2001, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s not that the sky is falling, but we are definitely late in the cycle,” said Ron Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Corp. So far, planemakers have been able to find other takers for production slots that have been vacated as carriers such as United Continental and Southwest Airlines postpone deliveries and scan the secondary market for bargains. “The real question becomes how long are they able to do that for,” Epstein said during a presentation last month. Nobody knows how steep the downturn will be or how long it will last, and the trade war with China threatened by President-elect Donald Trump only adds to the uncertainty. In contrast to previous slowdowns, global air travel is still growing and airlines are mostly making money, providing assurance they’ll follow through on the bulk of their orders. Airbus and Boeing are sitting on a near-record $1.2 trillion order backlog, and to some extent are victims of their own success. Airlines aren’t racing to close deals for jetliner models that are sold out for the rest of the decade, such as Airbus’s A350 and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. As the second-largest U.S. defense contractor, Chicago-based Boeing has an added cushion: Weapons sales seem likely to increase because Trump has vowed to boost military budgets, even as he’s railed against costs. There are signs, however, that the aerospace cycle has peaked. Global airline profit this year is forecast to fall 16 percent to $29.8 billion from 2016’s apex, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group. Another indicator of the aircraft manufacturing’s health, a measure of sales to shipments known as the book-to-bill ratio, is expected fall to the weakest level since the 2009 recession, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Boeing had netted 470 orders through Dec. 20, well short of its targeted deliveries of 740 to 745 planes for the year. Airbus reported 410 net orders through November. The European planemaker had been aiming to deliver 670 jetliners in 2016, 20 more than it forecast at the start of the year. The annual totals don’t include sales to Iran or deals closed late in December, including an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max placed by General Electric Co.’s aircraft leasing division. Spokesmen for Boeing and Airbus declined to comment. Airbus shares gained only 1.4 percent last year after surging 50 percent in 2015. Boeing climbed 7.7 percent, trailing the S&P 500 Index. The outlook for Boeing investors this year is worse, with a potential return of 0.4 percent based on the average 12-month target price of 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By the same yardstick, Airbus is poised for a 3.6 percent increase. The market is also absorbing a glut of twin-aisle jets after output increased at a 16 percent annual pace from 2011 through 2015, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. Last month, Boeing announced a second cut in the production rate of its 777 jetliner amid a sales drought, while Airbus’s A330neo orders have stalled, he said. About 18,070 passenger planes were in service as of November, a 41 percent jump from 2007, according to a Dec. 19 report by Deutsche Bank. Only 6.6 percent of the global fleet was stored, down from 8.3 percent in November 2007. “It’s different manifestations of the same problem,” Aboulafia said. “With twin-aisles, it’s demand. With single-aisles, it’s fuel.” There are other indications that the market is saturated: Lease rates peaked in 2015, while aircraft values have retreated since January 2016, said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy. Even prices for in-demand narrow-bodies like Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 could be at risk over the next three years if the planemakers follow through on plans to increase output 36 percent. “Our analysis shows capacity growth will be too high with production rates increasing and retirements remaining low, so something has to give,” Dimitroff said. “Unless we see global air-travel growth above 7 percent over the next few years, it’s difficult to see how all that additional capacity on the market will be filled.” Published: Jan. 5, 2017, 11:45 a.m.  Tags: Airbus, airlines, airplanes, aviation, Boeing, jetliners, jet sales Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

The glut of jets is sapping interest in wide-body planes and threatening production increases that Boeing and Airbus have plotted over the next two years for the lucrative 737 and A320 families of single-aisle aircraft. With last week's revelation that Emirates is postponing a dozen Airbus A380 superjumbos, the total number of delivery delays for the year reached 251, the most since at least 2001, according to Flight Fleets Analyser data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. "It's not that the sky is falling, but we are definitely late in the cycle," said Ron Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Corp. So far, planemakers have been able to find other takers for production slots that have been vacated as carriers such as United Continental and Southwest Airlines postpone deliveries and scan the secondary market for bargains. "The real question becomes how long are they able to do that for," Epstein said during a presentation last month. Continued below.

In contrast to previous slowdowns, global air travel is still growing and airlines are mostly making money, providing assurance they'll follow through on the bulk of their orders. Airbus and Boeing are sitting on a near-record $1.2 trillion (NZ$1.7t) order backlog, and to some extent are victims of their own success. Airlines aren't racing to close deals for jetliner models that are sold out for the rest of the decade, such as Airbus's A350 and Boeing's 787 Dreamliner. As the second-largest US defence contractor, Chicago-based Boeing has an added cushion: Weapons sales seem likely to increase because Trump has vowed to boost military budgets, even as he's railed against costs. It's not the sky is falling, but we're definitely late in the cycle. Ron Epstein, Bank of America analyst There are signs, however, that the aerospace cycle has peaked. Global airline profit this year is forecast to fall 16 per cent to $29.8 billion (NZ$42.4b) from 2016's apex, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group. Another indicator of the aircraft manufacturing health, a measure of sales to shipments known as the book-to-bill ratio, is expected fall to the weakest level since the 2009 recession, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Boeing had netted 470 orders through Dec. 20, well short of its targeted deliveries of 740 to 745 planes for the year. Airbus reported 410 net orders through November. The European planemaker had been aiming to deliver 670 jetliners in 2016, 20 more than it forecast at the start of the year. The annual totals don't include sales to Iran or deals closed late in December, including an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max placed by General Electric Co.'s aircraft leasing division. Spokesmen for Boeing and Airbus declined to comment. Airbus shares gained only 1.4 per cent last year after surging 50 per cent in 2015. Boeing climbed 7.7 percent, trailing the S&P 500 Index. The outlook for Boeing investors this year is worse, with a potential return of 0.4 per cent based on the average 12-month target price of 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By the same yardstick, Airbus is poised for a 3.6 per cent increase. Our analysis shows capacity growth will be too high with production rates increasing and retirements remaining low, so something has to give. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy The market is also absorbing a glut of twin-aisle jets after output increased at a 16 per cent annual pace from 2011 through 2015, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. Last month, Boeing announced a second cut in the production rate of its 777 jetliner amid a sales drought, while Airbus's A330neo orders have stalled, he said. About 18,070 passenger planes were in service as of November, a 41 per cent jump from 2007, according to a Dec. 19 report by Deutsche Bank. Only 6.6 per cent of the global fleet was stored, down from 8.3 per cent in November 2007. "It's different manifestations of the same problem," Aboulafia said. "With twin-aisles, it's demand. With single-aisles, it's fuel." There are other indications that the market is saturated: Lease rates peaked in 2015, while aircraft values have retreated since January 2016, said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy. Even prices for in-demand narrow-bodies like Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320 could be at risk over the next three years if the planemakers follow through on plans to increase output 36 per cent. "Our analysis shows capacity growth will be too high with production rates increasing and retirements remaining low, so something has to give," Dimitroff said. "Unless we see global air-travel growth above 7 per cent over the next few years, it's difficult to see how all that additional capacity on the market will be filled."

UPHOLD THIS AIR DEAL WITH IRAN Last September, Washington granted permission to the American aerospace manufacturer Boeing and its European rival Airbus (which uses some American components) to sell commercial aircraft to Iran. Iran has reached a $16.6 billion deal to buy 80 jetliners from Boeing. Boeing asserts that this sale will support thousands of U.S. jobs. Iran has also reached a deal to buy 100 additional aircraft from Airbus. Opponents of the nuclear agreement between Iran and the U.S. seek to block the sale by Boeing. But if they are successful, Iran will buy all of its jets from Airbus instead of Boeing. To create American jobs, the sale by Boeing should be approved. Otherwise, to create a level playing field for Boeing, the sales by both Boeing and Airbus should be blocked. Ted Sheskin, Flushing

This takes the total number of missions to SpaceX and Boeing to six each.  ( Alexander Gerst | ESA via Getty Images ) Advertisement NASA has bestowed four more contracts each to SpaceX and Boeing for ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station in 2018. The new crew rotation missions to the private firms will take the number of total missions with SpaceX and Boeing to six each. A statement from NASA said the space taxis will transport up to four astronauts and 220 pounds of critical cargo to the space station. "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. Flight Schedules The debut flight test of Space X without crews is expected in November, to be followed up by a Crew Dragon capsule test in May 2018. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner test with crew will take off in August 2018. In the crewed missions, a lifeboat capability will be a highlight, allowing the ISS astronauts to return safely to Earth in an emergency. Despite the publicized schedules, the crewed missions to ISS would take off only after the companies get the flight certification nod from NASA. For NASA, the fresh contracts make sense, as the arrangements have to be in place for the transfer of astronauts to ISS as the deal with Russian Space agency may not continue beyond 2018. The United States ended its Space Shuttle program in 2011 and was relying on Russia's Soyuz rockets to ferry ISS crew. For using the services of the Russian spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS, the spending by NASA was near $80 million for every seat on the Soyuz rocket. Russia's space agency Roscosmos stated in 2015 that it will not continue the arrangement of sending U.S. astronauts to the ISS after 2018. This has added a new urgency to NASA. It means SpaceX or Boeing has to keep the capsules ready by 2018 to manage the U.S. presence on the space station. NASA inked the space taxi contracts with Boeing and SpaceX in 2014 and offered them two missions each as a starter. Both Space X and Boeing will be launching their space taxi services from Florida's Space Coast. Boeing may operate from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, while SpaceX will opt for the Kennedy Space Center of NASA. ISS Transit Meanwhile, an opportunity is coming up to see the International Space Station passing in front of the sun on Thursday morning at the Denver Metro area. A map of the space station's transit across the sun through Denver has been released by the Denver Astronomical Society. The transit is expected at 11:16 a.m. Thursday. For watching the ISS solar transit, binoculars or telescopes with an eyepiece and solar filter must be used. "The sun is way too bright to look at without safe filters. It can actually cause blindness, either temporary, or in some cases, permanent damage to the eye," said Ron Hranac, president of the Denver Astronomical Society. Since the movement of ISS will be will be faster, it will take only less than a second to pass across the sun. TAG NASA, SpaceX, ISS, Boeing, Soyuz © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

(Courtesy of Boeing) Comments Share Tweet Share Share After weeks of what seemed like ongoing bad news for Boeing, the company finished out 2016 with a huge order for one of its most successful planes. The order will keep Boeing workers in Renton busy for “years to come,” according to Doug Alder with Boeing. “This is a big order to end 2016 for Boeing,” Alder said. “It involves 75 of our brand new 737 MAX airplanes.” Related: Why Boeing’s problems are nothing when compared to ‘the old days’ GE Capital Aviation Services is the commercial aircraft leasing and financing arm of General Electric. As of December 2016, an order for 75 of the 737 MAX 8 airplanes has been placed. It’s a deal worth $8.25 billion. “They are in the business of buying airplanes and they will take those airplanes and lease them out to airlines across the world,” Alder said. “With this order, they actually become the largest aircraft leasing company to have the MAX on order,” he added. “They continue to grow their MAX fleet and are the largest owner of a MAX fleet in the world. They have a total of 170 on order.” The 737 MAX is the fasted-selling airplane in the aerospace company’s history. The company has taken 3,419 orders for the model. “Our narrowbody single-aisle products like the 737 and the 737 MAX, we see robust demand for that,” Alder said. “So Renton is going to stay busy for a long time.” The bad and good news for Boeing While the news is good for Boeing’s Renton operations, Alder said it won’t affect manufacturing at the company’s Everett site. Boeing announced late in 2016 that it was lowering production and staffing levels in Everett in response to lower-than-expected demand for its 777 jets. The company had planned to deliver seven of the 777 model per month, but it didn’t receive enough orders for the jets and therefore cut back. The news came shortly before the company also decided to halt its staggered scheduling for 787 workers in Everett. The start times were costing too much money, and the change is hoped to increase efficiency. A concern, however, is that local traffic could be negatively affected. Other departments in Everett could also see a scheduling change. This all came amid negative tweets about the company posted by President-elect Donald Trump. Trump claimed the aerospace company’s prices for new Air Force One planes was too steep, and that he would reject any deal. He also bad mouthed a potential deal for next generation fighter jets. This prompted a meeting with Boeing’s CEO to smooth things over. It seemed to have worked, according to Boeing. The next day, Trump made a more favorable tweet about Boeing.

The President-elect reacted with a tweet reminding his comrades on Capitol Hill that Congress had better things to do. Within a day, House Republicans heeded the war By: Harlan Ullman 05-Jan-17 1548 1548 Top News Admiral Zakaullah calls on Bahrain’s naval chief 16-Jan-17 259 ISLAMABAD: Chief of Naval Staf ... Load shedding continues unabated despite PM’s claims 16-Jan-17 252 ISLAMABAD: The announcement ma ... Given President-elect (PE) Donald Trump’s ukase-like tweets last week, if President George W. Bush has not phoned his successor once removed with a crisp message, he should do so immediately. Six words are enough. “Donald, you are not president yet!” And, the 43rd president might have added, “And please do a little more homework before sounding off.” The President-elect’s preference to govern and rule by twitter is novel if not extraordinary. Both American and international audiences are puzzled, intrigued and in some cases concerned or worried by this approach to lead a country especially before taking office. And given Mr. Trump’s dependence on twitter, the betting is that as president, one is likely to see more not less. Some of his tweets over the past week or two clearly sparked reactions, good and bad. The intervention of Mr. Trump via twitter and MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski into the most vital and potentially existential national security issues is, at best, unhelpful. These tweets followed the post-election congratulatory phone calls Mr. Trump accepted from the Taiwan president and Pakistani prime minister. The first called into question the forty-five year old “one China policy.” The second provoked India. More seriously, Mr. Trump has called for “greatly strengthening and expanding” our nuclear weapons and boasted about winning a nuclear arms race against Russia; rejected the Obama administration’s abstention of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel for expanding settlements into the occupied territories; and threatened two major defense contractors — Boeing over the cost of the next Air Force One and Lockheed-Martin over the huge cost growth of the F-35 Lightning II fifth generation fighter. Since Dwight Eisenhower promised to go to Korea to end that war in 1952, no other President-elect has imposed himself so dramatically on the political scene as has Mr. Trump. The President-elect has done this with 140 characters rather than press conferences or written op-ed pieces. Serious people worry whether these interventions help or hurt American security especially when each appears to be an instinctive rather than a well-thought out response. And many fear this style of instant reaction is indicative of what will be a very active presidential bull in a very fragile China shop. Concerning the need for fuller understanding and knowledge of the issues, consider the tweets about nuclear weapons and the costs of Air Force One and the F-35 Lightning. During the campaign, Mr. Trump did not seem to understand what the nuclear triad of land, sea and air deterrent forces was or meant. Nor did the PE acknowledge that both Russia and America have signed the New Start Treaty limiting both sides to 1550 strategic launchers and about 5,000 warheads. If Mr. Trump was reacting to President Vladimir Putin’s meeting with his senior military leaders in which Putin vowed to make Russian strategic nuclear capabilities sufficient to defeat the West’s defensive anti-ballistic systems, did he appreciate the argument the Russian president was making? The answer appears to be no. Regarding Boeing and Air Force One, while the company’s CEO Dennis Muilenberg pledged to keep the cost below $4 billion that is not his or Boeing’s call. It is the White House that sets Air Force One’s requirements to protect the president from all dangers whether kinetic or electronic that drive costs. In prompting Boeing for an F-18 Super Hornet alternative to the F-35, did anyone advise the president that such a request had been made before and proved to be unworkable? Or did the PE know that only the Navy and Marines fly the F-18 not the Air Force? And did anyone inform the chief executive to be that eight other nations are planning to buy or have bought F-35’s so that cuts to the program could be disastrous for this coalition? But suppose Mr. Trump had taken a different tack based on a fuller understanding of these issues. He could have reminded President Putin that Ronald Reagan helped bankrupt the Soviet Union with the Strategic Defense Initiative. That tweet might have said: “Vlad, Star Wars broke you last time. Don’t force us to do it again!” About Air Force One, a tweet might have read: “$4 billion for AF One is outrageous. We will ensure the price is right.” And instead of trying to leverage Lockheed Martin’s F-35 costs with an upgraded Super Hornet, the next commander-in-chief could have proposed: “Unmanned aerial vehicles are smart, effective and can create jobs. Boeing and Lockheed, what can you do about that?” Earlier this week, the President-elect released two tweets that issued salutary warning that appears to have been effective. The city of Chicago released the tragic statistic of 762 people shot and killed in 2016. Mr. Trump tweeted that Chicago might ask for help from the federal government, an offer that was immediately accepted by Mayor Rahm Emmanuel — a Democrat and former Barack Obama chief of staff. The Republican House of Representatives decided to neuter the office of ethics oversight. The President-elect reacted with a tweet reminding his comrades on Capitol Hill that Congress had better things to do. Within a day, House Republicans heeded the warning and backed off the changes. Whatever one thinks of the president-elect, the greater challenge is not to make America great again. The challenge is to confront and fix the myriad problems, many irrational and self-imposed by a government in gridlock, that got Mr. Trump elected in the first place. Instinct is important provided it is headed in the proper direction. Instinct based on fuller knowledge and understanding is even better. Whether Mr. Trump’s last two tweets reflect a sea change in his attitudes or not remains to be seen. However this use of the Bully Pulpit, if it continues, could augur a refreshing change.   Harlan Ullman is UPI’s Arnaud de Borchgrave Distinguished Columnist and a Senior Advisor at Washington D.C.’s Atlantic Council and Business Executives for National Security.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co (GE.N) Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .SPX.

The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .

The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .SPX.

TrendsViral NASA announced on Tuesday that Elon Musk’s Space X and Boeing, headed by Dennis Muilenburg, have been awarded the new missions under the agency’s Commercial Crew Program. It brings each of their total NASA contracts to six. While the new contracts “do not include payments at this time”, the additional flights will allow SpaceX and Boeing to plan for future missions “while fulfilling space station transportation needs,” according to NASA. READ MORE: 2016 in space: A year of spectacular highs and crushing lows (PHOTOS, VIDEOS) "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director at NASA’s Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. “The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program,” he added.

SpaceX learns from Falcon 9 explosion, next launch days away On top of that, SpaceX and Boeing will transport about 220lb (100kg) of cargo to the ISS, and provide a “lifeboat capability” that can bring astronauts back to Earth in the case of emergency. The first unmanned test flight will be carried out by SpaceX’s ‘Demonstration Mission 1’ in November, 2017, with a manned test flight scheduled for May 2018. Boeing’s ‘Orbital Flight Test’, an unmanned test will take place in June of 2018, with a manned test flight planned for August 2018. Once the test flights are complete and NASA certifies them for flight, human missions to the space station can begin. The new providers will take over from the Russian spacecraft Soyuz, which is currently the sole means of delivering crew to the ISS. In May 2016, Russia said it had no intention of renewing its contract to deliver US astronauts to the station after the current contract ends in 2018. "We are working with our partners under the effective contracts, but we have no plans for concluding new ones," said Sergey Saveliev, the deputy chief of Roscosmos. The intention to sever the relationship had been clearly indicated by NASA, which announced plans to give up Russia’s space travel services in lieu of home-grown spacecraft as far back as 2013.

An artist’s conception shows a straight-on view of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner space taxi. (Boeing / NASA Photo) NASA has awarded four more contracts to Boeing and to SpaceX for space taxi trips to and from the International Space Station – dependent on certification that the spacecraft are safe. SpaceX is working on a crew-capable version of its Dragon capsule for NASA’s use, while Boeing is developing a capsule known as the CST-100 Starliner. Each company has already been given contracts for two flights; the contracts announced today brings the total trips to six for each. The space taxis haven’t yet been tested in flight. SpaceX has scheduled an uncrewed demonstration flight of its Crew Dragon to the space station in November, followed by a crewed flight test in May 2018. Boeing’s schedule calls for an uncrewed flight in June 2018 and a crewed flight test in August 2018. An artist’s conception shows SpaceX’s crew-capable Dragon approaching a port on the International Space Station with a cargo Dragon in the foreground. (NASA Photo) The demonstrations are covered under $6.8 billion in development contracts that NASA awarded in 2014. The 12 flights covered by the follow-up contracts would go ahead once the test flights are flown and NASA certifies the taxis. The post-certification contract awards do not require NASA to make any payments at this time, but they do provide Boeing and SpaceX with commitments that will help them plan for future needs. “Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,” Phil McAlister, director of NASA’s Commercial Spaceflight Development Division, said in a news release. “The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program.” Since the space shuttle fleet’s retirement in 2011, NASA has had to depend on the Russians to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost that now amounts to more than $80 million per seat. SpaceX and Boeing say they can do the job for less. Each taxi flight calls for transporting up to four astronauts and about 220 pounds of critical cargo, either for scheduled crew rotation or in an emergency lifeboat situation. Both companies would launch from Florida’s Space Coast. Boeing would send the Starliner into orbit using a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Space Launch Complex 41, while SpaceX would launch its Crew Dragon from Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Pad 39A atop a Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX could start using Pad 39A, which served as the departure point for Apollo moon missions and shuttle flights, for satellite launches as early as this month. Meanwhile, NASA is working on its own launch system for flights beyond Earth orbit. The first flight test of the heavy-lift Space Launch System is scheduled for late 2018. It’s due to send an uncrewed Orion space capsule around the moon and back. Crewed flights would follow in the 2020s.

(NASA) Print Email Lee Roop | lroop@al.com By Lee Roop | lroop@al.com The Huntsville Times Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 04, 2017 at 10:36 AM comments NASA gave Boeing and SpaceX orders Tuesday for four more crew flights each to the International Space Station. The missions are part of $6.8 billion in contracts already awarded the companies in 2014, and the Boeing award is good news for Alabama. Huntsville Boeing employees are working on the company's crew capsule, and Decatur United Launch Alliance workers will build the Atlas V rocket it will ride to space. Neither capsule will be ready to fly before 2018, according to the latest reports. That means NASA will have to buy four more seats on Russia's Soyuz rocket this year for astronauts scheduled to go to the station. Those seats cost more than $80 million each, and Boeing and SpaceX say they can beat that price. SpaceX plans to test its Dragon crew capsule in November and fly a crew in May 2018. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner will fly uncrewed in June 2018 and with a crew in August 2018, according to Boeing's plans. These so-called space taxis must be able to transport up to four astronauts and 220 pounds of cargo. Both will launch from the Kennedy Space Center-Cape Canveral complex in Florida. NASA won't have to pay Boeing or SpaceX any more money now, but the award lets them move forward with more confidence. "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director of NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. .  TALKING POLITICS Alabama/California Conversation Project We asked Alabama Trump voters to talk politics, values with California liberals Civic-minded Donald Trump voters in Alabama agreed to have a deep, serious, respectful conversation with Hillary Clinton voters from one of the most liberal places in America, the San Francisco Bay Area.

NASA has hired U.S. firms Boeing and SpaceX to ferry more astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), with the first crewed test flight set for as early as May 2018. In 2014, both private firms entered in to a contract with NASA to carry out a space taxi service but were only offered two missions each. Now Boeing and SpaceX will get six missions each, but only if their technology can pass NASA certification. At present, NASA astronauts go to and from the space station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft and have done since 2011when NASA last flew its space shuttle mission. "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director, NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division in a press release Tuesday. "The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program," he said. NASA said Boeing's un-crewed flight test, known as an Orbital Flight Test, is currently scheduled for June 2018 and its crewed flight test set for August 2018. SpaceX progress is reportedly quicker with an unmanned flight test scheduled for November 2017, followed by a crew flight test penciled in for May 2018. Both companies are looking to launch their services from Florida's "Space Coast": Boeing from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and SpaceX at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.

The contracts, announced under the space agency’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) program, bring the total number of missions awarded to SpaceX and Boeing to six each. “Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers,” Phil McAlister, director of NASA’s commercial spaceflight development division, said in a statement. “The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program.” SpaceX's first uncrewed flight test is scheduled for November 2017, and would be followed by its Crew Dragon capsule tests in May next year. Boeing, meanwhile, has scheduled the first crewed CST-100 Starliner test for August 2018.  Crewed missions to the ISS would begin once the companies receive flight certification from NASA. “The Commercial Crew Program will help NASA get full operational use from the national laboratory for scientific research by increasing the number of astronauts on the space station, and allowing the crew members to dedicate more time to research,” the space agency said in the statement. “The commercial crew vehicles will transport up to four astronauts for NASA missions, along with about 220 pounds of critical cargo to the space station.” Related Stories SpaceX Gets Another NASA Order For Crewed ISS Mission NASA Faces More Budget Cuts NASA on Wednesday awarded four more contracts each to SpaceX and Boeing for crewed flights to the International Space Station. Pictured: Artist's concept of the Crew Dragon capsule (left), and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner (right). Photo: NASA Since the U.S. ended its space shuttle program in 2011, Russia’s Soyuz rockets have the only means of ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS. Under its current arrangement, NASA has to shell out nearly $80 million for every seat on the Soyuz rocket.  However, last year, Russia’s Roscosmos announced that it does not have any plans to send U.S. astronauts to the ISS after 2018. This means that unless SpaceX or Boeing are ready with their flagship capsules by then, U.S. presence on the space station would be directly impacted — at least temporarily. “Returning human launch capabilities to U.S. soil underscores NASA’s commitment to the station and the research that the orbiting laboratory makes possible including the advancement of scientific knowledge off the Earth, for the benefit of those on the Earth and to prepare for future deep space exploration,” the space agency said.  Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Trump is singling out corporate giants who he seems to think are behaving unpatriotically. He went after Boeing for overpricing the next generation Air Force One, they committed to lower the cost of the program. Then he went after Lockheed Martin maker of the Pentagon's F-35 fighter jet and pitted Boeing against them, asking Boeing to price out a cheaper version. On Tuesday, the CEO of Ford, a company frequently criticized by the President-elect for shifting production out of the country, announced they're scrapping plans for a new plant in Mexico and will instead build those cars in Michigan. Ford CEO Mark Fields says the move should be considered a vote of confidence in Trump's and the new Congress's pro-growth policies. But also Tuesday he went after GM for building cars in Mexico. I can't recall ever seeing this kind of pressure put on companies by a President, much less a President-elect, but people have said for years now this country should be run more like a business. I'm very curious to see how Trump translates this approach when it comes to our foreign relations. I'm Kelly Ogle and that's My 2 Cents.    Live Radar OK Customize Your Forecast: Lookup Featured On News9.com Business News Find news on Oklahoma's economy, local business, the banking industry and more.

Trump, who won the presidency in part with tough talk on trade, has shown his willingness to single out individual companies by name if they displease him, and Ford seems to be the latest to fall in line. Also yesterday, Trump nominated Reagan-era protectionist lawyer Robert Lighthizer to serve as US trade representative, signaling he intends to make good on pledges to renegotiate trade deals he blames for killing millions of American jobs. The moves likely will loom large over next week’s Detroit auto show, when the US industry’s top executives gather to show off their new models. The president-elect, who has previously taken to Twitter to slam Boeing and Lockheed Martin, made GM his latest target in a breakfast-hour tweet threatening to impose tariff on imports of a small number of Mexican-made Chevy Cruze models into the US. About-face at Ford A couple of hours later, Ford announced it was scuttling plans for a new US$1.6 billion (RM7.2 billion) factory in San Luis Potosi, and instead invest US$700 million over the next four years to expand its Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Michigan to build electric and self-driving vehicles. The Ford decision was an about-face after the second-biggest US automaker repeatedly rebuffed Trump’s criticism over its plans for the Mexico plant during and after the presidential campaign. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the decision reflected the hope that Trump’s policies will boost the US manufacturing environment. “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that he has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the US and our plant here in Michigan,” Fields told CNN. He said company chairman Bill Ford spoke yesterday morning to Trump, and that he himself had spoken to Vice-President-elect Pence about the move, which Ford said would result in 700 new US jobs over four years. The new plant, announced in April, was expected to employ 2,800 by 2020. Mexico’s government said it “regrets” Ford’s decision, and that the company gave assurances it would repay “any expenditures made by the state government to facilitate this investment.” Another win for Trump? Trump took to Twitter again to crow about the Ford reversal: “Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world’s great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.” Ford’s decision creates a “political headline win for Trump, Ford and the UAW,” yet the diminished demand for small cars also makes it a positive decision in terms of business rationale, investment bank RBC Capital Markets said in a note. Meanwhile, GM responded to Trump’s Twitter attack with a statement emphasising that the vast majority of its Cruze cars sold in the US are made in Ohio, with just a small percentage imported from a plant across the southern border. “All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the US are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio,” the auto giant said. Of 190,000 Cruze cars sold in the US, only 4,500 were hatchbacks made in Mexico, said a GM spokesman. Fully assembled Chevrolet Cruze cars at the General Motors assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio July 22, 2011. — Reuters pic Trade war coming? Tough talk on trade helped Trump win election, and on the campaign trail he threatened to impose a 35 per cent import duty on cars produced in Mexico. He has also pledged to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, blaming NAFTA and other trade agreements for the loss of millions of American manufacturing jobs. The appointment of Lighthizer as his top trade negotiator suggests Trump plans to follow through on that rhetoric.  Lighthizer served as deputy US trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s, when the focus was on attacking Japan for its huge exports into the US market. But leading business lobbies such as the Business Roundtable have cautioned that US trading partners could retaliate against any new tariffs, threatening key US markets. “Any significant tariff increase within the North American region would impact the auto industry greatly and that just really makes the industry... much less competitive,” said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of Mexico Institute at the Wilson Centre, a Washington think tank. Automakers are also worried that Trump’s tough rhetoric towards China could trigger a full-scale trade war if the Republican makes good on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Beijing. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Sterling hammered on Brexit reports, Asia markets sink Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

ROS LBoard 1 Racial politics not welcome in Johor, ruler warns Mahathir FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Boeing may lead search for MH370, says safety expert FMT Reporters | January 4, 2017 Report says it is likely private sector will take over search for missing airplane after Malaysia and other nations stop search operations by end January. KUALA LUMPUR: The search for MH370 will likely continue, says a safety consultant. John Goglia, a safety consultant and former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, believes it will be carried out by the private sector, probably Boeing. Goglia was quoted in the magazine Popular Mechanics as saying that even though the official government funding for the search had run out, it did not mean the quest for answers was over. He said the search would continue, with Boeing most likely taking the lead. This is because MH370 was a Boeing 777. However the US manufacturer has yet to make any official statement on this. MH370 disappeared while on a routine flight from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur in March 2014 with 239 people on board. It is now the biggest aviation mystery. Although there is some evidence that a revised search zone may shed some light, the joint search operation by Malaysia, Australia, and China, led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, is due to end in January. A recent review by experts concluded that investigators may have been searching in the wrong place for MH370 all along. Malaysia, China and Australia have said they would stop the search operation by the end of January unless there was new and credible evidence that surfaced. The report said this decision had not only enraged families of the 239 people aboard MH370 but also aviation professionals, who argued that leaving a high-profile disaster unsolved was itself a threat to aviation safety. It quoted the president of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, David Booth, as saying it was important to recover the wreckage of every single plane crash to determine the cause. He said the global aviation industry should rally to “fund a search of all feasible areas.” Meanwhile, Goglia was quoted by Popular Mechanics as saying the privately-funded search would be “smaller and more focused, but that’s probably better”. He noted the similarity to the 1987 crash of a South African Airways 747, also in the southern Indian Ocean. The plane was eventually recovered after years of searching from depths of 4,900 metres. The report hinted that politics was also at play in air crash searches and investigations involving non-Western nations. Goglia was quoted as saying: “Most Western countries have laws designed to keep politics out of air crash investigations. But that is not the case in much of the rest of the world.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

As of Nov. 30, 2016, the Dallas, Texas-based carrier had taken delivery of 131 of 155 Boeing 737-800s on order; 32 were delivered through Nov. 30, approximately three per month. At this rate, the remaining 737-800s should be delivered by July, in time for the planned entry-into-service of Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft, for which Southwest is the launch customer. Southwest has 200 737 MAXs on order. Southwest’s new five-gate international Concourse A at Fort Lauderdale’s Terminal 1 is scheduled to open June 4. On that date, Southwest will launch 1X-daily service to Grand Cayman. On June 6, the airline will begin new routes to Montego Bay (Jamaica), Belize and Cancun (Mexico). The new routes are pending government approvals and will bring to eight the total number of international routes Southwest will operate from Fort Lauderdale (along with Nassau, Bahamas, and Cuban cities Havana, Varadero and Santa Clara). Additionally out of Fort Lauderdale, Southwest plans to launch new 1X-daily service to Washington Dulles, 1X-daily service to Philadelphia, and 1X-daily service to Orlando beginning June 4. The airline will also launch a new 2X-daily Tampa-New York LaGuardia service, as well as a weekend Pensacola-Denver route. The airline also announced new Ohio routes beginning June 4, concentrating on operations out of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and Cleveland International Airport. Southwest plans to end operations out of airports in both Akron-Canton and Dayton on June 3.

Image: Don Davis From Battlestar Galactica to the imperial Death Star, the world of fiction is rife with gargantuan spacecraft capable of supporting thousands of residents with their own personal quarters and facilities. But for real astronauts, spaceflight is not quite so, well, spacious. Take the International Space Station (ISS), which is the largest spacefaring vessel ever built, as well as the most expensive single construction project in human history, costing the US alone around $100 billion. Its first module was launched in November 1998, and its first long-duration crew, consisting of three people, arrived onboard two years later. With an internal pressurized volume of 32,898 cubic feet, roughly equal to the interior of a Boeing 747, the ISS is a far cry from the cavernous starships we’re used to seeing in science fiction and fantasy. That said, the station and its predecessors are enormously helpful testbeds in the quest to develop even more massive spaceships down the line. Like the Mir space station, which flew from 1986 to 2001, the modules of the ISS were launched separately and assembled in space, like some high-stakes orbital LEGO kit. Animation depicting assembly sequence of ISS. Video: NASA Johnson/YouTube The cost of blasting separate components out of Earth’s powerful gravitational grasp is exorbitant, but the microgravity environment into which they are deployed offers considerable advantages for large engineering projects. What better place to construct colossal architectures than outer space, where immensely heavy structures are rendered functionally weightless and easily maneuverable by smaller spacecraft, or human astronauts? Indeed, anyone who has toyed around with the Kerbal Space Program is probably already familiar with the benefits of in situ orbital manufacturing. Of course, there’s a big difference between throwing together spacecraft in a computer game, and assembling them in real life. Fortunately, the global space community has been steadily working towards achieving the centuries-old dream of big off-Earth structures that can support both robotic and human spaceflight missions. Just last month, for instance, NASA announced its finalists for the Breakthrough, Innovative and Game-changing (BIG) Idea Challenge, which annually solicits concepts for emerging spaceflight platforms. In 2017, the BIG Challenge is focusing on designing modular spacecraft, powered by solar electric propulsion, that could ferry cargo from low Earth orbit to lunar distant retrograde orbit (LDRO). Concept art of potential BIG idea design. Image: Analytical Mechanics Associates According to Keith Belvin, the principal technologist for structures, materials and nanotechnology at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate—and a judge for the BIG Challenge—LDRO is a particularly useful place to park and assemble large spacecraft because it has a much weaker gravity well relative to low Earth orbit. “LDRO is about a 6,000 kilometer orbit [around the Moon],” Belvin told me over the phone. “It’s really nice for a lot of reasons. It’s pretty easy to access. It’s pretty easy to leave from. So, that could form a good staging location. If we developed a satellite assembly construction in situ manufacturing servicing capability in this orbit, then we could launch vehicles in pieces, and assemble them in that orbit.” LDRO could even function as a service and refueling checkpoint for spacecraft returning from distant locations around the solar system. “Let’s suppose that we go to Phobos [one of Mars’ two moons] or do a Mars-type mission,” Belvin said. “When the vehicle comes back, instead of coming back to Earth and burning up, we would bring it back to LDRO, refurbish it, and use it again for another mission.” The ability to reuse spacecraft in this way would drastically reduce the cost of robotic deep space exploration, while also spurring the kind of infrastructures crucial for human exploration to more distant worlds like Mars. It will take an enormous amount of money, time, and effort to build these orbital truck-stops, but the back-end payoff of paving a super-roadway in space would be well worth it, according to author and spaceflight advocate Howard Bloom. “Why move NASA into space highway construction?” Bloom asked in a recent Scientific American article. “Because no one else will do it. And our future in space depends on it. Our future share in a space economy that United Launch Alliance (a joint venture rocket company from Boeing and Lockheed Martin) estimates will be worth $2.7 trillion in 30 years.” This notion of building cumulatively larger, more robust, and more efficient modular structures in space could lay the groundwork for the kinds of futuristic space communities we’ve grown accustomed to seeing in fiction—like O’Neill cylinders or city-sized starships—even if that process takes decades, or even centuries. O’Neill cylinder concept design. Image: Rick Guidice/NASA Ames Research Center In the meantime, there are plenty of other massive spacecraft concepts aimed towards solving problems on our own planet. One of the most prominent is the longstanding dream of building solar power plants in space, where sunlight is abundant and unfiltered by atmospheric interference. Over time, researchers have produced numerous captivating concept designs for space-based solar arrays measuring a kilometer across, or more. These systems could deliver green energy to locations all around the world, while also powering orbital systems or deep space missions. There are many hurdles left to clear before this lofty goal can be accomplished, but scientists, including Belvin, think space-based solar power is a technically sound possibility over the near term. “I think the technology is almost there,” Belvin told me. “There’s a lot of engineering that has to take place to make it efficient and cost-effective. But I think of the Apollo Program, starting in the early 1960s, and that had to be a dream, to go to the Moon. If there’s the money, and the will, you can do a lot in a decade. So, if anybody says: ‘Hey, we’ve got to have an orbiting power system,’ for whatever reason, I think we could do it within a decade.” READ MORE: Everything We Know About Beaming Solar Power to Earth from Space It’s exciting to know that the space sector is beginning to close in on these ambitious projects, constrained mainly by funding and resources rather than the technology itself. And while it’s tricky to predict what kind of vessel will overtake the ISS as the largest spacefaring structure in history, the fact that there are so many potential candidates in the works right now is a cause for celebration.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ordered the CBI on Thursday to complete probe into the alleged Rs 70,000 crore scam in purchase and leasing of aircraft by Air India during UPA-I government in 2005-06. Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi informed a bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud that CBI had registered an FIR in 2013 and has already examined 55 witnesses. "CBI has requested UK for certain information and has so far examined 55 witnesses. Investigations are likely to be completed by June," Rohatgi said. An Empowered Group of Ministers under chairmanship of then finance minister P Chidambaram and comprising then law minister H R Bharadwaj and civil aviation minister Praful Patel was constituted on December 20, 2005. It held discussions with Boeing and GE on December 24, 2005. A note signed by Chidambaram submitted for information and approval of the then Prime Minister for placing orders for 68 aircraft with Boeing with a caveat that Boeing would complete delivery of the planes by 2011 instead of 2012. The PMO on December 30, 2005 informed that the PM has seen note and directed that the ministry of civil aviation "may inform the CCEA about the finalised transaction". The bench headed by the CJI asked CBI to look into all allegations levelled by petitioner, Centre for Public Interest Litigation through advocate Prashant Bhushan, including alleged irregularity in purchase of biometric system for Air India at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. Bhushan said a Canadian superior court had already found that bribes were paid in bagging the contract for biometric systems by Air India. The petitioner had also questioned allocation of lucrative routes to private airliners at the cost of Air India. When the AG said that looking into all the charges levelled by the NGO would drag the investigation, the bench firmly told him: "We are not going to allow you too much of time given the fact that the FIR was registered in 2013." After the allegations about irregularities in the purchase and hiring of 111 aircraft by Air India surfaced, the Comptroller and Auditor General had given a stinging report questioning the procedure and modus operandi adopted by the civil aviation ministry. On tabling of the CAG report in Parliament, it was referred to the Public Accounts Committee. The PAC had sought certain clarifications and the ministry had given its response on May 3, 2016.

Photographer: David Ryder/Bloomberg The unprecedented jetliner shopping spree that’s spanned more than a decade is drawing to a close.  That’s bad news for  Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE, which face slowing jet sales and the highest level of airplane-delivery deferrals in at least 15 years. Final 2016 tallies to be unveiled over the next few days will probably show aircraft orders trailing shipments, a sign of a weakening market. Airline profits are poised to fall from last year’s peak, with even Persian Gulf juggernauts Emirates and Etihad Airways PJSC tempering growth. Unlike past retrenchments triggered by terrorism or recession, demand has also been hurt by the relatively low cost of fuel. While oil has risen in the past year, prices are hovering at about $50 a barrel, half of what they were in mid-2014. That gives airlines less incentive to retire older jetliners or order newer, more efficient models. The glut of jets is sapping interest in wide-body planes and threatening production increases that Boeing and Airbus have plotted over the next two years for the lucrative 737 and A320 families of single-aisle aircraft. With last week’s revelation that Emirates is postponing a dozen Airbus A380 superjumbos, the total number of delivery delays for the year reached 251, the most since at least 2001, according to Flight Fleets Analyzer data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s not that the sky is falling, but we are definitely late in the cycle,” said Ron Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Corp. Brakes On So far, planemakers have been able to find other takers for production slots that have been vacated as carriers such as United Continental Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. postpone deliveries and scan the secondary market for bargains. “The real question becomes how long are they able to do that for,” Epstein said during a presentation last month. Nobody knows how steep the downturn will be or how long it will last, and the trade war with China threatened by President-elect Donald Trump only adds to the uncertainty. In contrast to previous slowdowns, global air travel is still growing and airlines are mostly making money, providing assurance they’ll follow through on the bulk of their orders. Airbus and Boeing are sitting on a near-record $1.2 trillion order backlog, and to some extent are victims of their own success. Airlines aren’t racing to close deals for jetliner models that are sold out for the rest of the decade, such as Airbus’s A350 and Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. As the second-largest U.S. defense contractor, Chicago-based Boeing has an added cushion: Weapons sales seem likely to increase because Trump has vowed to boost military budgets, even as he’s railed against costs. There are signs, however, that the aerospace cycle has peaked. Global airline profit this year is forecast to fall 16 percent to $29.8 billion from 2016’s apex, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group. Another indicator of the aircraft manufacturing’s health, a measure of sales to shipments known as the book-to-bill ratio, is expected fall to the weakest level since the 2009 recession, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Boeing had netted 470 orders through Dec. 20, well short of its targeted deliveries of 740 to 745 planes for the year. Airbus reported 410 net orders through November. The European planemaker had been aiming to deliver 670 jetliners in 2016, 20 more than it forecast at the start of the year. The annual totals don’t include sales to Iran or deals closed late in December, including an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max placed by General Electric Co.’s aircraft leasing division. Spokesmen for Boeing and Airbus declined to comment. Airbus shares gained only 1.4 percent last year after surging 50 percent in 2015. Boeing climbed 7.7 percent, trailing the S&P 500 Index. The outlook for Boeing investors this year is worse, with a potential return of 0.4 percent based on the average 12-month target price of 26 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By the same yardstick, Airbus is poised for a 3.6 percent increase. Twin-Aisle Glut The market is also absorbing a glut of twin-aisle jets after output increased at a 16 percent annual pace from 2011 through 2015, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. Last month, Boeing announced a second cut in the production rate of its 777 jetliner amid a sales drought, while Airbus’s A330neo orders have stalled, he said. About 18,070 passenger planes were in service as of November, a 41 percent jump from 2007, according to a Dec. 19 report by Deutsche Bank AG. Only 6.6 percent of the global fleet was stored, down from 8.3 percent in November 2007. “It’s different manifestations of the same problem,” Aboulafia said. “With twin-aisles, it’s demand. With single-aisles, it’s fuel.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Business Your guide to the most important business stories of the day, every day.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter There are other indications that the market is saturated: Lease rates peaked in 2015, while aircraft values have retreated since January 2016, said George Dimitroff, head of valuations for Flight Ascend Consultancy. Even prices for in-demand narrow-bodies like Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 could be at risk over the next three years if the planemakers follow through on plans to increase output 36 percent. “Our analysis shows capacity growth will be too high with production rates increasing and retirements remaining low, so something has to give,” Dimitroff said. “Unless we see global air-travel growth above 7 percent over the next few years, it’s difficult to see how all that additional capacity on the market will be filled.” Rising interest rates and the strong U.S. dollar -- the currency used for aircraft deals -- also threaten aircraft orders, Ken Herbert, an aerospace analyst with Canaccord Genuity, said in a report Thursday. The “backlog today is more concentrated in emerging markets, notably Asia, than at any prior time or cycle,” Herbert said. “The increased exposure to Asia and the capacity growth assumptions upon which fleet plans are currently based do represent a significant risk we are watching heading into 2017.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Boeing won a contract to supply 75 single-aisle 737 Max 8 planes to General Electric’s airplane leasing arm worth $8.25 billion at current listed prices, the companies announced on January 4, 2017. The order, booked in December, increases GE Capital Aviation Services’ backlog of the popular Boeing model to 170 planes. Published: 15:00 January 5, 2017 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Seattle: Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion (Dh32.3 billion) at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world’s biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing’s order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company’s overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 per cent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. Quiet period The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On December 27, Delta Air Lines said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing’s shares were up about 1 per cent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday’s close, the stock had risen 11.7 per cent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 per cent rise in the S&P 500 index.   Factbox: Airbus executive sees low risk of order cancellations Order cancellations are not a major risk factor for the aerospace industry this year, a senior Airbus executive said on Thursday, dampening concerns about a downturn in the aerospace industry’s cycle amid fragile global economies. “The risk of order cancellations is not very high on our list of risks for this year,” Marwan Lahoud, executive vice-president of international, strategy and public affairs, told a briefing as head of France’s Gifas aerospace industry lobby. On the challenges of increasing aerospace production to keep up with past strong orders, the head of French aerospace supplier Daher, Patrick Daher, said most companies had absorbed the investments needed to meet their production targets. “The obstacles should diminish in 2017 compared to 2016,” he told the same briefing, referring to the risk of delays and quality problems that disrupted some deliveries last year. Lahoud declined to comment on Airbus deliveries.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media Companies must shore up their social media defences in light of Donald Trump’s targeting of brands 05 Jan 17 < Back to Blogs Tim Lince Protecting brand reputation and managing the possible legal fallout from crisis situations are some of the main responsibilities of an in-house trademark department. One recent element that has created headaches for numerous brands in that regard is the tweeting habit of US president-elect Donald Trump, and specifically his regular calling out of companies and brands. As he prepares to take office on January 20, we take a look at how brands can react should they be the unwitting target of a Trump Twitter tirade. Since announcing his candidacy for the US presidency on the Republican ticket in June 2015, Donald Trump has become notorious for his uncensored and passionate Twitter outbursts, cementing his reputation as the anti-establishment candidate who does not communicate in the traditionally safe, controlled way of career politicians. However, his tweets calling out specific companies have become regular and had a tangible impact for those targeted. In the last 12 months (both before and after his election win), Trump’s social media crosshairs have been aimed at high profile brands including Amazon, General Motors, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Macy’s, T-Mobile, Toyota and Rexnord (not to mention the countless media outlets he has criticised). Within hours of many of these tweets being sent, the impact could be measured in dollars. In December, following Trump criticism on Twitter, Lockheed Martin lost $3.5bn in market value. A similar tweet about Boeing caused a $1 billion stock market hit (although it recovered on the same day). Earlier this week, Trump rallied against General Motors and Toyota (threatening a "big border tax" should they build cars outside of the US), which saw significant share price drops for both companies. Of course, a drop in share price is often recoverable – but a PR hit can be longer lasting. For example, the over 300,000-strong community of Trump supporters on Reddit have an ‘official’ list of companies to boycott, with many on the list added following a Trump social media call out. Named brands can often be inundated with thousands of angry messages following a Trump tweet – both on official social media accounts and also to employees (mainly CEOs) who have public Twitter profiles. Such lists are not uncommon (there is a similar boycott list on the other end of the political spectrum) but a more unique development is the creation of an internet browser extension – called Cuckblock – which notifies Trump supporters that a web-page they are on belongs to a perceived anti-Trump company. Broadly, it is expected that, as president, Trump will target his Twitter tirades to brands in certain sectors – such as those in areas of trade, immigration, healthcare, and defense. For the trademark department at brands in those sectors then (and, perhaps, beyond), preparation is key and - as we discussed in the latest issue of World Trademark Review magazine (now available online to subscribers)  - there are a number of preparatory measures that brands can consider in case they are unwittingly dragged into the political arena in the future. Rob Frankel, strategist, author and dubbed “the best branding expert on the planet”, suggests that preparations should focus on the overall brand strategies, which “defines what the brand is and – just as importantly – what the brand is not”. This, he argues, “goes a long way to protect the brand from being misperceived by anyone attempting to co-opt it”, and should dictate the tone of any response to a Trump tweet – or whether to respond at all. As Eric Fingerhut, trademark practice group leader at Dykema, explains: “Each specific brand must know whether any [response] is going to be a ‘one and done’ or be more extensive, such as joining the conversation. Ultimately, trademark counsel must ensure the brand is in the best position to speak out and prevent commercial misuse of the brand.” The response should therefore be jointly managed and maintained “by the communications team and the trademark department”, argue Andy Holdsworth, associate partner, crisis and litigation, and Stuart Leach, managing director, geopolitical, crisis and litigation, at London-based Bell Pottinger. Special consideration should be given to a response not being seen as too pro or anti-Trump (or of any one political position). As Simon Miller, Telefonica O2’s deputy head of public affairs, told Marketing Week: “I think it is important that brands are not put in a position where they are seen to be of a certain political hue or colour. We have 450 stores and employ 11,000 people in the UK across the full patchwork quilt of political colours and we need to have a dialogue with those audiences.” To put it in an American context, restaurant consultant Aaron Allen warns that “when you get into politics – whether you’re Republican or Democrat – you’ll end up alienating half of your customers”. However, despite this, brands also need to be prepared to take a risk – a route that those in the legal department will no doubt quiver at. As Stan Steinreich, president and CEO of Steinreich Communications, wrote last month, “corporate response needs to change” in this new age of a tweeting president, suggesting that “instead of employing balanced language” (or language carefully vetted by the legal team), companies “need to be more provocative”. He added: “No doubt this will go against the grain for corporate executives who fear it will add fuel to the fire. When the tweet says, ‘cancel the contract with Boeing’, an appropriate response would be, ‘Mr. President, we honour our agreements, but happy to work with you on a resolution’. When threatening a company who needs to move jobs out of the US, would that company be better to respond, ‘Talk, don’t balk. Mr President, happy to discuss ways we can stay’.” We may be entering a new era of US presidential communications. Ground was broken in the past with Calvin Coolidge delivering messages on the radio, John F Kennedy’s polished use of television, Ronald Reagan's mastery of analogue mass communication and Barack Obama’s embracement of digital campaigning. Now, Donald Trump is all set to be the first truly “social media president”. While many will welcome such unfiltered messages from the person in the top office, others fear the consequences – both intended and unintended – of such outbursts. For private companies that could face the ire of the new president (and are not used to being ‘called out’ by the commander-in-chief), it is time to evaluate response strategies – and the trademark department is in the perfect position to kickstart that effort.

(U.S. Navy photo/Darin Russell) Posted By: Oriana Pawlyk January 5, 2017 Older fighter jets such as the F-16 and F/A-18 will never match the F-35, an Air Force general said. Brig. Gen. Scott Pleus, a former F-16 Fighting Falcon pilot who directs the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program’s integration office, said even upgraded versions of the fourth-generation fighters simply can’t compete against the newer aircraft’s stealth superiority. “You cannot take an airplane like an F-16 and really make it stealthy,” Pleus said in an interview with Military.com on Wednesday at the Pentagon. “The airplane is the shape of the airplane, the size is the size of the airplane,” he said. “The radar cross-section of an F-18 is the radar cross-section of an F-18 — you can’t change that,” he added. “Low observable technology, the ability to evade radar if you will, is something that has to be designed into the airplane from the very beginning.” Pleus’ comments came just weeks after President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter to criticize the F-35 program — the Pentagon’s biggest acquisition program estimated at nearly $400 billion for almost 2,500 aircraft. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” he tweeted. As previously noted on this blog, the Boeing-made F/A-18E/F Super Hornet doesn’t offer the same level of stealth or sensor technology as the F-35 Lightning II, though the Chicago-based aerospace giant has argued that the capabilities of the twin-engine electronic attack variant EA-18G Growler eclipse the Joint Strike Fighter’s stealth advantage. And, of course, the Super Hornet is significantly cheaper. For military pilots, the statements by Pleus, the brigadier general, won’t come as a revelation. But Trump’s comments have spurred a debate on whether defense contractors can upgrade fourth-gen fighters to somehow operate like a fifth-gen fighter. RELATED: Mattis Backs F-35 Stealth Fighter Criticized by Trump Pleus, who has 153 flight hours in the F-35 and more than 2,000 in the F-16 — explained the closest they could get to making a fourth-gen fighter into a “4.5-gen” fighter is by adding some newer technologies, limited by the original mechanics of the aircraft, cooling and generator systems, among other issues. “What you can do is take a fourth-generation aircraft and put a very good radar in it — so it’s a piece of technology that the F-35 has, and so you’ve upgraded it.” Enhancing it, “more in the sensor itself,” can get a fighter like the F-16 — flying since the early 1980s — or F/A-18 a step closer to fifth-gen, “but you cannot add on stealth technology to an airplane.” Pleus detailed the advantages the F-35 brings to the table: rapid computer technology, radar-evading stealth and what he called survivability. “The idea is, the F-35 was developed to go into a highly contested area, both air-to-air threats and surface-to-air threats, drop its bombs, hit the targets it’s supposed to, and then come home — and that is the entire fifth-generation package,” he said. Flying a fourth-gen or fifth-gen, from a pilot’s perspective, is “not a big change,” he said. The cockpit of the F-35, however, has bumped up situational awareness capabilities of how pilots can see or detect friend or foe in the airspace or down below. In an F-16 for example, “If my radar doesn’t see it, then I don’t see it,” Pleus said. “In the F-35, if my radar sees it, or if my electronic warning system sees it … or my wingman’s radar sees it, or their wingman’s radar sees it, I see all of it.” Previous post Next post About the Author Oriana Pawlyk Oriana Pawlyk is a reporter at Military.com.

Posted 05 Jan 2017 01:25 Updated 05 Jan 2017 05:50 The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the "What's Next?" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at US$8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at US$8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at US$550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at US$158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .

Booked in December, the order is worth $8.25 billion at list prices, though big commercial airplane buyers like GECAS typically enjoy discounts of as much as 50 percent from Boeing (NYSE: BA).

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

Posted 05 Jan 2017 01:25 Updated 05 Jan 2017 05:50 The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the "What's Next?" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at US$8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at US$8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at US$550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at US$158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .

The sale should boost Boeing’s 2016 net order tally above 600 airplanes. (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) The sale of 75 jets to GE Capital Aviation Services should boost Boeing’s 2016 net order tally above 600 airplanes. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Boeing booked a big 737 MAX order worth an estimated $3.8 billion from the aircraft leasing arm of GE during the holiday break. GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) ordered 75 MAX 8 aircraft. GECAS’s support for the MAX is unsurprising because GE is the exclusive engine supplier for the airplane with its new LEAP engine. The sale should boost Boeing’s 2016 net order tally above 600 airplanes. Boeing has projected about 740 deliveries for the year. With the typical year-end rush of sales, the final order tally may be close to that delivery figure. Also over the break, Czech airline Travel Service said it signed a deal to buy five more 737 MAXs, adding to a previous order for 25 of the jets.

 Boeing just got an $8.3 billion order for its fastest selling jet of all time Benjamin Zhang Jan. 4, 2017, 1:29 PM 12,502 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing 737 MAX in GECAS livery.Boeing On Wednesday, Boeing announced that GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) has placed an order for 75 737-MAX 8 airliners. With a list price of $110 million per aircraft, the deal could be worth as much as $8.25 billion. Large orders of this type commonly include significant bulk discounts. As a result, it is likely the GECAS order is worth less than list value. The deal, which was completed in December, pushed the total number of 737MAX airliners on order from GECAS up to 170 planes. GECAS is the Irish-American commercial aircraft financing and leasing arm of General Electric. The company currently owns and services a fleet of 1,950 aircraft and holds loans on another 400 or so planes. "We appreciate the confidence GECAS has in the 737 MAX, and look forward to seeing the airplanes placed with carriers all over the world," Brad McMullen, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president for North America and Leasing Sales, said in a statement. To date, the airplane maker has booked 3,419 orders for the 737MAX. According to Boeing, this make it the fastest selling plane in company history. "Our customers want the latest technology and fuel efficiency, and the CFM International LEAP-1B engines on these aircraft deliver outstanding productivity and reliability in the single-aisle market," GECAS president and CEO Alec Burger said in a statement. The LEAP 1-B engines that will power the 737MAX are made by CFM International — a 50/50 joint venture between GE and SAFRAN Aircraft Engines of France.

AUTO SALES US auto sales near record highs in 2016 DETROIT (AP) — Demand may be slowing, but U.S. consumers still bought a whole lot of cars and trucks in 2016. U.S. sales of new vehicles could hit a new high in 2016. Consulting firm LMC Automotive and car-buying site Edmunds.com both predict sales will squeak past the record set in 2015 and reach 17.5 million in 2016. Nissan says its U.S. sales rose 5 percent in 2016 to more than 1.5 million, a company record. Ford’s sales were up less than 1 percent to more than 2.6 million. Fiat Chrysler’s sales were flat at 2.2 million. General Motors said its year-over-year sales were down 1.3 percent to just over 3 million cars and trucks. That was partly because the company cut back on low-profit sales to rental-car firms. Toyota’s full-year sales fell 2 percent to 2.4 million. Volkswagen brands sales dropped 8 percent to 322,948, hurt by the company’s diesel mileage cheating scandal. Ford’s F-Series pickup remained the best-selling vehicle in America in 2016, with 820,799 trucks sold. That’s the equivalent of 93 trucks sold every hour.

Trump says in a statement that Clayton is “a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law.” Trump says his nominee will work to ensure that financial institutions “can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.” The Senate must OK the nomination of Clayton, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. Clayton is the latest Trump pick with deep ties to Wall Street — having represented Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc. Trump says he wants to undo many regulations that he says have “stifled investment” in Americans businesses. Clayton says he’ll “carefully monitor” the financial sector and set policies that encourages companies to create jobs. EXXON-TILLERSON-SEVERANCE Tillerson and Exxon part ways; $180M retirement package NEW YORK (AP) — Rex Tillerson, the nominee of President-elect Donald Trump for secretary of state, is severing ties with Exxon Mobil through a $180 million retirement package ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing. Tillerson was expected to step down as CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. in March when he turned 65, the company’s mandatory retirement age. Exxon said in a regulatory filing Wednesday that Tillerson has agreed to give up approximately 2 million unvested shares. In exchange, the company has agreed to make a cash payment equal to the value of those shares into a trust. Tillerson, who worked for Exxon for more than 40 years, is giving up about $7 million in compensation and benefits that he would have received if he had he stayed until March. CONGRESS-HEALTH OVERHAUL Obama, Pence to Capitol as health care overhaul fight begins WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President-elect Mike Pence says Donald Trump’s “first order of business” as president will be to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law and replace it. But Pence says Republicans must avoid hurting consumers as they do that. In a visit to Capitol Hill, Pence said Trump’s team is already working with GOP congressional leaders on plans to undo Obama’s law with both legislation and executive action the president and federal agencies would be able to take. Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said Pence told them the goal was to get legislation dismantling the health care law to Trump for his signature by Feb. 20. Obama also made a visit to the Capitol to meet with congressional Democrats on how to combat the Republican drive to dismantle the health care overhaul. He urged Democratic lawmakers to “Keep up the fight” and advised them to remind voters of how the law has helped them. CONGRESS-REGULATIONS House GOP to start regulation repeals Jan. 30 WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans say they will begin introducing legislation on Jan. 30 to repeal a series of Obama administration regulations, with the early focus on environmental rules. Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy says GOP leaders haven’t yet picked which agency regulation Congress will seek to overturn first. He said he expects swift action on invalidating a rule designed to reduce methane emissions and another designed to reduce the environmental impact of coal mining on the nation’s streams. McCarthy says the two rules “limit our energy production.” Republicans will also seek to repeal regulations implementing an education reform bill that some state officials have complained erodes local decision-making. Before the House goes after specific agency rules, McCarthy says it will tackle the regulatory process itself to give Congress more control. OIL PIPELINE-FINE North Dakota challenges pipeline developer argument vs. fine BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Staffers with the North Dakota Public Service Commission say there’s no doubt the developer of the four-state, $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline violated rules regarding reporting Native American artifacts. Via attorney John Schuh, the PSC staffers urge the commission to move forward with a fine of at least $15,000 for Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. In October, the company diverted construction around Native American artifacts without running the plan by the commission, which oversees pipelines. ETP has said that it shouldn’t be fined because state law says there needs to be a willful violation. Schuh said in his Dec. 15 response that a fine should be imposed regardless of intent. The PSC will decide whether to dismiss the case or schedule a hearing. CZECH-BOEING Czech airline to buy 5 more Boeing 737 MAX jets PRAGUE (AP) — Czech airline Travel Service says it has signed a deal to buy five more new Boeing 737 MAX jets. Spokeswoman Vladimira Dufkova said Wednesday the contract was signed on Dec. 23 and brings to 30 the total number of such Boeing aircraft that Travel Service has recently agreed to buy. The jets will be delivered between 2018 and 2023. Financial details were not disclosed. The airline, which operates regular flights under the name SmartWings as well as charter flights, is the biggest in the Czech Republic. It currently uses 37 jets, of which 32 are various types of Boeing 737s. The CEFC China Energy Company has a minority stake in the airline. EUROPE-ECONOMY Eurozone inflation spikes to highest in over 3 years BRUSSELS (AP) — Official figures show that inflation across the 19-country eurozone spiked in December to its highest rate in more than three years, largely on the back of rising energy costs. Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, says Wednesday that the annual inflation rate rose to 1.1 percent in December from November’s 0.6 percent. December’s rate is the highest since Sept. 2013, when inflation also stood at 1.1 percent. The figures are likely to cheer policymakers at the European Central Bank who have sought to get inflation toward the target of just below 2 percent. Still, there may be some concern that, when excluding energy costs, inflation remains muted. The core rate, which strips out volatile items like energy and food, rose to only 0.9 percent from the previous month’s 0.8 percent. INSURANCE-DISASTER LOSSES Insurer: 2016 saw highest natural disaster losses in 4 years BERLIN (AP) — A leading insurer says that last year saw the highest costs from natural disasters since 2012, with a pair of earthquakes in Japan in April accounting for the heaviest losses. Munich Re said in an annual survey Wednesday that losses from natural disasters totaled $175 billion last year, some $50 billion of which was covered by insurance. The earthquakes on Japan’s southern Kyushu island caused $31 billion worth of damage, with $6 billion of the costs covered by insurance. Floods in China in June and July caused $20 billion in costs, only $300 million of which was insured. Hurricane Matthew, which hit the Caribbean and the eastern United States in August, incurred losses totaling $10.2 billion, of which $3.8 billion was covered by insurance. GADGET SHOW Research firm sees shipments of PCs, tablets, phones and other gadgets flat in 2017 LAS VEGAS (AP) — Research firm Gartner says it expects worldwide shipments of PCs, tablets, phones and other gadgets to remain unchanged in 2017. Gartner says it expects 2.3 billion such devices to ship this year, the same as in 2016. This finding comes as gadget makers unveil all sorts of new products at the CES tech show in Las Vegas this week. Looking ahead, Gartner says the embattled PC market should return to growth in 2018, thanks to a natural cycle of upgrades. That’s mostly driven by an increase in premium “ultramobiles” — including ultra-slim Windows 10 devices and Apple’s MacBook Air. Smartphones are expected to grow just slightly; much of the growth is in emerging Asia and Pacific markets. In a report Wednesday, Gartner research director Ranjit Atwal says consumers have fewer reasons to upgrade or to buy traditional devices. Rather, he says, “they are seeking fresher experiences and applications in emerging categories such as head mounted displays, virtual personal assistant speakers and wearables.” GADGET SHOW-TVS High-end LG TVs include ultra-slim set LAS VEGAS (AP) — New television sets from LG will include an ultra-slim model that’s less than 4 millimeters (0.15 inch) thick. The company is achieving this by moving many of the bulky components — such as graphic cards — into a separate box connected to the screen with just a cord. The speakers are also separated; the TV has two round, retractable speakers on top. The new TV will also have better audio, using Dolby Atmos technology, along with high-end OLED screen technology. OLED — which stands for organic light-emitting diode — can produce better pictures because each pixel produces light individually. Traditional TVs are backlit and use filters to block out light — but not well enough to produce pure black. OLED is rare in TVs and is currently found mostly in smartphones. LG will have non-OLED models, too, and promises new technology to make colors more vibrant. LG also says an LG Technicolor mode will be added to TVs in 2017 to add to color accuracy. Samsung, LG, Sony and others are unveiling new offerings at CES that highlight higher-resolution pictures, thinner displays and brighter colors. The moves come as high-definition and 4K TVs are becoming cheaper and more mainstream, so top TV makers are competing for the higher end of the market. LG says it will release prices in February and start selling them in March. GADGET SHOW-COMCAST Comcast wants to tackle bad home internet LAS VEGAS (AP) — Comcast is hoping to make Wi-Fi in the home faster through an updated router — the machine that serves as data traffic cops for Wi-Fi networks. Although home internet speeds have gotten faster, laptops and phones on Wi-Fi might still feel sluggish because older routers can’t transmit data as fast. Comcast’s updated router costs $10 a month and comes with a modem. It’s the same price as before. Customers can still buy their own equipment and save money over time. Comcast is also offering extenders to help Wi-Fi work all over a house, though the company wouldn’t say what it might charge. Eero, Starry, Google and Luma are among the companies that have fancy new router systems, but they start at more than $100 and run as much as $500. Fewer than 5 million Comcast customers, mostly those on the most expensive internet packages, will get the new high-powered router this year. The company says it could take years to reach the bulk of its more than 24 million customers. Another 10 million customers with the company’s existing routers will get a software update by March to make it easier to set up parental controls and install “smart” thermostats and other internet-connected appliances. These features also come with the new routers.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files By Alwyn Scott | SEATTLE SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal. The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes. Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016. Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered. The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co (GE.N) Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices. GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said. The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said. Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25. Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017. Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index .SPX.

Which UK airports does Norwegian airways operate from, how much are flights to New York and why are they so cheap? The budget airline has announced ridiculously cheap fares to the US, so what's the catch? By Laura Burnip 4th January 2017, 3:18 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments START spreading the news – you will soon be able to fly from the UK to New York for just £56. The cheap flights – the lowest transatlantic fare around – have been announced by budget airline Norwegian. So where do these planes go from, and is it really as good a deal as it sounds? Getty Images 3 The budget airline is offering flights to the Big Apple for an incredible £56 – so what’s the catch? Why is Norwegian Airways offering really cheap tickets from Britain to New York? The airline has invested in fuel efficient Boeing 737Max planes, which allow it to go further with cheaper fuel costs. Chief executive of the Oslo-based airline Bjorn Kjos told the Telegraph: “We have a totally different set up to other airlines. “The Boeing 737MAX has a very modern engine, which means it can go for a longer distance. “Our planes are very, very fuel efficient.” The airline launched its transatlantic flights in 2014, and currently flies twice a day from Gatwick to New York starting from £125 each way. It also offers services to Florida, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The £56 tickets will be the cheapest on the market when they launch in the summer. Norwegian Air releases video to persuade us to fly to New York Getty Images 3 The airline says its new fuel-efficient planes will allow it to slash prices Where do Norwegian's flights to New York go from and what's the catch? Well, first of all, the planes are only going to be flying from Edinburgh - even though the airline has a base at Gatwick. And secondly, they won't be flying into JFK airport in Queens. One of the ways Norwegian has slashed its prices is to fly to out-of-town airports in New York state. “That means we don’t pay as much and can charge cheaper fares," says Mr Kjos. The actual destination hasn't been announced yet but Norwegian currently flies to Newark Liberty International Airport from the UK - about a half hour drive from Manhattan. And like most budget airlines, there are a few extra costs. According to Norwegian's website, seat reservations cost £25 per person each way, meals cost £28 each and checked baggage is £40 each way. So with food, a suitcase and somewhere to sit on the plane, you're looking at £149 each way - which is still pretty cheap. Getty Images 3 The super-cheap flights will only be going from Edinburgh rather than Norwegian's base at Gatwick Will Norwegian start flying to New York from anywhere else in the UK? At the moment, the super-cheap fares are only on offer from Edinburgh. But the airline has hinted that it could expand. Mr Kjos has said its long-haul flights are usually 95% full, and it is planning to increase the frequency of its flights from Gatwick to the US by 55%. "Passengers have shown that is demand there," Mr Kjos told the Telegraph. Norwegian is also reported to be looking to operate from Irish airports Shannon and Cork.

Thousands of commercial aircraft fly passengers and goods to tens of thousands of destinations throughout the world every day. For the commercial aircraft carrying passengers and cargo in very harsh environments, inspection and maintenance for safe operation are crucial (see videos below). Aviation maintenance is also a lucrative sector. In the United Kingdom the aviation maintenance, repair, overhaul and logistics sector today generates revenues in excess of £15 billion (Dh67.56bn) a year, according to the UK department for business innovation and skills (BIS). Complexity For airlines, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) is a costly business. Globally, airlines spent US$62.1bn on MRO, representing around 9 per cent of total operational costs, according to Iata. The MRO industry posted a 2014 net post-tax profit of $19.9bn, compared to $10.6bn in 2013. With a 3.8 per cent increase per annum anticipated, the market size is estimated to reach $90bn in 2024, Iata said. In 2014, the world fleet count was 24,597 aircraft, with 76 per cent of the fleet manufactured by Boeing or Airbus, the agency added. In a February survey, the BIS reported that "in terms of future prospects for the industry, several respondents identified what they felt to be a clear opportunity associated with the evolution of the MROL industry. The complexity and sophistication of activities conducted within the industry was felt to be intensifying – and doing so at an increasing rate. This is being driven by the need for increased aircraft serviceability, combined with MROL productivity and efficiency improvements through composite material technologies, data analytics and integrated logistics support." In this region, the growth of the ‘big three’ airlines is providing opportunites for MRO companies. One such is Olympus. The Japanese manufacturer of high-end optics and precision electronics is establishing its Middle East and Africa headquarters to Dubai. The facility will incorporate a state-of-the-art service and training centre for both support and knowledge transfer. From Dubai, the headquarters will cover 72 countries from across southern Africa to the Levant to Turkey to Arabian Gulf countries and elsewhere in the Middle East. Massive The move comes as the big three – Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways – are poised to expand their fleet by almost 650 new planes. "If you include Turkish Airlines and [others], the order book comes to a massive 1,058 passenger aircraft," says Maurice Faber, the regional managing director of Olympus. "With the market growing, our local presence here will help support our customers with stronger support on a variety of fronts including faster response times for service and product back-up." Periodic inspections of aircraft engines are mandatory by both manufacturers and regulatory authorities. Military aircraft are also subject to strict maintenance programmes. But, as you are sitting in a passenger plane waiting for take-off, have you ever wondered just how engineers manage to inspect a piece of machinery as complicated and crucial as the engines? "An aircraft engine is a very complex machine. But manufacturers have provided certain areas within the engine that have access ports to facilitate visual inspection with endoscopes," says Mr Faber. Failure Recently, aircraft have been required to have on-condition maintenance performed, which relies on the capability to detect failures before they happen, so preventive maintenance can be initiated, according to the South Korean industrial endoscope, or borescope, maker Medit. "Borescopes are becoming instrumental and required to perform these types of inspections," the company says. "If, during an inspection, maintenance personnel can find evidence that the equipment is approaching the end of its life, then it may be possible to delay the failure, prevent it from happening, or replace the equipment at the earliest convenience, rather than allowing the failure with severe consequences to occur. Modern airplane and helicopter engines are already equipped with endoscope bores." Olympus is also a supplier of aviation endoscopes and works closely with industry leaders such as Boeing and Airbus among others. Similar to endoscopy used by doctors to examine patients, these thin, flexible, ultra-high tech tubes are inserted into the access port of an engine. The tube usually has a couple of optical cables, each of which may have up 50,000 optical fibres. The cables carry light and cameras to see inside the engines. "However, because of the complexity of the engine, there still are various difficulties an inspector may face when attempting to conduct an engine inspection precisely and in a timely manner," Mr Faber points out. Laborious Commercial jets are equipped with turbofan engines, which vary in size from small turbines for regional jets to large turbines for larger, inter-continental airliners. Furthermore, there are many different parts to be inspected within each engine, such as turbine blades, compressor blades and the combustion chamber. It is important when conducting a smooth and accurate inspection, to choose the optimal endoscope and related accessories by engine type and engine part, Olympus says. "At Olympus, we use a single Iplex videoscope that can cover various demands for aircraft engine inspections by just changing the optical adaptors," Mr Faber says. In the past, one aspect of engine inspection involved the laborious procedure of rotating the engine shaft by hand for inspection of the hundreds of blades, which are located at several turbine/compressor stages and mounted on the shaft. It was a two-man operation where one engineer manually rotated the shaft while another inspected the condition of the blades. This work not only required an additional operator for the shaft rotation, but was also a less reliable method. Today, specific engine turning tools are used, which automatically rotate the shaft with high-pressure compressor/turbine blades at a preferred speed, enabling one inspector too accurately and thoroughly conduct both the shaft rotation and blade inspection operations without the need for a second person. Images Recording a large number of blade images for inspection analysis and reporting is necessary, but the images are very similar to each other, meaning attempting to find and sort the data is difficult. To help in this area, Olympus uses its inspection assist software. After an inspection, the engineer can efficiently analyse the recorded images and immediately create a report, just by selecting desired images with one-click operation, the company says. Its InHelp product is inspection data management and reporting software for Olympus Industrial videoscopes that streamlines all aspects of on-site inspections. It is designed to improve work efficiency by organising stored images and generating detailed inspection reports. Keeping a jet engine in good condition is a constant operation. "Some basic maintenance occurs on virtually every flight – when the flight crew visually checks the engine condition, lubricant levels and various points designed to highlight an anomaly – such as a dysfunctional low-oil level indicator or any other component indicating something out of specification," the US aviation journalist Dave Higson tells AvBuyer, an aircraft broker. "Other powerplant maintenance items arrive largely on an hours or cycles-based schedule, and include the two major events in the life of any turbine engine: the hot-section inspection (HSI); and engine overhaul." While some overhauls are proscribed as on-condition events, the HSI generally arrives at a set time period. "For engines with a proscribed TBO [time between overhaul], HSI events tend to arrive at the mid-point between zero hours and the TBO limit. For engines with an on-condition TBO cycle, however, HSI times are typically set on a firm schedule, whether 1,500 hours, 1,800 hours, 2,000 hours, or more," Mr Higson says. Invaluable "The downtimes vary and costs vary accordingly, but anticipate a low six-figure fee to be a starting point for engines that cost in the high six-figures new. Anticipate seven-figure fees for powerplants with new-production prices well into eight-figure sums. One engine-shop operator uses a rule of thumb that overhauls will cost one-third to one-half of the engine’s cost when new," he adds. "Regardless of the renewal costs, the necessity remains to help engines reach their limits, remain cost-effective and, most importantly, reliable and safe." So hats off to the backroom boys and girls whose work is seldom seen but whose efforts are invaluable in keeping our planes in the air. chnelson@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Loading...

Not just because Donald Trump was elected the 45th president of the United Stated or because the UK decided to leave the EU, but the markets’ reactions to these events were even more surprising and most forecasters got it wrong. A new year has started and many questions remain to be answered; here are some of the most asked questions for 2017: Will the Trump rally carry on? How many rate hikes will the Fed deliver? What is the future of the UK and the EU? Will OPEC finally balance the oil markets? Will the Trump rally carry on? Following the election of Donald Trump on November 8, all U.S. major indices recorded new highs. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8%, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite gained 5%, and the small-cap stock market index Russell 2000 outperformed its peers rising by more than 13%. From a market valuation perspective, very few may disagree that stocks are expensive, but the expected combination of fiscal stimulus and deregulation for some sectors under Trump’s presidency were the main catalysts for the rally. Of course, financial markets tend to price in events before they occur, but this time I believe investors have priced in most of the good news, and it requires very strong corporate profit growth to keep this bull market alive. Predicting the end of the bull market is a tough call, but the downside risk in 2017 is likely to be larger than the upside potential. If U.S. policy makers succeed in delivering the anticipated growth we can see another 5 – 10% gains in U.S. stocks, but failure to do so will cause a steep selloff that could exceed 20%. Day traders may be luckier than investors in 2017 as a new indicator has been added to their watch list:Trump’s twitter account. On December 6, Trump tweeted “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”, few seconds later Boeing stock wiped almost $1 billion from its market cap. We expect to see more of these tweets in 2017 and algorithms will probably require long time to put them into play, leaving retail traders with opportunities to profit from such market disruptions. How many rate hikes will the Fed deliver? 2016 kicked off with the expectation that four rate hikes wouldoccur, but only one was delivered in December. Although it was anticipated that the Federal Reserve will be more cautious in their forward guidance for 2017, December’s meeting took many economists by surprise as they hinted for three rate hikes. Since the financial crisis in 2008 the Fed has got many things wrong, whether it is forecasting rate hikes, economic growth and inflation levels, and now with a new administration to take office on January 20, this could make the Fed’s projections even more complicated. Inflation has always been the main justification for low interest rates, but now, even before Trump takesoffice, a couple of inflation gauges are running above 2%. The Fed did not account for any fiscal stimulus measures in their most recent projections, suggesting that huge shifts in expectations may be seen. The rising U.S. dollar which is currently at a 14-year high is another source of worry for the Fed, and tightening too fast will lead to even stronger dollar hitting U.S. exports and multinational companies’ profits. If Trump’s measures were passed and economic growth picked up, the Fed will have few options, either tightening monetary policy more aggressively, or to fall behind the curve and let the fixed income market lead the way, but three rate hikes in 2017 is my base case. Either way the dollar is likely to remain strong as divergence in monetary policies will continue to widen. Future of the UK and the EU? Hard, Soft or Grey Brexit. This was the most argued topic in the past six months, and until now there’s no clear path on what direction the UK will move. The pound ended 2016 17.5% lower against the US dollar since June 23 and there’s lot of speculation on how it will end in 2017. Of course, much will depend on the path Britain will choose. Theresa May promised to trigger Article 50 by the end of March, but we still need to hear from the Supreme Court on whether the UK government needs parliamentary approval before starting the withdrawal from the EU. The delay in triggering Article 50 will be positive in the short term for sterling, and negotiations may last well beyond 2017 on the terms of Brexit. Meanwhile investors will be focusing on the economic developments and the direction of the Bank of England’s monetary policy, which will probably be the second major central bank to raise rates after the Fed. Politics within the EU will rule investment decisions in 2017. Germany and France, the two largest economies will hold elections amid the rise of Eurosceptic candidates. Italy is likely to see an early vote, after the resignation of Matteo Renzi last month, and the Five Star Movement has vowed that if it wins power it will hold a referendum on whether Italy should leave the Eurozone. Although many polls indicate that far right candidates are still behind, nothing should be taken for granted after Trump won the U.S. presidency and Britain voted to leave the EU. Expect to see more pressure on the Euro and look out for parity against the dollar in the first six months. Will OPEC finally balance the oil market? After hitting a low of $27 a barrel in February 2016, Brent prices more than doubled by the end of year and many investment banks still see further increase in prices for 2017. OPEC’s decision to cut its output by 1.2 million barrels a day starting January, and non-OPEC producers to cut 558K barrels for the next six months to drain record global oil inventories led Brent prices to post its first yearly increase since 2012. Whether more appreciation is to be seen in 2017 will depend on multiple factors, and the biggest one currently looming is compliance to production cuts. It’s in no one’s interest not to comply, but historic figures show that delivering on previous production cuts has been poor. U.S. producers are another element to be focused on, how fast shale may come back is a key component to be considered in the price equation. Although Trump has made the energy sector part of his economic growth plan, I believe it won’t have a lot of impact if prices don’thold up. The dollar strength will likely impact the demand side, as continued strength will make oil more expensive in other currencies.   About the Author Forex Time The FXTM brand provides international brokerage services and gives access to the global currency markets, offering trading in forex, precious metals, Share CFDs, ETF CFDs and CFDs on Commodity Futures.

NASA said Wednesday that Boeing and SpaceX each have six orders for crewed missions now under the companies’ respective Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contracts with the space agency. Phil McAlister, director of NASA’s commercial spaceflight development division, said the additional missions will aid the stability of the crew rotation schedule and address schedule and financial uncertainty for commercial providers. The new awards currently do not include payments and are meant to help contractors plan for the missions and address space station transportation needs, NASA noted. Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon commercial crew spacecraft will work to carry up to four astronauts and 220 pounds of cargo as well as feature a lifeboat function to evacuate astronauts from ISS in case of an emergency. The Commercial Crew Program aims to increase the number of astronauts aboard the space station and provide more time for research to study the impact of long-duration human spaceflight within the low-Earth orbit. Boeing’s uncrewed flight test, dubbed Orbital Flight Test, is scheduled for June 2018 while the company’s crewed flight test is slated for August 2018. SpaceX plans to conduct its Demonstration Mission 1 uncrewed flight test in November and perform a crewed flight test in May next year. Actual missions to ISS will begin once flight tests are complete and NASA has issued certifications for providers.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 January 20174 January 2017 by Ethiopian Sets Yet Another Year of Growth Milestones Africa’s largest Airline Group, Ethiopian Airlines, is pleased to announce that it has ended yet another year of fast and profitable growth in 2016, highlighted by fleet and network expansion as well as significant investment in customer services. NEW YORK, NY, January 04, 2017 /24-7PressRelease/ — Recapping the Airline’s performance in 2016, Group CEO Ethiopian Airlines, Mr. Tewolde GebreMariam, said: “2016 has been an exceptionally challenging year for the African Aviation industry. Commodity exporting countries in general and oil exporting African countries in particular have been hit hard by the global decline of commodity prices. As a result, demand for air travel has been suppressed and the shortage of foreign exchange has severely affected the financial performance of airlines in the continent. Yet, at Ethiopian, we are very proud of the new heights Ethiopian has flown in the year: we celebrated our 70th anniversary, inaugurated the largest and the finest Aviation Academy in Africa and a state-of-the-art In-flight Catering facility which is the largest in the continent of Africa, introduced Africa’s first Ethiopian Airbus A350, and spread our wings to more countries on 5 continents. “Despite the sluggish growth in the world’s matured market, all of our 12,000 colleagues remained focused on the robust execution of our vision 2025, which has proved to be a winning strategy in today’s hyper-competitive and complex airline business. We wish to thank our valued customers for their continued vote of confidence on our services and for making Ethiopian as their airline of choice.” Major Diversification on the Core Fleet: Ethiopian has increased its fleet by 8 aircraft in 2016 and has closed the year with 82 airplanes in service. For the first time in its history, Ethiopian has diversified to include Airbus aircraft, with Africa’s first A350. With an average fleet age of just five years, Ethiopian has one of the youngest and most modern fleet in the world. Ethiopian has heavily invested in the two most technologically advanced fleet of our time; the B787 Dream Liner and the A350. With high performance, less carbon emission, advanced cabin features, and superior customer comfort, these airplanes are game changers in today’s civil aviation industry. Efficient Network of Convenient connectivity Living its motto of Bringing Africa Together and Closer to the World, Ethiopian has continued to connect the African continent with its major trading cities and markets. With connections as short as 30 minutes at our Addis Ababa hub airport, we offer the fastest travel time between Africa and the rest of the world for our customers.

In 2016 we launched new international flights to the Comoros Islands, Windhoek, and Newark and domestic routes to Hawassa, Kebridahar and Dembidolo. Ethiopian Cargo Services has also remained to be the largest cargo airline in Africa. Customer experience investments We have also been honored by the ways our world class service has been recognized: SKYTRAX World Airline Award for Best Airline Staff in Africa and Rising Star Carrier of the Year Award (both for the second year in a row), Cargo Airline of the Year, and African Airline of the Year Award are few to mention. Redefining our passengers’ onboard experience, we have successfully completed the modification of all our Boeing 787 Dreamliners with lie-flat beds. We have expanded and renovated our lounges in our Addis hub. In line with our new Inflight catering facilities, we have invested in upgrading our inflight meals with new menus, new cutlery, on board plating, new chinaware and new service delivery. We have also revamped our ShebaMiles Frequent Flyer Program with a major focus on enhancing our customers’ experience.

NASA took another big step to ensure reliable crew transportation to the International Space Station into the next decade. The agency's Commercial Crew Program has awarded an additional four crew rotation missions each to commercial partners, Boeing and SpaceX, to carry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The four additional missions will fly following NASA certification. They fall under the current Commercial Crew Transportation Capability contracts, and bring the total number of missions awarded to each provider to six. The additional flights will allow the commercial partners to plan for all aspects of these missions while fulfilling space station transportation needs. The awards do not include payments at this time. "Awarding these missions now will provide greater stability for the future space station crew rotation schedule, as well as reduce schedule and financial uncertainty for our providers," said Phil McAlister, director, NASA's Commercial Spaceflight Development Division. "The ability to turn on missions as needed to meet the needs of the space station program is an important aspect of the Commercial Crew Program." The two commercial spacecraft also will provide a lifeboat capability to allow the astronauts aboard the station to return safely to Earth in an emergency, if necessary. Returning human launch capabilities to U.S. soil underscores NASA's commitment to the station and the research that the orbiting laboratory makes possible including the advancement of scientific knowledge off the Earth, for the benefit of those on the Earth and to prepare for future deep space exploration. The Commercial Crew Program will help NASA get full operational use from the national laboratory for scientific research by increasing the number of astronauts on the space station, and allowing the crew members to dedicate more time to research. The commercial crew vehicles will transport up to four astronauts for NASA missions, along with about 220 pounds of critical cargo to the space station. More time dedicated for research allows NASA to better understand the challenges of long-duration human spaceflight without leaving low-Earth orbit. As NASA develops the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System rocket for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars, NASA is turning over low-Earth orbit crew and cargo transportation to commercial companies. This two-pronged approach is critical to achieve the agency's exploration goals. Boeing's uncrewed flight test, known as an Orbital Flight Test, is currently scheduled for June 2018 and its crewed flight test currently is planned for August 2018. SpaceX's uncrewed flight test, or Demonstration Mission 1, is currently scheduled for November 2017, followed by its first crew flight test in May 2018. Once the flight tests are complete and NASA certifies the providers for flight, the post-certification missions to the space station can begin. Boeing and SpaceX are developing two unique human space transportation systems. They also are upgrading necessary infrastructure, including launch pads, processing facilities, control centers and firing rooms. Boeing is developing the CST-100 Starliner that will launch on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX is developing the Crew Dragon to launch on the company's Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Pad 39A at the agency's Kennedy Space Center. Both are located on Florida's Space Coast.

ISSN 2330-717X Home News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology Health Dogfight Over Security Of Indian Skies To Begin Anew – Analysis India's Tejas fighter plane. Photo by Rahuldevnath, Wikipedia Commons. By South Asia Monitor January 4, 2017 By Gulshan Luthra* The dogfight over the choice of fighter jets – known as the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) – that are to provide security for the Indian skies is beginning again, this time for a much larger number than the 2007 figure of 189 asked by the Indian Air Force (IAF), an estimated 400 for for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and 60 for and Navy. While IAF has already issued a global request for single engine combat jets under the government’s Make in India programme, the Indian Navy is looking for about 60 twin-engine shipboard fighters for delivery to begin within five years. The navy’s first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC 1) is due for delivery within the next couple of years, and the preferred choice this time is either the Boeing F/A 18 Super Hornet or French Rafale, which IAF has already decided to buy. The two single engine aircraft being considered by IAF are US Lockheed Martin F 16 Fighting Falcon and Swedish Saab Gripen, Boeing, which developed the F 18 as a shipboard fighter, has also offered to make it in India while sources in Dassault, which makes Rafale, told India Strategic recently that they are aware of the Indian requirements and should be submitting a proposal soon. Rafale was also developed as a shipboard fighter. IAF is buying 36 Rafale Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) under a government-to-government basis and the first contractual payment of 15 percent was made in November to seal the deal. The first batch of six or so aircraft is to be delivered to IAF in 2019 as per the contract although India has requested the timelines to be advanced. Notably, shipboard jets are strong as they virtually have to crash-land on carrier decks on full power and it is easier to adapt them for lighter air force requirements. Conversely, it is difficult. Navy Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba had recently stated that the navy had jettisoned the indigenous naval variant of Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) because of low power. He did not specify the number or choice for the naval requirement but did say that only a couple of them are available in the market and that he wants them as fast as possible, say in about five years. He expressed confidence for speedy government approval. As for IAF, it has been losing two squadrons of Soviet-vintage Mig series aircraft every year, and although the numbers are being made up to an extent by the licence-production of 272 Russian Su 30MKIs, the depletion process of IAF squadrons is continuing. Notably, in 2007, the requirement for IAF was put at 126 plus 63 options (189) but their acquisition process under the MMRCA competition was scrapped in 2015 over price differences with the French Dassault whose Rafale was selected in 2012 against Eurofighter in the finals. The government then opted for a small number of 36 aircraft, or two squadrons, in 2015 for nearly Euro 8 billion inclusive of about Euro two billion for India-specific modifications and missiles as part of the package. Air Marshal VK Jimmy Bhatia (Retd), former Commander in Chief of the Western Air Command (WAC) and Air Marshal Ashok Goel (Retd), former Director General Inspection, say the Government should work towards both numbers and timelines. IAF needs to modernise 20 squadrons, or roughly 400 aircraft, as the need of the hour. An IAF fighter squadron, or Unit Establishment, has 18 aircraft for combat missions, and another two for training. At least three more are kept for Maintenance Reserve and Strike off Wastage (MRSOW). Notably, the acquisition process in India takes five to seven years, and that has to be factored in while planning for new jets. An IAF proposal to upgrade some 100 1970s-generation Jaguars with more powerful Honeywell engines and better avionics to extend their lives by 10 to 15 years is also pending for rather long in the Ministry of Defence. IAF’s operational strength of combat jets is around 700 aircraft, including the older Mig 21, Mig 27 and Jaguars. Its 25 to 30 year old Mig 29 and Mirage 2000 are however under upgrade, the latter by HAL in collaboration with the French Dassault, Safran and Thales which together make the Rafale. Both the IAF and Navy are looking for 4.5gen capabilities, that is what was stipulated for MMRCA, and plus in newer technologies, to keep up with the developments after 2007. Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha had told India Strategic that Boeing, Saab and Lockheed Martin had had made “unsolicited” offers under Make in India programme. Dassault and even Eurofighter could do the same and it would be up to the Government to consider them. All the five manufacturers took part in the aborted MMRCA competition along with Russian Mig 35. The navy apparently needs twin engine aircraft, and if they are to be made in India, then some commonality with IAF is required. IAF needs a combination of both. On the other hand, single engine jets are much cheaper to buy and operate, and if the aircraft are needed in large numbers, then the overall price will matter a lot. India’s Ministry of Defence has a tough choice, but one hopes for early decisions. *Gulshan Luthra is the Editor of India Strategic defence magazine and website, www.indiastrategic.in.

Previous post Next post 3 Comments on "Dogfight Over Security Of Indian Skies To Begin Anew – Analysis" Benith Israel Moses | January 4, 2017 at 12:00 pm | Reply I’m not an anti-national. I am just an arm chair critic. Seeing all this drama to again buy, one single engine, one twin engine and one more twin engine fighter (PAKFA). I say we have lost the plot. We should just buy F-35-A for Airfoce and F-35 C for 2nd aircraft carrier. We would definitely get screw driver technology for the numbers quoted time and again in the media. The US might just throw in a brand new bone, the EMALS technology for IAC 2 and follow on carriers. This technology transfer of licensed production and maintenance by HAL will go a long way will go a long way in building Indian military technological capabilities. This way DRDO can take its time to develop Tejas mk1,mk 1A, mk1B,mk 2, mk2A, mk 2B and heck yeah by 2050 we may even have first flight of AMCA. PS: The generals should first correct the ratio of fighter pilots to aircraft in the IAF inventory which stands currently at less than 1. Whats the point of having more aircraft if you don’t have anybody to fly them. Kiran | January 4, 2017 at 11:56 pm | Reply Good thought Israel, but will the Americans offer the F 35 to us? and even if they do, we might not be able to afford more than 2-3 squadrons shanx | January 5, 2017 at 5:27 am | Reply I have an even simpler idea. We just abandon the F16,F18,FGFA,Gripen and stick to Tejas and Su30mki. We should negotiate with Russia to acquire design, modification and upgrade ability on Su30mki in return for us buying 200 more of them. We continue to work with Sweden, France and USA to continually improve the Tejas. Ultimately the Su30mki and Tejas experience will pave the way for the AMCA.

The 29th edition of the show, held in the American car capital, will showcase the increasingly prominent role of digital and electric advances, starting with its unofficial kickoff on Sunday, when Google will showcase a self-driving car partnership with Chrysler. While the show will be looking to the future, prior to the show’s public opening on January 14 many industry insiders likely will be focused on the present, notably the increased uncertainty from an incoming Trump administration. The president-elect has shown a willingness to apply pressure, especially via Twitter, on U.S. manufacturers like Boeing, Carrier, Lockheed, GM and Ford to criticize corporate strategies, especially those involving investment and employment outside the United States. He has vowed to preserve American jobs or bring them back, threatened to impose tariffs on American goods made in Mexico and China, and tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. “We’ve never experienced anything quite like this,” said Alan Deardorff, a professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on international trade policy. Trade deals take years to have an effect as economies adjust, he said, so it is unclear what would happen to the US car industry should those deals be abruptly canceled or changed. “We’ve never gone in this direction, not in recent history,” he said. But he warned one likely outcome is an increase in the car prices, making them less competitive in a global economy. Matt DeLorenzo, who tracks the auto industry for Kelley Blue Book, said U.S. carmakers “will have to reassess their whole Mexico strategy and NAFTA.” An early sign of that reassessment came in dramatic fashion Tuesday when Ford appeared to capitulate to months of Trump’s criticism by scrapping plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Instead it will use $700 million of those funds to expand a Michigan plant, creating 700 new jobs. “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that (Trump) has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the U.S.,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said. Ford has been investing in high-tech, electric vehicle development, and beefing up higher-skilled American manufacturing can help better accomplish that goal, while its cheaper, less technology-laden car models are produced in Mexico.  Trump also targeted GM in a tweet Tuesday, threatening to impose a tariff on the car giant’s Mexican-made Chevrolet Cruze cars. GM responded quickly, emphasizing that the vast majority of its U.S.-sold Cruze vehicles are made in Ohio. Despite the rhetoric, the worst fears of what a Trump administration might do in 2017 are unlikely to come to pass, said Christopher Wilson, who studies U.S.-Mexico policy at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. “The incoming administration is coming to terms with the reality” of the cross-border car manufacturing process, Wilson said. He warned that there may be other efforts undertaken to address negative effects from globalization, including new tax policies and a renegotiation of NAFTA. “Anything that puts NAFTA at risk, puts the U.S. economy at risk,” he said. With those high stakes in play, the auto industry will open the Detroit auto show that this year focuses on autonomous car technologies, amid the usual array of vehicle debuts and demonstrations. The bulk of the show’s more than 300 exhibitors are start-ups boasting new technologies for connected and self-driving cars. Major manufacturers also are in the game. Volkswagen, seeking to turn the page from the diesel emissions scandal that led to a 7.6% sales tumble in 2016, plans to unveil an electric, autonomous concept car. Google’s self-driving car subsidiary Waymo will showcase a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with self-driving technology. “The race has accelerated in the last 12 months between car groups, Silicon Valley giants and consumer electronics groups to be the first in market” with an autonomous car, said Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. Despite that onslaught, analysts say autonomous technology is currently in the early stages, in which human intervention is still required. “Full automation is the ultimate goal, but at the moment, no company has fully autonomous vehicles in production,” Jefferies & Co tech analyst Brian Fitzgerald said. Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst with AutoTrader, said part of the challenge is overcoming hesitant consumer sentiment, which has been evolving from suspicious to cautious. “There’s going to be a lot of experimentation ... in terms of how do we make autonomous available to consumers,” Krebs said. An AutoTrader annual survey of consumer sentiment found shifting attitudes. After initially considering autonomous technologies too dangerous, consumers were becoming more accepting, Krebs said. “Consumers want more and more driver assist technology,” she said, “and they are warming up to the idea of autonomous, fully self-driving” cars. The production of these technology-packed cars will require a highly-skilled workforce. Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute said that is an opportunity for American manufacturing to catch up, should policymakers in the Trump administration take steps to invest in labor force training and other services for displaced workers. “They’re going to have to do more than renegotiate NAFTA,” to bring manufacturing jobs back at a large scale, Scott said. © 2017 AFP Tweet Back to top 1 Comment Login to comment 0 NCIS RerunsJan. 06, 2017 - 01:06PM JST "amid uncertain future with Trump" How can the writer imply that?

We've all heard the old saying: "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em." But in politics, the more clever move can be summed up by saying: "If you can't beat 'em, steal their best supporters." Donald Trump is continuing to do just that to the Democrats, and the supporters he's stealing are the unions. Trump's attack tweets against different companies may seem pretty random, but look closer. When he calls out Carrier, Ford, GM, Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, etc., all of the companies he's targeting have something in common: They're either unionized companies or in generally unionized industries. He did it again Thursday with this swipe at Toyota: Tweet Trump's protectionist threats continue to anger many conservative economic purists. But Democrats are the ones who should be irate, and they will be once they figure out what Trump is doing and doing successfully. He's pulling their most important source of financial and ballot box support right out from under them. His protectionist and border security message, which became evident right from the first day he announced his campaign, clearly spoke to union rank-and-file members across the country. While too many of the so-called experts were focusing on what they saw as offensive comments about illegal Mexican immigrants, union voters must have been listening with an open mind. The numbers prove it, as Trump did better among union voters than any Republican presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan. This makes a lot of sense politically. After the Iraq War went south and the financial crisis hit in 2008, the Republican brand died nationally. The GOP was still a viable party in statewide elections, especially in its stronghold regions in the reddest of red states. Trump seems to be the only Republican candidate who realized, and still realizes, that espousing traditional GOP messages won't work on the national stage anymore. That meant grabbing some of the traditional Democratic core supporters to make up the difference. And doing so meant sounding less like a Republican and more like a protectionist, pro-union Democrat. And it's not just about total voter numbers. As Hillary Clinton found out the hard way, eroding union support for Democrats leaves any Democratic presidential candidate vulnerable in the supposedly "blue wall" states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania that are all rich in Electoral College votes. And then there's the money. And we're talking big money. The list of the top financial election year donors to the Democratic Party reads like a list of unions in the phone book. Almost all of them donate almost exclusively to the Democrats and they also provide crucial ground support on Election Day to get out the vote. It is almost impossible to overstate their importance to the Democrats' chances of wining any election at any level. Indeed, Republicans have used this union-stealing strategy before. In addition to Reagan badly damaging his challengers' chances by almost winning the union vote in 1980 and 1984, Richard Nixon actually won a majority of them in 1972. Those presidential elections were all landslide wins for the Republicans. The good news for the Democrats is that in each of those elections and the 2016 contest, the individual winning GOP presidential candidate didn't have strong enough coattails to create , or in Trump's case, increase, Republican majorities in Congress. But for Democrats and liberals who have made Trump their singular enemy, perhaps that's no consolation. And if any current or future GOP candidates for key Congressional seats take up Trump's pro-union tune, the losses could be devastating for the Left. It's not that Trump has only gone after companies or industries with union workers. On the campaign trail and in some other venues he bashed hedge funds, Wall Street, and promised to do something about rising drug prices. But his most intense and enduring focus remains on the auto industry and manufacturers that either have, or once had, a lot of unionized employees. Nixon didn't get much of a chance to cater to unions, and Reagan did it infrequently with his protectionist policies to rescue Harley-Davidson and the steel industry. Trump looks like he's going to make this a regular priority. How the Democrats will respond to him and this strategy is their problem. Expect this to continue throughout his presidency. And all it takes is a look at the election map to see why. Trump's siphoning of union support from the Democrats brought him a narrow election victory, it's only logical that he'll do what it takes to siphon yet more to ensure more support and a bigger re-election margin in the coming years.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today New App Feature Will Warn Investors of Trump Tweets Finance alert app Trigger has created a feature to warn investors when President-elect Donald Trump is tweeting about their holdings. TheStreet Staff Jan 5, 2017 2:22 PM EST Finance alert app Trigger has created a feature to warn investors when President-elect Donald Trump is tweeting about their holdings. Trump's tweets since he was elected have had a pretty big impact on major U.S. corporations. On Thursday, Trump criticized Toyota (TM) for possibly building a plant in Mexico and not in the United States. After Trump's tweet, shares of Toyota slid nearly 0.5%. After criticizing Boeing (BA) for the price of the Air Force One jet, Boeing shares dipped about 2%. Trigger is looking to give users the tools to manage the market reaction to Trump's comments by sending out real-time alerts when Trump tweets about certain stocks. But the new feature could be useless after inauguration day. Trump says his use of Twitter (TWTR) will be "very restrained" once he takes office.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 January 20175 January 2017 by Top 5 Vendors in the UAV Payload and Subsystems Market from 2017 to 2021: Technavio LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Technavio has announced the top five leading vendors in their recent global UAV payload and subsystems market report. This research report also lists five other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. For over a decade, major spenders such as the US, Russia, China, and the UK have made significant investments in the development and procurement of next-generation UAV platforms to strengthen their security and surveillance capabilities. Also, the growing territorial disputes between countries have resulted in increased focus on maritime warfare, obligating naval agencies to enhance their target acquisition capability and acquire advanced UAVs and associated payloads and subsystems. Competitive vendor landscape The global UAV payload and subsystems market is highly competitive with many prominent players competing to enhance their market share. Also, due to the stringent safety and regulatory norms, along with the requirements for superior investments, entry of new vendors is expected to get restricted during the forecast period. “Due to the rapid adoption of miniaturized UAVs in the surveillance applications, UAV components suppliers need to develop and supply cost-efficient and miniaturized payloads that can enhance the operation capability of small UAVs,” says Moutushi Saha, a lead defense research analyst from Technavio. Companies with superior technical and financial resources can bring substantial changes in the existing payloads and subsystems, which will help them to recoup the development costs in shorter development cycle time. The smaller companies can establish collaborations to compete with existing prominent vendors. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=55400 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Top five UAV payload and subsystems market vendors AeroVironment AeroVironment manufactures and markets UAVs, tactical missile systems, and associated services primarily to various organizations within US DoD, including the US Army, Marine Corps, Special Operations Command, and Air Force; as well as to allied armed forces. These UAVs are used to establish ISR superiority on the front lines of combat zones. Boeing Boeing, along with its subsidiary, INSITU, designs, manufactures, and supplies UAV and associated systems for its customers spread across the global defense industry. The company also offers field operations and logistics, training, flight demonstration, and payloads directorate services. Elbit Systems The company develops, manufactures, and supplies EO payloads for UAVs and support equipment for the global defense and homeland security industries. It has been enhancing its business through strategic acquisitions and establishing joint ventures (JV). In April 2016, Elbit Systems signed an agreement with an Indian technology provider, Adani Aero Defence, to establish a JV for co-operating on UAVs development in India. Lockheed Martin The company engages in the development of advanced surveillance and imaging technologies that are used in remote sensing, EW, and maritime surveillance operations. It also offers systems support, maintenance, and training services covering a comprehensive array of UAV platforms. Lockheed Martin also manufactures and supplies hand-launched small UAV platforms along with man-portable GCS. Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman develops both surveillance and attack-enabled UAVs for the US and NATO allied countries globally. In October 2015, the company secured a contract worth USD 3.2 billion from the US Air Force to initiate upgrades for the RQ-4 Global Hawk fleets for next 10 years. The RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV allows broad-area surveillance by employing high-resolution SAR and long-range IR sensors.

On Wednesday, Yahoo Finance put a spotlight on their newest individual “trigger” for notifications: Now you can get a notification when President Elect Donald Trump tweets about a company you own stock in. This comes on the heels of Trump’s tweets about Boeing last month, which led to the aerospace giant’s stock dropping 2%. Also on Wednesday, Brian Stelter’s “Reliable Sources” email newsletter for CNN mentioned a related story. Stelter is in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and asked CNN tech correspondent Samuel Burke for his thoughts on where media and technology are converging at the trade show. Burke’s answer echoed the same concerns that Trigger’s user base may have. “[T]ech CEOs — talking about Trump — are fearing getting a tweet about their companies at 3 a.m. West Coast time since the president-elect often tweets in the 6 a.m. Eastern hour,” he said. “[M]ultiple tech leaders say they or their PR folks have adjusted their schedules to make sure someone is up at 3 a.m. local time to catch the the tweets out of fear that a Trump tweet could crash their stock and put their company into a frenzy.” Others have made a point of setting configuring the Twitter mobile app of notifying them whenever Trump tweets, some even going to the point of planning how they would rebuke a potential Trump call-out in the media.

Watchdogs must tighten rules that allow him to do this Small investors are told that it's a good idea to invest their money in the stock market to provide for their futures. Their interests need to be better protected James Moore @JimMooreJourno Thursday 5 January 2017 16:34 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Mike Ashley has brazenly ignored the wishes of a majority of independent shareholders PA Mike Ashley has thumbed his nose at the City once again, using his majority shareholding to secure the appointment of his man Keith Hellawell as chairman of Sports Direct, despite a majority of independent shareholders voting against him. Twice.  A little while ago the Financial Conduct Authority, the City's chief watchdog, became concerned at the way wealthy individuals were able make pots of cash by taking companies public in London only to ride roughshod over minority investors having done so.  In response, a new rule was introduced giving minority investors the power to vote down directors. If they said no to a particular candidate, said candidate would, in effect, be put into a sort of corporate purdah ahead of an EGM at which a fresh vote would be held.  Read more Sports Direct chairman Keith Hellawell faces second shareholder revolt Sports Direct spends £40m on corporate jet amid alarming dive in profi Sports Direct's Homer and Abe Simpson are at it again The idea was that there should be no need for that. Company directors are supposed to represent the interests of all shareholders. Having failed to secure the support of a majority of independent investors, the candidate was supposed to step aside because their position would, in theory, be untenable. Peace talks would then be held behind closed doors, a way forward agreed, a new candidate put forward and approved. Move on, nothing to see here.  Until Mike Ashley exposed the problem with the new rule. It doesn’t work.  Minority investors have for the second time voted against Mr Hellawell. He has sat at the head of the board as a string of problems at the company have come to light, and so really ought to be held to account.  In fact, an increased majority of independent shareholders tried to do this. Some 54 per cent voted against his reappointment at the latest EGM, up from 53 per cent at the last AGM.  While Mr Hellawell did offer to resign in the wake of the first negative vote, Mr Ashley asked him to stay put and so he did. Mr Ashley, who has appointed himself as chief executive in the meantime, further issued a statement to the stock exchange after the latest no saying that he hoped to persuade Mr Hellawell to reconsider his pledge to stand down if he failed to receive the backing of independent shareholders for the third occasion at the company’s AGM later this year.  Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty Other investors who maintain large shareholdings in their companies after going public like Mr Ashley will take note of this. What it tells them is that, while they might have to endure a bit of bad publicity, at the end of the day the rules allow them to do more or less what they want.  That’s not good enough. The point about Sports Direct, and about companies like it, is that they are public companies. Ordinary Britons have money invested in them through their ISAs and through their pensions. The Government has told them that it is a good idea for them to save in this way, and thus provide for themselves.  Mr Ashley’s behaviour, and Sports Direct's poor corporate governance, is a problem that goes beyond Sports Direct. But he isn’t going to change it until watchdogs step up to the plate and force the issue. It’s time for them to do that.  More about: Mike Ashley Sports Direct corporate governance Financial Conduct Authority Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY - RTX21PNO    5406875 One of the engines on a B-52 Stratofortress fell out during a flight training exercise over North Dakota Wednesday. Although it lost an engine, the Boeing-manufactured aircraft, part of the Minot Air Force Base 5th Bomb Wing, operates using eight Pratt & Whitney TF33-P-3/103 turbofan engines, so the five-man crew was able to land the plane safely, Defense News reported. The engine broke apart and landed in an unpopulated area 25 nautical miles from the base, at which time the Air Force dispatched a helicopter to retrieve the debris. There were no weapons on board the aircraft. Col. Matthew Brooks, commander of the 5th Bomb Wing, part of Air Force Global Strike Command’s Eighth Air Force, set up a safety panel to investigate the cause of the accident, Military.com introduced. In a similar incident, the B-52 from Minot crashed on the flight line at Anderson Air Force Base in Guam in May, 2016. The crew was able to safely evacuate the aircraft. The U.S. reportedly has 76 B-52 bombers currently in its inventory. While the B-52 is one of the oldest aircraft in the Air Force, dating all the way back to 1952, it continues to play a vital role in several different ways. Recent uses of the B-52 includes symbolic fly-overs of the Korean Peninsula to warn Pyongyang, similar fly-overs of the South China Sea to warn Beijing against its territorial ambitions, and more recently, bombing Islamic State (ISIS) militants in the Middle East. The iconic bomber is expected to be in operation until around 2040, at which point it will be replaced by Northrop Grumman’s B-21. The B-52 can carry a weapons payload of about 70,000 pounds and fly nearly 9,000 miles without in-flight refueling. “We want our partners and the enemy to see the airpower [the B-52] has overhead,” Col. Daniel Manning, the deputy director of the Combined Air Operations Center, told Military.com, “A B-52 encourages our partner force that we have their back.” Follow Ryan on Twitter Send tips to ryan@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

Eric Berger - Jan 5, 2017 3:40 pm UTC Enlarge / The Soyuz MS-03 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome with NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy of Roscosmos, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet on board in November. NASA/Bill Ingalls reader comments 67 Share this story The new year finds NASA beset by uncertainty, especially with regard to its human spaceflight programs. Soon, the agency will be without its current leadership. Administrator Charlie Bolden has told his team he will leave office at noon on January 20, along with his boss, President Barack Obama. And as yet there is no clear direction for what comes next from the Trump administration and its space transition team, which remain locked in a struggle over the future direction of the agency. Further ReadingPeter Thiel now leading the fight for commercial space in Trump’s NASA It's not a good time for uncertain leadership, as many of NASA's human spaceflight initiatives face serious questions. As 2017 begins, recurring issues with the Russian Soyuz launch vehicle have left the agency unable to say when its next astronaut will go into space. Its much-anticipated private space taxis remain more than a year from flight. And questions remain about the viability of its big-ticket programs, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. One should never count the space agency out, of course, as it works with a large number of aerospace contractors and has thousands of talented engineers and scientists at field centers. But as one former astronaut told Ars, "Human space flight has created the situation that it is waiting for leadership to make progress in significant ways. The big question is who will lead them out of this hole?" Soyuz NASA's problems start with Russia. Since the space shuttle's retirement in 2011, there has been only one pathway for astronauts and cosmonauts to the International Space Station—Russia's Soyuz rocket and spacecraft. Unfortunately, on December 1, a Soyuz rocket carrying an uncrewed Progress spacecraft exploded about six minutes into flight, wiping out 2.6 tons of food, fuel, and supplies. This was due to a problem with the rocket's third-stage engine, the kerosene-fueled RD-0110. The Progress spacecraft launched on an older Soyuz-U rocket, which is being phased out by Roscosmos. Crewed launches now take place on a more modern Soyuz-FG rocket, but the two rockets share a common third stage. This is the second time the third-stage engine has failed in some way in the last five years, as a similar problem occurred during the 2011 launch of Progress 44P. Further ReadingHad a crew launched on that doomed Soyuz last week, would they have died? What this means for the next crew launch to the station is unclear. Nominally, NASA astronaut Jack Fischer and Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin are due to launch in March; on New Year's Eve Roscosmos released a revised schedule calling for a March 27 crewed launch. However that presumes the investigation of the December 1 failure is complete, and Russia has a plan to either address the third stage issue or will accelerate its plan to transition to a modern (but less proven) Soyuz-2-1a variant, which has an entirely different third stage. According to one NASA source familiar with the Russian space program, the agency has heard "only rumors" regarding a return to flight date for the Progress vehicle, which would need to occur before humans fly into space again. Thus, NASA's only lifeline to the station appears to be shaky heading into the new year. Commercial crew This was to be the year when NASA would finally regain the capability to launch its own astronauts into space through its commercial crew program. However, Boeing and SpaceX have already slipped the dates of their first operational flights into 2018, and further delays are possible. Further ReadingNASA officials mulling the possibility of purchasing Soyuz seats for 2019 That means NASA has to hope Russia keeps the Soyuz safely flying for another two years, and it must also contemplate the politically sensitive topic of procuring more Soyuz seats in 2019. Congress will not be happy about receiving this request. While earlier delays with the private spacecraft were due to under-funding, Congressional outlays have recently matched NASA's requests for commercial crew funding. So delays beyond 2017 are due to technical problems with the companies' designs and NASA's own management of the program. The issue of commercial crew delays is likely to be one of the first decisions that will confront a new administrator of NASA, given that there is no guarantee Boeing's Starliner of SpaceX's Crew Dragon vehicles will be ready to fly two years from now. How will he or she explain this to Congress? SLS and Orion For the last six years, NASA and Congress have been in lock step about the future of the agency, touting construction of the large Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft for deep space exploration. But there has been a dawning realization that a space program predicated on a flight rate of once per year will be difficult to sustain. With the possible launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket this year, some members of the Trump administration's transition team are also asking questions about the need for NASA to build a heavy lift rocket on its own, at a cost of about $10 billion. Further ReadingNASA realizes SLS and Orion are too expensive, opens door to competitors There are also rumors about potential delays with the first launch of the SLS rocket, which will propel an Orion spacecraft around the Moon in a flight known as Exploration Mission 1. Some of the problems cannot be blamed on NASA, as they stem from slower-than-anticipated development of Orion's service module by the European Space Agency. But it is also conceivable that the agency will run into problems when it integrates the various components of the SLS rocket—its core tanks, the side-mounted boosters, and upper stage—for tests later this year and in early 2018. NASA has told Congress for several years now that Exploration Mission 1 would launch in September, 2018. However there is now a very real possibility that this demonstration mission will slip into at least early 2019. That is the same year yet another privately developed heavy lift rocket, Blue Origin's New Glenn, could begin launching, raising further questions about the need for NASA's own hardware.

(Mark Duncan/Associated Press) Josh Bolten, who served in the White House under President George W. Bush as chief of staff and director of the Office of Management and Budget, was just named head of the Business Roundtable, which its website describes as “an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies working to promote sound public policy and a thriving U.S. economy.” More impressive that the $6 trillion in annual revenue of its member companies is the nearly 15 million employees who work for the chief executives. This is a big cross-section of America. We normally wouldn’t remark upon a new head of a trade association, especially the Business Roundtable, which has been much less visible than other pro-market, pro-growth advocacy groups lately. But Bolten arrives at a precipitous moment for business, the start of Donald Trump’s presidency. Trump intends to slap tariffs on goods from China, round up and deport 11 million people and hector companies to keep jobs in the country or face his wrath. He has already threatened Boeing with cancellation of two new Air Force One airplanes, lit into General Motors and vowed to impose a border tax for cars manufactured in Mexico, and taken credit for saving 5,000 Sprint jobs (which actually had been “saved” before the election). Stepping back for a moment, the problems for business go beyond Trump’s day-to-day antics. Public support for trade agreements has collapsed. Americans swayed by xenophobic demagogues think immigrants steal our jobs. As with many institutions, big business has lost the confidence of the vast majority of Americans. Only 18 percent, according to Gallup, say they have “a great deal” or “quite a lot”  of confidence in big business. Only Congress does worse (9 percent) among the 14 institutions listed. So Bolten and his CEO members have their work cut out for them. Bolten, no doubt, is getting lots of suggestions, but here are a few that might help promote policies that favor growth, a dynamic economy, higher wages and integration, not rejection, into the modern, global economy. First, he and his members need to start defending trade, high-skilled immigration and globalization. These have helped lift billions out of poverty, given Americans the widest array of affordable goods any people in human history have ever enjoyed, stimulated phenomenal innovation, and allowed Americans to increase their earnings and wealth by selling their goods around the world. Unfortunately, Republicans have lost their nerve to defend these simple truths and the free-market policies that made them possible. Even those who know better refuse to defend these elements, which are at the heart of a free-market economy. (Groups such as Heritage Action are fair-weather friends of capitalism, refusing to rise in defense of trade or immigration for fear of losing favor with Trumpkins.) If business and its employees don’t do it, who is going to make the case for the building blocks on which American industry and workers rely? That brings us to the next point: The employees of companies that compete in the global economy depend upon trade, high-skilled immigration and globalization for their livelihood. They are the ones most likely to be hurt (along with consumers) if populist policies are enacted. The failure to make the connection between the livelihood of those 15 million people working for Business Roundtable companies and tens of millions who work for other companies that must compete globally has been a great failure of business and free-market conservatives. The rich (like Trump) don’t need a thriving, dynamic, globally integrated economy to be prosperous; these workers do. Their voices have been almost entirely absent from the debate that seems to rage between blue collar, less educated Americans who have fared poorly in the 21st-century economy and nebulous “elites.” Where is everyone else? We should be hearing from them, learning how they have navigated the 21st century and why “populism” isn’t going to help people like them at all. Third, as long as the federal government is dysfunctional (for the foreseeable future) business will need to attend to functions normally thought to be the responsibility of the public sector — K-12 education, higher education, lifetime worker training, anti-poverty measures, and even urban violence stemming from encounters between the police and minority communities. If business wants an educated workforce, prosperous consumers and safe places for its employees to live and for it to do business it is going to have to roll up its sleeves and recommit to what we used to call “corporate citizenship.” A great deal of this is already going on. Businesses “adopt” schools, fund research, provide constant training and often educational grants to their employees and more. Every museum, concert hall and sports stadium built in the past few decades has a long list of corporate sponsors. These will need to increase. Public-private partnerships can be the vehicle for everything from support for charter schools to mentor programs that combat truancy to library and community athletic programs. Business will need to scale up their programs and systematically commit to developing a 21st-century workforce. And finally, business can voluntarily sign onto to a host of initiatives that focus on the working poor, upward mobility and social justice. We have already seen Walmart agree to increase its minimum wage; other retailers, such as Target, followed suit. IKEA announced last year it was offering “four months paid parental leave to its U.S. workers of all genders, whether they’re salaried or hourly — and irrespective of whether they’re becoming parents via birth, adoption, or fostering.” The Human Rights Campaign reports that 517 companies have gotten perfect scores on its rating for LGBT employee policies. These companies did not do these things out of the goodness of their hearts; they did so out of a sense of enlightened self-interest. They need healthy, economically secure employees (who are also their customers). They want to get and retain the best workers. They, in essence, have developed their own social contracts with employees that go above and beyond what is legally required. Every single Business Roundtable member company should do the same — and then challenge the rest of the Fortune 500 to do so. If employers do not want to be thrashed by the new president, see their markets and employment pool dry up, operate in violent and wretched cities or lose a skilled workforce that will carry them through the next century, they better not be passive. Markets and skilled workers don’t magically appear and renew themselves; they must be fostered and maintained. Corporate citizenship and private social contracts are not a substitute for government. Of course, not everyone works for a big company with resources to do this, but some of what we are recommending should benefit non-employees as well — the families of employees and the communities and schools in the places they operate. Moreover, a more activist business community focused on working and middle-class prosperity may begin to change the mind-set of the country by demonstrating we all do rise or sink together. Very simply, if big business wants to survive Trump and change the way it is viewed, it better take on important tasks that are visible to the country at large. Otherwise, they’ll feel the wrath of Trump and his angry minions. opinions right-turn Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

News Business Business News Petrol prices hit 18-month high and will rise further, RAC warns drivers Rising oil costs and the pound's weakness against the dollar have combined Ben Chapman Thursday 5 January 2017 14:57 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Pump prices had been kept low by a prolonged period of oil oversupply; that is now over istock/ gremlin Fuel bills are at their highest in 18 months with drivers of diesel cars are paying £10 more to fill up a tank and petrol customers are shelling out £8 more.  Petrol has hit £1.17 per litre and diesel £1.20, with both set to rise further over the year, the RAC warned in its latest Fuel Watch report.  Unusually, supermarkets hiked pump prices by the most in December, the RAC found. The big stores normally offer discounts to lure shoppers into buying other goods while they fill up. Read more Opec may have done the world a good turn for once Drivers had enjoyed low prices after oil more than halved in price during 2014. Oversupply thanks to shale oil from the United States and a glut of oil from the Opec cartel of producing countries, combined with weak demand in a stuttering global economy had kept prices in a slump. A barrel of Brent crude dropped to $27 in January last year but has now rebounded to $56 as Opec has slashed production. Motorists have been hit by an additional squeeze from the pound’s 18 per cent drop against the dollar - oil is priced in the US currency, increasing fuel costs further. Read more UK petrol prices to rise after Opec deal cuts oil production Opec has agreed to cut oil production in 'historic agreement' Opec's production cut sends oil price higher. But it might not last There could be further pain in store after British businesses reported unprecedented price pressures on Thursday. The British Chambers of Commerce said the number of firms expecting to increase prices in the next three months is higher than at any time in 20 years. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said future fuel prices now depend on the outcome of an international deal on oil production levels currently being thrashed out.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) accused the company of using software that allowed excess diesel emissions in just over 100,000 US trucks and SUVs sold since 2014. READ MORE Six senior Volkswagen employees charged over emissions scandal Shares listed in Europe were recently trading around 18 per cent lower on the day.

For a report published ahead of its annual summit in Davos next week, the WEF surveyed 750 risk experts and found that rising income and wealth disparity were cited as the most important trends in determining global developments over the next 10 years. Getty 3/31 Mayor Sadiq Khan axes new Routemaster bus from the streets of London - Friday January 6 London Mayor Sadiq Khan has ended any hopes to purchase new Routemasters bus for the capital's streets as he tries to balance the books on London's transport budget. Once called 'Boris buses' named after his the previous mayor, every bus would cost around £350,000 each, or around £50,000 more than an ordinary bus. But the new mayor has promised to freeze purchases of the vehicles, which were criticised for being expensive and sauna-like conditions.

Hatton Garden was the centre of the world's diamond market, but traders are fighting to bring back the glory days, as they are squeezed by rising rents and the uncertainty created by the UK vote to leave the EU.

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE General Motors CEO Mary Barra talks about the new 2016 Chevy Cruze vehicle at the Filmore Theater in Detroit, Michigan, June 24, 2015. Trump slammed General Motors' production of some Cruze compact cars in Mexico on Twitter Tuesday. Rebecca Cook/Reuters | Caption Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen January 4, 2017 —The @realDonaldTrump was at it again Tuesday, threatening in 140 characters to impose a border tax on the Chevrolet Cruze cars General Motors manufactures in Mexico. An early morning Twitter post sent GM shares on a 1 percent tumble before the market opened, although they rebounded to close up, at $35.15 by the end of Tuesday.  The tweet came hours ahead of an announcement that Ford Motor Company has halted plans to build in Mexico a $1.6 billion assembly plant, a repeated target of Mr. Trump in his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Instead, Ford said Tuesday it now plans to invest $700 million in a Michigan factory to build new electric, hybrid, and autonomous vehicles. General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, became the latest American manufacturer Tuesday caught in the crosshairs of Mr. Trump’s Twitter account. The president-elect has slammed Ford, United Technologies, The Boeing Company, and Lockheed Martin on social media since he was elected Nov. 8. In doing so, Trump has already inserted himself into corporate affairs more than his predecessors in the White House, experts say. But it’s unclear how his direct criticism of one automaker, be it GM or Ford, could affect the industry as a whole. It’s unlikely one tweet will force a manufacturer to scrap months of planning, since any change in vehicle production would require a carmaker to build a brand new facility. But it could lead to different forms of rhetoric among those in Detroit, says Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied the relationship of businesses and governments. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? A “company could think of ways to allow an administration to claim some credit for the opening of new factories,” Professor Jensen tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interivew. Conversely, Ford and GM have each gone on the defensive against Trump.   On Tuesday, an Android phone (an indication Trump may have authored the post himself) tweeted “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across boarder. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!”  General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 The president-elect did not provide further details. But General Motors promptly responded, publishing a brief statement on its website. The automaker said it manufactures the Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio, and builds the hatchback version in Mexico “for global markets” “with a small number sold in the US.” According to Automative News, GM began to produce the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the US. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM facility in South Korea. “In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors,” said Trump transition team spokesman and incoming press secretary Sean Spicer. “But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind.” Trump’s tweet also came hours ahead of Ford’s announcement it would cancel its plans for the $1.6 billion factory in Mexico in favor of a $700 million factory in Michigan. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new plant was, in part, related to the company’s need to “fully utilize capacity at existing facilities” amid declining sales of small and medium-sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion. Mr. Fields also endorsed “pro growth” tax and regulatory policies expected under the Trump administration and a Republican Congress. But a Ford source told Reuters the company’s decision was directly influenced by Trump’s policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations. During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged that, if elected, he would not allow Ford to build the assembly plant in Mexico. He said Ford’s plan was an “absolute disgrace,” and threatened to slap a tariff of 35 percent on imported Ford cars. But Ford’s actions appear to be as much about the shifting auto market as policies under Trump. Small-car sales have been hurt by shifting consumer demands and low gas prices. In fact, a trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers has been to produce smaller cars in Mexico while taking advantage of higher-paid US workers to build more profitable, trucks, SUVs and luxury cars. Dr. Jensen at the University of Texas at Austin related Ford’s announcement to company’s relationships with governors. In a 2013 paper, Jensen and his colleagues published findings from a nationwide internet survey that suggested that a firm crediting a governor with its expansion can be politically beneficial to a governor's future campaign to remain in office. "Our findings illustrate a critical political benefit of offering such [tax] incentives," they write in the abstract. "Politicians can use these incentives to take credit for investment flowing into their districts and to minimize the political fallout when investors choose to locate elsewhere." Trump has also inserted himself into the aircraft manufacturing industry, sending company’s stocks briefly dropping in the process. In December, he attacked Boeing on Twitter for what he alleged were excessive costs to build two different Air Force One planes. Trump also twice used Twitter to slam Lockheed Martin’s development of the F-35, saying he asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet “based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns” of the F-35.

Acura Precision concept vehicle after the debut at the 2016 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, Michigan. Published: 16:36 January 5, 2017 AFP   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE CHICAGO: The automotive world descends on Detroit this weekend for the annual auto show, which will highlight rapidly-evolving technology, but comes amid an uncertain climate following Donald Trump’s public tussles with US car makers. The 29th edition of the show, held in the American car capital, will showcase the increasingly prominent role of digital and electric advances, starting with its unofficial kickoff on Sunday, when Google will showcase a self-driving car partnership with Chrysler. While the show will be looking to the future, before the show’s public opening on January 14 many industry insiders likely will be focused on the present, notably the increased uncertainty from an incoming Trump administration. The president-elect has shown a willingness to apply pressure, especially via Twitter, on US manufacturers like Boeing, Carrier, Lockheed, GM and Ford to criticise corporate strategies, especially those involving investment and employment outside the United States. He has vowed to preserve American jobs or bring them back, threatened to impose tariffs on American goods made in Mexico and China, and tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. NAFTA and the US economy “We’ve never experienced anything quite like this,” said Alan Deardorff, a professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on international trade policy. Trade deals take years to have an effect as economies adjust, he said, so it is unclear what would happen to the US car industry should those deals be abruptly cancelled or changed. “We’ve never gone in this direction, not in recent history,” he said. But he warned one likely outcome is an increase in the car prices, making them less competitive in a global economy. Matt DeLorenzo, who tracks the auto industry for Kelley Blue Book, said US carmakers “will have to reassess their whole Mexico strategy and NAFTA.” An early sign of that reassessment came in dramatic fashion Tuesday when Ford appeared to capitulate to months of Trump’s criticism by scrapping plans to build a $1.6 billion (Dh5.8 billion) plant in Mexico. Instead it will use $700 million of those funds to expand a Michigan plant, creating 700 new jobs. “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that [Trump] has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the US,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said. Ford has been investing in high-tech, electric vehicle development, and beefing up higher-skilled American manufacturing can help better accomplish that goal, while its cheaper, less technology-laden car models are produced in Mexico. Trump also targeted GM in a tweet Tuesday, threatening to impose a tariff on the car giant’s Mexican-made Chevrolet Cruze cars. GM responded quickly, emphasising that the vast majority of its US-sold Cruze vehicles are made in Ohio. Despite the rhetoric, the worst fears of what a Trump administration might do in 2017 are unlikely to come to pass, said Christopher Wilson, who studies US-Mexico policy at the Wilson Centre, a Washington think tank. “The incoming administration is coming to terms with the reality” of the cross-border car manufacturing process, Wilson said. He warned that there may be other efforts undertaken to address negative effects from globalisation, including new tax policies and a renegotiation of NAFTA. “Anything that puts NAFTA at risk, puts the US economy at risk,” he said. Full automation? Not yet With those high stakes in play, the auto industry will open the Detroit auto show that this year focuses on autonomous car technologies, amid the usual array of vehicle debuts and demonstrations. The bulk of the show’s more than 300 exhibitors are start-ups boasting new technologies for connected and self-driving cars. Major manufacturers also are in the game. Volkswagen, seeking to turn the page from the diesel emissions scandal that led to a 7.6 per cent sales tumble in 2016, plans to unveil an electric, autonomous concept car. Google’s self-driving car subsidiary Waymo will showcase a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with self-driving technology. “The race has accelerated in the last 12 months between car groups, Silicon Valley giants and consumer electronics groups to be the first in market” with an autonomous car, said Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. Despite that onslaught, analysts say autonomous technology is currently in the early stages, in which human intervention is still required. “Full automation is the ultimate goal, but at the moment, no company has fully autonomous vehicles in production,” Jefferies & Co tech analyst Brian Fitzgerald said. Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst with AutoTrader, said part of the challenge is overcoming hesitant consumer sentiment, which has been evolving from suspicious to cautious. “There’s going to be a lot of experimentation ... in terms of how do we make autonomous available to consumers,” Krebs said. Highly-skilled workforce An AutoTrader annual survey of consumer sentiment found shifting attitudes. After initially considering autonomous technologies too dangerous, consumers were becoming more accepting, Krebs said. “Consumers want more and more driver assist technology,” she said, “and they are warming up to the idea of autonomous, fully self-driving” cars. The production of these technology-packed cars will require a highly-skilled workforce. Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute said that is an opportunity for American manufacturing to catch up, should policymakers in the Trump administration take steps to invest in labour force training and other services for displaced workers. “They’re going to have to do more than renegotiate NAFTA,” to bring manufacturing jobs back at a large scale, Scott said.

News Business Business Comment Insurers, not lawyers, are the bad guys when it comes to whiplash Consultations close tomorrow on reforms that will deny justice to thousands of innocent motorists caught up in accidents that are no fault of their own James Moore @JimMooreJourno Thursday 5 January 2017 13:20 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Careful motorists will suffer through insurers pushing a whiplash crackdown Getty Whiplash, eh. It’s all a big con, pushed by ambulance chasing lawyers at the expense of innocent motorists who pay higher insurance premiums as a result.  Well that’s at least what the insurance industry would have you believe. The reality, as I can testify having been a victim of road accidents, is rather different.  Accidents are hideous things. Whiplash hurts like hell. It can require physiotherapy to put right. It can sometimes require a lot more than that.  Read more Insurers, tax, whiplash victims, and how to hit back Insurers mislead public with £40 car insurance whiplash saving claim This Ukip official thinks the Taliban are running a whiplash insurance When it is caused by someone else, you should be compensated. It’s a simple matter of justice. But insurance companies aren’t too keen on justice. What’s justice when set against the interest of the shareholders and bonus driven executives? The industry has pumped time, effort and money into a campaign, led by the Association of British Insurers, that has pushed for legal reforms that would deny compensation and legal advice to whiplash victims. It has put forward the dubious argument of an “epidemic” of false whiplash claims while slyly neglecting to mention that insurers could fight the dubious ones but often fail to do so. Far more preferable to get the Government to eliminate the problem for them.  To help garner support, the industry has claimed that a package of reforms that the Ministry of Justice has put on the table  will save the average motorist £40 on premiums.  So here’s a question, if that looks good to you. Why is an industry not known for its altruism putting so much effort into supposedly saving its customers money?  Could it be that the reforms won’t so much save motorists money as they will fatten the industry’s profit margins? Could that possibly be a rather better explanation for the industry’s keen interest in shafting the genuine victims of road accidents in the process of dealing with an “epidemic” that there is little in the way of hard evidence for.   Read more Insurers playing cynical game over whiplash as Government mulls reform Government consultations close tomorrow on the reforms. They would see pay outs capped at £400. Under the proposals people who have been the victims of accidents that are no fault of their own will also face the added stress of going through the smalls claims court for any claim worth less than £5,000. Claims which won't just involve whiplash but a lot of other injuries besides.  There will be no lawyer available unless you pay for one, and (as I can again testify) a lawyer is your best friend in the event of an accident when even your own insurer might not prove to be terribly helpful. As for the significant number of victims who develop serious problems through “low value” accidents? Tough.  Far from helping the ordinary motorist what these reforms serve to do is to kick the careful driver at the expense of both the bad ones and their greedy insurers.  By the way, there are no plans for any independent oversight of the industry’s promise to pass on that alleged £40 saving.

In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent.

News Business Business News Google faces US government contract ban unless it reveals how much employees get paid Labour Department says the demand is designed to ensure company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race Michael Liedtke Thursday 5 January 2017 12:35 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The US Labour Department is trying to bar Google from doing business with the federal government unless the internet company turns over confidential information about thousands of its employees. The potential banishment is being sought in a Labour Department lawsuit filed Wednesday with the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The complaint alleges that Google has repeatedly refused to provide the Labour Department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure the company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race. Read more Google cut £2.9bn off its 2015 tax bill using 'Dutch Sandwich' trick The review of how Google pays the thousands of workers at its Mountain View, California, headquarters is allowed under decades-old laws regulating US government contractors. Google has struck a series of deals with various federal government agencies during the past decade, including a digital advertising agreement cited by the Labour Department that has generated more than $600,000 for the company since June 2014, according to the complaint. That amount is a pittance for Google, whose revenue has surpassed $130bn during the same span. If Google doesn't comply with all its demands, the Labour Department wants a legal order that would void all of the company's current federal government contracts and block future deals. Read more Google publishes eight secret FBI requests Google results claim that the Holocaust didn't happen Google employees confess what they hated most about working at Google In a statement, Google said it has provided hundreds of thousands of records in an attempt to comply with the Labour Department's requests, but has rebuffed some of the agency's demands as "overbroad" and an invasion of employee privacy. Like most other big technology companies, Google for the past few years has been posting breakdowns of its workforce that show most of its computer programmers and other high-paid employees in technical jobs are white and Asian men. The disclosures have become a source of embarrassment for Google and its technology industry peers, who have repeatedly acknowledged they need to do more to hire women, blacks and Hispanics. "We're very committed to our affirmative action obligations, and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues," Google reiterated in its response to the Labour Department's lawsuit.

Putting the details of an average family into NatWest’s mortgage calculator suggests otherwise James Moore @JimMooreJourno Thursday 5 January 2017 09:57 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Are these new Persimmon homes as ‘very affordable’ as the company says they are Rex “Buying a new-build home remains a compelling choice supported by competitive mortgage offers which continue to make a new home purchase very affordable.” So said Persimmon Homes, on the back of its latest trading statement. An update that made the company the belle of the stock market ball. Revenues for 2016 were 8 per cent higher than in 2015 and the group completed 559 extra sales. Happy days for its investors.  But let’s take a closer look at that quote. Is an average Persimmon home really “very affordable”? Read more Persimmon reports soaring profits and ‘robust’ demand despite Brexit Persimmon boss warns politics 'getting in the way' of housebuilders Persimmon in call for green belt shake-up Now, the company said that its average selling price increased by 4 per cent to £206,700 in 2016. To put that in perspective, the median average British wage, which has been increasing at something more like 2 per cent per annum, stands at £28,200. To find out whether Persimmon’s average home is indeed very affordable to an average family (if there is such a thing) I created one of my own. The Smiths have £500 each on their credit cards (after Christmas) and they spend £100 a month on loan repayments. That makes their level of debt rather modest by British standards.   John Smith works full time earning £28,200. Jane Smith works two and a half days a week and makes half that on a pro rata basis. I haven’t factored in any child care costs because we’ll assume relatives help out.  Between them, they’ve scrimped and saved enough for a 10 per cent deposit which comes to £20,670. Feeding those details into NatWest’s handy mortgage calculator, I was told that they could borrow a maximum of £169,200. If Jenny Smith were to work three days a week, earning £16,920, that gets us to £180,400. That’s still just under £6,000 below what it would take to make Persimmon’s average home barely, and not very, affordable.  It looks like Jane Smith will either have to take on more hours, or the family will have to save a bit more and hope that their savings catch up with the rise in average house prices. Perhaps they’ll get lucky and find a lender willing risk the wrath of its regulators to play ball with them. I’m sure Persimmon will be only too happy to point them in the right direction.  Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

It flies the fanciest product on the biggest planes on the longest routes. There might not be much more room to soar Dubai International runs at full speed 24 hours a day to help Emirates serve a network that spans from Buenos Aires to Christchurch, New Zealand. Photographer: Greg White for Bloomberg Businessweek by Matthew Campbell @MattCampbel More stories by Matthew Campbell January 5, 2017, 12:01 AM EST From Subscribe Reprints In their fifth week of training, women hired as flight attendants at Emirates Airline spend a day in Dubai with Pamela Mizzi. A makeup artist from Malta who spent 12 years in the sky herself, Mizzi greets the students in a windowless instruction space about 20 feet across, lined on three sides by mirrors divided into vanities by bright roundels of light, like an old-timey dressing room. Her job is to teach the trainees how Emirates expects them to look. Female cabin crew, referred to invariably as “girls,” are to tie their hair back in tight buns, preferably secured by a scrunchie in Emirates-brand red. For makeup, a seven-step process is recommended, starting with foundation and concealer, then moving on to lipstick, also in preauthorized shades of crimson. At the back of Mizzi’s classroom are two display racks of Emirates-approved emollients for “body shaping,” “firming,” “wrinkle control,” and “luminosity.” “We have standards in regards to nail care,” Mizzi says. The same is true for weight. If a crew member looks too heavy, his or her superiors are to report their suspicions to a central fitness and nutrition department. “And they follow up,” she says. Little escapes scrutiny. By the time crew members reach Mizzi’s classroom, they have moved into Emirates-managed apartments with Emirates-imposed curfews, travel to work in Emirates-branded minibuses, and see Emirates-employed doctors at in-house Emirates clinics. The airline, which is based in Dubai and owned by its government, has become the world’s largest long-haul carrier by never relaxing its grip—on employees, on airplane manufacturers, or on its own ambitions. Emirates recently configured a plane to seat 615 passengers, a record, and flies the world’s most epic nonstop route, an 8,824-mile arc from Dubai to Auckland. Emirates is essentially the only buyer of the largest commercial airliner, the Airbus A380, which it gilds with stand-up cocktail bars and in-flight showers. For every flight departing Dubai, as cabin crew head to their airplanes, the last room they traverse is a hall with mirrors on one side and windows to the tarmac on the other. The space allows workers to inspect themselves for perfection against a backdrop of government-owned taxiways thick with Emirates jets. That’s the airline, in one image: glamour and ambition in a framework of absolute control. Since 1985, Emirates has grown from a two-plane operation at a desert airstrip into a force whose every movement rumbles through global aviation. The airline’s growth is inseparable from that of Dubai, with both straining the laws of financial and physical gravity. The company’s chairman is Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the uncle of Dubai’s absolute monarch. He also runs the airport authority, the aviation regulator, and the city’s largest bank, should Emirates ever need a loan. Out in the desert, a half-hour drive from the coast’s skyscrapers and malls, the government is building a $32 billion, five-runway megahub precisely to Emirates’ specifications. Its ambitions are consonant with its name: Dubai World Central. The project will have a capacity of 220 million passengers per year, four times the number that New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport serves today. Two-thirds of humanity lives within the radius of an eight-hour flight. Among industry veterans, the airline’s rise inspires a respectful awe. “Emirates is unprecedented,” says Tony Tyler, a former chief executive officer of Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific. “There’s never been anything as huge.” Flight attendant trainees are shown how to get the Emirates-compliant look. Photographer: Greg White for Bloomberg Businessweek Yet as Emirates dictates new standards of technology, luxury, and range, it’s finding that more and more is beyond its mastery. Conceived as a titanic bet on the growth of what development economists call the Global South—the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, and Latin America—the airline is at risk if those emerging markets don’t, in fact, emerge. Emirates in May reported its first-ever annual revenue decline and is cutting some of its plans for growth amid slackening demand from sub-Saharan Africa, Turkey, and Brazil. The slump has industry analysts wondering how Emirates will fill the staggering number of planes it has on order. The company has agreed to buy 50 A380s and 174 Boeing 777s, adding to the 92 and 148, respectively, it currently flies. By comparison, British Airways operates 12 A380s, and American Airlines, Delta, and United have zero. The bigger threat may lie in the U.S., the world’s most lucrative travel market, where Emirates has been expanding aggressively. It flies to 11 cities, including Orlando, Boston, Seattle, and Dallas. Led by Delta, the U.S. Big Three are intensifying a lobbying campaign against Emirates and its smaller Persian Gulf rivals, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, collectively the ME3, seeking to curtail their access to American airports unless “unfair subsidies” are eliminated. Their argument, that deep-pocketed foreigners are threatening American jobs by flooding the market with subsidized capacity, was once seen in business circles as a long shot—but it happens to resonate precisely with President-elect Donald Trump’s stated view of the world. Similar efforts are afoot in Europe. Those challenges may make the world less hospitable than ever to a company whose marketing projects a sunny globalism. With Trump and his ilk ascendant, one Emirates ad sums up a corporate ethos that feels increasingly at odds with the times: “Tomorrow thinks borders are so yesterday.” Supplies of plane parts for maintenance of Emirates aircraft. Photographer: Greg White for Bloomberg Businessweek In 1984, Dubai was a backwater, one of the seven city-states that made up the fledgling United Arab Emirates, when its ruler, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al-Maktoum, and his son Mohammed decided to start an airline. With $10 million in seed capital and a couple of jets leased from Pakistan, Emirates was created a year later under the leadership of a pair of British expats, Maurice Flanagan and Tim Clark, initially serving regional destinations before making its first flights to London in 1987. Born in 1912, Rashid was fond of saying that while his father rode a camel, he drove a luxury Mercedes and his son drove a playboy’s Land Rover—but his great-grandson would be back on a camel unless Dubai, never as oil-rich as neighboring Abu Dhabi, found other sources of income. His vision was to turn the city into an entrepôt for the Middle East, an orderly hub for business and tourism—like Singapore, but drier (in every sense). Emerging from a rural society with a tiny native population, the face of this city would by necessity be foreign: Bangladeshis to build the skyscrapers, Filipinos to staff the restaurants, and Brits to run the management consulting firms. Wealthy Iranians, Egyptians, Saudis, and Indians would fill the condominiums and buy the yachts, using Dubai as neutral ground on which to play, work, and cut deals. The sheikhdom pioneered a model of the state as highly leveraged private equity firm, developing and owning ports, shopping malls, hotels, and, most important, a top-notch airline to bring the world to its door. Included in the new issue of Bloomberg Businessweek, Jan. 9-Jan. 15, 2017. Subscribe now. Courtesy Emirates While Emirates is adamant that it never received subsidies after its startup grant, there’s no question it’s operated in an environment that drives Western airlines mad with envy. For starters, Dubai won the geographic lottery. From a fuel and flight-time perspective, the Persian Gulf is the most efficient place on the planet to connect Europe with Southeast Asia and Australia, and the U.S. with India. Strikes and protests aren't an issue—unions are banned, and rights to free speech and assembly are severely limited. Corporate and income taxes are nil. And then there are the advantages of being the favored corporation of an absolute ruler whose word is literally law. Unlike Heathrow Airport and Los Angeles International, where the rights of nearby citizens to sleep without jet noise must be respected, Dubai International Airport runs at full speed 24 hours a day, allowing Emirates to optimize connection times for a network that spans from Buenos Aires to Christchurch, New Zealand. Keeping passengers coming back, not short-term cost containment, is the highest value. “We have never equated our investment into a dollar return,” Chief Operations Officer Adel Ahmad al-Redha, one of the airline’s most senior Emiratis, says over tiny glasses of sweet tea in his office at company headquarters, adjacent to the airport. “His Highness has always told us, ‘Build the right product.’ That’s the priority.” Sheikh Mohammed, who became Dubai’s ruler in 2006, is sometimes referred to by Emirates executives as simply “the shareholder,” emphasized with a brief upward glance. The ruling sheikhs are never far away. Partway through an interview with al-Redha, an assistant silently enters to place a yellow Post-it in his field of vision: “HH meeting at 10 a.m.” A few minutes later, al-Redha excuses himself. In a replica cabin, crews train to serve in first class. Photographer: Greg White for Bloomberg Businessweek Such proximity to the levers of power has allowed Emirates to play hardball with opponents. In 2010, Canada rebuffed requests from the U.A.E. to allow Emirates and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad more landing rights in Toronto. The U.A.E. raged, abruptly closing its airspace to Canada’s defense minister while he was in midflight, which forced a diversion, and evicting Canadian troops from a Dubai base they were using to support combat in Afghanistan. Canadian visitors to the U.A.E. were slapped with visa requirements, including fees of as much as C$1,000 ($754), though the gambit backfired. Then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper told his ministers he wouldn’t allow soldiers to be used as a bargaining chip. Emirates’ landing rights still haven’t been increased. But almost everywhere else, the airline is flying at astonishing capacity. Nine Emirates A380s land in London every day, along with five in Bangkok and four at JFK. In South Africa, Johannesburg gets four daily 777s, Cape Town three, and Durban one. Daily flights to those three cities by U.S. carriers number one, zero, and zero. At Emirates headquarters, the wall to the left of Clark’s desk is covered by a world map about 8 feet high, its projection shifted a couple of turns from the orientation most Americans are used to. The result is to put the Persian Gulf in the center. “Lloyd Blankfein has sat in that chair and said, ‘I want that map on my wall,’ ” Clark says. (The Goldman Sachs CEO declined to comment.) To the right of Clark’s desk is a window with a commanding ninth-floor view of Emirates Terminal 3, a trio of silver, sausage-shaped concourses that collectively make up the world’s largest airport terminal. Emirates President Clark Courtesy Emirates Clark, 67, has spent more than 30 years at Emirates, taking on the role of president (the company’s equivalent of CEO) in 2003. After a peripatetic childhood, he got his start in the airline industry as a check-in agent for long-forgotten British Caledonian Airways. As one of Emirates’ first employees, he never experienced the cycles of contraction and retrenchment that have defined the careers of his contemporaries at Western carriers. He’s Emirates’ intellectual godfather, spokesman-in-chief, and enforcer, prone to gazing out over the airfield with binoculars and upbraiding subordinates for lapses. One executive tells of an occasion, years ago, when he was excitedly demonstrating a new procedure for washing airplanes. After listening politely, Clark licked his index finger and rubbed it, hard, on what appeared to be a gleaming fuselage. The digit came away covered in grime. The procedure was duly overhauled. Even the model airplanes that crowd Clark’s office are subject to his inspection. At one point during an interview, he stops to fret that the landing gear has fallen off a football-size plastic A380. Clark’s tenure has been defined by bold gestures, and he relishes recounting occasions when a seemingly doomed gamble went his way. He’s claimed credit for silencing naysayers who told him that reviving the Jet Age concept of an onboard bar, in Emirates’ case on the upper deck of the A380, would be an expensive folly that no passenger would bother using. (They very much do.) The same goes for the airborne showers in first class, requiring planes to take off with 2.2 metric tons of water, which Clark has said he had to “work conspiratorially” behind the backs of skeptical Airbus executives to develop. Since Clark took over, Emirates has several times set aircraft order records, culminating in a 2013 deal worth $99 billion at list prices. But apart from picking up two jets destined for a Japanese budget carrier that went bust, Emirates hasn’t bought a single plane since. With most viable routes already heavily served, the company has been forced to go farther afield to keep growing, pushing into ultralong-haul flights to the likes of Panama. Clark’s current mood is cautious, verging on somber: 2016 was “not a good year,” he says, and “I think ’17 could be even flatter, slightly worse.” Oil executives and bankers aren’t buying premium tickets like they used to; demand is plunging in sub-Saharan Africa; Syria, Libya, Tunisia, and, to a certain extent, even Turkey have fallen off the tourist map. These days, Emirates is as likely to reduce luxury as ramp it up. Some A380s are being flown without first class, in favor of more economy seats, and in September, Clark mused about introducing budget-carrier-style bag fees. In the airline’s last earnings announcement, in which fiscal first-half profit fell almost two-thirds, Sheikh Ahmed warned that “the bleak global economic outlook appears to be the new norm.” More broadly, Clark concedes that Emirates’ emergence as a boundary-pushing titan of global aviation was an outcome of an era that may now be at an end. “It is true that we are a product of the multilateralism, the liberalization of trade,” he says in his office, the lazy ballet of taxiing aircraft visible on the tarmac just over his left shoulder. On his desk, he’s kept a collection of British newspapers from June 24, the day after U.K. voters rejected the liberal order by voting to leave the European Union. “But are we going back to the ’30s? No, no, no. The man, the woman in the street has been exposed to the good things, irrespective of faith, creed, gender, nationality, sexuality, it doesn’t make any difference. Everybody’s out there,” he says. “They can see the world is open to them. And I’m hoping that kind of sense will prevail. Maybe I’m just being a little bit naive, overoptimistic.” He spoke on Oct. 26, 13 days before Trump’s election. Will It Be a ‘Borderless World’ for Emirates Under Trump? If there’s anywhere that will test Clark’s brand of optimism, it will be President Trump’s Washington. Generalized distrust of foreigners, particularly Muslim ones, and a determination to reopen long-settled trade deals were among the only common threads in his erratic campaign. The so-called Open Skies agreements that allow unlimited flights between the U.S. and the Persian Gulf present a rare confluence of Trump targets, giving new energy to a lobbying group formed in 2015 by Delta, American, and United, along with several industry unions, called the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies. The group claims the ME3 carriers have collectively received at least $42 billion in direct and indirect subsidies since 2004 and are twisting Open Skies deals to dump into the American market excessive capacity that wouldn’t be possible without government help. It argues that the trio’s growth is out of all proportion to the size of their home markets—a population smaller than Ohio’s, in the case of the U.A.E.—and can only be the result of unfair advantages. In Emirates’ case, the partnership pegs the 2004-14 subsidy figure at $6.8 billion, including $2.4 billion in fuel-hedging losses assumed by the Dubai government and $2.3 billion in subsidized airport charges. An additional $1.9 billion is the result, it says, of a “union ban resulting in below-market labor costs” and further unquantifiable benefits accrued from “exemption from competition laws” and the “absence of independent regulatory oversight.” Emirates disputes all of these figures and says U.S. airlines have received ample advantages of their own, notably via Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that shielded them from creditors during restructuring efforts. As it also points out, U.S. carriers barely fly to India, Africa, or the Middle East, the main destinations to which it’s ferrying American passengers. The partnership’s stated goal is to persuade Washington to force the governments of the U.A.E. and Qatar to end the purported subsidies as the price for continued unrestricted access to the U.S. The debate has had some nasty moments. In a 2015 CNN interview, Delta’s then-CEO, Richard Anderson, noted that “terrorists from the Arabian Peninsula” were responsible for the U.S. airline industry’s post-Sept. 11 meltdown, which he called “a great irony.” (Anderson later apologized.) Delta also pulled its sponsorship of Atlanta’s historic Fox Theatre after Qatar Airways held an event there. “When you look at the fact that no U.S. carrier flies to the Gulf region and the ME3 have 30 flights a day to the U.S., how is that possible if not at the expense of U.S. jobs?” asks Ed Bastian, Delta’s current CEO. Gulf carrier flights that operate directly from Europe to the U.S., allowed under so-called fifth freedom rights, are a particular concern. While Emirates does so on just one route (Milan-New York), a significant expansion would threaten U.S. airlines’ trans-Atlantic cash cow. An A380 simulator beside a life-raft training pool. Photographer: Greg White for Bloomberg Businessweek The partnership’s lobbying of the Obama administration was inconclusive, in part because not all U.S. players are on board. JetBlue Airways and Alaska Airlines, both of which code-share with Emirates, have said they prefer the status quo. Boeing has stayed neutral; Emirates is its largest customer, and Qatar and Etihad aren’t far behind. Bastian and other allies of the group, though, believe the new president will have their back. Trump “has expressed great care for American jobs and the impact of foreign subsidies on U.S. workers,” he says. “He has been very clear that free trade shouldn’t be at the expense of American jobs.” Adds Tim Canoll, the head of the Air Line Pilots Association, a partnership-supporting union: “The political stars are aligning.” The group has already begun discussions with Trump’s transition team, and it plans to increase its direct lobbying efforts as soon as cabinet and policy adviser positions are filled. If they’re successful, Emirates’ critics in Europe, particularly Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, are likely to revive their own attempts to throttle its expansion on that continent. For now access remains open, and Emirates is pushing deeper into the U.S. In December it began daily flights to, of all places, Fort Lauderdale. Clark says U.S. airports are eager to bring Emirates to their terminals despite any controversy; Denver, whose mayor recently led a delegation to meet with Emirates in Dubai, may be next. The partnership claims most ME3 flights to the U.S. lose money and are intended to crush competition by thronging the market with cheap seats. The experience of Australia’s Qantas Airways provides a cautionary tale. After trying and failing to compete with Gulf airlines on routes to Europe, losing hundreds of millions of dollars, Qantas in 2012 gave up and entered a comprehensive alliance with Clark. Most of its Europe-bound passengers are now booked on Emirates flights via Dubai. Still, airline watchers aren’t so sure about the U.S. partnership’s claims. Demand for flights to markets like India and Africa has grown significantly in the U.S., even in second-rung cities. “They’re not eating someone’s lunch,” John Strickland, a U.K. aviation consultant, says of Emirates. “They’ve created new lunch.” An Emirates A380 in for maintenance in Dubai. Photographer: Greg White for Bloomberg Businessweek Emirates and its U.S. antagonists agree on one thing: The vast majority of Emirates’ passengers aren’t going to Dubai. Three in five fliers are connecting to somewhere else, and Dubai’s airport has been designed as a massive machine to facilitate their movements, a polished-stone fulcrum between Dar es Salaam and Guangzhou, Dallas and Dhaka. The bulk of flights arrive and depart in three “waves”: one from 2 to 4:30 a.m., another from 7 to 11 a.m., and a third from 1:30 to 4 p.m. Between those rushes the airport is eerily quiet, even in the operations center, the size of a hockey rink, where Emirates manages the flights. A giant central screen shows the location of every Emirates plane in the air. A thick, curved line of blue avatars is headed to and from Western Europe; a smaller cluster moves between Dubai and Africa; another inches toward East Asia. Far to the north, flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco are headed straight over the top of the world. To spend time on Planet Emirates is to be bombarded with reminders of the awesome scale of its operations, often proffered by staff who’ve worked there since the early days and remain mildly bewildered by what the company has become. The airline operates an industrial-size wine cellar in Burgundy, with 3.75 million bottles aging at any given time. Its flight kitchens are the largest in the world and make almost everything from scratch, from hummus to hamburgers, as well as 25,000 muffins a day. They incorporate what Emirates says is the world’s largest dishwashing operation, using 17 colossal machines to clean 3.5 million items daily. In case of a breakdown, 200,000 sets of cutlery are kept in reserve. Still, the strains of growth are apparent. The airport, which has only two runways and is hemmed in by development, can become severely congested at peak times, and the move to Dubai World Central is probably a decade away. On Skytrax, which aggregates customer reviews of airlines, Emirates gets an average of 6 out of 10 as fliers complain about inconsistent service across its sprawling network, a score lower than that of budget carrier EasyJet. (Skytrax nonetheless named Emirates its top airline of 2016, an award that draws on separate data.) Meanwhile, online forums for pilots and cabin crew are crowded with complaints from Emirates staff about what they say are excessive hours and inflexible policies. For example, female cabin crew who’ve been employed less than three years must leave their jobs if they become pregnant. Because virtually none are locals and Emirates issues their visas, that generally means leaving Dubai. After three years of employee service, maternity leave is available but largely unpaid, and it depends on the mother being married; giving birth out of wedlock is a crime in the U.A.E. Staff also complain about curfews and visitor restrictions in Emirates-administered housing, which human resources chief Abdulaziz al-Ali says are necessary because “we know a little more about this country than foreigners who come.” He insists that employees are happy—so much so, in fact, that “there is no reason for them to become unionized.” Cold starters are prepared for first-class flights. Photographer: Greg White for Bloomberg Businessweek Staff and passengers alike do have other options. Etihad and Qatar Airways are using the same geographic advantages to expand, cloning the “superconnector” model pioneered in Dubai. In Istanbul, an airport that may be as large as Dubai World Central is under construction and could eventually allow Turkish Airlines to become a global challenger. Then again, the superconnector model itself might fall apart. The proliferation of lighter, fuel-efficient jets such as the Boeing 787 are making long-haul routes between smaller cities economical, reducing the role for megahubs of all stripes. In the 70-odd years of large-scale commercial aviation, no airline has managed to stay on top for long. Pan Am was the last word in intercontinental glamour in its day, and its day came to an end. It’s a problem that Clark is clearly wrestling with as he contemplates his own retreat from the stage. He hasn’t yet set a date for his retirement but acknowledges it isn’t far off. No successor has been chosen yet. “If I was in my 40s, I’d make bloody sure that in 20 years Emirates was right there and never came down a notch. I’dkeep. Up. The pressure,” Clark says, pausing for emphasis. “Adapting and changing to do everything we need to do to align ourselves not with what the establishment requires us to do, but what the man in the street requires us to do … that’ll keep us there. If that doesn’t happen, they’ll be running around with lots of empty airplanes.” As Clark speaks, in the middle distance a crew of workmen moves gingerly across the roof of Terminal 3, washing away its accumulated coating of blown sand to reveal a skin of shining chrome. The procedure has to be repeated constantly. If it weren’t, the airport would eventually sink back beneath the dunes. —With Deena Kamel     Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Thousands of commercial aircraft fly passengers and goods to tens of thousands of destinations throughout the world every day. For the commercial aircraft carrying passengers and cargo in very harsh environments, the inspection and maintenance for safe operation are crucial. Periodic inspections of aircraft engines are mandatory by both manufacturers and regulatory authorities. How do you inspect inside the engine? “An aircraft engine is a very complex machine. But manufacturers have provided certain areas within the engine that have access ports to facilitate visual inspection with endoscopes,” says Maurice Faber, Regional Managing Director of Olympus Corporation. Olympus is a world leader in aviation endoscopes and works closely with industry leaders such as Boeing and Airbus among others. Similar to endoscopy for people, these high technology thin flexible tubes are inserted into the access port of an engine. The tube usually has a couple of optical cables, each of which may have up 50,000 optical fibers. The cables carry light and cameras to see inside the engines. “However, because of the complexity of the engine, there still are various difficulties an inspector may face when attempting to conduct an engine inspection precisely and in a timely manner,” Faber points out. Three key challenges Commercial jets are equipped with turbofan engines, which vary in size from small turbines for regional jets to large turbines for larger, inter-continental airliners. Furthermore, there are many different parts to be inspected within each engine, such as turbine blades, compressor blades and the combustion chamber. It is important when conducting a smooth and accurate inspection, to choose the optimal endoscope and related accessories by engine type and engine part. “At Olympus, we use a single IPLEX videoscope that can cover various demands for aircraft engine inspections by just changing the optical adaptors,” Faber said. Another challenge is the laborious operation to rotate the engine shaft. Operators need to inspect hundreds of blades, which are located at several turbine/compressor stages and mounted on the shaft. To conduct the inspection, collaborative work is required where one operator manually rotates the shaft while another inspects the blade condition. This work not only requires an additional operator for the shaft rotation, but also tends to cause insufficient inspection of the turbine. The solution is to have an engine specific Turning Tools that can automatically rotate the shaft with high-pressure compressor/turbine blades at a preferred speed, enabling an inspector too accurately and thoroughly conduct both the shaft rotating and blade inspection operations without the need for a second person. The third challenge is the time-consuming inspection analysis and report generation Throughout the inspection, recording a large number of blade images is often the case for inspection analysis and report generation, but within this environment, images are very similar to each other and it is sometimes impossible to identify blade types during review. Thus, many operators experience difficulty and frustration when attempting to find and sort intended images from a large volume of very similar images. Olympus uses its Inspection Assist Software that enables an inspector to record images while categorizing them by inspected stage and putting diagnosis onto the images by way of standardized comment. After the inspection, the inspector/reporter can efficiently analyze the recorded images and immediately create a report, just by selecting desired images with one-click operation. The Japanese manufacturer of high-end optics and precision electronics is establishing its Middle East and Africa (MEA) headquarters to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The facility will incorporate a state of the art service and training centre for both support and knowledge transfer. From Dubai, the headquarters will cover 72 countries from across the South Africa to the Levant to Turkey to Gulf Arab countries and Iran. The move comes as the three major regional airlines – Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways – are poised to expand their fleet by almost 650 new planes. “If you include Turkish and Iran Air, the order book comes to a massive 1,058 passenger aircraft,” said Faber. “With the market growing, our local presence here will help support our customers with stronger support on a variety of fronts including faster response times for service and product backup,” said Faber.

Monday, January 16, 2017 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Technology  Detroit auto show comes amid uncertain Trump future January 5, 2017, Thursday The 29th edition of the Detroit auto show will showcase the increasingly prominent role of digital and electric advances. AFP File Photo CHICAGO: The automotive world descends on Detroit this weekend for the annual auto show, which will highlight rapidly-evolving technology, but comes amid an uncertain climate following Donald Trump’s public tussles with US car makers. The 29th edition of the show, held in the American car capital, will showcase the increasingly prominent role of digital and electric advances, starting with its unofficial kickoff on Sunday, when Google will showcase a self-driving car partnership with Chrysler. While the show will be looking to the future, prior to the show’s public opening on January 14 many industry insiders likely will be focused on the present, notably the increased uncertainty from an incoming Trump administration. The president-elect has shown a willingness to apply pressure, especially via Twitter, on US manufacturers like Boeing, Carrier, Lockheed, GM and Ford to criticize corporate strategies, especially those involving investment and employment outside the United States. He has vowed to preserve American jobs or bring them back, threatened to impose tariffs on American goods made in Mexico and China, and tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. – NAFTA and the US economy – “We’ve never experienced anything quite like this,” said Alan Deardorff, a professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on international trade policy. Trade deals take years to have an effect as economies adjust, he said, so it is unclear what would happen to the US car industry should those deals be abruptly canceled or changed. “We’ve never gone in this direction, not in recent history,” he said. But he warned one likely outcome is an increase in the car prices, making them less competitive in a global economy. Matt DeLorenzo, who tracks the auto industry for Kelley Blue Book, said US carmakers “will have to reassess their whole Mexico strategy and NAFTA.” An early sign of that reassessment came in dramatic fashion Tuesday when Ford appeared to capitulate to months of Trump’s criticism by scrapping plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Instead it will use $700 million of those funds to expand a Michigan plant, creating 700 new jobs. “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that (Trump) has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the US,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said. Ford has been investing in high-tech, electric vehicle development, and beefing up higher-skilled American manufacturing can help better accomplish that goal, while its cheaper, less technology-laden car models are produced in Mexico. Trump also targeted GM in a tweet Tuesday, threatening to impose a tariff on the car giant’s Mexican-made Chevrolet Cruze cars. GM responded quickly, emphasizing that the vast majority of its US-sold Cruze vehicles are made in Ohio. Despite the rhetoric, the worst fears of what a Trump administration might do in 2017 are unlikely to come to pass, said Christopher Wilson, who studies US-Mexico policy at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. “The incoming administration is coming to terms with the reality” of the cross-border car manufacturing process, Wilson said. He warned that there may be other efforts undertaken to address negative effects from globalization, including new tax policies and a renegotiation of NAFTA. “Anything that puts NAFTA at risk, puts the US economy at risk,” he said. – Full automation? Not yet – With those high stakes in play, the auto industry will open the Detroit auto show that this year focuses on autonomous car technologies, amid the usual array of vehicle debuts and demonstrations. The bulk of the show’s more than 300 exhibitors are start-ups boasting new technologies for connected and self-driving cars. Major manufacturers also are in the game. Volkswagen, seeking to turn the page from the diesel emissions scandal that led to a 7.6 percent sales tumble in 2016, plans to unveil an electric, autonomous concept car. Google’s self-driving car subsidiary Waymo will showcase a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with self-driving technology. “The race has accelerated in the last 12 months between car groups, Silicon Valley giants and consumer electronics groups to be the first in market” with an autonomous car, said Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. Despite that onslaught, analysts say autonomous technology is currently in the early stages, in which human intervention is still required. “Full automation is the ultimate goal, but at the moment, no company has fully autonomous vehicles in production,” Jefferies & Co. tech analyst Brian Fitzgerald said. Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst with AutoTrader, said part of the challenge is overcoming hesitant consumer sentiment, which has been evolving from suspicious to cautious. “There’s going to be a lot of experimentation … in terms of how do we make autonomous available to consumers,” Krebs said. An AutoTrader annual survey of consumer sentiment found shifting attitudes. After initially considering autonomous technologies too dangerous, consumers were becoming more accepting, Krebs said. “Consumers want more and more driver assist technology,” she said, “and they are warming up to the idea of autonomous, fully self-driving” cars. The production of these technology-packed cars will require a highly-skilled workforce. Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute said that is an opportunity for American manufacturing to catch up, should policymakers in the Trump administration take steps to invest in labor force training and other services for displaced workers. “They’re going to have to do more than renegotiate NAFTA,” to bring manufacturing jobs back at a large scale, Scott said. – AFP What do you think of this story?

GM responded quickly, emphasizing that the vast majority of its US-sold Cruze vehicles are made in Ohio. Despite the rhetoric, the worst fears of what a Trump administration might do in 2017 are unlikely to come to pass, said Christopher Wilson, who studies US-Mexico policy at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. "The incoming administration is coming to terms with the reality" of the cross-border car manufacturing process, Wilson said. He warned that there may be other efforts undertaken to address negative effects from globalization, including new tax policies and a renegotiation of NAFTA. "Anything that puts NAFTA at risk, puts the US economy at risk," he said. - Full automation? Not yet - With those high stakes in play, the auto industry will open the Detroit auto show that this year focuses on autonomous car technologies, amid the usual array of vehicle debuts and demonstrations. The bulk of the show's more than 300 exhibitors are start-ups boasting new technologies for connected and self-driving cars. Major manufacturers also are in the game. Volkswagen, seeking to turn the page from the diesel emissions scandal that led to a 7.6 percent sales tumble in 2016, plans to unveil an electric, autonomous concept car. Google's self-driving car subsidiary Waymo will showcase a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with self-driving technology. "The race has accelerated in the last 12 months between car groups, Silicon Valley giants and consumer electronics groups to be the first in market" with an autonomous car, said Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. Despite that onslaught, analysts say autonomous technology is currently in the early stages, in which human intervention is still required. "Full automation is the ultimate goal, but at the moment, no company has fully autonomous vehicles in production," Jefferies & Co. tech analyst Brian Fitzgerald said. Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst with AutoTrader, said part of the challenge is overcoming hesitant consumer sentiment, which has been evolving from suspicious to cautious. "There's going to be a lot of experimentation ... in terms of how do we make autonomous available to consumers," Krebs said. An AutoTrader annual survey of consumer sentiment found shifting attitudes. After initially considering autonomous technologies too dangerous, consumers were becoming more accepting, Krebs said. "Consumers want more and more driver assist technology," she said, "and they are warming up to the idea of autonomous, fully self-driving" cars. The production of these technology-packed cars will require a highly-skilled workforce. Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute said that is an opportunity for American manufacturing to catch up, should policymakers in the Trump administration take steps to invest in labor force training and other services for displaced workers. "They're going to have to do more than renegotiate NAFTA," to bring manufacturing jobs back at a large scale, Scott said.

The 29th edition of the show, held in the American car capital, will showcase the increasingly prominent role of digital and electric advances, starting with its unofficial kickoff on Sunday, when Google will showcase a self-driving car partnership with Chrysler. While the show will be looking to the future, prior to the show's public opening on January 14 many industry insiders likely will be focused on the present, notably the increased uncertainty from an incoming Trump administration. The 29th edition of the Detroit auto show will showcase the increasingly prominent role of digital and electric advances ©JEWEL SAMAD (AFP/File) The president-elect has shown a willingness to apply pressure, especially via Twitter, on US manufacturers like Boeing, Carrier, Lockheed, GM and Ford to criticize corporate strategies, especially those involving investment and employment outside the United States. He has vowed to preserve American jobs or bring them back, threatened to impose tariffs on American goods made in Mexico and China, and tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. - NAFTA and the US economy - "We've never experienced anything quite like this," said Alan Deardorff, a professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on international trade policy. Trade deals take years to have an effect as economies adjust, he said, so it is unclear what would happen to the US car industry should those deals be abruptly canceled or changed. "We've never gone in this direction, not in recent history," he said. But he warned one likely outcome is an increase in the car prices, making them less competitive in a global economy. Matt DeLorenzo, who tracks the auto industry for Kelley Blue Book, said US carmakers "will have to reassess their whole Mexico strategy and NAFTA." An early sign of that reassessment came in dramatic fashion Tuesday when Ford appeared to capitulate to months of Trump's criticism by scrapping plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. Instead it will use $700 million of those funds to expand a Michigan plant, creating 700 new jobs. "It's literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that (Trump) has been outlining and that's why we're making this decision to invest here in the US," Ford CEO Mark Fields said. Ford has been investing in high-tech, electric vehicle development, and beefing up higher-skilled American manufacturing can help better accomplish that goal, while its cheaper, less technology-laden car models are produced in Mexico. Trump also targeted GM in a tweet Tuesday, threatening to impose a tariff on the car giant's Mexican-made Chevrolet Cruze cars.

The 29th edition of the show, held in the American car capital, will showcase the increasingly prominent role of digital and electric advances, starting with its unofficial kickoff on Sunday, when Google will showcase a self-driving car partnership with Chrysler.  While the show will be looking to the future, prior to the show’s public opening on January 14 many industry insiders likely will be focused on the present, notably the increased uncertainty from an incoming Trump administration.  The president-elect has shown a willingness to apply pressure, especially via Twitter, on US manufacturers like Boeing, Carrier, Lockheed, GM and Ford to criticise corporate strategies, especially those involving investment and employment outside the United States. He has vowed to preserve American jobs or bring them back, threatened to impose tariffs on American goods made in Mexico and China, and tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.  Nafta and the US economy “We’ve never experienced anything quite like this,” said Alan Deardorff, a professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on international trade policy.  Trade deals take years to have an effect as economies adjust, he said, so it is unclear what would happen to the US car industry should those deals be abruptly canceled or changed.  “We’ve never gone in this direction, not in recent history,” he said. But he warned one likely outcome is an increase in the car prices, making them less competitive in a global economy.  Matt DeLorenzo, who tracks the auto industry for Kelley Blue Book, said US carmakers “will have to reassess their whole Mexico strategy and Nafta.” An early sign of that reassessment came in dramatic fashion Tuesday when Ford appeared to capitulate to months of Trump’s criticism by scrapping plans to build a US$1.6 billion (RM7.2 billion) plant in Mexico.  Instead it will use US$700 million of those funds to expand a Michigan plant, creating 700 new jobs.  “It’s literally a vote of confidence around some of the pro-growth policies that (Trump) has been outlining and that’s why we’re making this decision to invest here in the US,” Ford CEO Mark Fields said.  Ford has been investing in high-tech, electric vehicle development, and beefing up higher-skilled American manufacturing can help better accomplish that goal, while its cheaper, less technology-laden car models are produced in Mexico.   Trump also targeted GM in a tweet Tuesday, threatening to impose a tariff on the car giant’s Mexican-made Chevrolet Cruze cars. GM responded quickly, emphasizing that the vast majority of its US-sold Cruze vehicles are made in Ohio.  Despite the rhetoric, the worst fears of what a Trump administration might do in 2017 are unlikely to come to pass, said Christopher Wilson, who studies US-Mexico policy at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank.  “The incoming administration is coming to terms with the reality” of the cross-border car manufacturing process, Wilson said. He warned that there may be other efforts undertaken to address negative effects from globalization, including new tax policies and a renegotiation of Nafta.  “Anything that puts Nafta at risk, puts the US economy at risk,” he said.  Full automation? Not yet With those high stakes in play, the auto industry will open the Detroit auto show that this year focuses on autonomous car technologies, amid the usual array of vehicle debuts and demonstrations. The bulk of the show’s more than 300 exhibitors are start-ups boasting new technologies for connected and self-driving cars.  Major manufacturers also are in the game.  Volkswagen, seeking to turn the page from the diesel emissions scandal that led to a 7.6 per cent sales tumble in 2016, plans to unveil an electric, autonomous concept car.  Google’s self-driving car subsidiary Waymo will showcase a Chrysler Pacifica minivan outfitted with self-driving technology.  “The race has accelerated in the last 12 months between car groups, Silicon Valley giants and consumer electronics groups to be the first in market” with an  autonomous car, said Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book.  Despite that onslaught, analysts say autonomous technology is currently in the early stages, in which human intervention is still required.  “Full automation is the ultimate goal, but at the moment, no company has fully autonomous vehicles in production,” Jefferies & Co tech analyst Brian Fitzgerald said.  Michelle Krebs, an industry analyst with AutoTrader, said part of the challenge is overcoming hesitant consumer sentiment, which has been evolving from suspicious to cautious.  “There’s going to be a lot of experimentation ... in terms of how do we make autonomous available to consumers,” Krebs said.  An AutoTrader annual survey of consumer sentiment found shifting attitudes. After initially considering autonomous technologies too dangerous, consumers were becoming more accepting, Krebs said.  “Consumers want more and more driver assist technology,” she said, “and they are warming up to the idea of autonomous, fully self-driving” cars.  The production of these technology-packed cars will require a highly-skilled workforce.  Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute said that is an opportunity for American manufacturing to catch up, should policymakers in the Trump administration take steps to invest in labor force training and other services for displaced workers. “They’re going to have to do more than renegotiate Nafta,” to bring manufacturing jobs back at a large scale, Scott said. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Drive Channel Most Viewed Now Week In New York, ride-hailing drivers are slaves to the surge Daimler’s Zetsche shows off the new Mercedes E-Class (VIDEO) Perodua unveils new Perodua Axia with VVT-i engine In cars, do Americans care about looks?

Trump plans to deregulate through executive appointments, Cramer said. The President and his subordinates have a significant amount of discretion on how laws are enforced. Oklahoma Attorney General Greg Pruitt was nominated by the president-elect to run the Environmental Protection Agency. "If he gets approved, he could roll back years of regulations," the "Mad Money" host said. Additionally, Trump's tweets have turned out to be a buying opportunity for each stock targeted. United Technologies stock went to $108 after Trump highlighted it for moving jobs to Mexico. It now trades at $110. Boeing was at $154 and closed at $158 on Wednesday. Likewise, General Motors proved to be a buying opportunity after gaining 5 percent in a single session. Joshua Roberts | Reuters Donald Trump Cramer was astonished when the price of crude went down on Tuesday, but oil and gas stocks went up. The decoupling of oil and stocks was a move he hasn't seen in a very long time, and he says could be good news for the stock market, thanks to President-elect Donald Trump. "Don't let the analysts talk you out of oil stocks or natural gas stocks … This regime wants oil and gas companies to make more money, so I think they will," Cramer said. Dominion Resources is one of the largest players in the power generation space. The utility sector tends to be the bond market equivalent that investors swap out of as yield for bonds is expected to rise with each rate hike from the Federal Reserve. However, Cramer highlighted Dominion as a company with many additional businesses that could benefit from a Trump administration. He spoke with the company's chairman and CEO Tom Farrell, who explained that Dominion is different from its peers because of its large gas infrastructure business. "The gas infrastructure infrastructure will be almost half of the cash flow earnings stream of Dominion Resources, which makes it quite unique," Farrell said. Ken Cedeno | Corbis | Getty Images Oil field workers on a rig in Tioga, North Dakota. Given the incredible run that the stock market has had since the election, Cramer thinks it is time to find out if there are any warning signs that the market should be taking more seriously. The first flag to hit his radar was the Weekly Investors Intelligence survey of bullish and bearish newsletter writers. In its latest report, the number of bulls was at 60.2 percent, with only 18.4 percent bears and 21.4 percent anticipating a correction. "When everybody's bullish, it means there is no one left to buy. A healthy rally needs plenty of bears who can be persuaded to change their minds," Cramer explained. To find out if investors are getting complacent, Cramer spoke with Mark Sebastian, a technician and co-founder of OptionPit.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney. Sebastian is an expert when it comes to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the level of volatility that traders are expecting in the near future. However, while the latest Investors Intelligence survey was a red flag to Cramer, Sebastian's read on the VIX indicated that the market is poised to head higher. Based on his analysis, he anticipates that a major reversal will not occur without a largely negative catalyst. Another powerful theme in the market is the health and wellness trend. Shares of Weight Watchers spiked more than 20 percent on Wednesday after Oprah confirmed she has lost 42.5 pounds on the program. Likewise, shares of Mindbody rose 7 percent after announcing a new partnership with Google that will allow users to easily book fitness and wellness classes directly through Google search, Google Maps or a new website, Reserve with Google. Mindbody is the cloud-based provider of business management software tailored to the fitness industry. The company has gone from 1,000 subscribers in 2005 to more than 58,000 in its recent quarter, with 35 percent revenue growth, even as the company is not yet profitable. Cramer spoke with Mindbody's chairman and CEO Rick Stollmeyer, who explained that small to medium sized businesses (SMB) often have difficulty with scheduling and tracking customers and staff. "Our system can start with the small, single SMB location and scale effectively infinitely," Stollmeyer said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Advanced Micro Devices: "I don't think anyone knows something other than the fact that the company is doing much better than people think. It does have a kind of difficult agreement that may cause some profit taking because it has to share some profit. But I will tell you that AMD is back and I think it can still go higher." Merck: "Merck I think is a hold. I believe in the work that Ken Frazier [CEO] is doing and I would not sell the stock. Don't forget it also yields 3 percent."

Investigators with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the agency leading the hunt for the missing plane, revealed Wednesday in their weekly operational update that conditions late last month impacted the search — and could continue to pose problems going forward. "Weather has improved during the past week, although a cold front is moving across the search area today," the bureau wrote. "A ridge of high pressure will briefly dominate the search area on Thursday with another frontal passage expected on Friday." This weather could set back progress made by an autonomous underwater vehicle, or AUV, sweeping the floor of the Indian Ocean for evidence related to MH370. Over the past two weeks, the Fugro Equator's AUV has spent 23 hours on 10 missions, according to the bureau. These steps were the latest — and some of the last — in the search for MH370, a Boeing 777 that was presumed to have crashed after it mysteriously disappeared in March 2014. After a series of delays, the 120,000-square-kilometer, $145-million scan for debris from the plane was on scheduled to end this month. Related Stories Boeing To Lead New Search, Aviation Expert Claims Missing MH370 Plane Won't Be Found Near Search Area, Investigators Say But in December, officials collaborating with the bureau admitted in a report that they had "a high degree of confidence that the previously identified underwater area searched to date does not contain the missing aircraft." They identified another, 25,000-square-kilometer zone that "represents the next most likely area to contain the aircraft," the Guardian reported. However, whether the already lengthy search will continue past its January 2017 deadline remained unclear. Ministers from Malaysia, China and Australia agreed last summer not to keep up the hunt without new evidence, though recent reports alleged a private company like Boeing may take it over. Families of the 239 people who were on board MH370 when it vanished have also campaigned for an extension, last month even flying to Madagascar and Mauritius to look for debris themselves.   Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

The Palatine Township Elementary District 15 program provides nearly 300 students in need at three schools with enough groceries to feed themselves each weekend. A group of volunteers started the program at Kimball Hill School last winter. Supported by the school's Kids Hope mentors and a number of volunteers from Community Church of Rolling Meadows, the effort kicked off by sending groceries home with about 50 students each Friday afternoon. The Boeing grant will expand the number of students served to about 100. "And we could go even higher because the need is there," Kimball Hill Principal Tracey Wrobel said in a news release.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    As Donald Trump prepares to move into the White House, business leaders are neatly lining up talking points and leave-behinds, believing they are prepared to be heard in Washington after January 20. Think again. Ronald Reagan was the Great Communicator. Donald Trump will be the Great Disruptor. To be heard in Washington in 2017, business and leaders need to change to match the new president’s style and mission. What changed? Trump utterly disrupted politics, upending how Americans experience and receive information from a candidate, and thus from a new president. He used this strategy to endure a vicious pounding from Hillary and her unhappy band, pollsters, media, and fellow Republicans to win the greatest political upset since Truman defeated Dewey in 1948. He did this not by spending billions advertising on boring Sunday morning talk shows. Trump did this by bypassing mainstream media’s filter and directly engaging Americans through Twitter and other platforms to amplify his multiple interviews and pep rallies. Since his election, Trump has registered disruption internationally, infuriating communist leaders in China and totalitarianism thugs in Iran, who seem to have a lot to lose in a Trump administration. Most notably, Trump is using Twitter to communicate with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in front of the world, a contrast with the lackluster diplomacy of his predecessor. In business, Trump redefined what a president-elect can achieve by persuading United Technologies to keep more than 1,000 Carrier jobs in America, and Boeing and Lockheed to lower prices on defense contracts. Sprint announced it is bringing back 5,000 jobs to America. And on January 3, Ford cancelled its proposed $1.6 billion plant in Mexico, protecting 3,500 jobs in Michigan, adding $700 million in investments and 700 new jobs in America. Trump revealed that the precise tweet or viral video can move markets, jobs, contracts, legislation and millions of voters. Just after the new year, the House GOP revised course on an ethics bill creating a public firestorm capped by a Trump tweet. He has done all this — and not yet taken the oath of office. Change and disruption has only just begun. Based on many conversations and meetings with our corporate clients and trade associations, most have not yet accepted that this era will be as different and disruptive as the Jacksonian or New Deal eras. When corporate America addresses Washington, they do so through traditional channels of influence. None are adequate for the coming transformation. One channel is the voice of a CEO, a leader who can chat with POTUS, cabinet secretaries or senators, to seek support on taxes, trade, or regulation. More often, business speaks through trade associations. These large organizations — often housed in marbled palaces within a short cab ride of the Capitol — inspire "grass tops" messages to deluge politicians. Finally, there is the corporate lobbying-industrial complex armed with good arguments, data, endorsements, graphs, and promises of support for a politician’s broader agenda. None of these means are sufficient for imminent changes about to sweep Washington. Love Trump or hate him, business leaders must move beyond these traditional channels and adapt to the transforming political culture. They need to relearn how to speak, starting with the name of our country. The word “America” went out of fashion in the current administration, with corporations and lobbyists following suit, usually saying "the U.S.," which makes this country sound more like an institutional entity like the UN or the EU. One CEO in our past liked to boast about his globalist viewpoint. Though his company was based in New York — his brand was dotted across the American landscape — he proudly said to shareholders that his business "was in no sense an American company." He showed far less sensitivity in America than he did speaking in foreign nations. It is now time to speak again of "America" and what it stands for. Business must learn to communicate the way most Americans communicate, in short sentences and declarative English. Trump has used this skill in social media to disrupt traditional ways of moving voters, opinion and politicians. He has more than 40 million followers on social media, far more than twice the combined audiences of all the nightly news shows. And what do those news shows report? Whatever Trump tweets. Business leaders can also use social media more effectively, if they build friends and followers and speak in simple sentences about issues important to their audiences, not themselves. So in Trump’s America, when presented a stylistic choice between speaking Dayton or Davos, the default is always Dayton. And when the choice is between buying TV or ads in a failing newspaper, digital media usually wins. Now what should executives say about America? Start with "America First." In the Reagan era, the theme was national competitiveness. That’s the right idea, but it needs to be "Trumpcated" to what matters most — jobs. Executives must stress their policies and ideas that will create jobs, in America. And while you’re crafting talking points for important Washington meetings, or that upcoming speech, emphasize ways your company or trade association can retain, attract and create jobs — in America. Think in terms of rising incomes for families and communities, in America. This may not be popular at the next Council on Foreign Relations meeting. Furthermore, be careful speaking to Argentines who also think they are Americans. But if you learn to speak Trump, your talk about America is on track to be heard by this new administration, as well as Republicans now in control of both houses of Congress, 33 governor seats, and two-thirds of state legislative bodies. Talk about American jobs. Better yet, show your organization participating, not just watching. On January 3, a GM spokesman got into war of tweets with Donald Trump over the fraction of its compact cars imported from Mexico. Whatever the facts or merits of the case, GM had better take care in how it communicates on this, or it could be Trumped and Carriered.

News Business Business News Post-Brexit construction output surges despite 'intense pressure' from devalued pound Input costs rose at their fastest since April 2011, as rising imported raw material prices were passed down from suppli Ben Woods Wednesday 4 January 2017 15:25 BST Click to follow The Independent Online House building led the increase in activity Reuters The UK construction industry saw orders grow at their fastest pace in almost a year during December, but firms are still grappling with "intense cost pressures" caused by the Brexit-hit pound. The positive news from the Markit/CIPS survey, comes one day after manufacturers also signalled that activity was surging. UK Construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 54.2 last month, up from 52.8 in November and well above economists' expectations of 52.6. Read more UK construction industry hit by slowdown in October A reading above 50 indicates growth. The better-than-expected performance was driven by improved order books and a rebound in business conditions, with new order growth hitting an 11-month high. However, input costs rose at their fastest since April 2011, as rising imported raw material prices - driven by sterling's slump since the Brexit vote - were passed down from suppliers. It comes after separate PMI figures on Tuesday showed manufacturing output unexpectedly leap to a two-and-a-half-year high in December thanks to an exports boost from the plunging pound. Read more Don’t make shoppers pay for weak pound, Tesco boss warns Sainsbury's profits slump 10% as weak pound causes costs surge Why our post-Brexit economy can't be saved by slashing interest rates Tim Moore, senior economist at IHS Markit, said the PMI data showed the construction industry delivered a "solid rebound" in the final quarter of last year. "All three main areas of construction activity have started to recover from last summer's soft patch, but in each case growth remains much weaker than the cyclical peaks seen in 2014. "Housebuilding remains a key engine of growth for the construction sector, with the latest upturn the fastest for almost one year. "Meanwhile, commercial activity was the weakest performing category in December, reflecting an ongoing drag from subdued investment spending and heightened economic uncertainty." The PMI report said housebuilding was the best performing area of the industry, with housing activity delivering its fastest expansion since January. Rising workloads also bumped up employment levels, as recruitment grew at its quickest rate since May but remained "much weaker" than the average. Nearly half - 48 per cent - of the firms surveyed for the report expect business activity to step up over the next year, with business confidence hitting a three-month high.

Getty 31/31 Philip Hammond ditches George Osborne's 15% corporation tax cut target - Monday October 3 Chancellor Philip Hammond has apparently rejected the plan of his predecessor George Osborne to slash corporation tax to just 15 per cent in the wake of the UK’s Brexit vote. In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the PMI report boosted hopes for a robust performance from the UK economy in the fourth quarter. "The improved December construction purchasing managers' survey follows on from the manufacturing survey showing activity picking up to a 30-month high in December. "This buoys hopes that the UK economy continued to hold up pretty well in the fourth quarter of 2016 after resilient expansion of 0.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter following June's Brexit vote. "A healthy December purchasing managers' survey for the dominant services sector would be particularly reassuring."

James Mattis (Credit: a katz / Shutterstock.com)    5404927 Newly designated Secretary of Defense James Mattis reportedly assured U.S. senators of his commitment to move forward with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, which President-elect Donald Trump previously suggested had problems. Trump tweeted Dec. 22 that he was asking the Boeing corporation to offer a competitively priced alternative to the F-35 program, which is the current flagship fighter program of the U.S. The F-35 program is the most expensive weapons program in U.S. history, costing U.S. taxpayers nearly 400 billion dollars. Trump repeatedly expresses ire at the program’s cost overruns, and indicates he is open to radical cost-saving maneuvers. The F-35 is built by defense contractor Lockheed Martin. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal from North Carolina t0ld local Connecticut media that Mattis gave lawmakers a “clear commitment” to the F-35 program. “I was encouraged by his clear commitment to American air superiority and the important role of the F-35 program in sustaining and enhancing it,” Blumenthal said in a statement released after his meeting with Mattis. Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson also gave Trump a “personal commitment” to “aggressively” drive costs down on the program. The willingness of Mattis to express divergent views concerning defense programs and the military generally, is reportedly what endeared him to Trump, along with his reputation as a tough fighter. In his initial interview with Trump, Mattis pushed back against Trump’s professed desire to bring back enhanced interrogation techniques on suspected terrorists.

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE General Motors CEO Mary Barra talks about the new 2016 Chevy Cruze vehicle at the Filmore Theater in Detroit, Michigan, June 24, 2015. Trump slammed General Motors' production of some Cruze compact cars in Mexico on Twitter Tuesday. Rebecca Cook/Reuters | Caption Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen January 4, 2017 —The @realDonaldTrump was at it again Tuesday, threatening in 140 characters to impose a border tax on the Chevrolet Cruze cars General Motors manufactures in Mexico. An early morning Twitter post sent GM shares on a 1 percent tumble before the market opened, although they rebounded to close up, at $35.15 by the end of Tuesday.  The tweet came hours ahead of an announcement that Ford Motor Company has halted plans to build in Mexico a $1.6 billion assembly plant, a repeated target of Mr. Trump in his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Instead, Ford said Tuesday it now plans to invest $700 million in a Michigan factory to build new electric, hybrid, and autonomous vehicles. General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, became the latest American manufacturer Tuesday caught in the crosshairs of Mr. Trump’s Twitter account. The president-elect has slammed Ford, United Technologies, The Boeing Company, and Lockheed Martin on social media since he was elected Nov. 8. In doing so, Trump has already inserted himself into corporate affairs more than his predecessors in the White House, experts say. But it’s unclear how his direct criticism of one automaker, be it GM or Ford, could affect the industry as a whole. It’s unlikely one tweet will force a manufacturer to scrap months of planning, since any change in vehicle production would require a carmaker to build a brand new facility. But it could lead to different forms of rhetoric among those in Detroit, says Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied the relationship of businesses and governments. How much do you know about the auto industry's future? A “company could think of ways to allow an administration to claim some credit for the opening of new factories,” Professor Jensen tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interivew. Conversely, Ford and GM have each gone on the defensive against Trump.   On Tuesday, an Android phone (an indication Trump may have authored the post himself) tweeted “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across boarder. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!”  General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 The president-elect did not provide further details. But General Motors promptly responded, publishing a brief statement on its website. The automaker said it manufactures the Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio, and builds the hatchback version in Mexico “for global markets” “with a small number sold in the US.” According to Automative News, GM began to produce the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the US. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM facility in South Korea. “In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors,” said Trump transition team spokesman and incoming press secretary Sean Spicer. “But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind.” Trump’s tweet also came hours ahead of Ford’s announcement it would cancel its plans for the $1.6 billion factory in Mexico in favor of a $700 million factory in Michigan. Ford chief executive Mark Fields said the decision to cancel the new plant was, in part, related to the company’s need to “fully utilize capacity at existing facilities” amid declining sales of small and medium-sized cars such as the Focus and Fusion. Mr. Fields also endorsed “pro growth” tax and regulatory policies expected under the Trump administration and a Republican Congress. But a Ford source told Reuters the company’s decision was directly influenced by Trump’s policy goals such as lowering taxes and regulations. During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged that, if elected, he would not allow Ford to build the assembly plant in Mexico. He said Ford’s plan was an “absolute disgrace,” and threatened to slap a tariff of 35 percent on imported Ford cars. But Ford’s actions appear to be as much about the shifting auto market as policies under Trump. Small-car sales have been hurt by shifting consumer demands and low gas prices. In fact, a trend among Detroit’s Big Three automakers has been to produce smaller cars in Mexico while taking advantage of higher-paid US workers to build more profitable, trucks, SUVs and luxury cars. Dr. Jensen at the University of Texas at Austin related Ford’s announcement to company’s relationships with governors. In a 2013 paper, Jensen and his colleagues published findings from a nationwide internet survey that suggested that a firm crediting a governor with its expansion can be politically beneficial to a governor's future campaign to remain in office. "Our findings illustrate a critical political benefit of offering such [tax] incentives," they write in the abstract. "Politicians can use these incentives to take credit for investment flowing into their districts and to minimize the political fallout when investors choose to locate elsewhere." Trump has also inserted himself into the aircraft manufacturing industry, sending company’s stocks briefly dropping in the process. In December, he attacked Boeing on Twitter for what he alleged were excessive costs to build two different Air Force One planes. Trump also twice used Twitter to slam Lockheed Martin’s development of the F-35, saying he asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet “based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns” of the F-35.

News Business Business News Asia's richest families are abandoning hedge funds due to mediocre returns and high fees Family offices representing billionaires and multimillionaires are a key source of capital in the continent, where global pension funds haven’t made large inroads Klaus Wille Wednesday 4 January 2017 14:18 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Singapore-based wealth managers say their clients are increasingly looking towards private equity investments Reuters For Michael Preiss, whose firm oversees $1.9bn (£1.55bn) mainly for wealthy Asian families, adding hedge funds to his clients’ portfolios was an easy sell some years ago. Not anymore. The executive director at the Singapore-based Taurus Wealth Advisors multi-family office said his clients are disappointed with mediocre hedge fund returns and are balking at high fees, prompting them to shift to private equity. With redemptions already at a four-year high, Asia’s richest people comprise an investor group regional hedge funds can ill afford to lose. Family offices representing billionaires and multimillionaires are a key source of capital in Asia, where global pension funds and university endowments haven’t made large inroads. Managers seeking money for new hedge funds are likely to be the hardest hit. Read more UK hedge funds draw up Brexit wish list to prevent damage to the City “Asia’s hedge funds are smaller than their global peers, meaning they are more dependent on money from high-net-worth individuals and family offices,” said Melvyn Teo, professor of finance at Singapore Management University. “If family offices withdraw money, the region’s hedge fund industry will clearly feel the pinch.” UBS said in November family offices worldwide have turned away from hedge funds after they trailed stock markets in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The trend is even more pronounced in Asia, where family offices set more aggressive performance goals, according to Eric Landolt, UBS’s head of family advisory for Asia Pacific. Read more Brexit-backing hedge fund billionaire warns UK economy 'about to crash Why hedge fund employees are departing to work for mutual funds Hedge fund bets against pound hit record highs in wake of Brexit Top 25 US hedge fund managers made $13bn in 2015 “Family offices are usually here to add wealth to the family,” said Landolt. “It is a growth engine for the family, whereas in Europe or the US there is a much stronger wealth-preservation angle.” Managers seeking capital from outside Asia may find few takers. Ray Nolte, chief investment officer of $8bn US-based fund of hedge funds SkyBridge Capital, last month said he’s shunning Asian hedge funds because of mounting risks in China’s debt markets. SkyBridge has less than 5 per cent of its assets in Asian hedge funds, Nolte said. That compares with 85 per cent in the US and 10 per cent in Europe. Hedge funds investing in Asia suffered $1.6bn of withdrawals through November, on track for the biggest outflows in four years, as their returns trailed the industry globally, according to the latest estimates from data provider Eurekahedge Pte. “The big hedge funds have become complacent, meaning they put more emphasis on the management fee than performance fee,” Taurus’s Preiss said. “For instance, a $1bn fund tends to focus on capital preservation and getting the management fee instead of working on a decent performance.” Business picture of the day 31 show all Business picture of the day 1/31 Fiat loses $2.3bn in stock value plunge after diesel emissions accusation - Thursday January 12 Shares in Fiat Chrysler plunged on Thursday after US authorities said that the carmaker had violated the Clean Air Act by allowing excess diesel emissions in some vehicles.

In early July Mr Osborne said he wanted to push the levy on company profits to 15 per cent as a bold signal to global companies that the UK is still “open for business” despite the vote to leave the EU. In his speech to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham today, Mr Hammond made no reference to that 15 per cent goal, merely referencing the existing policy for the levy to decline to 17 per cent. AFP/Getty The ultra-rich families backing Taurus instead want to put their money directly into technology companies, according to Preiss. Taurus has about 10 per cent of client assets allocated to alternative assets. At $500m multi-family office Golden Equator Capital Pte, the shift has been even more drastic. Over the past two years, the share of assets allocated to hedge funds has more than halved to less than 10 per cent, while private-equity investments have doubled to 20 per cent, according to founder and chief executive Shirley Chua. Chua said her clients are particularly interested in closely-held US firms focusing on disruptive technologies such as car-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. or Magic Leap Inc., a US startup working on a device that simulates reality. “There is great interest in the unicorns,” said Chua, who before setting up Golden Equator assisted high-net-worth individuals from Asia and Europe as a director at Citigroup Inc. in Singapore. “Our clients want to participate in the new economy.” Taurus and Golden Equator are part of a wider shift that’s undermining hedge funds. The average share of alternative assets, mostly real estate and private equity, in Asian family office portfolios increased by 3 percentage points to 44 per cent in the two years through May 2016, according to UBS data. The proportion allocated to hedge funds fell 1 percentage point to 5 per cent. New hedge funds in Asia are particularly affected by the reluctance of family offices to invest, according to Singapore Management University’s Teo. “Especially for hedge fund startups, the bar has been raised because of this,” he said. “A lot of them depend not on institutional investor capital, but on capital from high net worth individuals and family offices so that they can get up to critical mass. It becomes a problem if family offices start to shy away from this.” Shiraz Poonevala, director of investments at Bangkok-based family office GP Group, which only invests its estimated $500m of assets directly, say it’s also a matter of Asia’s richest families wanting more control of their assets. “I look my boss in the eye every day, and I have to answer to him,” he said. “Maybe I don’t get super returns, but at the same time I don’t do super silly things because I have to see him every day. A hedge fund is like writing a check and then hoping for the best.” Bloomberg More about: Hedge Funds Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Maybe it was to save jack rabbit habitat. But the economic damage he caused to our state was greater than if he had shut down Boeing and Seattle. Grand Coulee Dam is one of the state’s most valuable assets. Yet, few on the west side could find it on a map. It is largest hydroelectric power plant in the U.S., and one of the largest in the world, and it was idled by Obama to force wind power’s higher electric rates on consumers. Grand Coulee transformed Washington’s dry mid-section into one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world. The Clinton/Obama “sound good” desert ecology policies haven’t saved one rabbit! And they have already cost your state more than $500 billion and tens of millions in lost lease revenue from state land and your school funds. Farm production and exports from the once dry Columbia Basin rival Boeing’s contribution to the state’s wealth. And, unlike Boeing, the farmers pay state and county taxes. And they pay for every gallon of water they are allowed to have. When Donald Trump said he wants to make America great again, I hope it will include making Grand Coulee Dam grand again.           Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP Rupert Neate @RupertNeate Wednesday 4 January 2017 08.54 EST Last modified on Friday 13 January 2017 17.18 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Donald Trump’s prolific and opinionated tweeting helped him win the US election, and now he is using Twitter to persuade big business to bend to his agenda. There was further evidence this week that the incoming president’s unusual approach is paying off after Ford cancelled plans to open a new plant in Mexico. It came one month after a Trump-brokered agreement with United Technologies to prevent 1,100 manufacturing jobs in Indiana from being moved out of the US. After his election win, Trump credited Twitter and other social media platforms with helping him beat Hillary Clinton despite her much higher advertising spending. “The fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc, I think it helped me win all of these races where they’re spending much more money than I spent,” he told CBS’s 60 Minutes programme. Trump has said he will rest his Twitter fingers when he is sworn in as the 45th president on 20 January. “I’m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all,” he said in the same interview. However, he has continued to use Twitter during the transition period, taking aim at multinational companies as well as his political opponents and the media. So far, it has produced results, with the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen applauding the Ford announcement as proof that “protectionism works”. Other companies have been affected by Trump’s solo social media campaign too. Ford and General Motors Carmakers Ford and GM were the latest companies to be targeted by Trump, raising the possibility that elements of US industrial strategy will be influenced and even formulated on social media. As the US returned to work on Tuesday morning after New Year celebrations, @RealDonaldTrump, who has 18.6 million followers, tweeted: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! January 3, 2017 GM shares immediately dipped 3% before recovering as the company pointed out that the vast majority of the cars it makes in Mexico are for international markets. Of the 190,000 Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks sold in the US last year, just 4,500 were made in Mexico. During the election campaign Trump repeatedly vowed to bring in a 35% tax on cars made in Mexico and sold in the US. At the moment, US companies can import goods from Mexico without paying any tax thanks to the North American free trade agreement (Nafta), which Trump has described as “the worst trade deal maybe ever”. Trump has repeatedly threatened to renegotiate or “terminate” Nafta. The free trade deal had allowed cars to become a booming part of Mexico’s economy, with foreign companies investing more than $20bn (£16.3bn) in building factories in its rustbelt around Aguascalientes between 2010 and 2015. Trump appeared to have posted the 7.30am tweet without consulting Mary Barra, GM’s chief executive, whom he appointed last month to his strategic and policy forum, which he said would help him formulate his economic and business policies. “This forum brings together CEOs and business leaders who know what it takes to create jobs and drive economic growth,” Trump said at the time of Barra’s appointment. “My administration is committed to drawing on private sector expertise and cutting the government red tape that is holding back our businesses from hiring, innovating and expanding right here in America.” Hours after GM’s scolding, Ford, which has regularly been targeted by Trump over manufacturing in Mexico, announced it was scrapping plans for a $1.6bn plant in San Luis Potosí and instead would invest $700m in a Michigan assembly plant. Mark Fields, Ford’s CEO, said Trump’s “pro-growth policies” had partly led to the decision. “We look at a lot of factors as we make those,” he told Fox News. “One of the factors that we’re looking at is a more positive US manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and some of the pro-growth policies he said he’s going to pursue. And so this is a vote of confidence.” Trump celebrated, tweeting: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.https://t.co/siXrptsOrt January 3, 2017 Boeing Last month Trump criticised the aircraft manufacturer Boeing for the “out of control” cost of the new Air Force One 747 and called for the deal to be scrapped. The tweet led to about $1bn being wiped off the company’s market value before the share price recovered. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! December 6, 2016 Trump summoned the Boeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, telling reporters that he was trying hard to get costs down. Muilenburg said as he left the resort: “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens. I was able to give the president-elect my personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing company.” Lockheed Martin Trump also hit out at Lockheed Martin over the cost of the next generation of F-35 fighter jets, tweeting last month: Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. December 12, 2016 Again, the tweet wiped billions off Lockheed’s market value. Trump expanded on his tweet on the Today show: “The planes are too expensive and we’re going to get the prices down, and if we don’t get the prices down we’re not going to order them.” He summoned Lockheed’s CEO, Marillyn Hewson, to the Florida resort. “I had a productive meeting with President-elect Trump,” Hewson said afterwards. “I appreciated the opportunity to discuss the importance of the F-35 programme and the progress we’ve made in bringing the costs down. The F-35 is a critical programme to our national security, and I conveyed our continued commitment to delivering an affordable aircraft to our US military and our allies.” Perhaps unsatisfied with the reaction, Trump announced on Twitter that he had asked Boeing to give him a quote on a different fighter jet option, the F-18 Super Hornet. The decision will also have an impact on the UK, which has been chosen as a possible location for an F-35 maintenance site. Britain’s £6.2bn aircraft carrier programme is designed for use by jump jets such as the F-35.

Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters Most Popular Seeking an Escape Hatch From Trump’s America Emma Green 7:00 AM ET Goodbye, American Apparel Bourree Lam Jan 14, 2017 My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates Dec 13, 2016 The Curse of Econ 101 James Kwak Jan 14, 2017 The Trump Tweet Tracker The Editors Dec 28, 2016 David Brown Jan 4, 2017 Science Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size Last week, upon leaving the president-elect’s office, Douglas Brinkley, a historian and conservationist, reported that Trump “was very interested in a man going to the moon.” Before that point, the entirety of Trump’s utterances of space policy consisted of two sentences: “Honestly I think NASA is wonderful!” and “Right now, we have bigger problems… We've got to fix our potholes.” Brinkley’s remark suggests he might be thinking about a moon base, an idea long-favored by Newt Gingrich, one of Trump’s advisers. The constitution of his transition landing team at NASA, which includes lunar advocates, would seem to bear this out. The principal arguments for a moon base involve digging mines and building fuel depots. Though the moon lacks the resources to ever be truly self-sustaining, it only takes a few days to reach from Earth. If the U.S. decides that the goal of human spaceflight should be to gather resources, the moon and its quarry of helium-3 will be a compelling target. The isotope is extremely rare on Earth because of our magnetosphere. The moon has no such protection, and for billions of years it has collected the stuff by way of an unyielding fusillade from solar winds. There is an estimated 1.1 million metric tons of helium-3 on the moon. A mere 40 tons could power the United States for a year; if scientists are able to build a fusion reactor, we could shovel it into our nuclear power plants for centuries to come. There are also countless scientific questions that can be answered on the lunar surface. A telescope, for example, built on the far side of the moon and thus free of Earth’s ionosphere and radio interference would allow scientists to see the beginning of the universe. Chris Carberry, CEO and founder of Explore Mars, a nonprofit Mars advocacy group, argues that far greater opportunities exist on Mars, and that a return to the moon might delay Mars settlement by decades. Mars has carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen—everything a colony needs to be self-sustaining. With those ingredients, you can do everything from manufacturing plastics to cultivating the soil. In other words, you can build a base on the moon, but a civilization on Mars. Moreover, Carberry says that the red planet has never been in a better position politically, culturally, or scientifically. “Right now we have an unprecedented level of support for Mars exploration,” Carberry says. “Frankly it would be foolish to throw that away. There's a huge amount of support on Capitol Hill. The Senate just passed a transition bill with the strongest Mars language ever put into legislation. The House did a previous authorization bill with very strong Mars language as well. There are many years of bipartisan support for Mars—also for the moon, but the strongest emphasis is on Mars. That goes for industry as well. Boeing, Lockheed, Aerojet Rocketdyne, SpaceX, and others put quite a bit of effort into designing a mission architecture.” American moon partisans owe a debt to Europe, which has tended the lunar flame during the ascent of Mars. Perhaps the most prominent moon advocate on Earth is Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency. Since assuming the post, he has argued persuasively that a “lunar village” is the natural successor to the aging International Space Station. It would be, in his view, a celestial point of harmony for a terrestrial species in discord. There is a problem, however: the Europeans have committed virtually no money to a moon village, and Russia, ESA's would-be partner in the venture, has no money to commit. They have already been forced to downsize their presence on the ISS due to costs, and have delayed plans for robotic exploration of the moon. (The head of the Russian space agency admits that Russia “does not have financial capabilities for advanced space projects.”) Lacking unity among member states, to say nothing of technology development and financial resources, what ESA really needs is for the United States to fund and spearhead such an effort. NASA's sights, however, are firmly fixed on Mars. With the presidential transition, however, and a new NASA director still to be appointed, lunar champions at home and abroad see an opportunity to abandon the Journey to Mars program and set sights a little closer to the Earth. To that end, ESA is on a moon base public-relations offensive, from the light and easy (magazine spreads and aspirational illustrations) to bare-knuckled politics  (publicly pressing the NASA administrator on the issue.) The overt message from Paris, where ESA is headquartered, is: We're doing this. The subtext is: While NASA plans a fantasy mission to Mars that will never happen, the rest of the world will be driving moon buggies and mining helium-3. But ESA’s campaign is powered by handwavium, and for all the illustrations of lunar domes and our great big blue marble over the horizon, progress on the moon base ends at Photoshop. If the U.S. doesn’t build the base, it won’t get built. Casey Dreier, the director of space policy for the Planetary Society, a nonprofit space advocacy organization, says that if any space agency really wants to land humans on the moon, let alone build a colony, there's no getting around the commitment to a program on the order of Apollo—a colossal commitment that ESA has not addressed.   “First you’d have to see a commitment to hardware that could get humans to the moon,” Dreier says. “Soyuz [the Russian-built spacecraft] doesn’t get to you there.” Even if deep space hardware for multi-week missions existed, however, there's the more fundamental problem of actually getting it into space. “You would need a new heavy launch rocket or plans that use existing rockets for in-orbit assembly of hardware, and that's just to get to the moon.” (Only American rockets in development have the requisite lift.) There's still the most challenging part of the mission: the lander. “Even more basically,” says Dreier, “ESA has to come together formally and commit votes. If there was a serious project, member nations would commit funds and decide things like: What do you do there?” The moon has always been part of NASA's Journey to Mars program. Though landing on the lunar surface is not part of the current plan, cislunar space—the 250,000 miles between the Earth and the moon—is essential. NASA calls it the “proving grounds,” and intends to develop that part of deep space to test life support and propulsion systems for any Mars expedition. Moreover, the Space Launch System (the colossal “Mars rocket” able to lift heavy payloads into space) and the Orion spacecraft for carrying astronauts into deep space are essentially holdovers from the Constellation program, the Mars space exploration initiative begun by President Bush in 2004 and canceled in 2009 by President Obama. The first stop on Constellation's roadmap was the moon, meaning SLS and Orion, both soon to roll off the assembly line, are moon-ready. Carberry says that if we change focus to the moon, however ill-advisedly, we should still do so in the context of going to Mars. He points to the Apollo program as a good example of how not to frame a space mission. The first time NASA went to the moon, it did so based on single reason: to beat the Soviet Union. Once that singular reason was accomplished, there will little will to maintain momentum. The long-term goal—Here is what this is all building toward—never entered the public policy discussion. “If you always have something beyond your current goal, it strengthens resolve to keep moving,” he says. “You strengthen your argument by making sure you have those longer-term goals—that this doesn't stop at moon. Hopefully it won’t come to that. If we can use the surface of moon within the framework of going to Mars, and we can stimulate commercial activity there, that's great, but if we put everything into the moon, we'll be stuck there for decades... Does US want to do a moon program forever? I don't know. Our advantage is clearly on Mars exploration.” That advantage goes beyond national pride. NASA has been successfully landing spacecraft on Mars for 40 years. No other nation has succeeded in doing this even once. Exploring Mars is difficult, as the crashed ESA-Russia Schiaparelli EDM lander confirmed in October. NASA has established a cadence of Mars missions, each more complicated than the last, each developing Martian science and engineering with eventual human exploration in mind. As long as the Mars missions continue, the agency can iterate on its carefully accumulated institutional knowledge. If that knowledge is wasted and manufacturing partners spin down, the entire Mars apparatus will have to be regrown from zero. This is the same problem NASA now suffers even in its limited plan to send astronauts to cislunar space. Although SLS and Orion are very far along in development, it will still be another five years at least before a crewed mission can be attempted to lunar orbit, replicating what Apollo 8 did 50 years ago. Wherever NASA is directed to go by the new administration will likely require a commitment that pushes the alternative back by decades. There’s simply no money in the NASA budget for both the moon and Mars. As the ISS demonstrated, building the thing—moon base or Mars colony—is the cheap part. It’s the operational costs that bog exploration down. Twenty percent of NASA’s budget goes to keeping the space station crewed and in orbit. A moon base will entail a similar such slice of the pie, which covers things like maintenance, ground support, technicians, engineers, physicians, launches, hardware, supplies, and food. You don’t maintain a moon base and gear up for Mars. Just the opposite: Going to Mars would specifically entail closing the moon base, which places Mars on the other side of lunar exploration, base design, base construction, base operations, base maintenance, and base divestment. NASA and world partners began work on the International Space Station began during Ronald Reagan’s first term. If we build a moon village, we’ll be there for a very long time.                                                                                                                          Casey Dreier maintains that there is no correct destination for human spaceflight. “To me,” he says, “the least interesting argument in space exploration is ‘moon or Mars.’ It’s an important decision, but not an interesting argument. Mars is not objectively the only answer. The fundamental issue at play is what do we do that pays dividends as nation.” What dividends should we look for? Elon Musk advocates Mars colonization by defining Mars as humanity's failsafe—that once we settle and flourish on a second world, no matter what catastrophe might befall Earth, be it an asteroid or atomic devastation, the human species can survive. NASA frames Mars exploration in more hopeful terms, calling it a scientific endeavor through which we can learn about the evolution Earth and life. Either way, those are enticing and worthy goals. Astronauts can press boot prints into Martian soil in less than 20 years, but for that to happen, NASA must stay the course.

They don’t own a refrigerator or a car; their year-old baby and four-year-old toddler play by candlelight rather than electricity at night. They identify as Christian anarchists, and have given an official name to their search for an alternative to consumption-heavy American life: the Downstream Project, with the motto to “do unto those downstream as you would have those upstream do unto you.” As it turns out, exiting the system is a challenging, time-consuming, and surprisingly technical process. Here in the Shenandoahs and central Virginia, a handful of tiny communities are experimenting with what it means to reject the norms of contemporary life and exist in a radically different way. They seem to share Americans’ pervasive sense of political alienation, which arguably reached an apotheosis with the election of Donald Trump: a sense of division from their peers, a distrust of government. The challenges of modern politics—dealing with issues like climate change, poverty, mass migration, and war on a global scale—are so vast and abstract that it’s difficult not to find them overwhelming. But instead of continuing in passive despair, as many Americans seem to do, the people in these communities decided to overhaul their lives. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Goodbye, American Apparel Bourree Lam The 19-year old company has been purchased for $88 million, which may be the brand’s last great marketing feat. It’s finally over for American Apparel, the trendy turned-scandal plagued clothing brand whose first store opened in 1997. On Thursday, a bankruptcy court in Delaware approved an $88 million sale of the brand’s intellectual property and manufacturing equipment to Gildan, a Canadian apparel company that focuses on wholesale. Gildan will pay an additional $15 million to acquire American Apparel’s purchase orders and inventory, effectively giving the buyer all the tools it needs to launch a new clothing line from the ruins of the now defunct brand. Millennials—especially those who identify with the term hipsters—likely remember a time in the early naughts when American Apparel’s snug, expensive t-shirts were emblematic of made-in-America cool. The company’s marketing blended the feel-good altruistic mission of making things in America while its advertising featured over-the-top sex appeal of one of America’s favorite traits: youth. Continue Reading Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was. Continue Reading Bettmann / Getty The Curse of Econ 101 James Kwak When it comes to basic policy questions such as the minimum wage, introductory economics can be more misleading than it is helpful. In a rich, post-industrial society, where most people walk around with supercomputers in their pockets and a person can have virtually anything delivered to his or her doorstep overnight, it seems wrong that people who work should have to live in poverty. Yet in America, there are more than ten million members of the working poor: people in the workforce whose household income is below the poverty line. Looking around, it isn’t hard to understand why. The two most common occupations in the United States are retail salesperson and cashier. Eight million people have one of those two jobs, which typically pay about $9–$10 per hour. It’s hard to make ends meet on such meager wages. A few years ago, McDonald’s was embarrassed by the revelation that its internal help line was recommending that even a full-time restaurant employee apply for various forms of public assistance. Continue Reading Spencer Platt / Getty / Zak Bickel / The Atlantic The Trump Tweet Tracker The Editors Monitoring the president-elect’s statements on Twitter—and analyzing what they mean President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly issued announcements and proposals over Twitter, during both the presidential election and the transition period, embracing the medium as a superior means of communicating with the American people compared to relying on traditional media organizations. Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has promised that Trump’s tweets will continue: “He has this direct pipeline to the American people, where he can talk back and forth,” Spicer recently explained to WPRI TV in Providence, Rhode Island, adding that Twitter allows him to “put his thoughts out and hear what they’re thinking in a way that no one’s ever been able to do before.” We’ll track and unpack Trump’s tweets here, according to our best understanding of their significance.

McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Mike Segar/Reuters Will Mike Pence Be Trump’s Bridge to Democrats? Alex Wagner Indiana Democrats weigh in on their experience with the former governor. Though he has not yet been installed in the Oval Office, Donald Trump has already made life fairly complex for his Republican brethren in Congress. Most recently, in an interview with the New York Times this week, Trump singlehandedly threw the GOP’s Obamacare repeal process into chaos, insisting that a repeal vote would come “probably some time next week” and a replacement “very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.” Neither was correct, but especially the replacement timeline: Congressional Republicans  are quietly insisting that it will be weeks before a replacement bill is ready—maybe even months (or years!).   The only person in the administration who seemed willing to acknowledge this reality is Vice President-elect Mike Pence.  In a press conference earlier this month, following a meeting with Republican lawmakers, Pence said: “The architecture of the replacement of Obamacare will come together, as it should, through the legislative process in the weeks and months ahead.” Continue Reading WIkimedia Commons Why More Writers Should Talk About Money Joseph Frankel A new collection of essays and interviews breaks one of the biggest taboos of the literary world. Money makes people anxious—perhaps even more so with writers. The relationship between commerce and writing is commonly sketched out in caricatures: the starving artist, the hapless student, the privileged few who “make it.” More often, it’s not addressed at all. In the past few years, some writers have begun to more openly approach questions of class. The internet has seen a profusion of such pieces: A writer who is “sponsored” by her husband calls on other writers to be more transparent about where their money comes from. Another outlines the clear advantages that being born rich, connected, and able to attend expensive schools furnishes to becoming a successful writer. In another case, a woman who wrote a well-received debut novel details how she went broke after a single advance.

Weston Phippen Billy Barr moved to the Rocky Mountains four decades ago, got bored one winter, and decided to keep a notebook that has become the stuff of legend. It was a year into his life alone in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains when Billy Barr began his recordings. It started as a curiosity, a task to busy his mind during the winter. By no means, Barr told me, having skied down from his cabin to use the nearest phone, did he set out to make a vital database for climate change scientists. “Hell no!” he said. “I didn’t know anything about climate change at the time.” In 1973 Barr had dropped out of college and made his home an abandoned mining shack at the base of Gothic Mountain, a 12,600-foot stone buttress. The cold winds blew through the shack’s wood slat walls as if they didn’t exist; he shared the bare dirt floor with a skunk and pine marten, his only regular company for much of the year. Barr had moved from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains precisely because of the solitude, but he couldn’t escape boredom. Especially that first winter. So he measured snow levels, animal tracks, and in spring the first jubilant calls of birds returning. He filled a notebook with these observations; then another notebook. This has continued now for 44 years. Continue Reading Paul Windle Machiavelli Was Right Michael Ignatieff The shocking lesson of The Prince isn’t that politics demands dirty hands, but that politicians shouldn’t care. You remember the photograph: President Obama hunched in a corner of the Situation Room with his national-security staff, including Hillary Clinton with a hand over her mouth, watching the live feed from the compound in Pakistan where the killing of Osama bin Laden is under way. This is a Machiavellian moment: a political leader taking the ultimate risks that go with the exercise of power, now awaiting the judgment of fate. He knows that if the mission fails, his presidency is over, while if it succeeds, no one should ever again question his willingness to risk all. It’s a Machiavellian moment in a second sense: an instance when public necessity requires actions that private ethics and religious values might condemn as unjust and immoral. We call these moments Machiavellian because it was Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince, written in 1513, that first laid bare the moral world of politics and the gulf between private conscience and the demands of public action.

News Business Business Comment Next's Brexit backing boss and a grim assessment of the future Brexiteers have been busily shooting messengers for not being optimistic about Britain's EU exit. Lord Wolfson, who has to run a business, doesn't have the luxury of looking through rose tinted spectacles James Moore @JimMooreJourno Wednesday 4 January 2017 11:51 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Lord Wolfson: this year may be the toughest since 2008 PA Faced with the growing weight of evidence that Brexit will be a complete disaster, Brexiteers have taken to shooting messengers for not being sufficiently positive about the future.  Most recently this has led to the early departure of Sir Ivan Rodgers, Britain’s ambassador to the EU, a huge loss to the negotiating team given his experience. It also led to an unwarranted attack on the Office for Budgetary Responsibility over the forecasts it issued alongside the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement because they weren't sufficiently sunny.  Read more Next sends shares of UK retailers diving as 2017 outlook turns bleak Brexit political correctness demands that people say it’s great, and presents a marvellous opportunity for the UK regardless of all evidence to the contrary. So you might have expected Brexit backing Next chief executive Lord Wolfson to pen an upbeat assessment of the business's prospects.  Except that he hasn't. Here’s the Next view of what Britain's economy is facing, and the impact it might have on the retailer’s performance: “We may see a further squeeze in general spending as inflation begins to erode real earnings growth.” If you want that translated, Next expects most of us to get poorer.  Then there’s this: “Following the devaluation of the Pound we expect prices on like-for-like garments to rise, but by no more than 5 per cent. We expect that this will depress sales revenue by around 0.5 per cent.” Translation: We’re going to put our prices up, but that means we’ll sell less clobber.  And there’s more: “In the light of the exceptional levels of uncertainty in the clothing sector, and with little visibility of the approach the UK government will be taking to Brexit, we have reviewed our approach to the distribution of surplus cash.” Read more Next sends shares of UK retailers diving as outlook turns bleak Next warns prices could rise by 5% in 2017 Marks & Spencer could become the next Sports Direct Translation: We don’t have a clue what’s going to happen, but we’re very worried and it might have an impact on what we can pay to shareholders. Next thinks that it will generate cash “at the lower end of our guidance” but will use it to pay out a bunch of special dividends so shareholders don’t suffer as much as consumers. There is, however, a caveat: “This plan is subject to the outlook remaining in line with our forecast ranges and no significant changes to market conditions.” Translation: Don’t rely too heavily on our ability to keep this up.  Part of Next’s problem is that under Lord Wolfson, who is, despite it all, a very skilful CEO, it has grown like a train. Growing businesses always stumble at some point not least because growth gets progressively harder to achieve as you get bigger. Next seems to have reached that point The final three months of last year weren’t terribly cheerful and the company had expected a rebound. Instead sales fell by 0.4 per cent. They had fallen by 3.5 per cent during the third quarter of the year, and the end of season sale hasn’t gone too well either.  In a normal environment the business could not, however, be said to be facing insurmountable problems. Far from it. The online business has done better than than the stores, and Next gives every impression of being a well run operation.

There’s Brexit. And, by the look of Next's statement, it appears that Lord Wolfson isn’t as optimistic about that as some of his Brexiteer mates seem to think people should be.  Perhaps that is because, as the boss of a large business, he has to deal with reality. He is also required by law to give a true and fair picture of how the business is going, not to mention by his shareholders, who would boot him out if he didn’t.  The pity is that the Government charged with running Great Britain plc seems incapable of doing the same, and is instead bent on shooting messengers all over the place. There will be more gloomy updates from Next if that continues. And it won’t just be Next either.  More about: Brexit Brexiteers Next Lord Wolfson Sir Ivan Rogers Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

The new recruits will join the German company’s various carriers in 2017. The bulk of the cabin crew, around 1,400, will be assigned at the hubs in Frankfurt and Munich alone. With 37,000 employees, Lufthansa, which operates a number of flights from the UAE and the rest of the Middle East, is the largest employer in Frankfurt and Hesse. It is not clear whether some of the positions will be available to candidates in the region. However, US planemaker Boeing had earlier said that airlines in the UAE and the rest of the Middle East region are expected to hire 200,000 more employees to support the growing demand for new aircraft over the next two decades. UAE-based Etihad Airways, which earlier announced some job cuts, are looking for new staff as well. The airline has scheduled at least eight cabin crew assessment days so far this year. Two of these were scheduled to take place in Abu Dhabi today, January 4 and on January 16.  Other locations include Tunisia, Johannesburg, Athens, Paris, Madrid and Cairo. Last year, in addition to the conventional application processes, Lufthansa also held six flight attendant castings in Heidelberg, Mainz, Augsburg, Regensburg, Munich and Berlin, which was met with great interest among the target group. “More than 2,000 applicants went to the castings, and almost 6,000 attended the regular application days in Frankfurt,” the airline said in a statement obtained by Gulf News. The recruitment campaign resulted in the hiring of one in every three applicants. Other divisions of the airline are also hiring. Lufthansa Technik, for example, intends to hire 450 new staff at different locations, while Austrian Airlines is hiring more than 300 additional cabin, check-in and cockpit staff, while other divisions are also looking. Last year, more than 100,000 applications were submitted to the career portal at www.be-lufthansa.com. “This makes us very proud. We are pleased to hire 2 / 2 more than 3000 staff again this year,” said Carsten Spohr, chairman of the board of Deutsche Lufthansa AG.  More from Employment How to get a job in UAE without leaving home DBWC launches partnership with United Nations Job loss in UAE: How much you will get paid UAE starts monitoring private Emiratisation Revealed: UAE sectors hiring today UAE sectors where job hiring is increasing UAE jobs: Apple hiring new employees UAE’s most attractive employers revealed tags from this storyUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGNGermany follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsEmployment tagsUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNGermany follow this tag on MGN+ MGN FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Hiring trends: Hot jobs in UAE in 2017 02UAE jobs: Hiring to pick up in 2017 03This airline will hire 3,000 new staff Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Tour of the DWTC kitchens May 18, 2015 8Images World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi Jan 18, 2010 8Images Where to live in Downtown Dubai Mar 15, 2011 11Images Etihad Airways offers residence in the sky May 04, 2014 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 EDITOR'S CHOICE Funding UAE health care sector Manoj Nair Huge gap exists in available hospital bed capacity and what is actually needed Find a Job AccountingArchitecture & DesignArts & EntertainmentAuto IndustryAviationBanking & FinanceBeauty, Health & FitnessBiotechnology & ScienceCustomer ServiceDomesticDrivingEngineering & ConstructionHRHospitalityITInsuranceLegalLogisticsManagerialManufacturing & ProductionMarketing & PRMediaMedicalMiscellaneousOil & GasPurchasing & ProcurementReal Estate & Property ServicesRetail & WholesaleSales & Business DevelopmentSecretarialTeachingTechnical & SkilledTravel  testlink-id FEATURED JOBS   Most Popular on Gulf News Speeding driver crashes into parked car, dies Revealed: World's most powerful passports 9 ways your own home could kill you Mum reunited with abused baby in Saudi Arabia Dubai retail developers prepare for mega year Businessman donates Dh370m to charity Mohammad Bin Zayed visits UAE ambassador Revealed: Top 25 universities in the world Female Indonesian workers come to UAE Close Recommended For You Mansour and Saif visit injured diplomatsPUBLISHED ON Jan 15, 2017 Mohammad receives President of MontenegroPUBLISHED ON Jan 15, 2017 Manholes being used as warehouses foundPUBLISHED ON Jan 15, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

News Business Business Comment Fatcat Day will fall on New Year's Day in the absence of reform Theresa May promised a City shake up but has subsequently backtracked, and CEO pay looks set to continue its unchecked rise James Moore @JimMooreJourno Wednesday 4 January 2017 10:58 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Bosses will rake in a median salary of £28,200 by midday, according to the High Pay Centre Getty How long will it take before the average CEO earns in a day what the average worker earns in a year, when what the High Pay Centre has designated as Fatcat Day becomes New Year’s Day? Right now, 4 January is Fatcat Wednesday, at which point a typical FTSE boss will have made £28,200. That is what the usual worker will make through the whole of 2017.  Read more 2016 was the year that the volcano of inequality exploded The Centre has been conducting this exercise for a number of years now, to highlight the yawning, and growing, gap between the money made by those at the top when compared to the money made by the people they employ.  It’s an important issue because Britain is becoming an increasingly unequal society and unequal societies are unstable societies. Unstable societies throw up bad things. The Brexit vote and the anger that accompanied it arguably being one of them. And that might be just the start of it.  The typical Briton feels the system is tilted against them, and watches aghast as their own take home remains static while that of the boss soars. What makes it worse is that there is nothing to logically justify the relentless rise in CEO pay. As the Centre points out in its release, research from Lancaster University Management School has revealed that the link between pay and performance is negligible.  Read more May’s great crusade against big business fat-cats has fallen short Theresa May signals new crackdown on fat-cat pay and corporate tax Crackdown on fatcats that isn’t as tough as it seems Bonuses are paid year in year out, with little apparent reference being made to company performance, and remuneration companies shower free shares on their executive charges like so much confetti via complex and woolly “long term incentive” schemes that aren’t very long term but have played a key role in the rapid rise in bosses' awards.  Blah blah blah, executive talent, blah, blah, blah, hire the best people. What, you mean talent like Philip Clarke at Tesco? Or even Marc Bolland at M&S, who led the shares up to the top of the hill and then right back down again? Or large parts of the banking industry a few years ago? I could go on.  Remuneration committees that pay people like these, and others, are typically made up of former executives, private equity types and accountants, who have all benefited from a crooked system and have little incentive to change it.  They are advised by consultants, whose first interest is in retaining business. They also have scant interest in rocking the boat.  Big shareholders do occasionally make a mild fuss, about the really outrageous awards. But here’s the thing: institutional fund managers that actively manage portfolios for investors are also very well paid with little apparent link to performance. Rare is the actively managed fund that can say it has beaten the relevant stockmarket index over the long term, and after charges have been taken into account.  So it’s not in their interest to make too much of a fuss either, otherwise people might start raising uncomfortable questions about their own bonuses.  But fear not! We’ve got Theresa May on our side, haven’t we? A tough as nails PM with the gumption to break it up, and restore some sanity to the City?  Tapping into the widespread anger against “elites”, Ms May initially indicated that she would do this, promising a corporate revolution that would lead to a Britain that works for everyone not just the few. We were going to see workers on boards, a requirement on companies to publish pay ratios, binding votes on pay, and more besides.  But, in the face of a fierce backlash, Ms May has been backtracking faster than Usain Bolt with a rocket pack on his back.  The green paper on corporate governance reform that has emerged has already proven to be a bit of a damp squib. And remember, it’s a green paper. A discussion document that will inevitably be further revised (read watered down).  The City's unhappiness over “Brexit means Brexit” pales by comparison to what it feels about politicians who threaten to take its top people’s sweeties away.  Biggest business scandals in pictures 18 show all Biggest business scandals in pictures 1/18 Former Reckitt Benckiser executive linked to death of 100 people in South Korea jailed for seven years - Friday January 6 A former South Korean executive of UK-based Reckitt Benckiser has been jailed for seven years over the sale of a humidifier disinfectant that killed about 100 people and left hundreds with permanent lung damage. Shin Hyun-woo, head of Reckitt Benkiser’s Oxy subsidiary from 1991 to 2005, was found guilty of accidental homicide and falsely advertising the deadly product as being safe even for children. The consumer product disaster affected many families in South Korea, where children and pregnant women often battle dry winter seasons with humidifiers. Other retailers such as Lotte Mart and Homeplus were also found guilty of selling the deadly product. 2/18 Rogue trader A French court cut the damages owed by rogue trader Jerome Kerviel from €4.9bn (£4.2bn) to just €1m (£860,000). The court ruled on that Kerviel was “partly responsible” for massive losses suffered in 2008 by his former employer Societe Generale through his reckless trades. Kerviel has consistently maintained that bosses at the French bank knew what he was doing all along. AP 3/18 Lloyds chief apologises for damage caused by affair allegations - August 2016 Antonio Horta-Osorio, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, has broken his silence over allegations about his private life admitting he regrets any "damage done to the group's reputation". In a message sent to the bank's 75,000 employees, the banker said that anyone can make mistakes while insisting that staff had to maintain the highest professional standards. Getty 4/18 Christine Lagarde faces court over £340m Bernard Tapie payment - July 2016 The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, must stand trial in France over a payment of €403 million (now £340m, then £290m) to tycoon Bernard Tapie, a France's highest appeals court has ruled. The court rejected Ms Lagarde's appeal against a judge's order in December for her to stand trial over allegations of negligence in her handling of the affair. Ms Lagarde could risk a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of €15,000 euros if convicted. Reuters 5/18 HSBC senior manager arrested in FX rigging investigation at JFK airport in New York - July 2016 A senior executive at HSBC has been arrested at New York's JFK airport for his alleged involvement in a conspiracy to rig currency benchmarks, according to reports. Mark Johnson, global head of foreign exchange cash trading in London, was reportedly arrested on Tuesday. He will appear before a federal court in Brooklyn on Wednesday charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, Bloomberg said. Getty 6/18 Former PwC employees found guilty in 'Luxleaks' tax scandal - June 2016 Two ex- PricewaterhouseCoopers staffers were found guilty in Luxembourg of stealing confidential tax files that helped unleash a global scandal over generous fiscal deals for hundreds of international companies. Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet face suspended sentences of 12 months and 9 months and were ordered to pay fines of €1,500 (£1,230) and €1,000 (£822) for their role in the so-called LuxLeaks scandal. Despite the minimal sentences, the ruling was described by Deltour’s lawyer as “shocking” and “a terrible anomaly.” The ruling “puts on guard future whistle-blowers,” Deltour told reporters.The LuxLeaks revelations sped beyond Luxembourg, causing European Union regulators to expand a tax-subsidy probe and propose new laws to fight corporate tax dodging, while EU lawmakers created a special committee to probe fiscal deals across the 28-nation bloc. reuters 7/18 Goldman Sachs dealmakers lavished Libyan officials with prostitutes to win contract - June 2016 A former Goldman Sachs dealmaker trying to persuade Gadaffi-era Libya to invest $1 billion with the investment bank procured prostitutes and invited Libyan officials to lavish parties in the hope of winning the business, the High Court heard on Monday June 13.The Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund is suing Goldman Sachs for inappropriately coercing its naïve staff into giving its sovereign wealth fund cash to the bank to invest in products they did not understand. The products were designed to generate big profits for Goldman, the LIA claims.Goldman denies wrongdoing and says the LIA was treated as an arms-length customer Reuters 8/18 Former boss of BHS said his life was threatened - June 2016 Darren Topp, the former boss of BHS, has said former owner Dominic Chappell threatened to kill him when he challenged him over a £1.5 million transfer out of the business. MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee asked Mr Topp about a £1.5 million transfer Mr Chappell made from BHS to a company called BHS Sweden. 9/18 Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley admits paying workers below the minimum wage - June 2016 Mike Ashley admitted paying Sports Direct employees below the minimum wage at a hearing in front of MPs. The company founder said that workers were paid less than the statutory minimum because of bottlenecks at security in an admission that could result in sanctions from HMRC. Reuters 10/18 Mitsubishi admits ‘improper’ fuel tests - April 2016 Mitsubishi has admitted to using false fuel methods dating back to 1991.

The scheme saw 68 nurses at an old people’s home in Gothenburg have their eight-hour days cut in a bid to improve staff satisfaction, health and patient care.  Preliminary results concluded that it achieved all of these aims, but the city had to employ an extra 17 staff, costing 12m kroner (£1.4m), Bloomberg reported.

Featured Story U2 tickets selling for whopping 900 euros each DUBLIN, Ireland - With epic rock band, U2 set to perform at a concert in Croke Park in July this year - a flurry of activity has been witnessed around ticket sales already.  Tickets are set to go on sale officially from tomorrow - however, a day before the official sales begin, tickets to watch the band perform live are already being sold and for nothing less than a whopping 900 euros each.  According to reports, fans that subscribed to the band’s official website were granted access to a pre-sale ticket portal last week and industry sources revealed that diehard fans with access to these tickets have chosen to sell them for a profit.  A set of tickets are said to have become available on official and black market websites since last week.  Tickets available currently on websites like Seatwave and Viagogo are being sold at prices higher than face value.  Officially, tickets for the Lower Davin Stand and pitch area of Croke Park have been priced at 76 euros, along with an extra charge of 3.30 euros for agent fees. Meanwhile, those in other parts of the Cusack and Hogan stands carry a value between 110 euros to 186 euros. But on these websites, the prices have been jacked up.   As of Sunday night, Seatwave, that is run by Ticketmaster, had advertised for 650 tickets that were available for sale.  Reports pointed ut that a pair of tickets was sold at 2,070 euros over the weekend and was for the standing section. It included extra charges and was priced at 13 times above face value.  A spokesperson for Ticketmaster defended the sale in a statement that said that Seatwave prices were set by the person selling the tickets and not the company. The spokesperson said, “The thing about Seatwave is that it is a safe and secure market so tickets would be genuine. The ticket prices are set by the seller, which in this instance is not Ticketmaster, but that price may not necessarily be secured by the seller. Ticketmaster is just facilitating the sale."

The President-elect threatened to impose a "big border tax" on the company for making its Chevy Cruze model in Mexico. GM shares slipped 1% in pre-market trading after Mr Trump made the remarks in a tweet - though they later improved and turned 1% higher shortly after Wall Street opened. Mr Trump wrote: "General Motors is sending Mexican-made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers tax free across border. "Make in USA or pay big border tax!" GM becomes the latest US industrial giant to feel the brunt of Mr Trump's remarks ahead of his inauguration later this month. Mr Trump has previously taken aim at aerospace manufacturers Lockheed and Boeing over contracts with the US government he has claimed were too expensive. Mr Trump has been critical of car giant Ford in the past over its investments in Mexico. More broadly he has threatened to slap tariffs of 35% on imports of products made by companies that have moved production out of the US, and said he would tear up a major trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. Last month he warned that firms shifting jobs away from America could be "making a very expensive mistake" and  would face "retribution or consequence". Mr Trump has also pledged to lower the corporate tax rate and scale back regulations to create a better climate in the US for business. General Motors brands include the Chevrolet, Cadillac and Buick as well as Germany's Opel and Britain's Vauxhall. GM said that it makes the sedan model of its Chevy Cruze in the US and that all of those sold in the US were made at a plant in Ohio. A hatchback version is made for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the US, it said in a statement. (c) Sky News 2017: Donald Trump threatens General Motors with 'big border tax!'

These include two critical requirements of the military — construction of submarines under project P 75I and manufacturing of a foreign fighter aircraft in India. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Tuesday said: “As far as the strategic partnership is concerned, the discussions are at a final stage. There are a few steps which need to be recorded so that the document is not half-cooked.” But top sources in the ministry told The Indian Express that while they are keen on the SP model, serious differences within the ministry is stalling its progress. Sources agreed that certain defence projects are ready to take-off but await finalisation of the policy. At least three critical defence projects await finalisation of the SP model so that they can go into production under the ‘Make in India’ scheme. The Navy’s submarine fleet needs urgent replacements, which shall be provided by submarines constructed under Project 75I, approved by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) many months ago. The same is the case with the Naval Utility Helicopters, which also await a decision on the Indian manufacturer. Equally critical is the IAF’s desperate need for another combat aircraft to supplement the 36 Rafale fighters in the medium weight category. Three foreign companies, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Saab, are in contention for making their fighters — F-16, F-18 and Gripen — in India but have been told by ministry officials that a decision will be taken only after the finalisation of the SP model.© Provided by Indian Express A committee under former DRDO chief V K Aatre submitted its report on the criteria for selecting the private companies, so that the SP model could be a part of the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP). First proposed in July 2015 by the Dhirendra Singh Committee, the SP model envisaged identifying a private Indian defence firm for assured contracts for all requirements of a particular military platform. It meant that a company like L&T, if selected, would get all the contracts for making submarines in India while Tatas, if chosen, would make all the planes in India for the next 20 years. A committee under former DRDO chief V K Aatre submitted its report on the criteria for selecting the private companies, so that the SP model could be a part of the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP). When the DPP was issued after much delay in March 2016, the chapter on SP model was missing. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar thereafter met with representatives of industry groups to arrive at an amicable model, and formed an internal committee in the ministry to finalise the SP model. The Indian Express has learnt that the Department of Defence Production has been the biggest opponent of this model, calling it ab initio flawed and unsuited for implementation in the Indian landscape. The acquisition wing of the ministry wants two or more companies to be selected as strategic partners for each platform, which would allow for price discovery through competitive bidding. The Department of Defence is strongly in favour of the SP model, which it believes is the only way to kick-start defence production in the private sector in India. It is arguing for a model where a single private company is selected and the price then determined on a cost-plus model. Those opposed to the idea argue that even defence public sector units have done away with the cost-plus model, which was seen as a reason for highly inflated costs for indigenously-produced equipment. In the view of the Department of Defence Finance, the total quantum of assured deals being made over the next two decades would bring the SP model into the ambit of big ticket procurement. This would exceed the powers of the ministry which are limited to Rs 1,000 crore. Any such proposal would have to thus go for approval to the Cabinet Committee on Security, which is bound to insist on a competitive process. Besides allegations of impropriety and favouritism that would accompany a selection of a strategic partner, opponents of the SP model also worry about the flurry of legal challenges from losing companies after one of their competitors is selected. So vehement have been the objections raised within the ministry that the SP model was not even taken up for consideration in the last DAC meeting, chaired by Parrikar, on December 21. Parrikar, however, said a meeting on finalising the SP model will be held sometime next week and we can “expect results very soon”.

He wrote on Twitter, “China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Trump’s words are alarming, but his claim is groundless. The Boeing Company sees China as a $1 trillion market. Chinese President Xi Jinping toured the company’s commercial airplane factory in Everett, Washington, in September 2016. At the welcome ceremony, President Xi noted Boeing’s cooperation with China and praised the win-win results. The results are backed by solid data. According to a report by Bloomberg, the company has delivered 967 aircraft to China since 2000, worth about $60.2 billion at 2016 prices. The vice chairman of the company said deliveries to China by Boeing support approximately 150,000 American jobs every year. Chinese companies create jobs and fight unemployment in America. Golden Dragon, a Chinese company based in Xinxiang, China, invested nearly $100 million to build a large copper-tube plant in Thomasville City, Alabama, employing about 150 people in one of the poorest regions in America. At the grand opening in May 2014, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley called Golden Dragon a “significant opportunity for the people of Wilcox County.” It was the first manufacturing project in the county in over half a century. If Trump wants to rebuild America, he will be happy to know that Chinese investors are making trade and investment between the two countries a two-way street. According to a report by the Rhodium Group, the U.S. became the largest recipient of China’s outbound foreign direct investment in 2016, with $45.6 billion worth of acquisitions and investments, and direct investment by Chinese in the U.S. economy since 2000 exceeds $100 billion. China is the top market for Apple and GM, and Telsa and other companies are building their brands in China. Companies both big and small understand the importance of China’s huge market, including The Trump Organization. Trump Hotels plans to open 20-30 luxury hotels in China, according to a report by The Washington Post. However, misunderstandings about the China-U.S. relationship persist, even within the President-elect’s small inner circle. Michael Flynn, who will advise Trump on important national security issues, believes China is allied with “radical Islamists.” In his book, The Field of Fight, Flynn makes the argument that China is a member of an “enemy alliance” in a global war against the West. His claim is not based on solid facts, and this type of thinking is dangerous if he advices the next President in this way. Fortunately, most Americans do not share the incoming administration’s fondness for fake news and conspiracy theories about China. In June 2016, Flynn tweeted that he was “now following” China, and asked users to “please send me anything you get on China activities.” The humorous responses show the deep interconnectedness between China and the U.S. Below are some of them: @stanleyfosha tweeted: “Sir, report from the field. Discovered a coded [message] on the label indicating China manufactured this keyboard.” @liguy743 tweeted: “They have a huge population. People in orbit. Lander on Moon. Nukes. Bigly army. Lots of US T-bills,” then added, “Chk CIA factbook for details.” @marvelle tweeted: “We’ve got 4 suspicious Chinese nationals under surveillance in DC,” and included a link to the Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s Panda Cams. @BruceNV tweeted: “They just started non-stop flights to Vegas. Might be the start of the invasion,” then added, “[Can’t] tell if they are staying [at The Trump Organization].” @dtom_dangerzone tweeted: “There is an unusual amount of activity near the Shenzhen area. Lots of technology being made... investigating.” Trump and his inner circle at the White House need to develop a realistic understanding of the China-U.S. relationship. The amusing comments under Flynn’s tweet show that China and the U.S. are in a deep, interconnected relationship; not just economically, but also on cultural and people-to-people exchange fronts. If random Internet users know the reality, Trump and his inner circle should too.

The president-elect has repeatedly tweeted about some of these companies, including Ford, and pressing them to keep jobs in the U.S. Ford said today that it didn’t consult with Mr. Trump on their Michigan decision. Josh Boak has been covering the story for the Associated Press. And he joins me now. So, Josh, bring us up to speed. What did Ford agree to do today? JOSH BOAK, Associated Press: Ford announced that it wasn’t going to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. There were a few reasons for that, one of which was that the plant was going to build Ford Focuses. And sales of that car have dipped as oil prices have fallen. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is a little, small, fuel-efficient vehicle. JOSH BOAK: Exactly. But the other major impact has been Donald Trump on Twitter talking about companies and what he wants to see them do, and those two seem to have combined together. Ford’s own CEO said he hoped that Trump’s policies on deregulation and taxes would be good for the company and good for the country. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As we mentioned before, this follows moves where Trump has targeted other companies, Carrier, Boeing, Lockheed Martin. And companies have shifted their positions based according to what Mr. Trump seems to be saying. Overall, how many jobs are we talking about here that are going to be staying in the U.S.? JOSH BOAK: Well, as far as Ford’s announcement today, they’re looking to hire 700 workers starting in 2018. When we look at Carrier, that’s 800 jobs. When we look last week at Sprint, that’s 5,000 jobs. OneWeb, that’s 3,000 jobs. Now, that sounds like a lot in an individual announcement, but the U.S. economy is massive. It added 2.25 million jobs last year alone. That’s so great, that this is really a drop in the bucket in the big picture. But it’s massive symbolically. We can’t forget that part of economics is psychology and the animal spirits, and Trump is really stirring them right now. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, do you credit these moves to Donald Trump? I mean, he would love to take credit for them, and we have seen him do that many times in the past. Do you credit him with what we saw out of Ford today? JOSH BOAK: Well, many of the chief executives involved in these decisions are crediting Donald Trump or attributing their decisions to him. And they have benefited from that. Last week, with the Sprint deal, for example, we saw Masayoshi Son say this has been the result of actions by the Trump administration. And giving credit to Donald Trump has actually been good for these companies. Sprint’s stock is up more than 40 percent, as of last Friday, since Trump became president. So, if the bottom line is what these CEOs really care about, then being on Trump’s side thus far has been profitable. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, how much of this — getting back to the point you made, how much of this is about economics and how much of this is about politics? Is this about a substantial change in manufacturing policy by these companies, or is this about being on the right side of public opinion? JOSH BOAK: Well, it’s critical to note there actually hasn’t been a policy change, just a series of tweets and public statements and phone calls. We haven’t seen a policy overhaul. We have seen the promise of policy overhauls on regulatory and tax issues, but those haven’t been manifest yet. So what this really appears to be is a president-elect able to exercise power on social media in a way that’s unprecedented. And corporations have seen benefits to responding to that. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We saw President-elect Trump leaning on GM today. Is this, in your mind, just the new paradigm, that companies in the U.S. have to prepare for the fact that you might have the president-elect or the soon-to-be president just naming them and shaming them? JOSH BOAK: It’s definitely possible. Business leaders I have talked to have said that they expect to have a bullseye on them. But what we have also seen talking with members of the Trump transition team is that Donald Trump sees these actions and interventions as a way to stay connected with his voting base. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think that these — as you mentioned, this is not necessarily a reflection of a new policy. Like, do you have any sense how Trump might — how this might translate, these actions might translate into a more cohesive economic policy going forward? JOSH BOAK: Well, he ran on the premise of America first. And that was all part of the greater make America great again theme. He’s clearly said that he wants to increase manufacturing jobs. And so this seems to be a component of that. The question is how he goes about that. We don’t have the policy details, although he has suggested that he will impose a border tax of some kind on companies that move jobs overseas. He’s also suggested that he’s going to cut regulation, which increases profits for a lot of these companies. What remains to be seen is whether he can create jobs on a meaningful scale and generate the kind of economic growth that’s he’s actually promised, about 3.5 percent a year. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It seems to be he has got a carrots-and-sticks policy going here. He’s going to offer them, potentially, less regulations and thus lower taxes, and then also threaten to put this tax on them if they try to leave the country. Do you think that there’s an appetite in Congress to actually put those measures into place? JOSH BOAK: Well, that remains to be seen. What executives like Ford CEO Mark Fields has said when he talks about his decision on Mexico is to say — is to emphasize the taxes and deregulation. He is focusing on the carrots, not the sticks. Business leaders are emphasizing those carrots, which means that they either don’t want to address the sticks or they don’t think the sticks are likely to happen. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You have obviously been covering economic policy for a long time. How unusual is this, to have a president-elect naming companies by name and singling them — singling them out, and then them responding? JOSH BOAK: It’s unprecedented because he hasn’t assumed office yet. More importantly, he’s doing so on social media and other venues that presidents historically have not had. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just because it hasn’t existed. JOSH BOAK: Exactly. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Josh Boak, AP, thank you very much for being here. JOSH BOAK: Thank you.

(U.S. Marine Corps photo/Thor Larson) Posted By: Richard Sisk January 3, 2017 Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis — Donald Trump’s choice for defense secretary — backed the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet program recently criticized by the president-elect, according to a senator who met with Mattis on Tuesday. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Hartford Courant newspaper that Mattis gave a “clear commitment” to the continuation of the F-35 program despite Trump’s repeated criticism of its huge costs and questionable performance thus far. In an earlier statement, Blumenthal said of his meeting with Mattis, “I was encouraged by his clear commitment to American air superiority and the important role of the F-35 program in sustaining and enhancing it.” United Technologies Corp., which has headquarters in Hartford, supplies the engines for the Lockheed Martin Corp.-made F-35 and thousands of jobs in Connecticut are dependent on continuation of the program. Trump last month said the costs of the F-35 program, projected at more than $400 billion for development and procurement of nearly 2,500 aircraft, were “out of control” and suggested that he may consider replacing it with a version of the F-18E/F Super Hornet made by competitor Boeing Co. Lockheed Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson met with Trump before Christmas and pledged to revamp the program. “I’ve heard his message loud and clear about reducing the cost of the F-35,” she said in a statement. “I gave him my personal commitment to drive the cost down aggressively.” Mattis has a reputation for independence and his backing of the F-35 would not be the first time that his judgment has been at odds with Trump’s. In lavishing praise on Mattis during the announcement of his choice of defense secretary, Trump said it was a revelation to him when Mattis rejected the use of so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques” on suspected terrorists. Trump said Mattis told him that he could get more out a prisoner with “a few beers and a pack of cigarettes” than he could with torture. Mattis met with Blumenthal in the course of making the rounds on Capitol Hill to ease his path to getting the waiver that would allow him to serve as defense secretary in the new Trump administration. Mattis, often referred to as “Mad Dog” by Trump, also met with Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and others ahead of the panel’s hearing next week on the required waiver and his qualifications to succeed outgoing Defense Secretary Ashton Carter. Before he can be confirmed by the Senate, Mattis will need special legislation from Congress exempting him from the federal law barring members of the military from serving as defense secretary until seven years after retirement. Mattis retired from the Marine Corps and his last post as head of U.S. Central Command in 2013. Enacted after World War II, the law was aimed at preserving civilian control of the military. The only waiver previously granted was to Gen. George C. Marshall, the Army chief of staff during the last world war. Mattis, a legend in the Marine Corps for his leadership in Iraq and Afghanistan, has widespread support for the nomination but some senators have expressed reservations about granting the waiver. In a statement last month after Trump announced that Mattis was his choice, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat and member of the defense committee, said, “While I deeply respect Gen. Mattis’ service, I will oppose a waiver. Civilian control of our military is a fundamental principle of American democracy, and I will not vote for an exception to this rule.” In his own statement last month, Reed said, “It is clear that Gen. Mattis is a respected Marine and strategic thinker who served with honor and distinction. What is less clear is how Congress would go about changing the law to allow him or any recently retired senior officer to serve as the head of the Pentagon. That would require ‎a debate about our Constitutional principle of civilian control of the military and passing a new bill.” Previous post Next post About the Author Richard Sisk Richard Sisk is a reporter for Military.com.

Democrats would have you believe that people who have been magnificently financially profitable in America are somehow disqualified from helping shape American policy. But here’s a different way of looking at the Cabinet Mr. Trump has assembled: This may be the most successful group of people brought together to serve a common purpose in Washington in at least the last 50 years. The list of those willing to bring their expertise to the aid of their country keeps growing. But let’s consider as an example the billionaire that Mr. Trump announced last month as his special adviser on regulatory issues: investor Carl Icahn. Mr. Icahn will not draw a salary or be considered a government employee. And that appears to be more than Democrats can bear. They are lambasting this as an insider arrangement that will somehow benefit Mr. Icahn. Democratic National Committee spokesman Eric Walker went so far as to say, “The corrupt nature of this arrangement cannot be understated [sic]. Voters who wanted Trump to drain the swamp just got another face full of mud.” Really? How is Mr. Icahn generously volunteering his time and knowledge to help rein in President Barack Obama’s excessive era of regulations proof of corruption? If you remember, Mr. Obama tapped a number of CEOs to join his President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, including Jeffrey R. Immelt, who served as council chair while he was also the chairman of General Electric. Jim McNerney, chairman and CEO of Boeing, and AOL co-founder Steve Case also sat on the council, along with numerous other American business leaders. If they were able to advise Mr. Obama on “ways to create jobs, opportunity and prosperity for the American people” without being corrupt, why is it that a guy like Mr. Icahn can’t help Mr. Trump identify ways that regulations may hinder economic growth? And, oh, by the way, Mr. Trump might actually listen to Mr. Icahn’s recommendations and implement changes to help boost the American economy. As I said in 2012, Mr. Obama’s creation of a jobs council was “nothing more than a throwaway talking point for his apologencia to use to try to mask the truth of his anti-capitalist core beliefs.” The jobs council met only four times before it fell apart. The fact is, Mr. Obama used the business leaders on the council as props designed to suggest he cared about business. What a joke. The president who famously declared “You didn’t build that” when talking about productive American business owners wasn’t actually interested in what the council might have had to say. We should be grateful that people like Mr. Icahn are willing to participate and give the president-elect advice. And good for Mr. Trump for recognizing that involving accomplished business leaders will be beneficial to the economy. This move further reinforces that business is back. Mr. Trump’s welcoming of business leaders is wildly different from Mr. Obama’s open contempt for entrepreneurs and business owners. We should want the most successful people we have to feel welcome to chip in and, dare I say, work to make America great again.

 'One our adversaries should fear': US Air Force General describes how the F-35 is above and beyond the competition Amanda Macias Jan. 5, 2017, 10:56 AM 26,832 facebook linkedin twitter email print An F-35A joint strike fighter crew chief, Tech. Sgt. Brian West, watches his aircraft approach for the first time at Eglin Air Force Base on July 14, 2011. Samuel King Jr./US Air Force WASHINGTON — Greeting me upon arrival in the doorway to his office, US Air Force Brig. Gen. Scott Pleus, dressed in an olive green flight suit, offered his hand. From his direct eye contact, exact manner of speaking, and overall subject-matter discipline, it's clear he's a command pilot. Brig. Gen. Scott Pleus, then-56th Fighter Wing commander, steps to his first F-35A sortie flight at Luke Air Force Base on March 18, 2015. Senior Airman Devante Williams/US Air Force I'm here to ask him about milestones, setbacks, misconceptions, and his work as a wing commander, pilot, and now director of the integration office for America's priciest weapons system: the F-35 Lightning II. Before coming to the Pentagon to head the integration office, Pleus spent 24 years flying the F-16 with just north of 2,200 flight hours, followed by two years as the commander of the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke Air Force Base. While at Luke, Pleus welcomed a unique challenge: Develop the next-generation of lethal F-35 fighter pilots. Within a few months, the first student for the 56th Fighter Wing began F-35 training — it was Pleus. Now headquartered at the Pentagon for a little over five months, Pleus is the single voice for the US Air Force to the F-35's Joint Program Office. I glance at the commemorative plaques lining his office walls before he offers me a seat at a polished conference table. "So what's the biggest misconception about this program that you want to leave behind in 2016?" I ask. 'It's not a real airplane' One of three US Air Force F-35As at the Fairford Royal Air Force base in the UK on June 30, 2016. Angel Delcueto/Lockheed Martin "I'll use an analogy that I heard a few years ago," Pleus began. "The F-35 was an airplane on paper only," he added. "The F-35 was a capability that was only on paper — it has not been proven. Yeah, maybe there are some test pilots that are flying it, but it's too far away and it's not a real airplane." Brig. Gen. Scott Pleus, 56th Fighter Wing commander, prepares to exit the cockpit after his final flight in an F-35A on June 27, 2016. Airman 1st Class Ridge Shan/US Air Force "That is my overall biggest misconception about the airplane," said Pleus. "We have pilots that are flying it and executing missions today that simulate a combat environment, and we know that this airplane has capabilities that are far better than we could have ever hoped for in a fourth-generation aircraft." "I can tell you that it is by far the best platform I've ever flown in my entire life, and at that you would have to take me on my word." In August 2016, Gen. Herbert "Hawk" Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, declared initial operational capability (IOC) for a squadron of F-35A's — a significant breakthrough for the weapons program, which has been beset by design flaws, cost overruns, and technical challenges. "Initial operating capability is a huge milestone because what you're saying is this is not necessarily just a developmental airplane anymore. This is a real thing. We could on that day have sent those airplanes into combat the next day," Pleus said. Since IOC, the US Air Force has trained more than 120 pilots in 100 F-35As, accruing a combined total of 75,000 hours of flight time. 'One our adversaries should fear' On February 16, 2012, the first external-weapons-test mission was flown by an F-35A at Edwards Air Force Base. Lockheed Martin In preparing to sit down with Pleus, I recalled comments he made at the Air Force Association's annual conference in September. "In terms of lethality and survivability, the aircraft is absolutely head and shoulders above our legacy fleet of fighters currently fielded," he said at the time. "This is an absolutely formidable airplane, and one our adversaries should fear." So I followed up, asking him, as one of the few people who have flown both an F-16 and an F-35, what's it like to engage an F-35? "You never knew I was there," he said with a smile. "You literally would never know I'm there. I flew the F-35 against other fourth-generation platforms and we killed them and they never even saw us." "If you were to engage an F-35 in say, a visual dogfight capability," he added, "the capabilities of the F-35 are absolutely eye-watering compared to a fourth-generation fighter." "The airplane has unbelievable maneuvering characteristics that make it completely undefeatable in an air-to-air environment. So if it's a long-range contact, you'll never see me and you'll die, and if it's within visual-range contact you'll see me and you're gonna die and you're gonna die very quickly," said Pleus, who has 153 flight hours in the F-35. An F-35B from Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501, flies near its base a MCAS Beaufort, South Carolina. Lockheed Martin To date, the US is slated to buy  2,443  F-35s at an acquisition cost of $379 billion. In December, the Joint Program Office  released the finalized price for the most recent production contract for the fifth-generation jet. After a little more than 14 months of negotiations between the Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin, the ninth Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP-9) contract for 57 F-35 jets was valued at $6.1 billion. The LRIP-9, which is essentially the ninth batch of jets, includes 34 jets for the US and 23 for five other countries.  Here’s the price tag for the latest batch of F35s » The US Air Force, getting the lion's share of F-35s, bought 42 planes in LRIP-9 and paid $102.1 million a jet, which includes aircraft, engine, and fee. By comparison, that $102.1 million is down from the previous contract by 5.5%, which equates to  $5.9 million. Six F-35As at Edwards Air Force Base are seen before a flight test on May 27, 2011. Lockheed Martin The first step on the F-35's journey to becoming the centerpiece of fusion warfare began on October 26, 2001, when the Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a contract worth more than $200 billion to build the next-generation stealth strike-fighter. The Pentagon's request was colossal: Develop a supersonic fifth-generation aircraft with the capability to replace four existing kinds of US military aircraft but also to be used by multiple international partners.  What's more, design three variants of the fighter in order to accommodate the unique needs of each sister-service branch: the F-35A for the Air Force, F-35B for the amphibious Marine Corps, and F-35C for the Navy. Having already engineered stealth aircraft — F-117A Nighthawk and F-22 Raptor — Lockheed Martin was playing on their home court. A view of the F-35 production line at Lockheed Martin's facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Courtesy of Lockheed Martin The cradle of the F-35, with its slick floors, high ceilings, brightly painted assembly areas, and machinery hum, is where I saw the Joint Strike Fighter for the first time. Riding in a golf cart through Lockheed Martin's mile-long production facility in Fort Worth, Texas, I watched the neatly organized bins of nuts and bolts, jet wings, and sophisticated electronics evolve into a seafoam green airframe. Once assembled, the planes roll into a windowless complex devoted to draping the F-35 in its invisibility cloak. "This room is the most advanced painting facility in the world," retired US Air Force pilot and F-35 simulation instructor Rick Royer told me as we entered the Aircraft Final Finishes bay. It's here where the jet receives its highly classified stealth technology that makes it almost invisible to enemy radar. It's here where the US military leaps ahead of emerging threats. It's here  where the  most expensive weapons system in American history is crafted. And whatever its shortcomings, developing a platform of this magnitude is undoubtedly impressive. 'The only experts in the F-35 business, are those that fix, maintain, and fly the F-35' Maj. Gen. Jay Silveria, US Air Force Warfare Center commander, walks out to an F-35A with Lt. Col. Matt Renbarger, 58th Fighter Squadron commander, on September 26, 2014, at Eglin Air Force Base. US Air Force photo At the aforementioned Air Force Association's annual conference, Pleus sat on a panel alongside commander of Air Combat Command, Gen. Herbert "Hawk" Carlisle, F-35A Joint Strike Fighter Program executive officer Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, and commander of the 388th Fighter Wing Col. David Lyons. Pleus began his remarks, his delivery blunt and confident, "I'm hopeful that as we continue to grow this fleet, we all take the opportunity to form opinions on this airplane from experts.  And the only experts in the F-35 business, are those that fix, maintain, and fly the F-35 on a day-to-day basis." "Whether they be at Eglin, Luke, Edwards, Nellis, or Hill, if you go and talk to them they will give you the ground truth. If you are forming your opinions by somebody that has not fixed or flown the airplane I would tell you you're wrong." The room couldn't have been more quiet. Gen. Hawk Carlisle, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, Brig. Gen. Scott Pleus and Col. David Lyons, speak during a panel at the Air Force Association's Air, Space and Cyber Conference on September 20, 2016. Tech. Sgt. Anthony Nelson Jr./US Air Force Sitting at the head of a conference table in his office, Pleus had the same intensity I remember from the panel discussion at AFA. An F-35A performs a test flight on March 28, 2013. Lockheed Martin "This airplane is out there." "We got real pilots flying it, real maintenance guys working on it, and if you ask the experts — and my definition of an expert is you either flew it, fought against it, or you fixed it — if one of those three things you are now considered an expert on the F-35," Pleus said. We spent a day with the people who fly and fix the F-35. Here's what they have to say about the most expensive weapons project in history » "If you haven't done any of those things, go find one of those people and ask them what they think about the airplane, and they'll tell you the truth." At first blush, the F-35 is easy to criticize, with its much chronicled cost overruns, faulty ejection seats, and helmet-display issues, among other problems. While I won't rehash, Pleus noted that the  F-35A's 75,000 flying hours didn't go off without a hitch and addressed some of the program's more substantial setbacks in 2016.  Successes and setbacks Airmen from the 33rd Maintenance Group perform checks on an F-35A Lightning II prior to a hot pit refueling session at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. US Air Force Photo "The biggest setback was an instability issue on 3i software," Pleus said thoughtfully. "The instability was not found out until we released the software to our test community, and they found that the fusion system onboard the airplane with the sensors was having trouble talking to each other." An F-35A test flight at Edwards Air Force Base on May 15, 2012. Lockheed Martin "So one computer is trying to talk and the other computer is trying to talk at the same time and they basically shut themselves down," Pleus explained. The 3i software hang-up, which took about four months to solve, caused a delay that will impact the installment of the 3F software, which delivers the plane's full warfare capability. Another setback, which Pleus labeled a "success," was the polyalphaolefin insulation issue discovered during an inspection at Nellis Air Force Base. "Polyalphaolefin is kind of a coolant that runs through a system of pipes throughout the entire airplane to cool off the computers and some of the hardware onboard the plane. There was a vendor that produced the wrong insulation on one of the pipes and that insulation swole up and cracked and came apart from the pipes," Pleus said. The problem came less than two months after the Air Force declared IOC and resulted in the temporary grounding of 15 jets.  "I think personally that that is a pretty big success story for two reasons, the first one was that we caught it very early in the process. So through very rigorous inspections that we have on the airplanes from a mechanical standpoint, it was noted very early." "The second thing — because the way the program is built we knew exactly what airplanes by tail number by exact location, cause it was actually two manufacturers — so we knew which manufacturer had the good pipe and which manufacturer had the bad pipe and we knew exactly where it was." "You say that is a success but what would you say to people who call that a significant setback?" I asked.  "My counter to that would be that there was absolutely no setback. The airplanes that we had that were operational and flying. We had a total of 13 of them that were United States Air Force airplanes and two of them were Norwegian airplanes and they were scattered at Hill Air Force Base, Nellis Air Force Base, and Luke Air Force Base. Those airplanes, once the insulation fault was discovered, while they didn't fly for a period of time there was no operational impact from a training perspective or a combat-capability perspective." "There was also additional airplanes that Lockheed Martin had in the assembly line process that had these insulation issues associated with it and t he assembly line never stopped. That would be in my mind a huge setback to the program, what they did was continued those airplanes and fixed them as they came out." "So those airplanes will all be delivered a few months late but still on schedule for the release of the airplanes. So from my standpoint, t hat bore no cost to the program. The United States Air Force, Department of the Navy and the Joint Programming Office did not pay a single penny for that." A F-35B aircraft approaches a KC-130J Super Hercules aircraft to refuel as it flies over the North Sea, having taken off from RAF Fairford on July 1, 2016. Matt Cardy/Getty Images Since speaking with Pleus, the F-35's saga continues. On December 22, President-elect Donald Trump announced via tweet that he asked Boeing to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet." Trump's request came a day after meeting separately with the CEOs from Lockheed Martin and Boeing to discuss bringing the "costs down" on the F-35 and the next fleet of presidential aircraft. Boeing's response — also announced via tweet — said it accepted the invitation to work with the Trump administration to " affordably meet US military requirements." F-35 chief: 'This program is not out of control' » Pleus noted a few upcoming events for the F-35A in 2017. The Air Force plans to debut the F-35A at Red Flag, the pinnacle of combat training, later this month and lasting until February. Following the training at Red Flag, the F-35A will participate in a  theater security package, which is a small deployment to what Pleus called an "austere-type location." "One of the good examples you can think of is we send F-22s to Kadena Air Force Base, and they'll be there a couple of months," he said. "They go to a base that's not necessarily use to having F-22s on it, and they train, they practice, they do all the things that they would normally do and then they'll redeploy back to their home. We do that with almost all of our fighter aircraft in the United States ... and we send them to both the Pacific theater as well as the European theater." A third highlight this year will be when the 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base reaches its full capacity of airplanes in the fall. "That means that not only will they have their 24 primary assigned aircraft but they will also have the right contingent of properly trained pilots and properly trained maintenance as well as their intelligence folks. At that point, you have a full squadron that a combatant commander would be looking for for a true combat role."

 This app will send you alerts when Donald Trump tweets about stocks you own Nathan McAlone Jan. 4, 2017, 6:30 PM 12,123 facebook linkedin twitter email print Donald Trump. Carlo Allegri/Reuters When President-elect Donald Trump tweets about a public company, the market listens.  And if you hold the stock of one of the companies that has come into Trump's crosshairs, finance app Trigger thinks you'll want to know about it. The free iPhone app works by letting you set up financial "triggers," which you can then use to guide your investment decisions. For example, you can set a reminder to sell a stock when its price reaches a certain level, moves a specific percentage, hits a one-year low or high, and so on. When the condition occurs, Trigger sends you a notification, and you can decide whether to act on it. Now the company has rolled out a special "Trump trigger." The trigger "gives you the ability to trade stocks based off of Trump’s tweets about public companies," the startup wrote. Basically, the trigger works by notifying you if Trump tweets about a publicly traded stock that you own, in real time. Trump has tweeted about companies from Apple to Amazon to AT&T — and that's just the A's. In some cases, such as when Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of a new Air Force One jet, the aerospace company's stock immediately fell nearly 2%. Should this pattern continue during Trump's presidency, it's not difficult to see why investors might want to be quickly alerted to tweets about their holdings.  Trigger Trigger characterized the Trump trigger as the first step toward the startup using "not just price based data but relevant world events to condense into simple IF this, THEN that rules."

In that time, it had trained its troops primarily for that mission and bought gear specifically for those nebulous conflicts. But the world seemed to be getting more complicated and troops would need new weapons and gear to help deal with these threats. So, the ground combat branch went on a modernization blitz. In December 2016, the Army released a “top 10” list of its modernization efforts. The programs ranged from vehicles to aircraft to individual weapons and medical equipment. In March 2014, Russia seized control of Ukraine’s Crimea Peninsula. Moscow then began to supply tank and artillery support to insurgents fighting the government in Kiev, reigniting concerns about a potential conventional ground conflict in Europe between traditionally armed opponents. Shortly thereafter, Islamic State spilled over from Syria into Iraq, kicking off a regional crisis. The group’s dramatic rise promised years of new, if limited fighting against terrorists in the Middle East and elsewhere. Suddenly the Army found itself searching for tools to deal with what it dubbed a “hybrid” of high- and low-tech foes. The enemy was often “elusive and ambiguous,” US Army Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, the service’s Vice Chief of Staff, said on Oct. 27, 2016. Legislators and experts routinely criticized the service for focusing too much on militants and terrorists. By 2017, it was true that the Army’s tanks, helicopters, mobile howitzers and rocket launchers and many other major systems were simply improved versions of decades old designs. To be fair, the Army had been working steadily on improving its equipment since the end of the Cold War. However, it had suffered a number of high-profile setbacks in the process. Between 1991 and 2010, the Pentagon had ultimately canceled the advanced Future Combat Systems armored vehicles, the deadly Crusader self-propelled howitzer and the futuristic RAH-66 Comanche stealth helicopter despite millions of dollars in existing investments. Congress-approved automatic budget cuts — a process known as sequestration — did not help matters. But none of that meant America’s ground combat branch was standing still. Above — the Stryker Dragoon. At top — BAE’s prototype Armored Multipurpose Vehicle. Image: US Army photos New vehicles, large and small By 2016, the Army had endured nearly 30 years full of failed attempts to improve to its vehicle fleets — particularly the M-1 Abrams tank and M-2 and M-3 Bradley fighting vehicles. The biggest success story was the service’s purchase of the controversial Stryker wheeled armored vehicle. In 2009, the Pentagon canned the ambitious Future Combat Systems program. At least on paper, that project promised the Army a whole suite of new tanks, armored personnel carriers and mobile artillery pieces. In addition, wheeled drones would work with troops on foot. Attempts to salvage the infantry fighting vehicle portion to replace the aging Bradleys ran into still more difficulties. So it was important for the service to close out 2016 making progress on a simpler project to finally replace hundreds of Cold War-era M-113 armored personnel carriers. The new Armored Multipurpose Vehicle — aka AMPV — held the potential to become a stepping stone to replacing other vehicles, including the M-2 and M-3. In December 2016, defense contractor BAE Systems delivered the first prototype AMPV — effectively a version of the Bradley without a the gun- and missile-armed turret. Two months earlier, the Army had still not decided whether this particular type would be the basis for all of the variants it had in mind, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. Separately, the Army was working with General Dynamics and Kongsberg Defense Systems to give the lighter Stryker more firepower. The infantry versions of the eight-wheeled armored vehicles could carry only one .50 caliber machine gun or a 40-millimeter automatic grenade launcher. Together, the American and Norwegian firms created the new Stryker Dragoon, featuring a fully-enclosed turret on top with a hard-hitting 30-millimeter cannon. Army commanders in Europe had specifically asked for the improved armament to counter potential Russian threats. “The Russians, it turns out, had upgraded and fielded significant capabilities while we were engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Allyn said at a General Dynamics’ facility in Michigan as the company debuted the new vehicle in October 2016. This presented an “unacceptable risk” for American troops. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the Army was making progress on replacing the iconic Humvee light vehicles with a new, better protected truck called the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, or JLTV. In March 2016, after nearly a decade of tests, trials and contract protests, the ground combat branch placed the first actual order for the vehicles. Oshkosh’s winning vehicle was a derivative of its earlier M-ATV mine-resistant vehicle. If everything goes according to plan, the initial run JLTVs will come in four flavors, a utility version, a general purpose vehicle, a heavy machine gun carrier and an obtusely named “close combat weapons carrier” armed with the TOW anti-tank missile — that same basic missions existing Hummers perform. Despite starting to purchase the new vehicles, the Army hopes to at least replace the traditional internal combustion motors in trucks like the JLTV in the near future. With improved engines, the Army could trim how much it has to spend filling gas tanks and reduce its reliance on oil-based fuels. So, another top Army modernization effort in 2016 was a program to design a an experimental hydrogen-fuel-cell powerplant. With help from General Motors, the ground combat branch unveiled a test-bed truck with the prototype motor in October 2016. An M-109A7 self-propelled howitzer, still with the old gun. Image: US Army photo New weapons for enemies at long and short ranges In 2002, the Pentagon canceled the Army’s Crusader self-propelled howitzer. The ground combat branch included plans for another new, long-range mobile gun in the ill-fated Future Combat Systems program. So, in 2016, artillery troops were found themselves still riding around in the M-109A6 Paladin mobile howitzer — a derivative of a vehicle that first entered service in 1962. Despite a new upgrade program, allies and potential enemies alike were increasingly out-ranging American soldiers. The same was true for their M-777 155-millimeter towed guns. The Army entered 2017 with existing work on a new, long-range gun barrel that it might be able to install on its existing weapons. The prototype M-777ER — standing for extended range — can hit targets more than 40 miles away. This is more than twice the range of the existing weapon. The modified cannon tube adds six feet and less than 1,000 pounds to the original setup. The Army expects the weapon will fit on the new M-109A7. Engineers do still have some problems to solve. The extra length means the gun might flex, bend or break as crews travel from one location to another. Also in 2016, the Army began the first major improvements to its hand grenades in four decades. The new weapon would give individual troops more options to take out enemies at closer ranges. Unlike with existing designs, the Army wants soldiers to be able to switch the “enhanced” grenade from “defensive” to “offensive” mode depending on the situation. Traditionally, an offensive hand grenade creates only a shockwave rather than sending out deadly fragments, making it safer for troops to use as they advance, especially into buildings or other confined spaces. Unfortunately, the Army’s retired its only offensive hand grenade in 1975. The weapon had a shell made from a composite containing the cancer-causing carcinogen asbestos. And with the new weapon, “soldiers will not need to carry as many types of hand grenades,” Jessica Perciballi, the Army project officer leading the effort, said. “With the new multi-purpose grenade, they can carry one … and have the ability to choose either fragmentation or concussive effects desired for the situation.” To meet the Army’s requirements, engineers worked on finding a shape that worked for both functions and would still be easy to carry. The rest of the design features could pose a challenge, as well. AH-64E Apaches. Image: US Army photo New engine for gunships and transport choppers While the Army is working on a new family of aircraft that might replace both helicopters and regular aircraft, in 2016, its aviators were still flying AH-64E Apaches and UH-60M Black Hawks. These were latest the latest versions of the gunships and transport choppers that had served troops since the 1980s. Both helicopters use versions of General Electric’s T-700 jet turbine. After more than three decades of upgrades, the AH-64 and UH-60 are carrying much more gear than plane makers Boeing and Sikorsky might have originally expected. The weight slows the helicopters down, makes them less maneuverable and and more vulnerable. It also just makes it harder for pilots to get the job done. “Years ago, four Black Hawks could move a platoon,” US Army Maj. Gen. William Gayler, head of the Army Aviation Center of Excellence at Fort Rucker, Alabama explained to the service’s reporters. “Now, it takes eight or nine and, by 2020 — assuming the linear weight increases continue at the current rate — it will take 15 to 20.” And that doesn’t take into account rising fuel costs and the time and money mechanics spend repairing increasingly older powerplants. Just like with the ground combat branch’s armored vehicles, Army officials want better engines to help save precious funds. With luck, the Army might be able to use at least some of this technology on whatever aircraft come next. Unfortunately, while engineers started the basic work on the new engine in 2016, officials don’t expect to even start testing the first aircraft with the improved turbine before 2026. Army National Guard medics at a training exercise. Image: US Army photo Saving lives Two more of the Army’s top 10 modernization projects dealt specifically with saving troops’ lives. Since the Korean War, one of the US military’s main strengths has been its increasingly effective medical technology. By 2016, medics and field hospital staff were already light-years ahead of where their predecessors were a half-century earlier. But the Army knows there are still improvements it can make. “A medic or fellow Soldier can apply a traditional tourniquet to a person’s limb, but can’t use it to stop hemorrhaging in the abdomen, chest, groin, waist, pelvis or armpit,” US Army Lt. Gen. Nadja Y. West, the service’s surgeon general, told a meeting of the Defense Writer’s Group in Washington, D.C. in August 2016. This new “junction tourniquet” offered a potential solution to that problem. While it looks like a relatively standard belt, the tool has inflatable sections. In an emergency, A soldier would could wrap the device around a larger section of a wounded comrade’s body, then pump it full of air to apply constant, life-saving pressure. Tests showed troops could apply the strap and halt deadly hemorrhaging in just one minute. By December 2016, the Army had gotten the first junction tourniquets to troops in combat. Of course, the best way for the Army to save lives would be to prevent soldiers from getting injuries in the first place. In 2016, engineers were working on lighter, less cumbersome body armor. The experimental ballistic shirt weighed 35 pounds less than the existing Interceptor body armor. More importantly, a soldier could “throw it on like a goalie shirt in hockey,” according Robert DiLalla, the Army engineer leading the work. “Soldiers have spoken loud and clear with more than 90 percent user acceptance in multiple user evaluations,” DiLalla added. “Typically, as we assess new body armor components, we’d consider 60 percent a successful number.” Future technology The last of the Army’s top 10 improvement efforts for 2016 bordered on science fiction. Scientists at the Army Research Laboratory had spent a considerable amount of time during the year seeing just what they could do with photons. Photons are the basic elements of light and other electromagnetic waves. A better understanding of the particles might let specialists devise new, faster and — perhaps most importantly — more secure ways to communicate or store information. Similarly, developing more sensitive equipment to measure and monitor photons could lead to breakthroughs in spy cameras and other surveillance gear. Essentially, the Army does not really understand what photons could help with — but it is eager to find out. “We don’t really know what all the applications are,” Michael Brodsky, an Army physical scientist, said. “Our mandate, in part, is to find those applications.” The photon research seems like a good analogy for the Army’s current modernization effort as a whole. The service knows the world is full of complex threats and that no single set of tools will help in every situation. But Army officials also know that the enemy won’t wait until a perfect solution presents itself. This article originally appeared on War Is Boring.

Trump told a friend in the last few weeks that he still considers the merger to be a bad deal, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the conversation was private. Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, is also opposed to the deal, another person said. While Trump blasted the deal during the campaign, Time Warner shares have climbed 10 percent since the election on speculation that a Republican administration would be friendlier to the $85.4 billion merger. The stock closed Wednesday at $96.71, compared with AT&T’s offer price of $107.50 a share. Time Warner shares dropped as much as 3.8 percent Thursday after Bloomberg’s report on Trump’s thinking about the transaction. Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, didn’t respond to a request for comment. AT&T and Time Warner both declined to comment. Trump’s opposition to the deal is “mildly negative,” but everything is negotiable with the president-elect, Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Gallant said Thursday in a note to clients. The review process is still in the very early stages, he said. Limited Options It remains unclear whether Trump would try to influence the regulatory review of the merger, either by pushing officials to impose conditions or to block the deal entirely. The transaction, which would combine the biggest U.S. pay-TV and internet provider with one of the largest creators of TV programming, will be reviewed by the Justice Department and possibly by the Federal Communications Commission. Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, to lead the Justice Department, and hasn’t named a successor to departing FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. In October, before the election, Trump said his administration wouldn’t approve the merger, saying, “It’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” He cited the deal as “an example of the power structure I’m fighting.” Trump has said little publicly about the deal since, but has taken on several major corporations in recent weeks after winning the election, including Ford Motor Co., Carrier and Boeing Co. If Trump wants to influence the review, he would have more success with the FCC, which weighs deals based on a more subjective public-interest standard, said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. In 2014, for instance, President Obama issued a statement and video urging the commission to impose stronger regulations on high-speed Internet service to protect “net neutrality,” which the agency later did. “If the FCC takes the case, President Trump could influence the decision in any number of ways,” Moffett said. “He can effectively turn up the heat and make it very difficult for the FCC to disagree with him.” AT&T, however, could avoid a FCC review by divesting licenses owned by Time Warner, Moffett said. Trump would have a harder time influencing the Justice Department review of the deal, because any decision the agency makes can be challenged in court, Moffett said. “It would be naive to say DOJ operates utterly without political intervention,” he said, “but the potential for partisan meddling is much lower at DOJ than at FCC.” Trump’s opinion is unlikely to lead to the merger being blocked unless the president chooses to get heavily involved in the approval process, said Barry Diller, a media veteran who’s now chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp. “Unless he’s going to micromanage and now he’s going to be head of antitrust and go through the whole legal process, he’s just doing what he does,” Diller said in an interview Thursday on Bloomberg Television. CNN Frustration Trump’s opposition to the AT&T-Time Warner deal stems partly from his frustration with CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, one of the people said. Trump has repeatedly criticized the cable news network for what he sees as unfair coverage of him. AT&T could sell CNN to appease Trump and get the deal approved, Moffett said. “If that’s the primary concern, you’d have to wonder whether AT&T wouldn’t prefer to sell CNN for Trump to claim victory and still get this deal across the finish line,” Moffett said.

Trump is upset with Comcast and NBC because he sees them as being responsible for the October leak of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” video in which he made degrading comments about women, the person said. Trump sees himself as a victim of a concentrated media landscape, the person said. In the coming months, federal regulators will scrutinize the deal, which would create a telecommunications and media empire that will own much of the programming it provides to subscribers of its wireless, internet and pay-TV services. AT&T serves 133 million U.S. wireless customers and 25 million video subscribers. During a congressional hearing last month, the chief executives of AT&T and Time Warner defended their transaction, arguing that it would raise a challenge to cable companies by making it easier to create new online TV packages and help them compete with tech giants in online advertising, among other benefits. That same month, AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson said at an investor conference that the regulatory review of the deal “should be fairly straightforward” and “based on the facts of the law, we expect a good outcome from that.” He said AT&T was open to conditions to get the deal approved but said “it’s too early to tell” whether AT&T would divest Time Warner’s licenses to avoid an FCC review.

Yesterday he took aim at General Motors, who he attacked for making a small number of Chevrolet Cruze cars in Mexico. Today it was the turn of Japanese firm Toyota, who he complained were building a new plant in Baja to build their Corolla cars for the US market. He's threatening firms with a 35% import tax on products brought across the border instead of being manufactured in the US. But the more immediately scary bit is what happens to a company's share price right after the President elect tweets about them. Here's what happened to Toyota. Ouch. That's an immediate 0.7 point drop - and it recovered a little, settling around 0.4% down after an hour. But while company shares generally bounce back after a Trump slapdown, the initial drop can be costly. Read More Donald Trump shames GM for making cars in Mexico an hour before rival Ford cancels plan to move jobs there After Trump was critical of Lockheed Martin for spending too much money developing their F-35 aircraft, the corporation saw 4% knocked off their shares. The Financial Post estimated the drop wiped $4 billion off their market capitalisation in a matter of minutes. That's $28 million for every character of his tweet. Nice going, Donald. (Photo: Getty) While previous Presidents have generally avoided publicly criticising firms - especially American ones - to avoid this kind of market manipulation, The Donald apparently isn't that worried about it. Because he does it a lot. He also blasted Boeing for the cost of the new Air Force One presidential jet. That cost them 2% of their share price.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Trump’s fucking up the entire economy with his phone In News by Drew Salisbury / January 5, 2017 Share < br />this article: Follow @raisedinthecity President-elect Trump seems to have figured out a fun way to pass the time until he takes office in a couple weeks (because he’s obviously not interested in writing any policy to replace all that legislation he’s so insistent on repealing). Instead of figuring out how to help the millions of Americans set to lose their healthcare coverage, PEOTUS has decided to play on his phone and mess with the economy during the commercial breaks of whatever TV show about himself he’s watching. On Thursday, Trump took aim at Japanese automaker Toyota on Twitter. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Almost immediately, Toyota stocks plummeted .4 percent. BREAKING: Toyota Motor shares sharply drop after President-elect tweets about the automaker. https://t.co/ykd1C9jAPZ pic.twitter.com/w8JeZ3ttHu — CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) January 5, 2017 Toyota is the latest company to be targeted by Trump on the social network. Stocks for Boeing and Lockheed Martin dropped sharply after he criticized them over the cost of their airplanes (so much for the free market). And while supporters laud the president-elect’s critical tweets of Carrier and Ford for supposedly saving America jobs, close examination reveals Carrier effectively blackmailed him into giving them tax breaks in exchange for not moving a facility to Mexico, and Ford never planned on shutting down any U.S. facilities at all. Trump should similarly receive no credit for the automaker’s recent decision to cancel a planned Mexico plant for reasons discussed here. It’s obvious the leader of the free world holds an immense amount of power. At their slightest intimation, markets can shift dramatically. Such volatility is not good for the stability of the economy. The head of the government putting a company on blast and fucking up their stock value doesn’t help everyday Americans working at those companies. It also, as previously mentioned, ain’t exactly in the tradition of free market conservatism (you know, if that’s a thing you actually care about). But hey, I guess it helps pass the days until your inauguration (which nobody is coming to). Edit: An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Toyota’s stock had dropped 40 percent. It actually decreased by four-tenths of a percent, or roughly $1,268,440,000.00.

For one, it often threatens to destroy those arrangements altogether, or at the very least provide a blustery challenge. This, however, comes with its costs, notably in the modern State. For one, it promises a mixture of bloodletting and indifference to the technocrats and advisors who claim various skills and expertise. Killing the priest class, the monopolists on expertise and ritual, leads to blood, confusion, and the need for a good deal of re-ordering. In the turmoil that is modern Britain, the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers offers a rather brutal example of this in action. As Britain’s former EU ambassador, he was meant to be the expert in formulating some plan of action regarding his country’s exit from the European Union. What he found instead were few plans in the offing, and a refusal to accept the complexity of the task at hand. In resigning, he accused his employers of “muddled” thinking. “We do not yet know what the government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK’s relationship with the EU after exit.” There was also a grave shortage of “multilateral negotiating experience” in Whitehall, a fact not replicated “in the Commission or in the Council.”[1] In the battle of the experts, Britain was coming up short. The government’s response was dull and domestic. In the words of a government spokesman, the resignation enabled “a successor to be appointed before the UK invokes Article 50 by the end of March. We are grateful for his work and commitment over the last three years.”[2] What Sir Ivan was experiencing was a standard bureaucratic assassination, or, in this case, an assassination on one of the more expert figures on the business of European governance. His critics chose to focus on the fact that his views had become the subject of leaks (in the British civil service, the equivalent of contracting HIV). “If the reports are true that he has been hounded out by hostile Brexiteers in government,” suggested Sir Ivan’s former employee Nick Clegg, also formerly leader of the Lib Dems, “it counts as a spectacular own goal.” But what is being sought? Hardly complicated advice, a true sign of the times. Former conservative Tory cabinet minister John Redwood hoped for a replacement “who thinks it’s straightforward.” Sentiment and attitude counted over evidence and application. Sir Ivan had been one of those cerebral nuisances, a person who did “not really have his heart” in the Brexit process, castigating it as being “very difficult and long-winded.” Flat-earth theorists were far more preferable. In such cases, the role of the expert is treated as handy scapegoat, the great obfuscator against feeling and sentiment. The experts are the modern variant of pre-Protestant Catholic priests. The populist revolution being witnessed in Europe and the United States resembles, in some way, a Protestant expectoration against Catholic establishment order, the savaging of the cult of the saints (in modern terms, neo-liberal market practices, trade deals, open borders), the concealing practices of the clerics. To know God, it is best to get rid of those who obscure pathways to his vision. The United States has been no exception to such suspicions of the “expert”, ever perched between the radically innovative and the crudely atavistic. Ingenious political models of republicanism have been entangled with divination more rooted in primitive theocracy. God accompanies the workings of Lockheed Martin and Boeing; bustling punditry and political science exists alongside pure staple prejudices and hatreds, long nursed by frontier desires and racial division. It was the sort of thing that worried Richard Hofstadter, who suggested that populism had its nasty analogues in the form of paranoia in politics.[3] Certainly, when it came to Senator Joe McCarthy, hunting the expert during the early phase of the Cold War was fair game. It was a mission laced with anti-Communist fervour, while previous enemies of populism had been the Banker, the Jew, or Wall Street. As the “rogue elephant” of sorts, McCarthy, according to Daniel Bell, “formulated his appeal derived from something deep in the moralizing strain of the American temper, in the willingness to believe in conspiracy and that debunkers are usually more right than wrong.”[4] In one way, McCarthy’s war on the experts (those in the US State Department bookishly versed with their portfolios) resembled the Stalinist purges without the number of fatalities, though the principle was the same: executing catharsis, a ceremonial stripping and ripping of the educated establishment in favour of visceral revenge for the natural voice. Unfortunately, much of the modern populist purging has very much to argue against. It is not merely the issue of experts, but the broader managerial classes who have done their part in taking institutions out of their democratic, accountable orbit. What we will mourn in passing is the killing of the genuinely informed citizen, providing unvarnished and unabashed advice to governments as they bumble through history. In the words of Sir Ivan, “I hope you will continue to challenge ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and that you will never be afraid to speak the truth to those in power.” Dr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. January 5, 2017 The $1bn plant will be located Guanajuato, a state in central Mexico, not Baja California, as Trump tweeted. Toyota plans to increase capacity at an existing plant in Tijuana, Baja California, that makes Tacoma pickup trucks. Toyota plans to manufacture 200,000 Corollas at the new plant. The Corolla is the second bestselling compact car in the US behind fellow Japanese manufacturer Honda’s Civic. Trump’s latest threat follows a similar one against General Motors over its plans to manufacture compact cars south of the border for US export. Jorge Guajardo, the former Mexican ambassador to China, immediately lit into Trump: “If you think intentionally wrecking your neighbor’s economy is what’s going to bring peace and stability to US you’re in for a big surprise,” he tweeted. Trump, who was elected on a promise to restore US manufacturing jobs, has spent the week instructing automakers to move their compact car production out of Mexico. On Tuesday he told GM that it too must weigh his opinion favorably against the financial efficiencies offered on foreign soil. “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” Trump tweeted. Last month Trump threatened “retribution” against companies outsourcing factory work to foreign facilities. “There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies,” he tweeted, naming car and air conditioner manufacturers in the same series of remarks. In recent weeks, Trump also threatened aerospace firms Boeing and Lockheed-Martin, both of which rely heavily on government contracts for multibillion-dollar revenues. Those threats, also tweeted, shocked shareholders and caused stock prices to plummet. But threatening car companies with taxation has barely caused the market to blink. The US president cannot personally levy taxes; that duty falls to state legislatures and the US House of Representatives, which holds the “power of the purse”. Trump’s campaign platform heavily criticized companies for moving labor out of the US, but thus far his favored method of dealing with corporations has been rewards via back channels, rather than punishment. Instead of taxing air conditioner company Carrier more for exporting jobs, however, Trump and Indiana governor Mike Pence offered the Indiana-based company $7m in tax breaks to keep 700 jobs.

Its strength will hurt U.S. manufacturing while triggering capital flight from emerging markets, economists say. The appreciation “is a real serious noose around the neck of the global economy,” David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University in Arlington, Va., said in November. What’s really alarming, though, is that even though the dollar has jumped 6 percent against the euro and 12 percent against the yen since the U.S. presidential election, it remains well below its historic highs. If its rise to date is causing trouble, imagine how much worse things could get if it went on a serious upward run. The included chart shows how much headroom remains for the greenback. It’s the Federal Reserve’s index of the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies of 26 trading partners, with each one’s value adjusted for that nation’s inflation rate. This is a better indicator of the dollar’s strength than the frequently cited U.S. Dollar Index, which covers just six currencies and isn’t adjusted for inflation. The Fed’s index remains 10 percent below its 2002 high and fully 19 percent below the lofty high of 1985, which led to an emergency international accord to lower the greenback’s value through official, coordinated sales of dollar reserves. Fundamental factors are driving the dollar upward. Because U.S. growth is strong and unemployment low, Fed policymakers are projecting three more quarter-point increases in short-term rates in 2017. That will tend to push up the dollar by making U.S. Treasuries and other fixed-income investments more lucrative. Investors are also betting President-elect Donald Trump will touch off a growth spurt through tax cuts and infrastructure investment. Meanwhile, “The euro zone debt crisis and the travails of the Chinese renminbi have weakened the dollar’s main rivals and cemented its dominance as a key benchmark for other currencies,” Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad wrote in an e-mail. ABN Amro, a Dutch bank with a more extreme forecast than most, projects that the euro, worth $1.15 as recently as May, will be only 95¢ for most of 2017. Trump Gives the Dollar Wings, it headlined a November research report. A strong dollar is bad for U.S. growth, making American goods and services less competitive in world markets. A rule of thumb says that a 10 percent rise in the dollar increases the trade deficit by 1 percent of gross domestic product, and that translates into the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, says Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Warnings about the damage from dollar strength have come recently from U.S. companies including Boeing, Emerson Electric, 3M, and United Technologies. The greenback’s strength could cause problems in emerging markets such as Mexico and Turkey, because it increases how much of the local currency borrowers need to spend to make payments on bonds they issued in dollars. And bond issuers in those countries must pay higher interest to attract buyers when the Fed raises rates. Petróleos Mexicanos pointed to the peso’s depreciation as a factor in a 23 percent increase in the peso value of its debt in the first three quarters of 2016. In China, debt-laden builders are suddenly having trouble selling dollar-denominated bonds. At the end of 2015 there was $9.7 trillion in nonfinancial debt outside the U.S. issued in dollars, and one-third of it was owed by issuers in emerging markets, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which is run jointly by the central banks of several countries. “If the current trend of dollar strength persists, it is very likely that we will see emerging market currency crises,” Variant Perception, a London-based research firm, wrote to clients in December. Whatever gains in trade competitiveness that emerging-market economies get when the dollar rises against their currencies can be outweighed by the rise in their borrowing costs, says a December research report by BIS economists Nikola Tarashev, Stefan Avdjiev, and Ben Cohen.

Most emerging-market issuers of dollar debt are protected against a big dollar rise, either because they have offsetting financial hedges or because they receive a steady income of dollars from trade, says Joe Kogan, co-head of Latin America strategy at Scotia Capital Markets in New York. Emerging-market economies are in better shape than they were in 1997, when rising rates caused a financial crisis in Asia, says Mark Follett, managing director for emerging Asia debt capital markets at JPMorgan Chase in Hong Kong. Then again, Follett doesn’t know where the dollar is headed from here. “No one,” he says, “has any idea at the end of the day.”   —With Isabella Cota, Craig Torres, and Carrie Hong The bottom line: Several factors, from higher interest rates to a hoped-for Trump tax cut, are making the dollar stronger.

On Thursday afternoon,  Trump blasted the Japanese automaker for its supposed plans to build a plant in Baja, Mexico. The company's stock promptly took a dive. Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 But the plant he apparently referenced will not be built in Baja — though Toyota does have an existing facility there.  Rather, Toyota  is planning to build a new plant to produce Corollas in Guanajuato, Mexico. In response to Trump's tweet, the company emphasized that the new plant will not decrease the global giant's job numbers or investment in the U.S. "Toyota has been part of the cultural fabric in the U.S. for nearly 60 years," the company said in a statement. "With more than $21.9 billion direct investment in the U.S., 10 manufacturing facilities, 1,500 dealerships and 136,000 employees, Toyota looks forward to collaborating with the Trump Administration to serve in the best interests of consumers and the automotive industry." According to the statement from Toyota, the manufacturing facilities in Baja, which were established in 2002, "support production at our San Antonio, Texas, plant, where 3,300 team members produced over 230,000 Tundras and Tacomas," last year. The company underscored that it has recently expanded manufacturing operations in Kentucky, Alabama, Indiana and West Virginia, adding more than 1,000 jobs and investing about $700 million in those facilities.  The two-way highway that is Texas-Mexico trade Toyota is set to bring more than 4,000 employees to the Lone Star State as it moves its North American headquarters from Southern California to a glittering new campus in Plano later this year. Experts have said that the production of cars — by both foreign-owned and U.S. automakers — no longer occurs in one place, as global supply chains grow increasingly complex for all kinds of manufacturing. A single automobile will frequently be shuttled back and forth across the southern border multiple times for additions or finishing touches before it's ultimately sold — in Mexico, the U.S. or elsewhere — which raises questions about how the "big border tax" that Trump threatened would be levied.  Because Texas is a kind of geographic link between the U.S. and Mexico, the state's economy relies heavily on the flow of products back and forth across the border.  See the growing list of companies singled out in Trump's tweets The move to North Texas by the Japanese automaker, among the biggest and richest in the world, has been a coup for the area's economic development strategy, which has helped propel the region's booming job growth and sprawling new development.  What's ahead for the Dallas economy in 2017? Toyota's move marks key moment in recruitment strategy Still, in midday trading, Toyota's stock had dropped .4 percent after Trump's tweet, proving yet again that the president-elect's 140-character missives have the power to move markets. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted against GM's plans to produce some Chevy Cruze vehicles in Mexico. Then he congratulated Ford for its decision not to move production south of the border and invest $700 million in a plant in Michigan instead.  Ford's CEO has said that the move was not prompted by Trump. The president-elect's tweets about Boeing and Lockheed Martin over the cost of airplanes also affected their stock prices temporarily, though it seems both have since recovered.

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     App to send alerts when Donald Trump tweets about stocks you own Listen | Print By Business Insider     Jan 5, 2017 in Technology When President-elect Donald Trump tweets about a public company, the market listens. And if you hold the stock of one of the companies that has come into Trump's crosshairs, finance app Trigger thinks you'll want to know about it. The free iPhone app works by letting you set up financial "triggers," which you can then use to guide your investment decisions. For example, you can set a reminder to sell a stock when its price reaches a certain level, moves a specific percentage, hits a one-year low or high, and so on. When the condition occurs, Trigger sends you a notification, and you can decide whether to act on it. Now the company has rolled out a special "Trump trigger." The trigger "gives you the ability to trade stocks based off of Trump’s tweets about public companies," the startup wrote. Basically, the trigger works by notifying you if Trump tweets about a publicly traded stock that you own, in real time. Trump has tweeted about companies from Apple to Amazon to AT&T — and that's just the A's. In some cases, such as when Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of a new Air Force One jet, the aerospace company's stock immediately fell nearly 2 percent. Should this pattern continue during Trump's presidency, it's not difficult to see why investors might want to be quickly alerted to tweets about their holdings. Trigger sends alerts to users when Trump tweets about their stocks Trigger Trigger characterized the Trump trigger as the first step toward the startup using "not just price based data but relevant world events to condense into simple IF this, THEN that rules." Expect a bunch of varied types of financial signals in the future. If the idea of setting up these types of notifications for your investments intrigues you, check out Trigger's website, or its iPhone app. Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

The officials are expected to describe the Russian government’s role in directing a cyber campaign that divulged emails from the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and other political organizations, and set off an unprecedented postelection feud between President-elect Donald Trump and the intelligence community he is about to lead.

For one, it often threatens to destroy those arrangements altogether, or at the very least provide a blustery challenge. This, however, comes with its costs, notably in the modern State.  For one, it promises a mixture of bloodletting and indifference to the technocrats and advisors who claim various skills and expertise.  Killing the priest class, the monopolists on expertise and ritual, leads to blood, confusion, and the need for a good deal of re-ordering. In the turmoil that is modern Britain, the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers offers a rather brutal example of this in action. As Britain’s former EU ambassador, he was meant to be the expert in formulating some plan of action regarding his country’s exit from the European Union. What he found instead were few plans in the offing, and a refusal to accept the complexity of the task at hand. In resigning, he accused his employers of “muddled” thinking. “We do not yet know what the government will set as negotiating objectives for the UK’s relationship with the EU after exit.”  There was also a grave shortage of “multilateral negotiating experience” in Whitehall, a fact not replicated “in the Commission or in the Council.” In the battle of the experts, Britain was coming up short. The government’s response was dull and domestic. In the words of a government spokesman, the resignation enabled “a successor to be appointed before the UK invokes Article 50 by the end of March.  We are grateful for his work and commitment over the last three years.” What Sir Ivan was experiencing was a standard bureaucratic assassination, or, in this case, an assassination on one of the more expert figures on the business of European governance.  His critics chose to focus on the fact that his views had become the subject of leaks (in the British civil service, the equivalent of contracting HIV). “If the reports are true that he has been hounded out by hostile Brexiteers in government,” suggested Sir Ivan’s former employee Nick Clegg, also formerly leader of the Lib Dems, “it counts as a spectacular own goal.” But what is being sought?  Hardly complicated advice, a true sign of the times.   Former conservative Tory cabinet minister John Redwood hoped for a replacement “who thinks it’s straightforward.”  Sentiment and attitude counted over evidence and application.  Sir Ivan had been one of those cerebral nuisances, a person who did “not really have his heart” in the Brexit process, castigating it as being “very difficult and long-winded.”  Flat-earth theorists were far more preferable. In such cases, the role of the expert is treated as handy scapegoat, the great obfuscator against feeling and sentiment.  The experts are the modern variant of pre-Protestant Catholic priests.  The populist revolution being witnessed in Europe and the United States resembles, in some way, a Protestant expectoration against Catholic establishment order, the savaging of the cult of the saints (in modern terms, neo-liberal market practices, trade deals, open borders), the concealing practices of the clerics.  To know God, it is best to get rid of those who obscure pathways to his vision. The United States has been no exception to such suspicions of the “expert”, ever perched between the radically innovative and the crudely atavistic. Ingenious political models of republicanism have been entangled with divination more rooted in primitive theocracy. God accompanies the workings of Lockheed Martin and Boeing; bustling punditry and political science exists alongside pure staple prejudices and hatreds, long nursed by frontier desires and racial division. It was the sort of thing that worried Richard Hofstadter, who suggested that populism had its nasty analogues in the form of paranoia in politics.  Certainly, when it came to Senator Joe McCarthy, hunting the expert during the early phase of the Cold War was fair game. It was a mission laced with anti-Communist fervour, while previous enemies of populism had been the Banker, the Jew, or Wall Street.  As the “rogue elephant” of sorts, McCarthy, according to Daniel Bell, “formulated his appeal derived from something deep in the moralizing strain of the American temper, in the willingness to believe in conspiracy and that debunkers are usually more right than wrong.” In one way, McCarthy’s war on the experts (those in the US State Department bookishly versed with their portfolios) resembled the Stalinist purges without the number of fatalities, though the principle was the same: executing catharsis, a ceremonial stripping and ripping of the educated establishment in favour of visceral revenge for the natural voice. Unfortunately, much of the modern populist purging has very much to argue against. It is not merely the issue of experts, but the broader managerial classes who have done their part in taking institutions out of their democratic, accountable orbit. What we will mourn in passing is the killing of the genuinely informed citizen, providing unvarnished and unabashed advice to governments as they bumble through history. In the words of Sir Ivan, “I hope you will continue to challenge ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and that you will never be afraid to speak the truth to those in power.” Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.

Thankfully, the pilots were able to land the aircraft safely using the massive plane's remaining seven turbofan jet engines. Defense News was able to confirm that none of the five personnel on board sustained any injuries, and that an Air Force Huey helicopter has been sent to recover engine debris, which luckily fell on an unpopulated area about 25 nautical miles (46 km) northeast of the airbase at Minot. An Air Force spokesman was quoted by ABC News as saying that the crew had "declared an in-flight emergency when the pilot discovered that an engine departed the aircraft." The spokesman added that there were no weapons on board, and that the plane was on a local training mission. A safety investigation has been initiated. The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range strategic bomber that has been in service with the US Air Force since the 1950s. The aircraft has received multiple upgrades, and continues to be used as a heavy bomber, including most recently in the US war in Afghanistan. B-52s are mostly used in missions against countries that do not have sophisticated air defense capabilities, and drops both precision and non-precision munitions. The planes also complement the US nuclear triad. © Photo: Facebook/ Студенти за истину Yugoslavia Bombings' Victims May Be Painted on Russia-Donated MiG Fighters to Serbia as a Hint to NATOB-52s are among the oldest planes in the US Air Force's fleet, and the newest of the planes is over 50 years old. According to Defense News, the incident "could…ignite debate about whether and how to re-engine the service's B-52 inventory," which consists of 76 B-52s. The Air Force plans to continue operating the planes until at least 2040, when they are expected to be replaced by the B-21, a new $550 million a pop heavy bomber developed by weapons manufacturer Northrop Grumman. ...

BUSINESS To compete with Silicon Valley for engineers, aerospace firms start recruitment in pre-kindergarten To compete with Silicon Valley for engineers, aerospace firms start recruitment in pre-kindergarten Aerospace employers are reaching out earlier to potential hires — as early as elementary school or pre-kindergarten — to get them interested in science and math Aerospace employers are reaching out earlier to potential hires — as early as elementary school or pre-kindergarten — to get them interested in science and math Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter USC mechanical engineering junior Stephanie Balais developed a passion for aerospace after joining the university’s AeroDesign team and helping to construct an airplane fuselage hours before transporting the plane to a competition in Kansas. As internships beckoned, she sent in a number of applications to top defense and aerospace firms. But Microsoft Corp. snagged her first. This summer, Balais, 20, will spend 13 weeks in Redmond, Wash., working in the tech giant’s manufacturing and supply chain department. Silicon Valley and other tech centers have always been popular landing places for young engineers, with their lure of cutting-edge technology and top-notch pay. But aerospace companies are facing an even stiffer challenge as Web and computer companies, and other sectors like the auto industry, move into areas like drones and autonomous systems. Aerospace employers are realizing they have to dig deeper — and adjust their messaging — to capture top tech talent. They are starting to reach out earlier to potential employees — as early as elementary school or even pre-kindergarten — to get them interested in science and math. And they’re recognizing the challenge they have building awareness with a generation that never had a real space race, but grew up with Google, Snapchat and Apple as part of their daily lives. “This is something that’s very critical to our member companies,” said Dan Stohr, spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Assn. trade group. “They’re putting serious money into this, to the tune of millions of dollars a year.” Lockheed Martin Corp. has launched a program called Generation Beyond aimed at encouraging middle school students’ interest in deep space exploration. The initiative includes a class curriculum, a downloadable Mars weather app and a traveling school bus modified so that children riding it can see the Martian landscape through the windows. “One of the things we’ve been seeing is that this generation of students doesn’t necessarily know or have grown up with Lockheed Martin, as their parents did,” said Steve Hatch, the company’s director for central talent acquisition, of current college students. “As we look at the competition, how do we go attract that talent sooner … but at the same time, get them interested in STEM.” In early 2015, Northrop Grumman Corp. opened an innovation center called NG Next based in Redondo Beach, where it is doubling down on basic research to figure out solutions to problems that may be years in the future. The organization takes a more aggressive approach to experimentation, which can be attractive to potential employees looking for a creative work environment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 26,000 aerospace engineers were employed as of May 2015 in product and parts manufacturing, a category that covers about 70% of the aerospace and defense industry, but excludes many suppliers in sectors like shipbuilding. Joining them were about 5,900 electrical engineers, about 14,000 mechanical engineers and 12,000 software developers of systems software. In computer and electronic product manufacturing, there were about 5,700 aerospace engineers, 30,300 electrical engineers, 18,400 mechanical engineers and 48,600 software developers of systems software. Defense firms have long maintained a presence on college campuses, whether at career fairs, sponsoring student engineering competitions, serving on deans’ or department advisory boards or providing scholarships. “Students encounter Google and Amazon frequently on the Web,” said Jayathi Murthy, dean of UCLA’s Engineering School. “So in order for [defense companies] to be heard above that, they really need to engage with us on campus, and they do.” A meeting with a Northrop Grumman executive during a USC recruiting event piquedJustin Jameson’s interest in working at the company. It ended up being the only place he applied to after graduating from USC in 2009. Jameson, 29, has now worked at Northrop Grumman for more than seven years. “I looked at a lot of the big consulting companies as well, but at Northrop Grumman, they offered me the chance to come in and work on real problems,” he said. “At a consulting company, I would be solving someone else’s problems.” Defense firms emphasize a mission of national security with recruits, said Robin Thurman, director of workforce policy at the Aerospace Industries Assn. And the unique, real-world nature of the work gives it a “cool” factor for some students. “In the Internet world, they’re going to work on advertising algorithms … big data analysis, which can be fun and exciting and interesting,” said Chris Hernandez, vice president of NG Next. “But I’d like to compare my airplanes and spacecraft to that any day of the week.” That aspect attracted Addison Salzman, 21, who will graduate from USC in May with a degree in aerospace engineering. Salzman, who is interested in higher-level aircraft design, has already landed a full-time job at Boeing Co. and will start in July. “One of the big reasons that I chose it is because they have their hands in not just defense, but they have a very large commercial airplanes business,” he said. “It gives me a cool opportunity to explore the different applications of aerospace technologies.” Timothy John, an aerospace engineering student at UCLA, has been interested in space exploration since elementary school and has sent out a number of job applications to defense companies. John, 25, said he’s looking for longevity and growth in potential employers, but also hopes to work on an airplane or spacecraft. “I’m pretty indiscriminate,” he said. “Any projects that include planes, like anything with a jet turbine, like a F-16 or F-22 or stealth bombers. Or even missiles.” Though Northrop Grumman’s NG Next was not established specifically for recruiting, it has become a useful tool in hiring, Hernandez said. New employees can be part of an environment of rapid development and experimentation not generally associated with large defense contractors. “For us to achieve the great things that we need to achieve to solve the nation’s toughest problems, we have to push hard,” Hernandez said. The organization’s four main components — basic research, applied technology, advanced design and rapid prototyping — employ about 800 full- or part-time people, though faculty from research universities can also collaborate with NG Next scientists. The organization was also designed to have a larger tolerance for risk than what might be assumed for a big government contractor. “We want to move fast and hard, cautiously and consciously, but it’s OK if we fail every now and then,” Hernandez said, voicing a credo that aerospace engineers say held for the space program long before it became popular in Silicon Valley.  “If we don’t, we’re probably not pushing hard enough.” To read the article in Spanish, click here Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss What values does Hollywood promote? A storm that hit Northern California toppled the Pioneer Cabin Tree. Who should discipline police officers? Michelle King has made no big waves in her first year running Los Angeles Unified. A state watchdog agency is investigating political donations connected to real estate developer Samuel Leung.

In the latest of a series of snipes directed at publicly traded companies via Twitter, President-elect Donald Trump fired across the bow of GM stock (whose CEO serves on Trump’s strategic and policy forum), sending shares plummeting in pre-market trading. GM stock has since recovered, pushing higher by 0.5%. Source: William Oliver via Flickr (Modified) Trump threatened to hit General Motors with a “big border tax” for “sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.” GM responded to Trump’s tweets in a statement, informing the president-elect that it sells very little Mexican-made vehicles in the U.S.: “General Motors manufactures the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio. All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.” And while General Motors did issue more Mexican-made Cruzes to meet demand for its initial rollout of the vehicle, GM has since switched production of its sedans sold in the U.S. to its Ohio plant. The 10 Best Fidelity Funds for 2017 According to GM spokesperson Patrick Morrissey, only about 4,500 of the 190,000 Cruzes sold in the U.S. in 2017 were made in Mexico, amounting to 2.4% of its Cruze sales. That, according to United Auto Workers President Glenn Johnson, is barely a day’s worth of production at GM’s Lordstown facility. Bottom Line on GM Stock GM stock isn’t the first to come under fire from Trump — both Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) were called out for pricey defense contracts, with both stocks taking a short-term hit. Trump’s threats are an extension of his campaign pledge to bring production back to the States, and he has warned before that he would levy a 35% tariff on companies outsourcing production. That threat has shaken some automakers to their core, with Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) announcing today that it is cancelling its planned $1.6 billion Mexico factory, instead investing $700 million in a Michigan factory. But as Johnson put it, Trump’s tweets simply make for good news … and great dip-buying opportunities for investors who see through the tweet storms. As of this writing, John Kilhefner did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post/Getty Images When Donald Trump takes to Twitter, some companies shudder. This week, Ford Motor Co. said it would scrap a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico in favor of expanding an existing one in Michigan. That happened on the same day the president-elect tweeted criticism of General Motors for manufacturing its Chevy Cruze vehicles in Mexico. Parallels Canceled Ford Plant Adds To Mexico's Economic Frustrations GM says only a small number of the cars produced in Mexico are sold in the U.S., but that's a detail that may not register with the public. Economist Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution says of companies that produce consumer goods: "They can't afford bad publicity." Bosworth notes that so far Trump's targets are companies that are expanding or planning to build operations in Mexico. He has not singled out U.S. companies that built plants there long ago. U.S. Firms' Investment Plans In Mexico Mexico is a global business center, with industries ranging from aerospace to autos operating factories and research facilities there. The following is a sample of U.S. firms' recent investment plans announced for Mexico. Cisco Systems plans to spend up to $4 billion to expand production. Wal-Mart says it will invest $1.3 billion in logistics, including building and expanding distribution centers. Spectrum Aeronautical is investing $300 million to build an aircraft assembly plant. Kansas City Southern plans to invest about $154 million in Mexico rail operations. Automotive wheel manufacturer Prime Wheel plans a $60 million expansion to boost production. Honeywell plans to invest about $15 million to upgrade its plant in Mexicali. MetLife plans an $11 million global distribution and support center. Sources: Mexico Business Blog, published reports "He focuses in on these individual cases," says Bosworth, "but there doesn't seem to be a rule." In November, under pressure from Trump, heating and cooling firm Carrier Corp., a subsidiary of United Technologies, said it would keep hundreds of jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to a plant in Mexico. Who might be next? Bosworth says the Trump Twitter spotlight is shining the most on big companies with well-known household brands. Automakers are especially at risk because of the sector's high volume of cross-border trade, and because it is so vulnerable to consumer opinion. Bosworth says going after a maker of obscure chemicals or a small firm that makes car components doesn't produce great headlines, nor does it move public sentiment. Trump's focus is on finished products. "If they're not assembled, they can't be identified in the terms of a specific model of a General Motors car," Bosworth says. "It doesn't have the same public appeal." Trump has talked tough on China trade as well, but Bosworth notes he has not gone after individual companies — Apple, for example, and its huge iPhone assembly operations there. China's economy is almost as big as the U.S.'s, and it has the power to inflict lots of pain on U.S. companies, like Boeing — so interfering there could backfire for American workers. Article continues after sponsorship Bosworth says picking on Mexico is like fighting the weak kid on the playground: It's less likely to elicit a retaliatory response. U.S. companies are the biggest foreign investors in Mexico, and U.S.-Mexico trade is worth about half a trillion dollars annually. "It's a much weaker economy," Bosworth notes, "much fewer options available to them." The Two-Way Shaming Firms That Export Jobs Has Worked For Trump So Far Economist Derek Scissors at the American Enterprise Institute says retailers, banks and other service providers aren't likely to be targeted. And, he says, he hopes the singling out of individual companies will stop once Trump takes office. "When you're president, you shouldn't be bothering one company. You should be changing policies such as corporate taxes, to change the whole landscape," Scissors argues. "Getting down into the details can't be done by Twitter." He acknowledges that tweeting about trade does accomplish a few things. First, it appeals to Trump's base. "Probably the reason that he won the election is the effort to re-shore manufacturing," he says, "not to accept it as inevitable that manufacturing will head overseas." Business Carrier Got Cut A Deal, But Can Other Companies Expect The Same? The tweets also telegraph a message, he says, not just to the specific companies Trump has targeted, but also to firms in other industries which might be thinking about expanding elsewhere besides Mexico.

Foreign companies are interested in acquiring a controlling stake, i.e., more than 51 percent of the shares. Such an example is Air Astana airline, where the investor has acquired 49 percent stake, and the state has transferred to him in trust further two percent of the shares. Representatives of the State Agency for Attraction of Investments under the Ministry of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic and the members of the Board of Air Kyrgyzstan felt the need to create a joint venture with China Southern Airlines. This will enhance the capabilities of both parties. The Chinese intend to update the fleet and expand company's route network after its creation.  The head of the Ministry of Transport and Roads of Kyrgyzstan Zhamshitbek Kalilov noted that the issue should be carefully considered taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and urged his colleagues to submit proposals for a final decision on the establishment of a joint venture. State China Southern Airlines (South China Airlines) is among the five largest airlines in China. It has more than 600 Boeing and Airbus planes. They daily operate more than 2,500 flights in 260 directions. Chinese investors say that in the case of a positive decision on the establishment of the joint venture, Air Kyrgyzstan within five years will get up to six aircrafts for international and inland flights and an aircraft for the transport of the first persons of the Kyrgyz Republic.  URL: http://www.eng.24.kg/economics/170587-news24.html printable version      ��������    ��������   RELATED MATERIALS 14/01-2017 / Society Kyrgyz citizens have to be fingerprinted to obtain visa to China 10/01-2017 / Economics Chinese businessmen not interested in idle factories in Kyrgyzstan 10/01-2017 / Economics First trucks from Kyrgyzstan go along Bishkek - Kashkar – Urumqi route 09/01-2017 / Power President of Kyrgyzstan takes rest in China 05/01-2017 / Power President of Kyrgyzstan to pay working visit to China without press� 29/11-2016 / Economics Roads.kg.

Trump’s comments marked his latest broadside aimed at an American company over jobs, imports and costs before he takes office on January 20, signalling an uncommon degree of intervention for an incoming US President into corporate affairs. “General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to US car dealers-tax free across border. Make in USA or pay big border tax!” Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 per cent tax on their exports into the US. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada. Trump’s tweet came hours before GM’s rival Ford Motor Co. announced it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Ford’s executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr, said he personally notified Trump of the decision. GM, the world’s number three automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the US in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the US, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the US. Since winning the November 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM’s rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the US, including United’s Carrier unit in Indiana. “In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think you’ve seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don’t benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind,” Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. « Stocks climb, dollar dips ahead of Fed minutes Eurozone business growth fastest in more than five years in December –PMI » Advert See our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" Trump said in a post on Twitter. Trump did not provide further details but previously vowed to hit companies that shift production from America to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States. He also has denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada. Trump's tweet came hours before GM's rival Ford Motor Co announced it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and would invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after it also came under criticism from the Republican president-elect for its Mexican investment plans. Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., said he personally notified Trump of the decision, but after Trump's early-morning GM tweet. GM, the world's No. 3 automaker, said it sold about 190,000 Cruze cars in the United States in 2016. All of the sedan versions sold in the United States, or about 185,500, were built at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. About 4,500 hatchback versions of the Cruze were assembled in Mexico and sold in the United States. "GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S." it said in a statement posted on its website. The Cruze is one of GM's best-selling cars, although its sales numbers were down significantly in 2016. Shares of GM rose 1 percent to $35.19 after falling about 1 percent following Trump's tweet before the market opened. Since winning the Nov. 8 presidential election, Trump has targeted GM's rival Ford Motor Co, United Technologies Inc, Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Trump also has touted decisions by companies to keep some production in the United States, including United's Carrier unit in Indiana. "In this case, the tweet was specific to General Motors. But I think you've seen an overall philosophy during the campaign and since he was elected to stand up for American workers and make sure that American companies don't benefit from moving their companies overseas and leaving American workers behind," Trump transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said. Last month, Trump announced the formation of a council to advise him on job creation comprised of leaders from a variety of major U.S. corporations including GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra. GM said in 2015 it would build its next-generation Chevrolet Cruze compact in Mexico as automakers look to expand in the Latin American nation to take advantage of low labor costs and free trade agreements. The company said in 2015 it would invest $350 million to produce the Cruze at its plant in Coahuila as part of the $5 billion investment in its Mexican plants announced in 2014, creating 5,600 jobs. GM said last year it would import some Cruze cars from Mexico Trump, a Republican who will succeed Democratic President Barack Obama, campaigned for president using tough rhetoric on trade and promises to protect American workers, and targeted several companies by name. According to Automotive News, GM began producing the Cruze in Mexico last year, making 52,631 cars there. In comparison, it built 319,536 of them in the United States. Previous versions of the Cruze sold in Mexico were made in a GM South Korea plant, it reported. The shift is part of a larger trend among Detroit's Big Three automakers to produce more small cars for the North American market in Mexico in an effort to lower labor costs, while using higher-paid U.S. workers to build more profitable trucks, sport utility vehicles and luxury cars. In November, GM said it planned in early 2017 to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants, including the one in Lordstown. U.S. small car sales have been hurt by lagging consumer demand and low gas prices. GM's U.S. Cruze sales were down 18 percent through November.
