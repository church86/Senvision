Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 7, 2016 at 10:13AM Look! Up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a European space monopoly. Image source: Getty Images. Will they? Won't they? They will -- and they did. In a decision that will reverberate throughout the space industry for decades, last month the European Commission gave final approval to Airbus' (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) plan to acquire a controlling stake in European rocket launch company Arianespace. For the piddling sum of just $166 million, Airbus Safran Launchers (ASL -- Airbus' joint venture with Safran) will buy French government space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales' (CNES) 35% stake in Arianespace. ASL will add it to the 39% it already owns, and thus acquire 74% supermajority control over the space launch company. What it means to investors On the surface, this may sound like a run-of-the-mill corporate organization. It's not. In fact, it's hard to overestimate the significance of ASL's move to investors in Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) here in the U.S. Here's the reason in a nutshell: In the U.S., two companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, both build space launch vehicles -- Delta IV and Atlas V, respectively. These two companies provide these vehicles to their 50-50-owned joint venture, United Launch Alliance (ULA), which uses them for commercial and government (but mainly government) space missions. From start to finish, therefore, Boeing and Lockheed enjoy the synergies of being both rocket makers and rocket launchers. Similarly, in Europe, two companies -- Airbus and Safran this time -- build space launch vehicles. Up until now, their ASL joint venture did not fully control the company that launched those vehicles: Arianespace. But once ASL acquires CNES' stake in Arianespace, it will control the subsidiary. ASL's and CNES' businesses will basically be controlled by a unified management, and Airbus and Safran can begin to enjoy the same synergies that have benefited Boeing and Lockheed for a decade, since the formation of ULA in 2006.  As The Wall Street Journal pointed out in February, the formation of ASL was intended to give Airbus and Safran "cost efficiencies to compete more nimbly" against rivals, such as ULA and SpaceX (because SpaceX also both builds and launches its own rockets). But that was just the start. ASL also needed to control the launching business. As Airbus CEO Thomas Enders told the Journal back then: "I'm not satisfied with the progress we have achieved so far," and Arianespace still needed to be brought within the fold. Now it will be, and the playing field will be leveled among all three of these big space-launch companies. Sounds fair. So, what was the holdup? This development has been a long time coming. Not just since ASL announced plans to buy CNES' Arianespace stake in June of last year, or since Airbus' alliance with Safran to form ASL in 2014, but ever since Boeing and Lockheed stopped fighting each other and teamed up to form ULA 10 years ago. ASL gaining control over Arianespace is just the last step in a long process of Airbus and Safran playing catch-up, and as Enders lamented in the Journal earlier this year, Airbus has been "losing precious time against the competition" all the while. To fix that, the deal to acquire control over Arianespace, which required clearance from the European Commission, was expected to sail through by February. Instead, it was held up for nearly six months over EC concerns that an effectively merged ASL/Arianespace might exchange confidential information one with the other, to the detriment of competitors of both ASL (in rocket and satellite manufacture) and Arianespace (in rocket launch), who would not have access to such inside information on competing bids for products and services. To allay these concerns, Airbus and Arianespace have made binding commitments to set up "firewalls" to prevent such transfers of confidential information, so as to not harm competition in the fields of satellite manufacture or space launch. At the same time, the EC's review confirmed that past worries over potential "discrimination in satellite manufacturers' access to Arianespace's launch services," and worries that Arianespace would choose to buy only ASL launchers and payload adapters in the future, shutting down competing products from, for example, Russia's Progress State Research and Production Space Centre (TsSKB) or Italy's ELV, were in fact unfounded. That's good news for ASL and Arianespace going forward, as the companies were not required to make any commitments to preserve competition in these areas. It's less good for rival rocket makers, should it turn out that Arianespace will in the future begin giving more business to its de facto owner, and less to competing companies. The upshot for investors Was the European Commission right to give Airbus and Arianespace the benefit of the doubt on these latter issues? Will the firewalls the companies say they will put in place in fact protect their rivals from unfair competition? Time will tell. For now, what we know is this: With the EC on board with the deal, Airbus and its partner are free to proceed with their acquisition of a controlling stake in Arianespace. The creation of a de facto monopoly in European space launch has begun -- and SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin now face a tougher rival when competing for international launch contracts.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FL – The next generation of America’s human spaceships is rapidly taking shape and “making fantastic progress” at the Kennedy Space Center as Boeing and NASA showcased the start of assembly of the first flightworthy version of the aerospace giants Starliner crew taxi vehicle to the media last week. Starliner will ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS) by early 2018. “We are making fantastic progress across the board,” John Mulholland, vice president and program manager of Boeing Commercial Programs, told Universe Today at the July 26 media event in Boeing’s new Starliner factory. “It so nice to move from design to firm configuration, which was an incredibly important milestone, to now moving into the integrated qual phase of the campaign.” Boeing is swiftly making tangible progress towards once again flying Americans astronauts to space from American soil as was quite visibly demonstrated when the firm showed off their spanking new Starliner ‘clean-floor factory’ to the media last week, including Universe Today – and it’s already humming with activity by simultaneously building two full scale Starliner crew vehicles. “We are on track to support launch by the end of 2017 [of the uncrewed orbital test flight],” Mulholland told me. “The Structural Test Article (STA) crew module is almost ready to be delivered to the test site in California. The service module is already delivered at the test site. So we are ready to move into the qualification campaign.” “We are also in the middle of component qualification and qualifying more than one component every week as we really progress into assembly, integration and test of flight design spacecrafts.” Starliner is being manufactured in what is officially known as Boeing’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility (C3PF) at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida under contract with NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP). And the Boeing CST-100 Starliner assembly line aiming to send our astronauts to low Earth orbit and the space station is now operating full speed ahead at KSC. Formerly known as Orbiter Processing Facility-3, or OPF-3, the facility was previously used as a servicing hanger to prepare NASA’s space shuttle orbiters for flight. NASA, industry and news media representatives visit the modernized high bay in Boeing’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Credits: NASA/Kim Shiflett The facility has now been completely renovated and refurbished by removing about 11,000 tons of massive steel work platforms that once enshrouded the space shuttle orbiters for servicing and refurbishment for flight – and been transformed into Boeings gleaming white C3PF Starliner manufacturing facility. Components for the first Starliner that will actually fly in space – known as Spacecraft 1 – began arriving recently at the C3PF. These include the upper and lower domes, as well as the docking hatch for the spacecrafts pressure vessel. “You can see the beginning of Spacecraft 1. To build it all of the major structural elements are here,” Mulholland explained. “The lower dome will be populated and get to first power on early next year. We are really looking forward to that. Then we will mate that to the upper dome and start in on the ground qualification on Spacecraft 1.” Altogether Boeing is fabricating three Starliner flight spacecraft. “We will start building Spacecraft 2 in the Fall of this year. And then we will start Spacecraft 3 early next year.” “So we will have three Starliner spacecraft flight crew module builds as we move into the flight campaign.” The honeycombed upper dome of a Boeing Starliner spacecraft on a work stand inside the company’s Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com Notably Spacecraft 1 will be the first Starliner to fly in the company’s pad abort test. “Spacecraft 1 will go into the ground campaign and then the pad abort,” Mulholland stated. “The test is designed to prove the launch abort system planned for the spacecraft will be able to lift astronauts away from danger in the event of an emergency during launch operations,” says NASA. The Pad Abort test is currently slated for October 2017 in New Mexico. Boeing will fly an uncrewed orbital flight test in December 2017 and a crewed orbital flight test in February 2018. “Spacecraft 3 will be the first to fly in orbit on the uncrewed flight test by the end of 2017,” Mulholland confirmed. ‘Spacecraft 2 will go through a several month long thermal vac testing and EMI and EMC in California in the middle of next year and then go into the crewed flight test [in 2018].” The rather distinctive, olive colored aluminum domes are manufactured using a weldless spin forming process by Spincraft, based in North Billerica, Massachusetts. They take on their honeycombed look after being machined for the purposes of reducing weight and increasing strength to handle the extreme stresses of spaceflight.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com Engineers bolted together the upper and lower domes of Boeings maiden Starliner crew module in early May to form the complete hull of the pressure vessel for the Structural Test Article (STA). Altogether they are held together by 216 bolts. They have to line up perfectly. And the seals are checked to make sure there are no leaks, which could be deadly in space. Boeing expects to finish fabricating the STA by August. The completed Starliner STA will then be transported to Boeing’s facility in Huntington Beach, California for a period of critical stress testing that verifies the capabilities and worthiness of the spacecraft. “Boeing’s testing facility in Huntington Beach, California has all the facilities to do the structural testing and apply loads. They are set up to test spacecraft,” said Danom Buck, manager of Boeing’s Manufacturing and Engineering team at KSC, during an interview in the C3PF. “At Huntington Beach we will test for all of the load cases that the vehicle will fly in and land in – so all of the worst stressing cases.” “So we have predicted loads and will compare that to what we actually see in testing and see whether that matches what we predicted.” Boeing has also vastly updated the mockup Starliner to reflect the latest spacecraft advances and assist in manufacturing the three planned flight units. Bastian Technologies built many of the components for the mockup and signed as new 18-month new Mentor-Protégé Program agreement with Boeing and NASA at the media event. The mock up “is used as a hands-on way to test the design, accessibility and human factors during the early design and development phase of the program. The mock-up is currently being used for rapid fire engineering verification activities, ergonomic evaluations [including the seats and display panels], and crew ingress and egress training,” says NASA.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The Boeing CST 100 Starliner is one of two private astronaut capsules – along with the SpaceX Crew Dragon – being developed under a commercial partnership contract with NASA to end our sole reliance on Russia for crew launches back and forth to the International Space Station (ISS). The goal of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) is to restore America’s capability to launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil to the ISS, as soon as possible. Boeing was awarded a $4.2 Billion contract in September 2014 by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden to complete development and manufacture of the CST-100 Starliner space taxi under the agency’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) program and NASA’s Launch America initiative. Since the retirement of NASA’s space shuttle program in 2011, the US was been 100% dependent on the Russian Soyuz capsule for astronauts rides to the ISS at a cost exceeding $70 million per seat. Starliners will launch to space atop the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket from pad 41 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Boeing Starliner will launch on a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket similar to the one carrying the NROL-61 surveillance satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) from Space Launch Complex-41 on July 28, 2016 at 8:37 a.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, FL.

As Prime membership soars, Amazon adds planes to arsenal The Washington Post Aug 6, 2016 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS The Boeing 767 “Amazon One” Prime Air cargo plane, unveiled Friday in Seattle, is part of a fleet of 40 jetliners leased by the online retailer for its air cargo network. The Amazon.com logo is on e-readers, tablet computers and countless cardboard boxes on doorsteps. Now, the familiar, swooping arrow is somewhere new: plastered on the side of a Boeing 767. The e-commerce giant on Friday showed off the aircraft that it has dubbed “Amazon One,” a plane that is among a fleet of 40 leased from two air freight companies in an effort to improve a supply chain straining to keep pace with the retailer’s growing sales and its swelling ranks of Prime members. “Creating an air transportation network is expanding our capacity to ensure great delivery speeds for our Prime members for years to come,” Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in a statement. The move to create its own fleet of planes is part of a broader blitz of investment by Amazon to shore up its delivery capabilities. It has begun experimenting with an Uber-like network of drivers that could deliver packages within local markets such as Baltimore, Miami and Milwaukee. Last year, the company unveiled an Amazon-branded fleet of 4,000 trucking trailers to shuttle its wares. Amazon said its planes and trucking trailers are largely meant to help move goods from one warehouse to another, rather than to facilitate delivery of orders to customers. And, in that way, the company said its forays into the logistics arena are intended to complement the business that it does with UPS and FedEx, not replace them. Yet some analysts wonder whether the buildup of planes, trucking power and drivers should be interpreted as something of a warning shot that Amazon has more ambitious plans to take greater control of the delivery process. Amazon is a major customer of UPS and FedEx, and the shipping firms have shrugged off the idea that the e-commerce giant intends to bypass them. Even if it did, FedEx, for example, has said that no single customer accounts for more than 3 percent of its revenue. Whatever Amazon’s long game is on logistics, it is clear that it was looking to make a splash with the inaugural flight of Amazon One. The company flew the aircraft Friday in the Boeing Seafair Air Show, an annual event near its headquarters in Seattle. The side of the plane is emblazoned with the words “Prime Air,” and its underside features the Amazon logo. The curved Amazon arrow appears on the tail. The plane’s tail number — N1997A — is a prime number, a gimmick that the company said is meant as a nod to its Prime customers. Eleven of its leased planes have been in the air ferrying goods, but this plane is the first to be splashed with Amazon branding. The rest of the fleet will be getting the logo treatment soon. Even as Amazon ventures into new territory with its trucking and air fleets, it continues to make other, more familiar investments in its logistics capabilities. The retailer has famously been plowing millions of dollars into building a network of fulfillment and sorting centers that enable its promise of two-day shipping on Prime orders. In this quarter alone, the company is set to open 18 fulfillment centers, or three times the number that it opened in the same quarter in 2015. The retailer’s aim is to be better prepared for the coming holiday season crush. Last year, fulfillment costs soared in that quarter as demand increased at its warehouses. Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, owns the Washington Post.

All passengers and crew escaped from the Boeing Co. 777-300 following the 12:45pm explosion on Flight 521 from Thiruvananthapuram, India. A firefighter was killed trying to extinguish the blaze, Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said at an evening news conference in Dubai. Chairman Sheikh Ahmed: The trouble with the flight was ‘operationa’. — Reuters file picThe trouble with the flight was “operational,” he said, adding he didn’t believe there was any security issue. The pilot might have attempted a so-called go-around — that is, aborting the landing — to avoid wind shear, but that hadn’t been verified, Sheikh Ahmed said. The airport had issued a wind-shear warning for all runways before the accident, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. The condition occurs when wind direction changes abruptly. In extreme cases, it can be severe enough that a plane will lose lift and plunge. “It’s difficult to speculate about what happened in the last few minutes of the flight, but I want to thank the crew for their professionalism and evacuating the plane in a short time,” Sheikh Ahmed said. The pilot and co-pilot had logged more than 7,000 of flying hours each, he said. Cockpit instructions Flight 521 had been cleared to land at Dubai, according to a transcript of an air-traffic control recording obtained by LiveATC.net. About a minute and a-half later, the tower gave a new instruction. “Emirates 521 climb straight ahead to 4,000 feet” (1,200 metres), a controller said, a command acknowledged by the pilot. The reason for the order wasn’t known. Typically, such instructions are issued after pilots request to abort touchdowns. Television footage and newswire photos showed that the aircraft slid to a halt on its belly, with one of its huge Rolls-Royce engines detached. The jet then quickly became engulfed in smoke and fire, which gutted the length of the fuselage and burned off the roof. The jumbo jet carried 282 passengers and 18 crew members, according to Emirates, the world’s biggest carrier by international traffic. Emergency services sprayed down the plane to put out the fire. Passengers and crew hurried to safety down inflatable slides. Thirteen people were hospitalized with minor injuries, Sheikh Ahmed said. Dubai airport, the world’s third-busiest by passenger numbers, shut down shortly after the crash and reopened at 6:30 p.m. on a restricted basis, giving priority to arriving flights. Investigation teams The US National Transportation Safety Board is sending a five-person team to assist with the investigation, a spokesman said. Under a United Nations treaty, the government from where the plane was manufactured is invited to participate in a probe. Despite the reported winds, the pilots should have been able to land the plane — or climb to safety if they were uncomfortable with the situation, said John Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems and a former airline pilot. “Professional pilots deal with high winds and gusty winds on a regular basis,” Cox said in an interview. “It’s like cruise-ship captains. You are going to have to learn to dock that thing when it’s calm or when winds are at 40 knots.” At this point, investigators won’t rule anything out, looking at weather conditions, possible pilot missteps and potential failures of aircraft systems, he said. The aircraft involved entered service in 2003 and was current for regular maintenance and inspections, Sheikh Ahmed. ‘Belly Flop’ John Nance, a former commercial and US Air Force pilot who has flown a 777, said videos from the scene indicate that the landing gear may not have been fully deployed when Flight 521 touched down. “This is a situation where it looks very much like the aircraft was landing with gear up. It does appear this was a belly flop,” he said. “Why is a good question, especially if the aircraft was ordered to go around.” Boeing’s 777 model is the largest twin-engine airliner in production and the most used wide-body. Emirates is the biggest operator of the plane as well as of Airbus Group SE’s A380 double-decker. The Boeing aircraft is also one of the safest, with only a handful suffering irreparable damage since the model’s introduction two decades ago, including incidents caused by war or pilot error, according to Aviation Safety Network. Rolls-Royce engine Boeing is standing by with a technical team to help US authorities investigating the accident, the US planemaker said on its website. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, which made the jet’s Trent 800 engines, also said it was ready to take part in the probe. Wednesday’s 3½-hour flight started midmorning from Thiruvananthapuram on India’s southwest coast. Emirates serves the region mainly to ferry Indian workers to jobs in the Middle East. The carrier has built its business on exploiting the Persian Gulf’s position at the heart of intercontinental flight paths and the region’s oil industry, building Dubai into an airport that served 78 million passengers last year, making the hub the world’s biggest by international traffic. The carrier’s success has put pressure on earnings at European network airlines including Air France-KLM Group and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Tough general convinces Trump to backtrack on torture Far-right loner jailed for life in murder of British MP Egypt’s Sisi expresses support for Syrian military Turkey throws out child sex bill after outcry Israel minister doesn’t expect Mideast move by Obama Trump’s daughter Ivanka sits in on landmark Japan PM talks Clinton: Election exposed deep divisions in the US Journalist arrested in Morocco for report on cannabis Trump demands apology over 'Hamilton' slight (VIDEO) Confusion over Trump's first talks with foreign leader (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The kidnapping took place on Wednesday in waters off the northeast of Sabah state, on the Malaysian side of Borneo island, Indonesia’s ambassador to Malaysia said. “[The vessel] was intercepted by a boat carrying four armed men,” ambassador Herman Prayitno said. The kidnappers took the Indonesian captain after failing to get the 10,000 ringgit (US$2,500) they demanded, Prayitno added. AUSTRALIA Flight diverted to Guam A Jetstar flight from Tokyo to Australia’s Gold Coast was diverted to Guam yesterday. The twin-engine JQ12 Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight from Narita international airport to the Gold Coast landed on the US island territory of Guam in the Pacific yesterday morning after an oil pressure warning light came on, Jetstar said. “After receiving the indicator message the captain elected to shut down one engine as a precaution. Boeing 787s can fly safely on one engine.” The passengers, which the Australian Broadcasting Corp said numbered about 320, are to be taken to Australia on a flight arriving today. AUSTRALIA ‘Patriot’ charged with terror A man with reported links to far-right extremist groups was yesterday charged with planning a terrorist attack after his Melbourne home was raided following police fears of a “specific threat.” The 31-year-old, named in local media as Phillip Galea, appeared in court after he was charged with planning or preparing for a terrorist act and collecting or making documents to facilitate an attack. Galea told the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court he would fight the charges, adding that they were “a conspiracy against the patriot movement.” MEXICO Six killed in landslide A landslide triggered by Tropical Storm Earl left six dead on Saturday in the country’s east as heavy rains began to ease up, but officials warned residents to remain prepared for more floods or mudslides. A couple and their toddler died in Veracruz state when their house was buried, the state’s secretary of civil protection Yolanda Gutierrez Carlin said. The couple’s eight-year-old child was rescued and hospitalized. Another young couple and their three-year-old child were killed when their home was completely swamped by mud. UNITED STATES Drugged candy hits revelers Two dozen concertgoers in northeast Ohio on Saturday suffered medical symptoms after they ate candy laced with a drug found in marijuana. No fatalities were reported at the Ohio Dreams sports camp complex in Butler, about 100km northeast of Columbus, where the weekend-long EST 2016 rap music festival was being held. Major Joe Masi of the Richland County Sheriff’s Department told the Mansfield News Journal someone began tossing out bags of the colorful candies at around 11am. The packages contained about 20 pieces each, according to photographs posted to social media. Masi said each piece had “a very, very high dose of THC,” the chemical that gives marijuana its mind-altering effects. Only one or two candies would get a user high, but some people were eating whole packages, officials said. This story has been viewed 1378 times. Comments will be moderated.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)   Sarah Halzack Washington Post     The Amazon.com logo is on e-readers, tablet computers and countless cardboard boxes on doorsteps. Now, the familiar, swooping arrow is about to show up somewhere new: plastered on the side of a Boeing 767. The e-commerce giant is showing off the aircraft it has dubbed "Amazon One," a plane that is among a fleet of 40 leased from two airfreight companies in an effort to improve a supply chain straining to keep pace with the retailer's growing sales and its swelling ranks of Prime members. "Creating an air transportation network is expanding our capacity to ensure great delivery speeds for our Prime members for years to come," Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, said in a statement. The move to create its own fleet of planes is part of a broader blitz of investment by Amazon to shore up its delivery capabilities. It has begun experimenting with an Uber-like network of drivers that could deliver packages within local markets such as Baltimore, Miami and Milwaukee. Last year, the company unveiled an Amazon-branded fleet of 4,000 trucking trailers to shuttle its wares. (Jeffrey P. Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.) Amazon says its planes and trucking trailers are largely meant to help move goods from one warehouse to another, rather than to facilitate delivery of orders to customers. And, in that way, the company says its forays into the logistics arena are intended to complement the business it does with UPS and FedEx, not replace them. Yet some analysts wonder if the buildup of planes, trucking power and drivers should be interpreted as something of a warning shot that Amazon has more ambitious plans to take greater control of the delivery process. Amazon is a major customer of UPS and FedEx, and the shipping firms have shrugged off the idea that the e-commerce giant intends to bypass them. Even if it did, FedEx, for example, has said that no single customer accounts for more than 3 percent of its revenue. Whatever Amazon's long game is on logistics, it is clear that it is looking to make a splash with the inaugural flight of Amazon One. The company is flying the aircraft on Friday in the Boeing Seafair Air Show, an annual event near its headquarters in Seattle. The side of the plane is emblazoned with the words "Prime Air," and its underside features the Amazon logo. The curved Amazon arrow appears on the tail. The plane's tail number -- N1997A -- is a prime number, a gimmick the company says is meant as a nod to its Prime customers. Eleven of its leased planes have been in the air ferrying goods, but this plane is the first to be splashed with Amazon branding. The rest of the fleet will be getting the logo treatment soon. Even as Amazon ventures into new territory with its trucking and air fleets, it continues to make other, more familiar investments in its logistics capabilities. The retailer has famously been plowing millions of dollars into building a network of fulfillment and sorting centers that enable its promise of two-day shipping on Prime orders. In this quarter alone, the company is set to open 18 fulfillment centers, or three times the number it opened in the same quarter in 2015. The retailer hopes the efforts will make it better prepared for the coming holiday season crush. Last year, fulfillment costs soared in that quarter as demand increased at its warehouses.

The plane is one of 40 jetliners in the "Prime Air" fleet that will make up the retail giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. Called the Amazon One, it was showcased online in a special time-lapse video that shows workers "upcycling" a Boeing jet. Credit: YouTube/About Amazon via Storyful The Boeing jets have been leased from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015. The history of Amazon Play! 02:11 Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Credit: YouTube/About Amazon via Storyful Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future." Credit: YouTube/About Amazon via Storyful The company has been furiously building out distribution centres, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as developing drone delivery technology – another branch of Prime Air.  The company currently has a Prime Air development centre in the United Kingdom,  as well as the US, Austria and Israel. The intention is to use drones to deliver packages ordered on Amazon in 30 minutes or less.

It is located on a 3.5-acre site bounded by Magazine, Calliope and Camp Streets and Andrew Higgins Drive. There is a subway on the ground floor of the museum. There are also the Restoration Pavilion, the Victory Theater and the Liberation Pavilion among others, which feature screens showing short documentaries of the beginning of the war and other key issues surrounding it, the brutality of the battles in the Pacific and the casualties of the European Theatre. The oral history studios enable visitors listen to narratives of the war. There is also a fascinating creation depicting the aftermath of the crash of a CG-4A Waco glider in Normandy, in the early morning of June 6 1944. With the aid of special effects, a visitor can hear birds chirping and squirrels screeching in the background. It is said that the Boeing Company has made donations of planes involved in accidents to the museum to vividly paint the effect of crash scenes during the war. Though a global war, the WW11, which was fought from September 1939 to September 1945, was one war America wasn’t keen on fighting, until the Pearl Harbour was hit. America’s initial reluctance was based on its experience with the First World War, but when the Pearl Harbour was hit in December 1941, Americans had no choice than to join the war, though it wasn’t as if they were entirely neutral, when the war broke out. By early 1942, all the world’s major countries had got involved in the most destructive war in history. American history will not be complete without the narratives of the WW11 and so, the museum, which is said to have gulped $325million and still counting, is an epic survey of a war that was said to have been fought in over 50 countries, including Nigeria and all the great powers, which eventually formed two opposing military alliances— the Allies and the Axis and involved more than 100 million people. Described as the mightiest struggle humankind has ever experienced, the war was said to have resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres. The World War II is, indeed, the deadliest conflict in human history. It killed more people, cost more money, destroyed more property, affected more people, and caused more far-reaching changes in nearly every country than any other war recorded in history. The number of people killed, wounded, or missing between September 1939 and September 1945 can never be calculated, but it is estimated that more than 55 million people perished. The WW11 museum, which is also a theme park, displays the roll call of donors and sponsors of the project, as well as some veterans, who gave their all to the cause. On interlocks used on walkways around the museum are inscriptions of names of American veterans, who had fought gallantly and paid the supreme price. The Guardian also observed that veterans and serving military are the first group usually called to board flights at American domestic airports, though it couldn’t be ascertained whether they are made to pay for the services or not. The deep sense of preservation is also worthy of note in the WW11 museum. Aside the ubiquitous machine guns, rifles, helmets, uniforms, booth and other common war materials such as magazines, the museum has also preserved tyres used by trucks during the war and other things one would have thought are insignificant, such as packs of cigarettes, matches, socks, chewing gums, anti-seasickness pills, water purification tablets, penicillin, French language translation handbook. Interestingly, condoms used by the troops to keep sand and water out of rifle barrels were also on display. With no tour guide, a visitor is able to move easily round the museum and understand what every artefact connotes. There are enough write-ups to be read to help conjure a mental picture of events. The many 120-foot-wide screens mounted in theatres showed vivid pictures of events on the battlefield. A section of the museum also depicts heavy forest, where troops hid and shot at the enemies. Churchill led the operation tagged ‘Bodyguard,’ which eventually recorded more positive result during the war. It was discovered that troops’ plans were foiled due to leakages. So, he devised a means of wrapping lies round planned operations, which helped the troops to succeed eventually. The over-an-hour tour of the museum was a rewarding experience that will not leave anyone fatigued or bored. Theatre are strategically located around, where one could sit and watch some documentaries or listen to oral history. At no cost, the museum is said to have received over 3.5 million visitors since it opened in 2000. There are enormous interactive video databases. Information about the war’s 464 Medal of Honor winners, the more than 700 government leaders, who were the veterans, including Presidents George H. W Bush, Gerald R. Ford, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, was also available. Still a work in progress, when the edifice is completed, it will house the $35 million US Freedom Pavilion: the Boeing Centre. It will also act as a kind of interlude, a salute to the nation’s fighting forces during the war. A Boeing-17 Flying Fortress, a Corsair fighter also known as “Whistling Death” and other warplanes will be seen as the visitor stands at the atrium, while touch screens will allow for exploration of cockpits and controls. There will also be a special-effect theatre with falling “snow,” vibrating seats to depict earth shakings, as missiles flew through the air. The whole essence is to allow visitors experience the sight, sound and emotion of going to war. There are also newspaper clips on the progression of the war and when it eventually ended. In his victory message titled ‘cost of victory’ to allied troupe of Europe, General Dwight Eisenhower said: “The route you have travelled is marked by the graves of former comrades. Each of the fallen dead, as a member of the team to which you belong, bound together by a common love of liberty’’. An artwork depicting the graveyard of fallen heroes is rested on a large portion of a wall in the museum. The artistic piece showed rows of tombs with white cross on each of them. Indeed, a visit to the museum will enable those not born during the war to grasp more than 50 percent of the happenings during the war. It is hoped that the world will never again experience such monumental waste of human and natural resources.

Amazon unveiled its first branded cargo plane Thursday, one of 40 freighters that will make up the company's ... own air transportation network of 40 Boeing jets leased from Atlas Air and Air Transportation Services Group, which will operate the air cargo network. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) Expand Amazon Reveals 'Prime Air' Cargo Jet Published August 06, 2016 Ecommerce Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) unveiled the first in a planned fleet of new cargo jets on Thursday, part of an effort by the e-commerce giant to expand its logistics operation. Continue Reading Below The Boeing (BA) 767-300, emblazoned with "Prime Air" on its fuselage, is to be operated by Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. (AAWW). It is one of 40 that Amazon has agreed to lease as it broadens its system for shipping and delivering goods quickly to supplement partners such as United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) and FedEx Corp.(FDX). The plane is part of a deal announced in May to lease 20 Boeing planes from Atlas Air, following a similar deal in March to lease as many as 20 jets from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG). The effort stems from a broad desire at Amazon to take greater control of its shipping and package delivery operations. In some cases, the firm is using its own trucks, drivers and a fleet of couriers for so-called last mile delivery, the final and most-expensive leg of an order’s trip. Amazon’s shipping costs have been rising more quickly than sales, and having its own cargo fleet could help stem the rise. The company said last month its second-quarter shipping expenses rose 44% to $3.36 billion, while sales rose 31%. In its deal with Amazon, Atlas provides crew, maintenance and insurance over the course of seven years. Atlas said it expects to begin putting the Amazon planes into service this quarter.

WARREN | THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Amazon.com boxes are stacked near a Boeing 767 “Prime Air” cargo plane on display in Seattle on Thursday. SEATTLE — Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers. The planes will have connections to Ohio, where Amazon has been making a major investment in distribution and technology operations. In March, following months of speculation, Amazon confirmed it had struck a deal with Wilmington-based ATSG to lease 20 Boeing freighter jets. ATSG operates at the air park that was handed over to the city of Wilmington by DHL when the German shipping giant closed its operations there. Under the initial 5-year agreement, ATSG also will operate the aircraft and provide logistics services to Amazon. In central Ohio, Amazon is building two distribution centers along with three data centers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Amazon revealed its first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. Amazon leased a total of 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future."

Frank Kendall, the Defense Department's top weapons buyer, has convened a closed session of the Defense Acquisition Board for Wednesday to review the Air Force's acquisition strategy and updated cost estimates for replacing Minuteman III nuclear-armed missiles that have sat in silos for almost 50 years. The Air Force last year estimated the program would cost $62.3 billion for research and development and production of as many as 400 missiles as well as command and control systems and infrastructure. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman are all competing to build the new ICBMs. The other arms of the nation's land-air-sea nuclear triad also are scheduled to be modernized: Northrop defeated a Lockheed-Boeing team in October for the right to build a new bomber that can carry nuclear weapons, a project valued at as much as $80 billion. The Navy is planning to replace its Ohio-class nuclear-armed submarines through a production program now estimated at $122 billion. Updated estimates for the cost of the missiles have been prepared by the Air Force and and the Pentagon's independent cost assessment office but haven't yet been released. The Navy is also updating its submarine estimate for a review later this year. The new forecasts are likely to add to the debate over whether coming administrations will be able to afford what defense analysts call a "bow wave" of costs converging in the next decade for the new nuclear systems as well as nine Air Force conventional systems and plans for increased construction of naval vessels such as a second Ford-class aircraft carrier. The ICBM "milestone marks the official beginning of the technology development stage where contracts will be awarded and spending" will "begin to ramp up," from about $75 million this year to $1.6 billion in 2021, Todd Harrison, a defense budget analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an email. Arms control organizations and some Pentagon officials say the nuclear triad's modernization could cost as much as $1 trillion over 30 years if research, procurement, operations and support are included. By way of comparison, Pentagon analysts estimate that Lockheed's F-35 jet, the military's most expensive program, may cost as much as $1.12 trillion over 60 years to support. "It's also important to put these costs in context," Harrison said. "The U.S. will likely spend more than $20 trillion over the next 30 years on defense, so $1 trillion is only a small fraction of that," Harrison said. Still, the bow wave's cost is likely to force the Air Force to delay the ICBM program or cancel it in favor of modifying the existing missiles because the service has higher priorities, predicted Kingston Reif, an analyst with the Arms Control Association. The Pentagon review "reflects the current department and service commitment to the program, but it's far from a point of no return," Reif said in an email. Adm. Cecil Haney, head of the U.S. Strategic Command, told a House Armed Services Committee panel last month the new missile program is necessary because a comprehensive nuclear deterrence "requires us to have a complex problem for an adversary." "If that program is delayed it really puts the one leg of the triad at significant risk" from "a reliability standpoint," Haney said. The Air Force plans to award two 36-month contracts by September 2017 for the ICBM's technology development phase and then one contract in about 2020 for engineering, manufacturing, development and first five production lots, Leah Bryant, spokeswoman for the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, said in an email. The program is planning to offer competition for numerous aspects of the missile program, she added.

The company is showcasing the Boeing 767-300 this weekend at Seattle’s SeaFair Air Show. It will be flown and operated by Atlas Air Worldwide, which provides Amazon’s air cargo services. The cargo plane, which displays the Prime Air and Amazon smile logos, is one of 40 Boeing 767s that the company is leasing from Atlas and its other cargo partner, Air Transport Services Group. There are currently 11 dedicated planes flying for the company, with the remainder rolling out over the coming years. “Creating an air transportation network is expanding our capacity to ensure great delivery speeds for our Prime members for years to come,” said Dave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, in a press release. “I cannot imagine a better way to celebrate the inaugural flight than in our hometown at Seafair alongside Amazon employees and Seattle residents.” With its fleet of planes, 4000 truck trailers, and Uber-style Flex delivery vans - along with the eventual arrival of drones and container ships - the big question is whether the logistics network Amazon is building will ultimately see it abandon partners FedEx and UPS altogether, and perhaps even start competing aginst the two giants with its own delivery service. Jeff Bezos says this isn’t Amazon's intentions, claiming the firm just needs the additional capacity, but, as it proved with AWS, if there’s an opportunity to move into a new, money-making business then Amazon won’t stand idly by.

Close share panel Image copyright Reuters Passengers who stopped to get their hand luggage put 300 lives at risk last week, after a fire broke out on an Emirates airliner in Dubai. Luckily, everyone escaped before the plane was consumed by flames - but it could have been different. What can be done to make people leave their bags behind? "Passengers are told not to waste time getting luggage, but they just don't listen," says fire safety expert Prof Ed Galea of London's Greenwich University. "This is not unusual, it happens in most cases. Often they don't appreciate the absolute urgency of their situation. They don't realise that every second can literally make the difference between life and death." Two incidents in the last year have given a clear illustration of the problem. Before the Dubai fire video came pictures of passengers leaving a burning BA aircraft in Las Vegas, many wheeling bags across the tarmac. But Galea suggested an answer to this problem more than 20 years ago - a central-locking system for overhead storage. "On approach to land, the overhead bins should be locked by the flight deck," he says. "Passengers would obviously be informed that they are locked and cannot be opened until the plane is at the gate. I think it would make a huge difference." It should not cause any inconvenience, Galea says. During the flight passengers would still have access to their bags, unless the "fasten seat-belt" light was switched on. His ideas have fallen on stony ground, however. Airlines think it would be unpopular with passengers, Galea says, and will not be "volunteering" to do it even now that the Dubai and Las Vegas incidents have underlined again the potential for loss of life. Las Vegas 9 September 2015 Media captionOne of the plane's engines caught fire during preparations for take off Dubai 3 August 2016 Media captionA video shared on WhatsApp shows the panic on board the Emirates plane While the video of the Dubai evacuation depicts a chaotic scene - some passengers screaming, a child pushing past adults to find her mother, men getting luggage from the overhead lockers and others people apparently trying to attach oxygen masks - passengers did not engage in a life-and-death struggle to reach the exits. But such struggles do take place. In one account of the fire on a British Airtours jet at Manchester airport in 1985, in which 55 people died, an air stewardess describes people who, in their competition to get out, had become wedged into a gap near one of the exits so tightly that none of them could move. In the aftermath of the disaster, Prof Helen Muir of Cranfield University attempted to simulate this panicked evacuation with volunteers. As it would have been unethical to make them fear for their lives she offered them money. All participants, many of them students, were paid £10 to take part in four evacuations over the course of a day, but there was an additional cash payment of £5 per evacuation to those in the first half of the group to leave the plane. This was sufficient to cause people to get wedged together in the over-wing exit on five occasions; on two other occasions the experiment had to be halted because a volunteer fell and could have been trampled underfoot. Aircraft exits were subsequently redesigned. In such a scenario, where passengers are panicking - possibly in the dark, and choking on smoke - a wheeled bag could become a serious hazard. Why bags are dangerous in an evacuation They "slow people down and clog the aisles and exit points", as the pilot and author Patrick Smith puts it On the evacuation slide, bags become "a deadly, high-speed projectile", he adds In a mad rush for the exit, bags could trip passengers up They could also puncture the evacuation slide and put it out of action On the Professional Pilots Rumour Network (PPRuNe) last week there was some surprise that there had been no casualties in Dubai, as well as admiration for the Emirates cabin crew that got all the passengers out safely, and indignation that some passengers had recklessly risked their lives and those of others. A handful of pilots commented that it was "time to introduce locking overhead bins". However, a roughly equal number said that if the bins were locked, passengers would waste even more time trying to force them open. An incident when a passenger tore off part of the ceiling of a Cathay Pacific Airbus in Hong Kong last month provides some support for this argument. Seated towards the rear of the plane, the man did not have an overhead locker above his seat, just a curved ceiling panel. Trying to "open" it, he pulled so hard that it came away. Image copyright Facebook/@Tofu.Diary Another expert who is sceptical about the idea of centrally locking overhead storage is Devin Liddell, principal brand strategist for Teague, a design and innovation consultancy that has designed the interiors of Boeing aircraft since 1946. His solution is quite different: "To have far fewer bags in the cabin in the first place." When Teague researchers recently studied the attitudes of passengers towards their luggage, they discovered that their main fear was finding no room for their bag in the overhead locker. That is why, Liddell notes, whenever any announcement is made about boarding - even if only to say that the first to board will be those with young children - everyone at the gate stands and starts inching forwards. However, on probing further, the researchers discovered that passengers would be happy to part with their bags if there was no fee for putting them in the hold, and if they could be sure they would not get lost in transit. Image copyright Alamy Image caption The overhead space on a Boeing 707 was often used for hats (as, perhaps, on this Qantas flight at Heathrow in 1959) For many, their ideal model, Liddell says, was one used by short-haul commuter flights in the US, where bags are placed in a cart close to the aircraft door, and picked up again near the same door on the way out. He envisages a system where bags would carry a radio frequency ID tag, and passengers would receive a text message when their bag was loaded on to the plane, They would also be able to text a number to check where their bag was if they were concerned it was not on board. Teague's studies also found that the additional time taken to board a plane and disembark when all passengers carry bags is usually greater than the amount of time spent retrieving luggage from a carousel - though Liddell also regards carousels as "dinosaurs", ripe for replacement by smarter systems. For this reason, when the company unveiled a concept airline called Poppi last year, it provided no more space for hand luggage than there was on the Boeing 707, the aircraft that ushered in the age of jet travel half a century ago. "When we looked at old photographs, the overhead space was occupied mainly by hats - hats, briefcases and jackets - so we nicknamed them 'fedora bins'," Liddell says. Image copyright Teague Image caption Poppi's "fedora bins" Image copyright Teague Image caption Poppi's aircraft would also have light coming through the fuselage roof The original thinking behind the minimalist lockers was that getting rid of heavy carry-on bags would enhance passenger comfort, though Liddell says the safety argument is also a powerful one. The response from passengers was "overwhelmingly positive", he adds. Whether airlines would ever warm to the idea, however, is uncertain. The fedora bins would be lighter and save on fuel, but airlines that charge for putting bags in the hold would lose a useful income stream if these fees were cancelled. Airline pilot and author Patrick Smith who writes the AskThePilot blog is unconvinced both about centrally locked overhead bins, and the idea of radically restricting carry-on baggage. "We are well past the point where the banning of hand luggage is a reasonable solution," he says. He does regard locked bins as "something to think about", though he notes that passengers might still grab any bags stored under the seat. His preferred solution would be to re-focus pre-flight safety briefings - which so many passengers currently ignore - and to firmly emphasise just four or five bullet points, including the importance of leaving all bags behind during an evacuation. While Devin Liddell does not see central locking of overhead bins as the best solution to the problem, he too does not rule it out. It would be a challenge getting across to passengers that there was no point trying to open the bins in an emergency, he says. On the other hand, he has a design idea that might help: "Redesign the bin so there is an LED light that glows fiery red when it's locked, and goes green when it's unlocked." Prof Ed Galea thinks regulators may one day come round to his lockable lockers idea, but does not see it happening soon: "The difficulty with international regulators is they move at a snail's pace. "Most international regulation is 'tombstone regulation' - lots of people have to be killed in an accident first." But the passengers who stop to retrieve bags in an emergency are a "disaster waiting to happen," he insists. And one that will inevitably result in fatalities, sooner or later. A debate on the Professional Pilots Rumour Network asdf1234: Time to introduce locking overhead bins. Only accessible when the the seatbelt sign has been turned off. Ranger One: Great idea - until someone's laptop lithium battery goes into runaway and the locking system fails in the "locked" mode. etrang: Locking overhead bins would only make the situation worse as pax [passengers] try and figure out why they won't open. There is a simple solution however, don't let pax take any luggage into the cabin in the first place. Fortissimo: Those with a brain leave their bags behind rather than risk their own and other people's lives while they delay the evac to collect things from the overheads, create trip hazards and hurl heavy bags down slides... Those with even larger brains keep items such as passports, phones and wallets about their person. armchairpilot94116: We need to look at reducing the ability to carry on baggage. Having smaller bins, not bigger... Many airlines are charging for checking in bags. This should be reverse. There should instead be charges for hand carry. DXBWannabe: Maybe instead of showing 4 different videos before T/O [takeoff] with info everyone already knows, the airlines should drill into people not to take their luggage with them during an evac.

(Screen grab via U.S. Navy video) Posted By: Brendan McGarry August 3, 2016 The first MV-22 Osprey with 3-D-printed parts recently took flight, the Navy announced. The aircraft made by Textron Inc.’s Bell Helicopter unit and aerospace giant Boeing Co. performed a hover during a July 29 demonstration at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland, the service said in a statement. The Osprey was equipped with a titanium link and fitting inside an engine nacelle, thus marking the “first successful flight demonstration of a flight critical aircraft component built using additive manufacturing techniques,” according to the Navy, which released video of the demonstration on YouTube. The historic test may pave the way for eventually helping to develop replacement parts in faster time and at less cost, officials have said. “That’s where the Rosetta Stone is going to be,” Rear Adm. (Sel.) Francis Morley, vice commander of Naval Air Systems Command, said earlier this year at the Navy League’s Sea Air Space conference outside Washington, D.C., according to a previous article on our Military.com sister blog DoDBuzz by my colleague, Hope Hodge Seck. “If we can start manufacturing flight-critical components, now you’re talking sustainment costs and speed and time; we have some really great opportunities to accelerate,” he added. While the Air Force and Marine Corps currently fly the Osprey, the Navy is working toward developing its own variant. The command in April awarded Bell-Boeing a $151 million contract to being working on the Navy-specific version, CMV-22B, which will be used to deliver gear and supplies to aircraft carriers. The service expects to receive its first Ospreys in 2020. –Hope Hodge Seck contributed to this report.

(AP) — Amazon develó el viernes el primer avión de carga que llevará su marca, una de las 40 aeronaves que se sumarán a la flota propia de reparto del gigante minorista, que está aumentando su control sobre la red de entregas de sus productos.   La nueva iniciativa para agilizar los repartos llegó mientras la empresa, con sede en Seattle, eleva el número de paquetes que la compañía entrega en todo el mundo. Se estima que Amazon movió unos 1.000 millones de paquetes en 2015, el mismo número que entregó FedEx tres años antes para cientos de miles de clientes.   MÁS: Amazon regresa al negocio de los teléfonos celulares pero con una diferencia   Amazon ha tenido problemas con la fiabilidad de los servicios aéreos de mercancías. En 2013 ofreció devoluciones a los clientes que recibieron tarde sus pedidos de navidad debido al mal tiempo y a un aumento en la venta a través de internet, que causó retrasos de UPS y FedEx.   Los analistas informaron que tiene sentido para Amazon emplear la flota que controla como otra forma de llevar sus productos a compradores en internet atraídos por su reparto rápido y sin coste adicional.   "Son un minorista de internet muy grande", comentó Satish Jindel, presidente de la consultora de logística ShipMatrix. "Hay tanto volumen, que si uno tiene que añadir el transporte para sí mismo, ¿por qué iba a pagar el precio de venta cuando puede hacerlo al por mayor? Tiene sentido".   La compañía presentará el viernes el primer avión con su marca, Amazon One, en la feria anual Seafair. El avión pasará sobre el lago Washington de Seattle, según un portavoz de la empresa.   MÁS: Google responde a Amazon y Oculus con nuevos productos   Amazon ha arrendado 40 aviones Boeing de Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings y Air Transport Services Group Inc., que entregarán paquetes para el programa de fidelidad Prime.   Pese a la flota que está construyendo, Amazon dijo que tiene previsto seguir trabajando con FedEx, UPS y otros socios.   Amazon informó hace poco de unos beneficios de 857 millones de dólares en el segundo trimestre del año, con unos ingresos 30.000 millones de dólares.   Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process.   MÁS: Amazon lanza una plataforma para compartir videos para hacerle guerra a YouTube   The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015 — the same number that FedEx delivered three years earlier for hundreds of thousands of customers.   Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who got their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx.   Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery.   "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense."   Amazon will reveal its first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane will buzz over Seattle's Lake Washington just before the Navy's Blue Angels take to the skies, a company official said.   Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years.   Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations.   Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners.   "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said.   The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide.   Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots.   "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future."   Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Spin Control: Figuring the governor’s primary, over the years Jim Camden Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Candidates and their campaigns are apt to get caught up in the excitement of election night and say things that, in the light of later days, don’t hold up well. As state primary returns were being reported Tuesday night, Republican Bill Bryant’s gubernatorial campaign came up with an interesting way to spin results that showed him 10 percentage points behind Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee. First, Inslee was under 50 percent, which the Bryant campaign declared a vote of “no confidence.” And if one combines “the two Republican Bills,” the campaign said, it was really a case of 42 percent to 48 percent. Huh? For those who have already forgotten, the long list of gubernatorial wannabes in the primary included Bill Hirt, another Republican. The retired Boeing engineer, who didn’t campaign much and apparently spent nothing but his filing fee, got just under 4 percent, which was good enough to finish third. Spin Control knows of no formula that allows one candidate to add on the votes of another with a shared party and first name. If we started doing that, where would we stop? Would we have to give Inslee the votes of the two Democrats whose names start with J? A slippery slope indeed. The suggestion that a showing under 50 percent in the primary spells trouble in the general election does not hold up under scrutiny, either. In 2008, incumbent Chris Gregoire got 48.3 percent of the vote compared to Dino Rossi’s 46.4 percent; Gregoire won the general. That’s the only top-two primary with an incumbent governor, and that’s not much of a pattern. But there are patterns in gubernatorial primaries over the last 60 years. Here’s a list with general-election winners in upper case; incumbents, when they run, marked with an asterisk; and the total number of candidates in the primary. See if any patterns pop out: 2012: INSLEE 47 percent, Rob McKenna 43 percent (9 candidates) 2008: GREGOIRE* 48.3 percent, Rossi 46.4 percent (10 candidates) 2004: GREGOIRE 38.7 percent, Rossi 34.1 percent (11 candidates) 2000: GARY LOCKE* 54.3 percent, John Carlson 34.5 percent (5 candidates) 1996: LOCKE 23.7 percent, Ellen Craswell 15.3 percent (15 candidate race) 1992: MIKE LOWRY 29.2 percent, Ken Eikenberry 22.4 percent (11 candidate race) 1988: BOOTH GARDNER* 57.6 percent, Bob Williams 20.1 percent (8 candidates) 1984: GARDNER 46.1 percent, John Spellman* 26.2 percent (8 candidates) 1980: Jim McDermott 33 percent, SPELLMAN 16.7 percent (14 candidates) 1976: DIXY LEE RAY 24.1 percent, Spellman 21.8 percent (9 candidates) 1972: Al Rosellini 30.3 percent, DAN EVANS* 24.7 percent (9 candidates) 1968: EVANS* 43.4 percent, John O’Connell 26 percent (8 candidates) 1964: EVANS 39.1 percent, Rosellini* 29.4 percent (8 candidates) 1960: Lloyd Andrews 37.4 percent, ROSELLINI* 34.7 percent (5 candidates) 1956: ROSELLINI 31.6 percent, Emmett Anderson 25.8 percent (10 candidates) The first thing you might notice is Washington rarely lacks candidates who think they should be governor. Before 2008, the state had a blanket primary, so the top Democrat and the top Republican advanced to the general election, regardless of how big their percentage. Minor-party candidates could qualify for the general election, too, if they got enough votes. The clearest pattern is that with few exceptions, the candidate with the most votes in the primary won the general election. And if the state had the top-two primary in 1980, Spellman wouldn’t have gone to the general because he actually finished third overall in the primary. Ray, the incumbent Democratic governor, finished second to McDermott, who was then a state senator. So she was out, Spellman was in, and he beat McDermott in the general. Incumbents rarely had more than 50 percent, and that wasn’t usually fatal. So the “top 50 percent in the primary” standard for an incumbent isn’t a prerequisite for eventual victory. If it were hard and fast, Bryant’s fellow Republican Chris Vance might as well fold his tent in the U.S. Senate race, where incumbent Patty Murray is at 53 percent. Donors sometimes use it when deciding whether to pour money into a race. But they also look at other things, such as how close the challenger is to the incumbent, which may be why the Bryant campaign was trying to close the gap to “striking distance” with the two Republican Bills equation.

Kenya Airways: 'Pride of Africa' tries to stop a long fall Africa Sunday 7 August 2016 - 9:54am File: Kenya's 'Pride of Africa' slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the R3.5bn loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Photo: AFP PHOTO/Tony KARUMBA NAIROBI - When Kenya Airways published the country's worst-ever corporate results last month, the scale of the loss revealed the effects of several disastrous decisions that the national carrier is struggling to reverse. The airline's "Pride of Africa" slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the $259-million (R3.5-billion) loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu. "In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss," Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa's tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it "hedges" its fuel costs by entering into a fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. READ: Oil price drops as Iran declines output freeze Foreign currency "and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this," said Satchu about the airline's latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways' two biggest backers -- Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government -- the firm's share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company's debts exceed a billion dollars.  National pride at stake  Despite the gloom, analysts still see some cause for optimism in the numbers. Revenue was up five percent and operating losses shrank thanks to a series of shock treatments imposed on the airline by management last year. "The operational result is what I'll take from the latest results," said Eric Musau, analyst at Kenya's Standard Investment Bank. "KQ is on the right track, even if they could do a bit more in terms of assets sales," he told AFP, describing the net loss as largely down to exceptional factors. A number of structural changes are beginning to show fruit. Kenya Airways has sold or rented out planes that were sitting idle, reducing its fleet size by a third, and has rid itself of an expensive permanent landing slot at London's Heathrow airport, opting to rent one instead. What is at stake is more than just cash. "It is a matter of national and geopolitical interest for Kenya to have a national carrier. You can't be the economic leader of the East African region if you don't have a national carrier," emphasised Satchu. "I wonder whether Kenya's shoulders are broad enough to rescue KQ again and again. Kenya is not a country like UAE or Qatar," which underwrite world-class airlines such as Qatar Airways, he added. Kenya Airways' pilots have had a particularly fraught relationship with management, which at one point suggested they could be lent on occasion to rapidly growing Ethiopian Airlines. READ : Kenya cancels flights as pilots go on strike Protests and strikes followed and the idea was abandoned, but the firm still has to deal with a bloated workforce left over from the disastrous expansion plan. The fleet and those who fly it are in the sights of chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze. "The first thing that we are doing now is making sure that we get our business at the right size in order to grow responsibly, and that right size is both revenue and costs," he said. Ngunze announced in March the airline will cut 600 jobs out of its 4,000-strong workforce. AFP Comment Now! Discussion Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Author: John Noonan. John Noonan Security Date of Publication: 01.14.11. 01.14.11 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am In Nuclear Silos, Death Wears a Snuggie At a small United States Air Force installation in eastern Wyoming, I’m sitting at an electronic console, ready to unleash nuclear hell. In front of me is a strange amalgamation of ’60s-era flip switches and modern digital display screens. It’s the control console for launching an intercontinental ballistic missile or ICBM. On an archaic display screen in the center of the console, three large letters blink in rapid succession. “EAM inbound,” says my deputy commander and the second member of the launch crew. An emergency-action message is on its way, maybe from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, maybe from the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, maybe even from the president. We both mechanically pull down our code books, thick binders swollen with pages of alpha-numeric sequences, and swiftly decipher the message. After nearly four years of pulling ICBM-alert duty, this process is instinctive. I deliberately recite the encrypted characters to ensure my deputy is on the same page, literally and figuratively, as six short characters can effectively communicate a wealth of information through the use of special decoding binders. “Charlie, Echo, Seven, Quebec, Golf, Bravo, six characters ending in Bravo.” My partner concurs, scribbling in his code book. “Crowd pleaser,” he adds without emotion, referring to a war plan that mandates immediate release of our entire flight of nuclear missiles, 10 in all. Of course, this is just a training scenario. The coded orders are a simulation. The console is a mockup of the real thing, stowed away in a larger hanger and serviced seven days a week by a small staff of Boeing contractors. If this were a real event, I’d be buried in a steel cocoon 100 feet underground. I’d have shed my standard-issue flight suit and boots. Instead, I’d be wearing sweats, fleece-lined slippers and, naturally, my indispensable, royal blue Snuggie. America and her nuclear warriors have an odd relationship. For decades, missileers (as we’re known in the military) have quietly performed their duties, custodians of a dying breed of weapon. But American citizens have no real connection with the shadowy operators who stand the old posts of the Cold War, despite the fact that they spend up to $8 billion a year to maintain our country’s nuclear deterrent. The truth is the job is an awesome responsibility, but it’s deeply weird. Back in the air-conditioned simulator, my deputy and I carefully, but quickly, walk through a precisely choreographed preparation sequence. Unlock codes provided by the president allow us to enable the missiles for launch, a function similar to the safety switch of a gun. At this moment, the safety is off. Several times during the process, we verify that the orders are authentic and formatted properly, and that they originate from the appropriate command authorities. Both of us keep a sharp eye out for a “termination message,” a quick stand-down notification that would cancel our attack orders. None comes. We finish our sequence in less than a minute, leaving 30 seconds to spare before initiating our practice launch. It feels like an eternity. My deputy stares at his keyboard, while my eyes are locked on a large red clock above our heads. The clock is set to Greenwich Mean Time (“Zulu time” in missile parlance), and is checked against the Navy’s atomic clock twice a day for accuracy down to the millisecond. At 10 seconds out, we place our hands on a series of launch switches. Contrary to popular myth, there is no red button. Four launch switches means it takes four hands to launch — it’s one of many safety mechanisms built into the system as a means of preventing unauthorized execution of missiles by a lone individual. At five seconds out, I start my countdown, commanding a final “3, 2, 1 — execute.” We turn our keys, and watch as the control screen flashes with missile-launch notifications. Some fly immediately, some with a delay to prevent nuclear fratricide when the bombs approach their targets in 20 to 30 minutes. The Ultimate Enemy: Boredom In four years on nuclear-alert duty, I ran through an infinite number of attack sequences and fought countless virtual nuclear wars. I knew how to target my missiles within minutes and launch them within seconds. The process was rigorous, thorough and fully governed by a checklist that was, to our knowledge, without defect. The room for human error was minimal. But that training was about as exciting as the job got, a blessing considering the mission. Being a missileer means that your worst enemy is boredom. No battlefield heroism, no medals to be won. The duty is seen today as a dull anachronism. Old hats, the squadron commanders who pulled nuclear alert during the sunset of the Cold War, spin tales of the good old days over sweaty mugs of beer at base officer clubs. The harsh mediocrity of missile duty is demanding enough to extract an emotional and physical toll, but cushy enough that missileers are too ashamed to acknowledge any misery. Missileers get warm sheets and hot food; Marines sleep in the mud. For the missileers of the 9/11 generation, relevancy — a dwindling commodity in a dwindling community — is a vicarious experience. During the Cold War, they had real-time intelligence briefings, screaming klaxons and a force three times larger than the current inventory. Today there’s Facebook and PowerPoint. The missile field is attached to Wyoming’s FE Warren Air Force Base, one of three such fields nationwide. It’s approximately the size of Rhode Island. When the deep silos for the ICBMs and underground alert facilities were dug in the 1960s, military planners spaced each site several miles apart as a survivability feature. The distance ensured a perverse tit-for-tat approach to nuclear game theory, born of the outdated mutually assured destruction epoch but sophisticated enough in its simplicity. An attack would require one nuke to kill one nuke. It meant a two-hour drive from base to the alert facility, a winding journey through America’s high plains. During a typical four-year tour, missileers spend more than a year separated from their families and work an average of 25 days a month on alert or in training. In the good old days, the oncoming alert force would show up at 0800 for a five-minute pre-deployment briefing. Thanks to Microsoft’s growing influence in the U.S. military, that five-minute weather and maintenance brief has ballooned into an hour-long PowerPoint extravaganza. “Alerts” are something of a misnomer, another cultural handle better suited the Cold War. Two officers seal themselves behind a 4-ton blast door, in a small capsule similar in size to an 18-wheeler’s freight rig, for a 24-hour period. Remaining alert is the real challenge. I’ve spent long, quiet hours with lights dimmed — reading, monitoring the status of the missiles, watching DVDs (Lost and Entourage were favorites), and fighting a growing sense of boredom, containment and isolation. My First Nuclear “Strike” One way to fend off those symptoms is humor. Early in my tour, I was startled out of the rack by a playful commander who had triggered the fire alarm, cut the lights and figured out how to make the capsule sway back and forth on the heavy chains that anchored it to the ceiling. My training told me that these conditions were indications of a nuclear strike. To my colleague’s eternal amusement, I sprinted around the capsule in a pair of polka-dotted boxer shorts trying to simultaneously restore command over the system and nurse the banged head that happened when I was jolted from a pleasant sleep. Though tedious, missile duty is not without perks. The uniform regulations are relaxed, though not by design. Once the blast door thuds shut and a crew is free from the prying eyes of the public or enlisted personnel topside, out come the pajamas and hooded sweatshirts. In a favorite missileer uniform patch (right), the Grim Reaper sits at an ICBM console, dressed in bunny slippers. In the real world, death wears a campus T-shirt, JCrew bottoms and the ubiquitous Snuggie. The silly blanket-robe hybrid is suited to the missile force, keeping an officer toasty while allowing him to interact with the weapons console unobstructed. Missileers learn that on alert, comfort is as important as humor. One enterprising fellow liked to string a hammock between the two command chairs and stretch out for his long shifts at the console. Videogame systems are forbidden, a rule that was mocked until it got out that wireless Nintendo Wii controllers could cause the system to detect a false electromagnetic pulse attack and shut down. I used to imagine that I’d have some sort of stiff-upper-lip moment should I receive “the order,” where I’d shed the Snuggie and slippers, zip up my flight suit, and make imperial references about “going out proper.” Though the USSR is gone, the assignment still has a kamikaze feel to it, left over from the Cold War, when a launch meant instant Soviet counter-battery fire. You resign yourself to the fact that you sit 100 feet underground while bombs that crater down to 200 feet are headed in your direction. It doesn’t make for much peace of mind. Isolation often gives way to reflection, and missile duty brings out strange conundrums. Missile training fosters an unquestioning, automation mentality. I was trained to be a cog in the machine: Orders were orders, and a lawful command from the president was not subject to debate or dissonance. Every missileer is carefully screened for mental aptitude and stability, yet they’re evaluated for their readiness to unleash hell. Though I never doubted that I would execute a launch order without question, other misgivings occasionally surfaced. We arrested a group of Catholic nuns staging a peaceful protest on one of our launch facilities a few years back. For a missileer who is a practicing Catholic, such a situation brings up questions: If women who have committed themselves to the Word of God feel so strongly about the immorality of nuclear weapons that they’re willing to be confined for their convictions, what kind of Christian am I to sit at the launch switch? How do you resolve a conflict between duty to your God and duty to your country? Who wins, faith or flag? That a capacity for great violence sustains great peace is one of the genuine paradoxes of our time, and I wrestled with that from time to time. The human factor is the system’s greatest vulnerability, something I unwittingly contributed to whenever I engaged in high-minded navel gazing. But these philosophical battles were not ours to fight — even in the quiet solitude of an archaic outpost, fighting yesterday’s war. John Noonan is a policy advisor and defense writer.

The airline’s “Pride of Africa” slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the 26.22-billion-shilling ($259-million) loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu. “In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss,” Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa’s tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it “hedges” its fuel costs by entering into a fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. Foreign currency “and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this,” said Satchu about the airline’s latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways’ two biggest backers — Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government — the firm’s share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company’s debts exceed a billion dollars. – National pride at stake – Despite the gloom, analysts still see some cause for optimism in the numbers. Revenue was up five percent and operating losses shrank thanks to a series of shock treatments imposed on the airline by management last year. “The operational result is what I’ll take from the latest results,” said Eric Musau, analyst at Kenya’s Standard Investment Bank. “KQ is on the right track, even if they could do a bit more in terms of assets sales,” he told AFP, describing the net loss as largely down to exceptional factors. A number of structural changes are beginning to show fruit. Kenya Airways has sold or rented out planes that were sitting idle, reducing its fleet size by a third, and has rid itself of an expensive permanent landing slot at London’s Heathrow airport, opting to rent one instead. What is at stake is more than just cash. “It is a matter of national and geopolitical interest for Kenya to have a national carrier. You can’t be the economic leader of the East African region if you don’t have a national carrier,” emphasised Satchu. “I wonder whether Kenya’s shoulders are broad enough to rescue KQ again and again. Kenya is not a country like UAE or Qatar,” which underwrite world-class airlines such as Qatar Airways, he added. Kenya Airways’ pilots have had a particularly fraught relationship with management, which at one point suggested they could be lent on occasion to rapidly growing Ethiopian Airlines. Protests and strikes followed and the idea was abandoned, but the firm still has to deal with a bloated workforce left over from the disastrous expansion plan. The fleet and those who fly it are in the sights of chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze. “The first thing that we are doing now is making sure that we get our business at the right size in order to grow responsibly, and that right size is both revenue and costs,” he said. Ngunze announced in March the airline will cut 600 jobs out of its 4,000-strong workforce. -AFP dikeledi RELATED ARTICLES Africa Kenyatta and UN work for ‘people power’ Africa ‘Bye-Bye Kabila’ campaign launched in DR Congo Africa HIV-positive Malawi man jailed for two years over sex ritual NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Steve Moss (R-Cherokee) 1 of 2 i By Cassie Cope ccope@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story State Rep. Steve Moss, R-Cherokee, has come under criticism for a newly paved road that leads to his home. Cherokee County approved spending $51,714 to pave the road with money from the county’s transportation committee, according to acting county administrator Holland Belue. Moss said he went through the normal county process to get a road paved and “asked for no special favors.” “I made sure that I went by the book,” said Moss, adding he spent his own money to get the road up to standards for it to qualify for the county to take it over. The county took responsibility for the road in 2014, according to The Gaffney Ledger, an Upstate newspaper. Currently, three taxpayers own property along the road, Moss said. However, paving the road opens up the area for future development, he added. Moss said he will disclose the road paving on his state-required Statement of Economic Interest, where legislators disclose any gifts they receive and “any public improvements of more than $200.00 on or adjacent to (their) real property.” The money to pay for the road-paving project came from the Cherokee County transportation committee. Most county transportation committees are appointed by legislative delegations. But Cherokee County’s County Council also is that county’s transportation committee. Typically, county transportation committees get money from the state’s 16.75-cent-a-gallon gas tax, collecting 2.66 cents from every gallon sold. However, in the state’s 2015-16 budget, lawmakers approved sending $216 million in state money to county transportation committees to repair roads. In the 2016-17 budget that took effect July 1, those committees received an extra $50 million in state money. As a legislator, Moss votes on state spending – including sending state money to county transportation committees. But, Moss added, he is not a member of the House panel that writes the state budget. Moss is not the first legislator to be scrutinized in connection with state road spending. In 2015, the S.C. Transportation Infrastructure Bank, whose members include Senate President Pro Tempore Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, agreed to spend $340 million in state money to help pay for Florence County road projects. “We have a really chaotic system in South Carolina of jurisdiction over roads, and who’s responsible for building them and maintaining them,” said government watchdog John Crangle. It would be better if the state had one entity in charge of determining how road money is spent, Crangle said. “This has been the problem for a long time – the political determination of how road money is spent.” Dems take swipe at Mulvaney U.S. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-Indian Land, predictably took heat from S.C. Democratic Coordinated Campaign last week. Campaign co-chair James Smith, a state representative from Richland County, criticized Mulvaney for, among other things, his votes in favor of “turning Social Security over to Wall Street” and against the Export-Import Bank, which finances and guarantees loans by foreign companies to buy U.S. goods, including made-in-North-Charleston Boeing jets. Fiscal hawks, including Mulvaney, contend the Ex-Im Bank is just another example of the government deciding economic winners and losers, adding big businesses like Boeing can afford to buy loan insurance in the private sector. “These may be Mick Mulvaney’s ‘principles,’ but to voters of the 5th District, they are nothing but a harmful extremist ideology,” Smith said, noting Boeing is a major S.C. employer. Of course, the Democratic state representative is backing Mulvaney’s Nov. 8 Democratic challenger, former Biden aide Fran Person. Buzz bites ▪  Columbia Attorney Butch Bowers is representing N.C.

Both, as critics have noted, were slaveholders. Citing Jackson’s treatment of Native Americans, activists also have pressed Democratic parties in other states to drop his name from their annual fundraising dinners.

An investigation team led by the General Civil Aviation Authority with support from the 777 aircraft manufacturer Boeing and engine maker Rolls Royce began to examine the evidence hours after the accident on Wednesday. Ian Holder, principal consultant at the UK-based aviation safety consultancy Baines Simmons, said the investigation into the crash at Dubai International Airport could take between six months and a year to complete. "The main aim of an air accident investigator is to find what and why the incident happened so that we can learn from it and prevent similar things happening in future," he said. "It is not to proportion blame." The investigation process begins with securing the site so that it was safe enough for the team to conduct their work. "On this occasion the incident took place on a runway so it is already a secured area," said Mr Holder. "It would be much more difficult to secure a location if the accident happened in a remote area or the sea, as evidence can quickly disappear." Ideally, on-site work should be completed as soon as possible because there is a danger of contanimation as more people come into contact with it. "The site has already seen firefighters go onto the scene as well as others, so the sooner investigators can make their measurements and collect data, the better," he said. It was vital to retrieve the black box and cockpit voice recorder to help build a picture of what happened onboard. Investigators also take evidence of the placement of flaps and flight surfaces. "Collection of physical evidence as well as eye-witness accounts in this period is very important because this type of data will become degraded," he said. "People’s perception of what happened can change quickly." Once key information has been collected, the aircraft is moved to a secure location where the data will be analysed in greater detail. "This means interviews with the pilots, air-traffic controllers, maintenance crews, aircraft manufacturers and the airline, among others, to develop a set of hypotheses, which will then be tested," said Mr Holder. "Aircraft are highly complex machines and so to have the manufacturer on-site can help to provide clarification for investigators in that regard." After all the evidence is gathered, it must be cross-referenced with what witnesses say and physical data, which is "very time-consuming", Mr Holder said. It is important for investigators to corroborate evidence because it is not uncommon for people to have differing accounts. "The idea is not to jump to a conclusion, but instead develop a set of hypotheses and keep challenging them," he said. If there is not enough evidence, the aircraft might be reconstructed to help show where the failures were, though this is more common for an accident that happened in the air rather than one the ground, Mr Holder said. "Investigators follow a structure and they evaluate the facts and from that they get findings and draw conclusions. It is never one thing that would have caused an accident, but rather a series of variables that happened together to create the circumstances for the crash," he said. Aviation is an "extremely safe mode of transport", Mr Holder said. "If you’re someone who flies once a year then that is the safest journey you will have. The reason for that is we have learnt over the years how to put systems in place to reduce the risk of accidents. "For an aircraft accident to occur, a series of complex variables will have happened." Emirates flight EK521 from Thiruvananthapuram, India, crash-landed at Dubai International Airport on Wednesday. All 300 passengers and crew on board were safely removed from the plane, but a firefighter, Emirati Jassim Al Baloushi, died from injuries sustained during the emergency response. nhanif@thenational.ae Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Investigation into Emirates crash landing ‘could take up to three years’ Investigation into Emirates plane crash reveals pilot tried to abort landing Passengers aboard Dubai flight that crash-landed to receive compensation How smartphone cameras turn our lives into fantasies More Transport Sharjah motorists welcome opening of five new petrol stations UAE companies turning to technology to keep track of drivers and improve road safety Dh2.1 billion Abu Dhabi-Dubai motorway to open by year’s end Emirati girl who fell from second floor at school faces long road to recovery MOST VIEWED Uae | All Man arrested after Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank chief found dead in Egypt home Emirates A380 blossoms at Dubai Miracle Garden – video Dh2.1 billion Abu Dhabi-Dubai motorway to open by year’s end Sharjah motorists welcome opening of five new petrol stations Man who posted photo of Dubai policeman on Instagram is jailed for two years UAE weather: heavy rain forecast in western region, Fujairah and RAK RAK provides three months of fully paid maternity leave Abu Dhabi’s hotels at 92 per cent capacity ahead of grand prix High tribute to UAE’s heroes Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed on official visit to Algeria - in pictures More Most Viewed Man arrested after Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank chief found dead in Egypt home Al fresco cinema Vox Outdoor now open for business in Dubai Emirates A380 blossoms at Dubai Miracle Garden – video Dh2.1 billion Abu Dhabi-Dubai motorway to open by year’s end Exclusive: Scout, settle, success, sell – how the Benfica model is flourishing Sheikh Mohammed’s photo speaks volumes RAK opens unique Via Ferrata on Jebel Jais, the UAE’s highest mountain High tribute to UAE’s heroes Sharjah motorists welcome opening of five new petrol stations Man who posted photo of Dubai policeman on Instagram is jailed for two years More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank chief in Egypt found dead in apartment Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed on official visit to Algeria - in pictures Abu Dhabi Civil Defence teams carry out emergency drill in Sheikh Zayed tunnel Mohammed bin Rashid launches UAE University Science and Innovation Park FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Dubai International Film Festival announces 2016 line-up Abu Dhabi Airports all geared up for F1 fans deluge About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

The route, served by a Boeing 777-300ER, is the airline’s 155th across 82 countries and territories, and represents its fifth new destination to east Asia this year. In March, Emirates started a circular service from Dubai to Cebu and Clark in the Philippines, and Yinchuan and Zhengzhou in mainland China were added in May. The Yangon service continues on to Hanoi in Vietnam after a 90-minute stop in Myanmar’s biggest city and commercial centre. Those not disembarking in Yangon can carry on to Vietnam’s capital; the airline already operates a direct daily service to Ho Chi Minh City. Previously, most travellers to Myanmar have flown via Bangkok. Badr Abbas, the senior vice president for Far East commercial operations at Emirates, said both Yangon and Hanoi were "on a list of must-see places, especially for UAE nationals". Following a strong increase in tourist arrivals in Myanmar over the past year from around the world, Emirates’ strategy is both to capture and create demand, locally and globally. "We felt it was important to enter at this time. Emirates wants to play a major role in the growth and success of Myanmar," Mr Abbas said. Myanmar’s military government only recently opened up the country to tourism, and although some western sanctions are still in place, a boycott of tourism to the country ended in about 2010 when Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, was released from house arrest. Mr Abbas said Dubai tourist arrivals from the Far East were increasing, even with the current strength of the dollar, and that Myanmar is a "dynamic emerging market". The country has a population of 55 million, with 7 million living in the former capital Yangon. In terms of tourism, Myanmar’s appeal includes ancient temple sites, modern and traditional restaurants, ecotourism and a long stretch of unspoilt, remote islands and beaches on the Andaman Sea south of Yangon. In the north, new areas previously restricted to tourism are opening up. While there is currently no Myanmar embassy in the UAE, most visitors, whether travelling on business or holi­day, can apply online for an e-visa. Flights to Yangon and Hanoi depart daily from Dubai at 03.30, arriving at Yangon International Airport at 11.40 and Hanoi’s Noi Ba International Airport at 15.30. rbehan@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter​​ Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Executive travel: Night shift with Emirates to Yangon Boeing 777X set to become world’s first flying iPad Boeing freezes jet prices for first time in seven years as sales slow Emirates increases daily flights from Dubai to Doha to nine More Aviation Fiji Airways to add to fleet with five new Boeing jets Libyan airline plans to double fleet with Airbus jetliners Is it a bird?

A source from Air Algerie told RIA Novosti that the aircraft returned to Algeria due to a technical glitch. Flight radar shows the plane turning back on itself and cruising over the Mediterranean towards Mahon. Sources at Ennahar TV said the aircraft had already landed in Algiers due to technical damage. The passenger aeroplane flying from Algiers to Marseille had declared a mid-air emergency and then disappeared off air traffic control radar, according to reports. The Boeing 737 took off on Saturday 6 August from Algiers in the afternoon, heading to Marseille when the plane made an emergency call soon after take-off. "Flight AH1020 is currently not tracked by Flightradar24. It's either out of coverage or has already landed," reports Flightradar24, an internet tracking website that shows real-time aircraft flight information. Flight radar showed the aircraft turn around and head back towards the point where it took-off. However, before arriving, the plane disappeared from radar, according to the Mirror. The last recorded altitude of the plane was some 7,000m, according to Flightradar 24. The plane's status was listed as "unknown" by the plane tracking website, before tweeting: "We believe Air Algérie AH1020 to be a *coverage issue* NOT a missing aircraft. Our ADS-B coverage in Algeria is limited." Flightradar 24 records show the missing Boeing 737-6D6 was 14 years old. The plane had 123 passenger seats. The number of people on board is not known.

By: AFP | London | Published:August 8, 2016 2:58 am Airbus Group is under investigation.  Britain’s Serious Fraud Office has said on it had opened a criminal probe into Airbus Group, investigating allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption. “These allegations relate to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the SFO said in a statement on Sunday. The authority said it opened the investigation in July and asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. A spokesperson for the SFO said additional details of the probe would not be made public until charges were brought or the investigation is dropped. European planemaker Airbus said it was aware of the probe and the aviation firm was working with investigators. “Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants,” the company said in a statement. “Airbus Group continues to cooperate with the SFO,” the statement concluded. The company was informed on Friday that the authority had launched an investigation, an Airbus spokesman told AFP.”We ourselves detected this issue and self-disclosed it to the authorities. “This is as an effort of our enhanced anti-corruption (policy). Management has taken robust action and is determined to resolve this issue in cooperation with the authorities,” spokesman Jeremy Greaves said. Airbus informed authorities of the irregularities in April. The same month the UK Export Finance decided to suspend export credits to the firm, a move followed by France and Germany. The aviation firm said at the time it hoped to resolve the financing problem as soon as possible. The current SFO investigation is expected to take years. The probe was described by the Financial Times newspaper as a “severe blow to the European aircraft maker” which would be exploited by its US rival Boeing.

Profits were up 1.76 billion euros (USD 1.94 billion), but the gain was due to exceptional items that masked a slide in operating earnings. The company was hit by charges of just over 1 billion euros related to its troubled A400M military cargo transporter programme, while adverse currency movements and charges on its widebody A350 aircraft totaled nearly 900 million. However these were compensated for by the sale of shares in Dassault Aviation and the creation of a rocket launcher joint venture with Safran that generated a net gain of nearly 1.9 billion euros.

BEIRUT: Iran intends to purchase 20 Regional Jets from Japan's Mitsubishi Corp, according to Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy minister for international affairs at the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development. The Mehr News agency quoted Fakhrieh Kashan on Sunday as saying that the deal was likely to be finalised when a Japanese delegation visits Tehran in December. The aircraft will be acquired through a lease-purchase contract and will be used by Aseman Airlines on domestic routes, Fakhrieh Khashan said. The lifting of long-standing economic sanctions against Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities has allowed it to strike provisional deals worth around $50 billion with Boeing and Airbus to buy some 200 airliners to renew its ageing fleet. However, financial and political obstacles have continued to dog the deals, and Iran has made clear it is widening its search to include other suppliers. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet, Japan's first commercial airplane in half a century, will seat just under 100 people and is being developed by Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp.

Credit Greg Kahn for The New York Times How Think Tanks Amplify Corporate America’s Influence Think tanks are seen as independent, but their scholars often push donors’ agendas, amplifying a culture of corporate influence in Washington. By ERIC LIPTON and BROOKE WILLIAMSAUG. 7, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — As Lennar Corporation, one of the nation’s largest home builders, pushed ahead with an $8 billion plan to revitalize a barren swath of San Francisco, it found a trusted voice to vouch for its work: the Brookings Institution, the most prestigious think tank in the world. “This can become a productive, mutually beneficial relationship,” Bruce Katz, a Brookings vice president, wrote to Lennar in July 2010. The ultimate benefit for Brookings: $400,000 in donations from Lennar’s different divisions. The think tank began to aggressively promote the project, San Francisco’s biggest redevelopment effort since its recovery from the 1906 earthquake, and later offered to help Lennar, a publicly traded company, “engage with national media to develop stories that highlight Lennar’s innovative approach.” And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow — an enviable credential he used to advance the company’s efforts. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “He would be a trusted adviser,” an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar. Photo Kofi Bonner, then a regional vice president for Lennar Corporation, at Hunters Point in San Francisco in 2008. The Brookings Institution named him a senior fellow in 2014. Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Think tanks, which position themselves as “universities without students,” have power in government policy debates because they are seen as researchers independent of moneyed interests. But in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors — like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; K.K.R., the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate — show that financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide “donation benefits,” including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. Video ‘This Is Thinly Disguised Lobbying’ Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, explains how some think tanks engage in “thinly disguised lobbying” to influence lawmakers. By A.J. CHAVAR and ERIC LIPTON on Publish Date August 7, 2016. . Watch in Times Video » embed “This is about giant corporations who figured out that by spending, hey, a few tens of millions of dollars, if they can influence outcomes here in Washington, they can make billions of dollars,” said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, a frequent critic of undisclosed Wall Street donations to think tanks. Washington has seen a proliferation of think tanks, particularly small institutions with narrow interests tied to specific industries. At the same time, the brand names of the field have experienced explosive growth. Brookings’s annual budget has doubled in the last decade, to $100 million. The American Enterprise Institute is spending at least $80 million on a new headquarters in Washington, not far from where the Center for Strategic and International Studies built a $100 million office tower. The shift has occurred as nonprofits in general have been under increasing pressure from their donors to meet specific goals. But for think tanks, that pressure can threaten their standing as independent arbiters in policy debates in Congress, the White House and the news media. “Wouldn’t it be nice to go back to the greatest generation, in the post-World War II era of philanthropy, where they said, gosh, ‘Here is $1 million; spend it how you wish,’” Kimberly Churches, the managing director at Brookings, said in an interview. Think tank executives reject any suggestion that they are tools of corporate influence campaigns and say they are simply teaming up with donors that have similar goals, like helping cities with economic development. “We do not compromise our integrity,” said Martin S. Indyk, Brookings’s executive vice president. “We maintain our core values of quality, independence, as well as impact.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story But he acknowledged that the arrangement to appoint the Lennar executive as a senior fellow had created the “appearance of a conflict of interest.” And he said that Brookings, in the interest of transparency, had recently decided to prohibit corporations or corporate-backed foundations from making anonymous contributions. At think tanks like Brookings, the majority of reports and events, with titles like “Five Evils: Multidimensional Poverty and Race in America” or “India at the Global High Table,” have no obvious link to corporate donors. Still, the benefits afforded to corporations looking to cloak themselves with the authority of think tanks are strikingly evident, according to a review of documents from more than a dozen institutions. When think tank scholars testify before Congress or speak at other public events, the public is often not aware of the financial relationships between these scholars and for-profit companies. The New England Center for Investigative Reporting and The New York Times looked at some of these conflicts. Video by The Eye, from NECIR The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports. Donors have outlined how the resulting scholarship will be used as part of broader lobbying efforts. The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase, whose $15.5 million contribution is the largest by a private corporation in the institution’s history. Despite these benefits, corporations can write off the donations as charitable contributions. Some tax experts say these arrangements may amount to improper subsidies by taxpayers if think tanks are providing specific services. “People think of think tanks as do-gooders, uncompromised and not bought like others in the political class,” said Bill Goodfellow, the executive director of the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. “But it’s absurd to suggest that donors don’t have influence. The danger is we in the think tank world are being corrupted in the same way as the political world. And all of us should be worried about it.” A group of Democratic state attorneys general is investigating whether Exxon Mobil worked with certain think tanks in past decades to cover up its understanding of fossil fuels’ impact on climate change, in part by financing reports questioning the science, a suggestion the company rejects. OPEN Document Document: Brookings Institution and Its Corporate Donors Executives at Brookings, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and other think tanks say they have systems in place to ensure that their reports are based on scholars’ independent conclusions. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We strongly believe in our model of seeking solutions to some of our country’s most difficult problems,” John J. Hamre, the chief executive at C.S.I.S., said in a written reply to questions. “We gather stakeholders, vet ideas, find areas of agreement and highlight areas of disagreement.” Yet researchers at think tanks are seeing corporate influence firsthand. Rachel Stohl, a senior associate at the Stimson Center in Washington, said she had been quizzed by potential donors as she tried to raise money for research on the military’s use of armed drones. “‘Are you going to say drones are bad?’” she recalled one potential financial backer asking. “‘We are not interested in funding something that says drones are bad.’” Donations and Rewards The confidential Brookings spreadsheet had an unassuming title: Corporate Overviews Tracking. It listed nearly 90 corporations, from Alcoa to Wells Fargo, providing a glimpse of the vast electronic file that Brookings maintained on donors and prospects, and the benefits it might offer. The database, along with thousands of pages of emails, solicitations for money and memos on meetings with corporate officials, highlighted Brookings’s practice of assuring that donors would see results from their contributions. Photo The Brookings Institution, which operates on a $100 million annual budget, twice what it was a decade ago. Credit Greg Kahn for The New York Times The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs — both critical parts of its business — and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries. In 2004, Brookings established its Metropolitan Policy Program, devised to stimulate economic growth in cities. As the country was emerging from recession, Brookings bolstered its ties to corporate donors in 2010 by naming Marek Gootman, a lobbyist from Patton Boggs, as its first director of strategic partnerships. He was assigned to work with “a national network of elected, business and civic leaders engaged in city and metropolitan area policy development and implementation.” From the start, the program blended a variety of insights on urban matters, including from corporate, nonprofit and government sources. And Mr. Indyk noted that any reports issued were made public. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Donations to the program exploded, from $4.3 million in 2005 to $12.5 million in 2013, nearly 20 percent of Brookings’s overall program spending that year. K.K.R., after starting special funds around 2010 to invest in real estate and other infrastructure projects, donated $450,000 to Brookings, some of it as the institution agreed to set up meetings for a top K.K.R. executive with community leaders in Philadelphia and Detroit, where the company was considering real estate projects. Brookings separately produced a report, published on K.K.R.’s website, promoting one of the company’s infrastructure projects in New Jersey, after the company executive suggested such a piece. In advance of a 2014 event Brookings officials attended with corporate executives including Henry R. Kravis, a co-chairman of K.K.R., one memo marked as confidential noted: “K.K.R. has given a total of $350K to Brookings. Last gift came in on 3/27/2014 for $150K to Metro; Henry has donated $75K to Brookings, most going to the individual unrestricted fund.” The tally demonstrates the important distinction that Brookings makes between “unrestricted” donations, which the think tank can spend on any research, and project-based funding restricted to specific topics that the donor has a particular interest in. Photo Marek Gootman, center, with Gina Luna, a JPMorgan Chase executive, in April. Formerly a lobbyist at Patton Boggs, Mr. Gootman was appointed in 2010 as Brookings’s first director of strategic partnerships. Credit Erin Hull for The New York Times Lennar joined Brookings’s Metropolitan Leadership Council, established for the program’s top donors, in July 2010. That month, the company won approval to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco, turning the area into a more than 700-acre mix of housing, education and commercial development. Brookings would later name the project one of the three most “transformative investments in the United States.” The San Francisco project generated controversy from the beginning, with critics concerned about toxic waste left by the former Navy shipyard. Lennar joined with Brookings as protests were escalating in 2010. One complaint, filed by area residents with the Environmental Protection Agency, said the San Francisco Health Department was “conspiring with Lennar Corporation to conceal the health threats of asbestos-laden dust.” The company was busy at the time looking for investors to help it complete the project, known as the San Francisco Shipyard. Advertisement Continue reading the main story A spokesman for Lennar, Glenn Bunting, disputed claims that the company had donated to Brookings out of self-interest — and said the alliance was not related to the protests. “There was nothing needed in the way of assistance for Lennar to ‘buy’ from Brookings,” Mr. Bunting said in an email. Brookings, though, continued to promote the project. “San Francisco’s Shipyard project is both physically and economically transformative for the Bay Area and globally significant,” Mr. Katz, the Brookings vice president, said in a news release issued by San Francisco’s mayor in 2011 as Lennar’s hunt for major investors intensified. “This project promises to set a new paradigm for successfully conceiving, financing and delivering transformative infrastructure projects in the United States.” Follow-up memos were more explicit: Brookings, as it sought an additional $50,000 from Lennar in 2014, said it was prepared to “use our convening power, research expertise, network connections and knowledge of innovative practices to help further drive the ultimate impact and success” of Lennar’s project and to “provide public validation of San Francisco’s efforts through national and local media coverage.” The think tank soon delivered. Photo In a July 2014 document, Brookings sought more money from Lennar while offering to help with its San Francisco project. Mr. Katz made appearances alongside Mr. Bonner, the Lennar executive, to promote the project to government officials and business leaders in California. In 2014, around the time the think tank sought an additional round of money from Lennar, Brookings invited its new nonresident senior fellow, Mr. Bonner, who has a master’s degree in architecture and is a former government planner for several California cities, to appear at an event at its headquarters. “I am working in San Francisco in a fabulous property,” Mr. Bonner said at the event, referring to Lennar’s Shipyard project. In March, at a conference of real estate developers and investors in Cannes, France, Lennar sponsored a session in which Brookings researchers helped the company highlight the Shipyard. “Kofi is what I would describe as the quintessential city builder,” Julie Wagner, a Brookings nonresident senior fellow, said as she introduced Mr. Bonner at an event where projects with no connection to donors were also featured. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At least some of the $400,000 Lennar has donated to Brookings since 2010 has come from its SunStreet Energy division, which sells rooftop solar systems, at the same time that Brookings’s metropolitan program has published research on the rooftop solar industry. Mr. Indyk said the collaboration simply reflected shared goals of revitalizing cities. Brookings scholars promoted other real estate projects, he said, involving local governments, universities or even developers that were not donors — including one in Detroit backed by Dan Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, and one in Seattle backed by Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. But Mr. Indyk acknowledged that naming Mr. Bonner, who declined to be interviewed, a Brookings nonresident scholar had “created the impression that because Lennar was giving money, he was getting the title.” His post, which was unpaid, was not renewed. Photo Martin S. Indyk, the Brookings Institution’s executive vice president, said the think tank’s collaboration with Lennar to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco reflected a shared goal to revitalize cities. “We do not compromise our integrity,” he said. Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times Hitachi has been another large donor to the metropolitan program, giving a total of $1.8 million to Brookings over the last decade, according to Brookings documents. The think tank reviewed the company’s corporate marketing and sales strategy targeting the United States, an internal memo shows. Brookings also organized public events that featured top Obama administration officials and allowed Hitachi executives to promote their products. “Metro has held nine meetings and several conference calls in the past six months with executives from Hitachi’s water, transportation and data business lines and are collaborating more fully on defining what it means to be a ‘Smart City,’” a confidential Brookings memo said. Officials at Brookings said they had not lobbied for Hitachi, and they provided examples of reports that they said included conclusions challenging the company’s position. “Helping a corporation’s for-profit agenda is not in any way our agenda,” Ms. Churches, the managing director, said. Yet Ms. Churches also said the contract language with donors like Lennar and Hitachi was “inelegant,” although not improper. When asked if the documents read like a fee-for-service agreement, she said, “It could be misconstrued.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Indyk said Brookings had recently changed its policies so that “today, there is no way in which those words would be used in our documents.” ‘Growing the Economy’ When JPMorgan offered a major donation to the metropolitan program in 2011, Brookings created the Global Cities Initiative, complete with a new logo that called it a “joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase.” The project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times In contract documents, Brookings emphasized that it would control the conclusions of its reports and said it would “not directly or indirectly communicate with any party” to help get JPMorgan business. Mr. Indyk and executives from JPMorgan said the company and the think tank simply agreed on a worthy agenda. “This was about growing the economy, and we are incredibly proud of the results of this initiative,” said Peter Scher, the head of the corporate responsibility program at JPMorgan. “We believe it’s had a huge impact in more than 30 cities that are involved.” At the same time, hundreds of pages of memos — status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money — make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities. “Bottom line: Growing metro economies is good for the nation and for JPMC; also, many U.S. cities are JPMC clients — motivation to support them and their clients,” said one Brookings document dated July 2011, as officials from the think tank met with top bank executives to discuss a planned donation that eventually totaled $15 million. The Global Cities Initiative, another document written by a Brookings senior fellow explained, “must mean a marriage between JPMC corporate interests” and “Brookings continued thought leadership.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story JPMorgan, in a document dated a month before the agreement was signed, said the pending donation to Brookings “deepens/extends relationships with important client base among business and civic leaders both in the U.S. and abroad.” And Brookings was ready to do its part. “Our events, which in part target these audiences,” said an internal 2014 Brookings memo, referring to the Global Cities Initiative and federal and state leaders, “have yielded 100+ media hits, with 97% of them referencing GCI and 90% referencing JPMorgan; by the end of this year, we will have held events in 13 domestic markets and 9 international markets.” At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank. Photo One of hundreds of documents detailing confidential discussions between Brookings and JPMorgan in 2011 as the parties were negotiating a $10 million gift for the Global Cities Initiative. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank’s executives. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” It remains difficult to assess whether the relationship helped the bank’s business, but Mr. Scher said that was not the goal. “If the Global Cities Initiative strengthens the economic competitiveness of cities, it’s a win for small businesses, job creation and everyone involved in these communities, including us,” Mr. Scher said in a statement. Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line. But two lawyers who specialize in nonprofit law — Miranda Perry Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, and Clifford Perlman, a partner at a New York-based firm — said Brookings’s agreements raised questions. “Tax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,” Ms. Fleischer said. “And the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Indyk said that opinion was “totally unfounded,” noting that Brookings had retained its own lawyers to review the documents and found no problems. “Brookings’s conclusion that all of these activities it engaged in with these donors primarily benefited the public rather than the donors is consistent with the applicable federal tax standards,” Douglas Varley, one of the lawyers for Brookings, said in a statement. Close Partnerships Other think tanks have been even more closely aligned with corporate agendas. FedEx teamed up with the Atlantic Council — a think tank that focuses on international relations, with annual revenue that has surged to $21 million from $2 million in the last decade — to build support for a free-trade agreement the company hoped would increase business. OPEN Document Document: Atlantic Council and Corporate Donors Six months before the Atlantic Council report was issued, FedEx and the think tank worked on plans to use the report as a lobbying tool. “The impact and reach of the report would be maximized by a rollout event” including a “public report launch with member(s) of Congress from one of the relevant committees,” said a two-page summary drafted by the Atlantic Council months before the study was completed. FedEx and the Atlantic Council, working with the European American Chamber of Commerce, also told companies being asked to participate in the study that the goal was to “emphasize the positive impact that a comprehensive agreement would have on American and European small businesses.” When the report came out in late 2014, its conclusions mirrored arguments FedEx had been aggressively pushing on Capitol Hill, including recommending a reduction in trans-Atlantic tariffs and allowing more duty-free shipments. An executive vice president at FedEx, Rajesh Subramaniam, attended an event at Atlantic Council headquarters in Washington to celebrate the release of the final report. So did a key supporter, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “This is very exciting,” Mr. Subramaniam said at the event, referring to the potential for more trade. “The upside opportunity is quite large.” Frederick Kempe, the Atlantic Council president, said that FedEx had donated just $20,000 to help fund the effort and that the staff at the Atlantic Council had handled the research. Photo A 2013 Atlantic Council brochure detailed the benefits of membership in the think tank’s corporate program. “There is no doubt the work of think tanks has more credibility than the work of lobbyists, but the only way we preserve it is through intellectual independence,” Mr. Kempe said. ‘We Do Not Lobby’ General Atomics, the California-based manufacturer of Predator drones, had a clear problem. Prospects for sales were falling as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wound down. The company wanted the Obama administration to change its policy to allow for sales to other countries, a lucrative proposition. “When the budgets are going down in the U.S., you would like to be able to export more,” Frank Pace, the president of the company’s aircraft systems group, told a Reuters reporter in late 2013 at an air show in Dubai. At about that time, the industry turned to the Center for Strategic and International Studies for help, providing money that the think tank used to conduct a study on drone policy, including exports. While defense contracting giants like Lockheed Martin and Boeing have cumulatively donated at least $77 million since 2010 to two dozen think tanks, disclosure records show, General Atomics’s contribution to the Center for Strategic and International Studies was quite small — in the tens of thousands of dollars. C.S.I.S. set up confidential meetings at its headquarters with company representatives, inviting top officials from the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, the State Department and the office of the defense secretary, according to emails and other documents obtained by The Times through open records requests. OPEN Document Document: C.S.I.S. and the Military Drone Maker “Our series will be unique in convening a much broader group of stakeholders than is typical,” Samuel J. Brannen, the think tank’s lead scholar, wrote in an email to Aaron W. Jost, one of the State Department officials in charge of regulating drone exports. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear. “Political obstacles to export,” read the agenda of one closed-door “working group” meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a lobbyist in General Atomics’s Washington office, on the invitation lists, the emails show. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major C.S.I.S. contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry’s priorities. “I came out strongly in support of export,” Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for defense trade controls. But the effort did not stop there. Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export limits at a conference it hosted at its headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps. Mr. Brannen, who has since left C.S.I.S., declined to comment. The think tank insisted that its efforts to influence administration policy were not lobbying. “C.S.I.S. will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,” Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to The Times. “We do not lobby.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story One thing is clear: The result was a victory for General Atomics. Photo A Predator drone manufactured by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. General Atomics helped fund a study that led the United States to ease restrictions on sales of drones to governments overseas. Credit Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times In February 2015, almost one year after the C.S.I.S. report was issued, the State Department announced a clarification of its rules, easing final approval that month for General Atomics’s long-planned sale of unarmed Predator drones to the United Arab Emirates, the first such sale to a non-NATO nation. The think tank report was just one of many voices pushing for the change. A State Department spokesman said that while the government officials involved in the review had received opinions from think tanks and industry officials, “at the end of the day, this is a considered U.S. government policy.” Huntington Ingalls Industries had an equally clear objective: to create an elaborate public relations and lobbying campaign to convince Congress that the nation needed to confront an emerging threat from China by building more nuclear-powered aircraft carriers — at a cost of about $11 billion each. The clear beneficiary? Huntington, the lone builder of the ships. As part of a broader communications effort, Huntington helped finance a think tank report that enhanced the company’s argument for more funding. Bryan McGrath, a former naval officer who had commanded a guided-missile destroyer, approached Huntington Ingalls and offered to write a study on a fee-for-service basis as a private industry expert. The company turned down his offer. Later, after he had joined the Hudson Institute and helped create the Center for American Seapower, he approached Huntington officials again, and they were interested. “A think tank has more prestige,” Mr. McGrath said. Huntington Ingalls paid $100,000 to fund the work, a critical commitment for Mr. McGrath, who said he was paid by Hudson only if he could successfully solicit donations to support his research. Mr. McGrath said he had always been a strong proponent of aircraft carriers, so the company was not buying his opinion. “The Hudson Center makes no secret about being very pro-sea power,” he said. “If a company came that wanted us to write a piece that advocated for something other than that, the answer would be no.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story In exchange for Huntington Ingalls’s support, company officials were given regular briefings on the research and the opportunity to suggest revisions to early drafts, Mr. McGrath said. OPEN Document Document: The Aircraft Carrier Industry’s Lobbying and Think Tank Plan “We have an iterative process already laid out in which we will sit down with them and go through drafts and discuss where we are going,” Mr. McGrath said. He added that he had not accepted all of the company’s suggestions. The report was released in October at the Rayburn House Office Building. Mr. McGrath received an introduction from one of the industry’s most important boosters, Representative J. Randy Forbes, Republican of Virginia, the chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees the Navy. The report did not mention that Huntington Ingalls had helped pay for it. Asked about the failure to disclose the contribution, John P. Walters, Hudson’s chief operating officer, called it a mistake. The report was subsequently revised — months after it was released and the congressional event held — to disclose the donation. A second industry-funded report, prepared by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, came out a month later with a similar urgent call for more money to build more ships and to base more ships abroad, although it did not mention that it had been funded by the Navy League of the United States, a nonprofit group whose large corporate donors include Huntington Ingalls. “This report is yet another important tool for Navy Leaguers to use in the field when educating local leaders and lawmakers,” Skip Witunski, the Navy League president, wrote to the group’s members late last year. The strategy — lining up think tank reports as lobbying tools that echoed each other — was backed up with a series of letters to the editor, dozens of posts on Twitter and Facebook, and op-ed pieces. Mr. McGrath said he, too, wondered if this storm of industry-funded work might be threatening the integrity of the process. “I see a lot of stuff that comes out in Washington,” Mr. McGrath said, “and I got to scratch my head and say, ‘That guy must be on the payroll.’” Brooke Williams is a reporter at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, which collaborated with The New York Times on this series.

Hot Topics: U.S. Presidential Election News Local Heroes Where We Live My Classic Car The Alphabet Print   Email   Font Resize Amazon unveils cargo plane as it expands delivery network Sentinel & Enterprise Updated:   08/06/2016 11:42:22 PM EDT Associated Press SEATTLE -- Seattle-based Amazon is unveiling its first branded cargo plane, one of 40 jetliners that will make up the e-commerce giant's own air transportation network as it takes more control of its delivery process. The latest push to speed delivery of its products comes as the company ships an increasing number of packages worldwide. Amazon's parcel volume was an estimated 1 billion packages in 2015. By way of comparison, in the 2016 fiscal year FedEx delivered about 3 billion packages for hundreds of thousands of customers. Amazon has had issues with the reliability of air freight services. In 2013, it offered refunds to customers who received their Christmas orders late after bad weather and a jump in online shopping caused delays for UPS and FedEx. Analysts say it makes sense for Amazon to use an air fleet it controls as another way to get its products to online shoppers drawn to fast, no-extra-cost delivery. "They're such a big online retailer," said Satish Jindel, president of shipping consultant ShipMatrix. "There's so much volume that if you have to add transportation for yourself, why would you pay a retail price when you can get wholesale? It makes sense." Amazon revealed its first branded "Prime Air" cargo plane, designated Amazon One, on Friday at the annual Seafair Air Show. The plane buzzed over Seattle's Lake Washington just before the Navy's Blue Angels took to the skies. Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc. Advertisement , which will operate the air cargo network. Eleven of the planes already are delivering packages for Amazon's annual Prime loyalty program, which offers free two-day shipping and other perks. The remaining freighters will be rolled out in the next couple of years. Aircraft like Amazon One allow the company to "continue to maintain our fast delivery speeds and lower our costs as our Prime base and our Prime member growth continue to soar," said Dave Clark, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations. Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. "Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs," Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn't yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it's constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. "Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers," Clark said, adding: "Stay tuned and we'll see what happens in the future."

Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. TEA GRAPHIC | NATION MEDIA GROUP   ALLAN OLINGO Sunday, August 7   2016 at  12:09 comment Airlines in the East African region are sprucing up their fleets with new aeroplanes. Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. Tanzania plans to have its Air Tanzania Company Ltd (ATCL) return to its regional routes. “The government is working on a strategic three-year plan that will see the airline’s fleet revamped. If the discussions come to fruition, Air Tanzania will get two more aircraft from Bombardier in the coming year,” a senior aviation official in Tanzania’s Transport Ministry said. Air Tanzania is majority-owned by the state, but has only one Bombardier Dash 8 and a leased Canadair CRJ 100s, which operates between Dar es Salaam and the Comoros islands, with local routes to Mwanza, Kigoma and Mtwara. Last week, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft announced that Tanzania had signed a $62 million purchase agreement for two Q400 turboprop airliners. Leonard Chamuriho, Permanent Secretary at Tanzania’s Ministry of Transport, Works and Communication, said the Q400 aircraft will provide affordable, convenient and comfortable air transport. “We are committed to providing good service as our business grows to include new destinations in Tanzania and Africa,” Dr Chamuriho said. The aircraft were reportedly purchased after a $20 million loan was processed through the TIB Development Bank. This publicationunderstands that ATCL has been audited to ensure the company is financially sound. The airline is said to generate $2.8 million monthly, but has been saddled with debts. Last month, Ethiopian Airlines became the first African airline to take delivery of the Airbus A350, in a $2 billion deal that included smaller aircraft. The aeroplane flies on the Addis Ababa to Lagos route, and has also served the Kigali and Entebbe routes; the route is also served by Kenya Airways and RwandAir. Tewolde Gebremariam, group chief executive officer of Ethiopian, said the aircraft had been purchased to stay competitive in the region. “We are taking an aircraft that has cutting edge technology and will be 25 per cent more fuel efficient. We will save on costs while providing comfort,” he said. Aeroplane delivery RwandAir is expecting two Airbus aeroplanes and a Boeing between September and November. The airline is expecting the delivery of its first 244-seat Airbus A330-200 in September, followed by a Boeing B737-800 in October, and a second 274-seat Airbus A330-300 in November. In May 2017, the airline will receive its fourth Boeing B737-800. RwandAir will ply the Johannesburg, Entebbe, Dar es Salaam, Lagos and Accra routes. The aeroplanes will also operate on the long haul routes to Europe and Asia. The airlines’ most lucrative routes are Kigali to Entebbe, Juba, and Nairobi.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French US planning preemptive nuclear attack: North Korea Sat Aug 6, 2016 10:15PM Home Asia-Pacific Koreas File photo shows a US air force Rockwell B-1 Lancer bomber (Photos by AFP) North Korea says the US is planning a preemptive nuclear attack after Washington announces the deployment of B-1 bombers in the Pacific. On Saturday, the North said the US is "becoming all the more pronounced in their moves to topple down the DPRK by mobilizing all nuclear war hardware." The strategic bombers were set to be deployed in the US Island of Guam on Saturday in a move which the Pentagon calls a routine rotation with the B-52 bombers. "The enemies are bluffing that they can mount a preemptive nuclear strike on the DPRK by letting fly B-1B over the Korean peninsula within two-three hours in contingency," said a statement released on North Korean state media. On July 29, the US air force announced that it would be the first time that B-1s are sent to Guam since April 2006. Designed by Rockwell International (now part of Boeing), the Rockwell B-1 Lancer is a four-engine heavy strategic bomber used by the US air force as a supersonic bomber with Mach 2 speed. This undated photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on July 21, 2016 shows a missile fired during a drill by Hwasong artillery units of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army. "Such moves for bolstering nuclear force exposes again that the US imperialists are making a preemptive nuclear strike on the DPRK a fait accompli," added the Pyongyang statement. Earlier in July, the North pledged a “physical response” to US deployment of the sophisticated THAAD missile system in Korean Peninsula.  THAAD interceptor is launched during a test in this undated handout photo provided by the Pentagon. Tensions have been flaring in the region since January, when North Korea said it had successfully detonated a hydrogen bomb, its fourth nuclear test, and vowed to build up its nuclear program as deterrence against potential aggression from the US and its regional allies.     A month later, Pyongyang launched a long-range rocket which it said placed an earth observation satellite into orbit. However, Washington and Seoul denounced it as a cover for an intercontinental ballistic missile test.​ Loading ...

In a speech at an airline conference in Brisbane, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said current demand is being met by the 12 A380s they already have in their fleet. To rub salt into Airbus' wound, Qantas also said any growth would be catered for by the arrival of the 787-9 Dreamliner produced by Airbus rival, Boeing. Qantas deploys the A380 on longhaul flights, with superjumbos flying routes like Sydney to London via Dubai or direct from Sydney or Melbourne to Dallas or Los Angeles. Last month Airbus announced it would cut production of the A380s from 27 per year to just 12. Emirates are by far the biggest customer for the A380, they have 81 in their fleet with 61 yet to be delivered. Each Airbus costs more than $595 million. Newshub.

Despite its growing fleet of aircraft, Amazon said it plans to continue to use FedEx, UPS and other transportation partners. “Because of our growth and the sheer amount of packages, we are supplementing our transportation needs,” Clark said. The company has been furiously building out distribution centers, where workers and robots pull products off shelves and package them for delivery, as well as smaller sorting plants, which arrange packages by ZIP code for faster delivery. It has a network of more than 125 fulfillment centers worldwide. Amazon recently reported a second-quarter profit of $857 million on $30 billion in revenue. The company doesn’t yet have plans to carry packages for others but says it’s constantly evaluating its situation. Amazon has not been shy about competing in businesses areas far-flung from its e-commerce roots. “Once you have those planes, it certainly creates the opportunity for new products for customers,” Clark said, adding: “Stay tuned and we’ll see what happens in the future.” Comments DentonRC.com is now using Facebook Comments.

Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. TEA GRAPHIC | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary Regional airlines are sprucing up their fleets with new aeroplanes. Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. However, analysts are sceptical about whether demand for air travel in the region is high enough to sustain the fleet expansion programmes. Regional airlines are sprucing up their fleets with new aeroplanes. Ethiopian, Rwandan and Tanzanian airlines will receive new aircraft from next week. Tanzania plans to have its Air Tanzania Company Ltd (ATCL) return to its regional routes. “The government is working on a strategic three-year plan that will see the airline’s fleet revamped. If the discussions come to fruition, Air Tanzania will get two more aircraft from Bombardier in the coming year,” a senior aviation official in Tanzania’s Transport Ministry said. Air Tanzania is majority-owned by the state, but has only one Bombardier Dash 8 and a leased Canadair CRJ 100s, which operates between Dar es Salaam and the Comoros islands, with local routes to Mwanza, Kigoma and Mtwara. Last week, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft announced that Tanzania had signed a $62 million purchase agreement for two Q400 turboprop airliners. Leonard Chamuriho, Permanent Secretary at Tanzania’s Ministry of Transport, Works and Communication, said the Q400 aircraft will provide affordable, convenient and comfortable air transport. “We are committed to providing good service as our business grows to include new destinations in Tanzania and Africa,” Dr Chamuriho said. The aircraft were reportedly purchased after a $20 million loan was processed through the TIB Development Bank. The EastAfrican understands that ATCL has been audited to ensure the company is financially sound. The airline is said to generate $2.8 million monthly, but has been saddled with debts. Last month, Ethiopian Airlines became the first African airline to take delivery of the Airbus A350, in a $2 billion deal that included smaller aircraft. The aeroplane flies on the Addis Ababa to Lagos route, and has also served the Kigali and Entebbe routes; the route is also served by Kenya Airways and RwandAir. Tewolde Gebremariam, group chief executive officer of Ethiopian, said the aircraft had been purchased to stay competitive in the region. “We are taking an aircraft that has cutting edge technology and will be 25 per cent more fuel efficient. We will save on costs while providing comfort,” he said. Aeroplane delivery RwandAir is expecting two Airbus aeroplanes and a Boeing between September and November. The airline is expecting the delivery of its first 244-seat Airbus A330-200 in September, followed by a Boeing B737-800 in October, and a second 274-seat Airbus A330-300 in November. In May 2017, the airline will receive its fourth Boeing B737-800. RwandAir will ply the Johannesburg, Entebbe, Dar es Salaam, Lagos and Accra routes. The aeroplanes will also operate on the long haul routes to Europe and Asia. The airlines’ most lucrative routes are Kigali to Entebbe, Juba, and Nairobi. However, analysts are sceptical about whether demand for air travel in the region is high enough to sustain the fleet expansion programmes. “Even large international airlines have had tumultuous times running a profitable business in the region. It is difficult to foresee a scenario where passenger demand will rise,” said Razia Khan, chief Africa economist at Standard Chartered Bank.

Geza, you went through the trouble of bringing the article here, but why not bring the bombaider and rueters article? stop fixng things, ati acording to bla blah, thats just a cheap way to lie. the article say you signed a $62m agreement and you took a $20m loan witch you used for the purchase, so what is your problem exactly cause the article doea not even talk about if where you got the other $42m. all i can say to you is goodluck, but dont start yapping about ATL here, it will take more that 20years for ATL to get the level of KQ, RwandAir has better chance........ You are still just starting to buy turbo prop airplanes, unless you plan to use them for cargo. I think its was a bad investment, no one buys those planes for commercial use anymore, they are noisy when you sit close to the middle and planes cant go high altitube for long haul distance.... but like i said, good luck, you have to start from somewhere, but atleast you are starting   - 0 people likes G Geza Ulole JF-Expert Member #20 Aug 7, 2016 Joined: Oct 31, 2009 Messages: 8,062 Likes Received: 1,281 Trophy Points: 280 Kuziwa, so u hav already concluded a forex will be accrued by just building a railline or a road to those unproductive areas compared to those already proven productive area! If our projections r to hav 3 mln tourists by 2018, what opportunities do u see? And if over 10 airports already constructed n scattered to nearly every strategic corner of the country, how do we get returns from them? Do we have to just let only the foreign airlines make use of such facilities to benefit themselves and continue to have no say on the kind fare they charge us? Do u hav an idea Dar-Nrb (less than 2 hrs) was over $400? R u aware of roads n rail lines current under construction or about to be constructed? Mention me one forgotten place around the EA compared to Northern Kenya! Uache ujuaji huwezi kusema tuache kuwinda fursa bwerere zilizopo zitokanazo na Jumuiya na rasirimali za utalii kisa kijiji flani hakina barabara!

Mimi binafsi nachukia makao makuu ya Barrickgold Africa (Acacia) yenye migodi mitano Tanzania (minne dhahabu mmoja nickel) kuwa J'burg na si Mwanza! Ungekuwa mwerevu ungetambua easier logistics play a role! Our competitive edge was not up to the task as far as convincing Barrick Gold put up offices in Mwanza. Ila with current expansion at Mwanza airport n a revamp of Air Tanzania direct connections from other business hubs across the continent and global to Mwanza will be possible and better off affordable as a room for fair competition will be enabled with functioning Air Tanzania. The same is the story for the KIA expansion, it had reached a point we as a nation were public embarrased by our heavily dependence on JKIA and KQ! Plse remind urself of frequent bans on our shuttle buses and our horticulture cargo from accessing JKIA. At times with flimsy excuses like our flowers are contaminated with pests! Kenya's ego had reached to unpreceedented levels n regardless of their KQ making loss n being in need of more business, had dared to grossly misbehaving and bully us to allow them accessing our Parks free of charge in return to our access to their JKIA which has always been at a fee! Will we be able to avoid that by just modernizing our airports and not having a functioning airline? Wewe ni siasa inakuweka upofu na sidhani kama umeipitia bajeti ya 2016/2017 kuona gawio la miundombinu! FYI TCAA and TAA have invested a lot including the two radars about to be acquired n r more than prepared to host a national airline ready to tap into gas n tourism revenues that go hand in hand with good aviation industry since travelling complements the two sectors.

It was Airbus Group’s experimental E-Fan 1.2 hybrid electric airplane being unveiled for the first time in the U.S. The red, white and blue European single-seater — which flies on batteries and regular aviation fuel — is so new and untested that U.S. aviation authorities wouldn’t allow it to fly last month at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s famous AirVenture — more commonly known as “Oshkosh.” “We’re just at the beginning — the seventh test flight,” said Didier Esteyne, the plane’s lead test pilot and designer. “We still have a lot of work to do in front of us.” Dirt and noise So, with the price of traditional fossil fuels so low these days, why so much attention on electric planes? Large commercial jets are blamed for 11% of all global transportation emissions, according to the federal government, and that number is predicted to explode by 50% by 2050. The E-Fan hybrid could help engineers make key breakthroughs to developing cleaner, quieter electric airliners that travelers might be flying on in less than two decades. Crossing the Channel, cleanly and quietly Esteyne made news last year when he flew an all-electric version of the plane — the E-Fan 1.1 — across the English Channel. It was a meaningful moment for him and for everyone who helped develop the aircraft. “Even though I was flying alone, we were many people together when I crossed the Channel,” Esteyne recalled. Esteyne was at Oshkosh to introduce his newest plane to America. Curious air show attendees gathered around him asking questions about how the E-Fan hybrid worked. He told them about how the combustion engine gives the plane a 2-hour-15-minute range — extending the flight time of the previous version — the 1.1 — by an hour and 15 minutes. He explained how the combustion engine sits behind the cockpit, and is only used to charge the plane’s lithium-ion batteries which are embedded in the wings. The combustion engine doesn’t provide any of the plane’s thrust. The two ducted fan engines that do give the plane its thrust are mounted on each side of the fuselage. The plane takes off and lands on electric power only — to make it as quiet as possible. The combustion engine will charge the batteries only during the cruise portion of each flight. Big challenges Let’s not kid ourselves. Lots of technological hurdles stand in the way between the E-Fan and developing electric airliners — challenges like developing lightweight batteries that can store enough electricity for long distance flights. Boeing conducted a small experimental electric hybrid plane program last year in the UK and finished a study with NASA that showed hybrid electric propulsion as having good potential for “air vehicles in the 2030 to 2050 timeline.” What the future holds Airbus is collaborating with Siemens and Daher to build an all-electric two-seater called E-Fan 2.0. It’s first flight is expected sometime next year. But perhaps more importantly, this technology is sowing the seeds for passenger electric planes that we could be flying on as soon as 14 years from now. In April, Siemens announced that it hopes to be selling hybrid electric passenger planes with Airbus by 2030 that will carry up to 100 passengers up to about 620 miles — that’s about the distance from New York to Detroit. The planes would burn 25% less fuel by running electric power during takeoff and landing, Siemens said, making them almost silent at airports. Cutting CO2 emissions is critical, but also, cities will need to build more airports as passenger traffic increases. And that brings with it concerns about noise. “For me, reducing the noise is very important,” Esteyne said. “We know that in cities when you add airports, the noise and pollution are very important. This is the only way to do it.” Noise and CO2 levels are only expected to rise, because in the next 20 years 3.2 billion additional airline passengers are predicted to fly worldwide, according to the International Air Transport Association. Those passengers are going to need more airplanes and airports. It’s a statistic that only puts more pressure on airlines, airports, aviation authorities and governments to find cleaner and quieter ways to fly.

Testing the Vector P-20 Rocket 0:00 0:00 Share this video http://qz.com/747513 Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business August 06, 2016 Back in June, NASA tested a booster for the most powerful rocket it has ever tried to build, the Space Launch System (SLS). The booster alone was more than 150 feet long, producing 3.6 million pounds of force, and reaching temperatures of nearly 6,000°F during a ground test in Promontory, Utah. The whole rocket is so expensive it will probably only fly twice in the next four years, if at all. A month later, in the Mojave Desert, a very different test took place, involving a prototype rocket just 12 feet long. Built by a small company called Vector Space, it flew just a few thousand feet in the air, successfully demonstrating 3-D printed engine parts that will plug into a full-scale version just 42 feet long, not even a third of the size of one of SLS booster. If its designers are right, the Vector 1, as the small rocket is called, will fly hundreds of times before the SLS becomes operational, making the company a bundle along the way. The buzz in the space business isn’t always about bigger rockets and farther journeys. Today, it’s about downright small rockets, practically bespoke, and designed to go just a few hundred or thousand miles. Just a little lift Entrepreneurs are excited about small satellites for the same reason you may be excited about Pokemon Go: Engineers can now cram a huge amount of processing and sensing ability into an electronics component that barely weighs anything, letting you do fun things (catch Pokemon, snap satellite pictures) very cheaply in places you could not before (sidewalks across America, low-Earth orbit). Advances like these make it possible to do more with smaller satellites, a key savings in a business where installing your infrastructure costs—at a minimum—thousands of dollars per kilogram. Numerous companies already have sprung up, among them Spire, Planet, Urthecast, Planetary Resources, and BlackSky Global, promising a brisk business for launching small satellites, which could be used for purposes ranging from photography to communications to tracking.  It’s the space equivalent of sending a UPS truck across town instead of an enormous container ship.  Instead of dozens of small satellites launched annually, analysts are now forecasting hundreds of small satellites heading to orbit each year. The next question is how to get them up there. Most of the time, small satellites are launched in groups by the big space-access providers, like Arianespace or ULA, but it’s tough finding room on one of their launches, especially when each company may fly just a dozen missions in a year. It’s also a logistical hassle. Booking a launch requires wait times that are often longer than a year, as well as customizing your satellite to the rocket you’re riding on, and often ends with your mission taking a backseat to whatever the primary cargo is. There’s no real way to conceive of a small satellite, build it, and launch it in just a few months, which makes rapid testing and deployment in the spirit of Silicon Valley nearly impossible. “We are already seeing traffic jams for a launch at the national ranges,” Virgin Galactic executive Will Pomerantz says. “You want to fly on date X, so does NASA, and so does the Air Force; you can imagine where a small entrepreneurial company would fall on the pecking order.” You can see where this is going: What if small satellites had commensurately small rockets to take them quickly into orbit, the space equivalent of sending a UPS truck across town instead of an enormous container ship? Necessity is the mother “Nobody is paying attention to those guys—they’re still treated like toys, like second-class citizens, they don’t have a reliable way to get to orbit,” Jim Cantrell says of small satellite companies.  “I’m going to dominate the small side.”  Cantrell is a founder of Vector Space, the company behind the Mojave Desert test. He and co-founder John Garvey are both veterans of the space business; they played a role in helping Elon Musk set up SpaceX when the company’s early staff was being recruited in those same Mojave test grounds. Vector Space Systems testing their prototype in the Mojave. (Vector Space) Musk’s vision for disrupting space is slightly different: SpaceX is beating established rocketry firms at the lucrative work of launching enormous satellites into orbit, especially geo-stationary orbits 37,000 kilometers up, where satellites can hang over one spot on Earth. SpaceX’s next rocket, the Falcon Heavy, will be enormous (though not quite as big as SLS) and designed to take big cargo into space very efficiently. “Geo-stationary orbit is actually real estate—you can only put so many satellites up there,” Cantrell says. “It’s like waterfront property at the beach. Everyone builds the biggest thing they can put up there. Chasing that market, putting everybody out of that business, that’s how Elon is going to fund his way to Mars. It’s kind of a brilliant strategy.” But that’s not Cantrell’s business. He and Garvey are focused on the opportunity they see in a world where companies are building businesses around satellites that weigh less than 100 lbs. “I’m going to dominate the small side,” Cantrell promises. He expects to orbital tests to start next year, and operations to commence in 2018. A crowded field Vector Space is hardly the only company to aim for this market. There at least a half-dozen hoping to be the first to provide regular service to small satellite operators. Rocket Labs, a San Francisco/New Zealand effort, has developed a new kind of electronic rocket motor and is already signing on clients to fly as soon as 2017, though it has yet to fully flight-test its rocket. Firefly also is developing a rocket, and expects by 2018 to launch satellites weighing less than 1,000 kg. Then there are the companies developing plans to launch small rockets from planes, like Paul Allen’s Vulcan Aerospace. Vulcan is in the early stages of figuring out how to use an aircraft called the Stratolaunch, with the largest wingspan ever built, for the job. And Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic is in the process of hardware-testing a rocket system it hopes is two years away from launching satellites on a 60-foot (18-meter) rocket slung under the belly of a 747. A rendering of what it might look like to drop a rocket off a 747. (Virgin Galactic) “Even if you are only at an altitude of 35,000 feet, you’re already above 90% of the atmosphere, not swimming your way through a thick soup of atmosphere at the start of a mission,” Pomerantz says. Another answer for the smallest satellites is the company NanoRacks, which in 2014 installed a special port on the International Space Station to launch cubesats carried aloft during regular cargo delivery missions to the station, where astronauts can then deploy the satellites. So far, they have launched more than 100. There’s one big threat to the small-rocket business The incumbent rocket companies flying the big cargo missions aren’t ignoring the market trends. And they all have operational rockets in an industry where bringing a functioning product to market rarely happens on schedule. SpaceX’s obsession with reusability has it convinced it will drive competitors with smaller rockets out of business. It has also forced its competitors to think more about lowering launch costs and using every inch of their rockets efficiently. United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin that performs most US space launches, has developed a “cubesat” carrier (designed for small, cube-shaped satellites) that can attach to its Atlas rocket; and it plans to deploy it widely. “Every Atlas launch vehicle would have one of these carriers on the back end and provide the total current equivalent of the world’s cubesat rides to space, in one to three years,” ULA CEO Tory Bruno told Quartz. “I think there is going to be greater and greater utility in smaller and smaller satellites,” Bruno added, describing a scenario in which low-Earth orbit “becomes the app store of space, [offering] all sorts of economic activities there, things we haven’t even thought about today.” Bet on the little guy If the large rocket companies think their quest for lower pricing will eventually crowd out smaller competitors, the new companies are equally bullish that the incumbents can’t match their service and flexibility in a world of cheap access to space. “In many ways, the market for satellites has been so constrained by launch costs for so long, if that diminishes, it’s going to increase our demand,” Virgin Galactic’s Pomerantz says, forecasting an expanded array of rocket needs. If cheap access to space is really going to bring about a surge of new economic activity there, it will likely take multiple, easy-to-use platforms for commercial access—because the industry will be serving a range of customers, and because individual customers will have a range of needs. A key client for Virgin, OneWeb, the space internet company, has an ambitious efforts underway to launch hundreds of satellites weighing 125 kilograms apiece to deliver broadband internet to Earth. OneWeb can launch perhaps 35 or 40 of its satellites on a large rocket, whereas Virgin Galactic could only launch two at a time. But even if most satellites are launched in bulk, small rockets can be used for a lot of other purposes—replacing individual satellites if they fail, testing new generations of satellites, or putting a few satellites in a unique orbit to eliminate empty coverage areas, for example. “We’ve designed our capability to be able to go into space for any rocket that will provide it,” says Chris Lewicki, the CEO of Planetary Resources, a company developing the technology to mine asteroids and a likely customer for the small-scale players. “In the normal shipping market, FedEx or UPS or DHL, they all have their different advantages.” And it will take that kind of ease of use to make Earth-orbit the kind of entrepreneurial playground that these starry-eyed Silicon Valley voyagers are looking for.

But, for a quieter experience, you may want to see them up close at the Hydroplane and Raceboat Museum in Kent. The exhibit grew from a private collection of memorabilia into a warehouse jampacked with hydroplanes that have been restored to sailing condition. Nine were on display when I visited, including the historic 1975 Oh Boy! Oberto, the first one to be sponsored by the local brand. Years before we had Sounders, Seahawks or Mariners to root for, hydroplane races put Seattle on the map of professional sports. I often hear these words when people talk about them: “Quintessential Seattle.” Here are more sketches from my visit to the museum: Modern-era hydroplanes use enclosed cockpits to protect the pilots in case of crashes. The cockpit of this Boeing hydro came from an F-16 aircraft. Back in the day, it was normal for towns to have their own mascot hydros. The 1960 Miss Burien was sponsored by a group of Burien merchants. The 1957 Miss Wahoo belonged to Bill Boeing Jr. With its wooden finish, it stands as the most elegant in the collection.
