Pages Home About Contact Commercial Aviation Defense Space Privacy Policy Disclaimer Saturday, August 13, 2016 USAF approve KC-46A tanker production U.S. Air Force approved production of its newest strategic tanker aircraft- the Boeing KC-46A Pegasus, after successfully completing several aerial refueling demonstrations. KC-46 refuels a A-10 aircraft using the boom The Milestone C approval was granted by Frank Kendall, the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. The USAF will soon award the first two low rate initial production contracts to Boeing, totaling 19 aircraft, and associated spare parts for a pre-negotiated $2.8 billion combined value. The approval was granted after successful aerial refueling demonstrations of multiple platforms operated by USAF, to include refueling an F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter, C-17 Globemaster III airlifter and A-10 Thunderbolt II off the boom, and an AV-8 Harriar II and F/A-18 Hornet off both hose and drogue systems. The KC-46 also proved its receiver capability by taking fuel from a KC-10 Extender tanker. Some demonstrations were delayed due to higher than expected axial loads in the boom. Boeing installed hydraulic pressure relief valves to alleviate loads and last month all remaining demonstrations were quickly completed. The first aircraft deliveries will be to McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, and Altus AFB, Oklahoma. A total of 18 tankers are scheduled to be delivered by early 2018. The Pegasus is based on a Boeing 767 commercial jet platform and can also configured to carry passengers, cargo and patients. It will replace the ageing fleet of KC-135 tankers, which first entered USAF service in 1956. The tanker can offload 212,299 lbs (96,265 kg) of fuel through its centerline boom and two wing-mounted hose and drogue systems. A total of 179 KC-46 aircraft will be built for the Air Force.

Fiji Time: 7:50 AM on Thursday 24 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / News High flyer Talebula Kate Monday, August 15, 2016 THE first iTaukei pilot to captain a Boeing 787 Dreamliner was in the country at the weekend to watch the Deans rugby final between Queen Victoria School (QVS) and Marist Brothers High School. Captain Laisenia Naigulevu, a former QVS student, said there was nothing to stop Fijian pilots flying world-class luxury airlines that offered international experience. He is the first Fijian pilot to have flown and commanded the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and is motivating aspiring Fijian pilots. "It's free to dream; we as island boys can make it, there's no stopping us." The gentleman from Namacu, Koro, in Lomaiviti, who has maternal links to Tavuki, Kadavu, always wanted to fly when he was a child. Raised by parents who were medical professionals, Mr Naigulevu said they used to travel a lot within Fiji by plane because of his parents' work schedules. From a humble beginning flying Fiji's Sunflower airline in 1989, he is now flying for one of the world's leading airlines — Oman Air. Captain Naigulevu joined Air Pacific in 1991 before getting an offer which he could not resist from Oman Air in 2005 and is now based in Muscat, Oman. He said it was an honour and huge opportunity to be in command of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is the latest Boeing airplane and is not in operation in Fiji. Mr Naigulevu said he loved to go places and always wanted a new adventure so when he was offered the opportunity to captain the 787 Dreamliner, it was an offer too hard to resist. In comparing the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner Mr Naigulevu said the latter travelled a lot faster, flew higher and was more economical. As for the cargo capacity, Mr Naiguilevu said the A330 was better. "A330 has the advantage on cargo capacity," he said. He attributed his success to what he called a pathfinder in Captain Jimmy Sassen, now a retired pilot but working with the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji in Nadi. "He was the first to go out to the Gulf back in the 1980s and he set the bar for us who went to the Gulf," Mr Naigulevu said. "I was one of the 14 pilots who moved to Oman Air from Air Pacific." Captain Naigulevu is married to Salauca Caucau from Batiki and they have a son, Christian. It's back to business for Captain Naigulevu this week as he returns to his adopted country.

Iran News ... 08/14/16 Boeing representatives in Tehran: Iranian Minister Source: Press TV Boeing representatives are currently in Tehran, discussing the US plane maker's planned sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, an Iranian minister says. "Right now, Boeing representatives including three financial, legal and technical groups are in Tehran and negotiating" the sale of jetliners to Iran, Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhundi said on Saturday. Related campaign by Tehran residents: Add 1000 wagons to Tehran Metro to address overcrowding Source: Javan daily Those negotiations with Airbus have concluded and the two sides were waiting for the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to issue a license for the purchase to go ahead, Akhundi added. The two aviation rivals have signed initial accords with the flag carrier Iran Air to sell about 200 aircraft worth more than $50 billion to the country which is seeking to renovate its aging fleet after decades of sanctions. However, they are facing stiff opposition from pro-Israeli members of US Congress who are seeking to block the planned sales. The lawmakers plan to debate a raft of measures, including one that would prohibit the US Treasury from licensing the sales. US President Barack Obama and his allies are expected to oppose the legislation, but if the bills are written into law, they would prevent other firms from selling aircraft to Iran as well. US equipment allegedly accounts for more than 10% of the content used in almost all modern jets, requiring export licenses from the American government for any contract to be implemented. Iran's current civil aviation fleet consists of 248 aircraft, of which 100 are grounded. Akhundi expected deliveries by Airbus to start in the Iranian month of Aban which begins on October 22 if OFAC issues a license within the next two or three weeks. "As for Airbus, all technical, contractual and financial negotiations have finished and we are waiting for OFAC's license in which case all work will be wrapped up in time," he said. "Everything depends on this license and politicians are saying that OFAC's licenses for Airbus and Boeing are interrelated," Akhundi added in remarks quoted by the Tasnim news agency. As regards Airbus, most of the technical specifications have ended and only the time of the authorization remains to be announced by OFAC, the minister said. Iran Air agreed in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Airbus. Another MoU was signed in June, calling for Boeing to sell a total of 80 aircraft to Iran and help the country lease a further 29 in a deal worth $25 billion. Boeing has proposed to sell its 737, 777 and 787 models and promised after-sales support, according to Iranian officials who have said the country needs as many as 500 jets for its fleet. Iran's current civil aviation fleet consists of 248 aircraft with an average age of 20 years, of which 100 are grounded. Some media reports have said US Treasury might be putting off its decision on the sales until after the Nov. 8 presidential election in the US, where both Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump are stalwart supporters of Israel. Amid those speculations, Iranian carriers have begun talks with Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer as well as Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft for its regional passenger jet currently under development. In February, turboprop manufacturer ATR and Iran Air signed a deal for the introduction of 40 newest generation ATR 72-600s. China's single-aisle C919 airliner which rolled off the assembly line last November is another option, but neither choice is without hurdles. While none of the companies has an aircraft for delivery in its inventory, both rely on the US and Europe for key parts in their manufacturing. ...

Thanks to this contract, the airplane manufacturer will start the production of its KC-46 military tanker aircraft. The agreement is expected to be valued at $2.8 billion under which the aircraft manufacturer would manufacture 19 KC-46 aircraft. The current news would mean a big achievement for Boeing, as its troubled KC-46 tanker project has faced long delays due to technical issues. With the company resolving all its issues last month and conducting a successful refueling test flight for the A-10 Warthog military aircraft, Boeing can now look ahead to initiate full production of the aircraft once it signs the agreement with the US Air Force. Boeing was expected to sign the initial production agreement with US Air Force in August 2015, but because of the aircraft's technical issues it was not able to gain the Pentagon’s approval. The low rate production contract was then delayed to April this year which was also not received, as technical issues continued to plague the aircraft. The aircraft manufacturer gained the confidence of US officials after conducting successful test flights last month that resulted in the approval of the contract at last. As part of the long term US government contract, Boeing is slated to manufacture a total of 179 tanker aircraft bearing a consolidated value of $52 billion. “I commend the team for diligently working through some difficult technical challenges,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in the statement. “The KC-46 program has made significant strides in moving the Air Force toward the modernization needed in our strategic tanker fleet." The KC-46 has still not received the full production contract approval from the US government as the US Air Force will test the aircraft performance during the low rate production period. Previously, the US Air Force had scheduled the KC-46 tanker's full approval for September 2017, but delays in the lower approval forced the US government to delay full production approval until March 2018. The KC-46 tanker aerial refueling military aircraft has also dented Boeing’s net margins due to increased project costs stemming from the delays due to the technical issues. The aircraft manufacturer had to incorporate $393 million worth of additional charges in its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, dealing a blow to investors. However, after the recent news, Boeing’s investors are also expected to gain confidence in the KC-46 project that was once considered a liability for the company. Apart from incorporating the KC-46 tanker project cost into its second quarter 2016 earnings, Boeing also had to include additional charges arising from its commercial aircraft production. It was due to these additional charges that the aircraft manufacturer reported a net loss per share after a long time. Along with these issues, Boeing is also experiencing tough market conditions after the US government reduced military spending to acquire new military jets. In the second quarter of 2016, Boeing’s Military Aircraft segment revenues came in at $2.97 billion, which is a 14% year-over-year (YoY) decline due to less C-17 and Chinook helicopter deliveries.

Smith indicated that the dearth of widebody jet sales may also mean Boeing won’t raise output of the 787 Dreamliner as high as planned. A further 777 production rate cut and a lower-than-planned 787 rate — added to the possibility signaled last month that Boeing could shutter the 747 jumbo jet assembly line — would mean less work in the Seattle-area city of Everett and potential job cuts there, though it’s unclear how severe the impact might be. Boeing has already committed to slowing production of the current 777 from today’s rate of 8.3 jets per month — that’s 100 per year — down to 7 jets per month in 2017. The rate will decrease further to 5.5 jets per month during the transition to the new model 777X in 2018. Speaking at the Jefferies Industrials Conference in New York, Smith said it’s unclear if new orders will arrive in time to match those planned production rates. “Over the next couple of months, we’ll know,” Smith said. “We’ll either solidify those orders . or we’ll modify the production rate.” Boeing has said it needs to sell 40 to 60 jets per year to fill all the open 777 delivery slots between now and the end of the decade. So far this year, it has booked just eight net new orders. Smith did not indicate how much lower the rate might go. Local aviation analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham.net said the 777 order backlog suggests a rate of about 4 aircraft per month is sustainable without further sales. One indicator that the 777 market is in trouble came in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late last month by global aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation. Intrepid, which has six 777s on order from Boeing, revealed it hasn’t yet found airlines to take four of those planes — three scheduled for delivery next fall and the other in early 2018. Sam Pearlstein, aerospace analyst with Wells Fargo, wrote in a note to investors that “this highlights why Boeing’s goal of 40-plus annual new 777 orders will remain a challenge.” Smith also lowered expectations on production of the 787 Dreamliner. Next year, 787 production is set to rise from today’s 10 jets per month to 12 per month. And Boeing had planned to make 14 per month by the end of the decade. Now that second rate hike looks uncertain. “We’re going to match supply and demand, and if it doesn’t play out to be 14, then we’ll adjust accordingly,” Smith said. “It’s not the end of the world if you went from 14 to 12. We can still be profitable.” While the 787 sold at record levels prior to entering service, sales slowed dramatically afterwards. In the first five years of sales, Boeing sold 700 Dreamliners. In the five and a half years since, it has sold 400 more. So far this year, Boeing has added just 19 net new orders for the jet. Last week, Leeham.net’s Hamilton wrote that even the planned rate of 12 Dreamliners per month could be challenging to sustain without more 787 sales. In an interview Wednesday, Hamilton said that if 787 production is further pared back, it’s likely the cutbacks will come in Everett rather than at the assembly line in North Charleston, S.C. The South Carolina line’s prospects are bolstered by the fact that Boeing will build the largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, only at that plant. If the 787 rate were cut, along with the possibility of a 777 production cut and the 747 line closing, “by the end of the decade, it’s very possible we could be looking at some lean times in Everett,” Hamilton said. And he warned that the new 777 model that’s in development, the 777X, doesn’t have enough sales to suggest a big recovery when it enters service in 2020. Boeing has 306 firm orders for that new jet, and has booked no new orders within the past year. Hamilton said that’s only enough to sustain a production rate of 4 or 5 a month. “The 777X isn’t going to be any kind of savior,” he said. Hamilton said Washington state officials need to do “a deep dive into the potential scenarios” and come up with a pro-active plan to capture new work for Everett — whether that’s Boeing’s next new airplane or aerospace work from other companies.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French Boeing representatives in Tehran: Minister Sat Aug 13, 2016 9:55AM Home Iran Economy An MoU signed in June calls for Boeing to sell a total of 80 aircraft worth $25 billion to Iran. Boeing representatives are currently in Tehran, discussing the US planemaker’s planned sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, an Iranian minister says.  “Right now, Boeing representatives including three financial, legal and technical groups are in Tehran and negotiating” the sale of jetliners to Iran, Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhundi said on Saturday. Those negotiations with Airbus have concluded and the two sides were waiting for the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to issue a license for the purchase to go ahead, he added. The two aviation rivals have signed initial accords with the flag carrier Iran Air to sell about 200 aircraft worth more than $50 billion to the country which is seeking to renovate its aging fleet after decades of sanctions. Iran’s current civil aviation fleet consists of 248 aircraft, of which 100 are grounded. However, they are facing stiff opposition from pro-Israeli members of US Congress who are seeking to block the planned sales. The lawmakers plan to debate a raft of measures, including one that would prohibit the US Treasury from licensing the sales. US President Barack Obama and his allies are expected to oppose the legislation, but if the bills are written into law, they would prevent other firms from selling aircraft to Iran as well. US equipment allegedly accounts for more than 10% of the content used in almost all modern jets, requiring export licenses from the American government for any contract to be implemented. Akhundi expected deliveries by Airbus to start in the Iranian month of Aban which begins on October 22 if OFAC issues a license within the next two or three weeks. “As for Airbus, all technical, contractual and financial negotiations have finished and we are waiting for OFAC’s license in which case all work will be wrapped up in time,” he said. “Everything depends on this license and politicians are saying that OFAC’s licenses for Airbus and Boeing are interrelated,” Akhundi added in remarks quoted by the Tasnim news agency.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor NextSTEP-2 companies to develop deep space habitat prototypes Derek Richardson August 13th, 2016 NASA selected six companies to design and develop prototype deep space habitats to be used sometime in the future as part of the agency’s journey to Mars. Image Credit: NASA Earlier this week, NASA selected six U.S. companies to develop deep space habitat ground prototypes under the second Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement. The goal of these partnerships is to advance commercial development of space while supporting human spaceflight missions to beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO). The six companies selected are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), and NanoRacks. According to NASA, each company will have up to 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The agency has estimated the total cost of NextSTEP-2 will be around $65 million over the next two years. Specific amounts awarded to each company will be dependent on contract negotiations. However, each partner is expected to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors, said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long-duration habitation, and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The habitat prototypes developed must integrate systems and components that include a docking capability, environmental control and life support systems, logistics management, radiation mitigation and monitoring, fire safety technologies, and crew health capabilities. The ground prototypes the companies will be developing will be used for three main purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. All of this will be done to help define standards, common interfaces, and other requirements as well options for using SLS and Orion as well as commercial spacecraft. Risk reduction for final flight systems is expected to come after this phase. Bigelow Aerospace Image Credit: Bigelow Aerospace Bigelow already has three prototype expandable modules in space: Genesis 1, launched in 2006; Genesis 2, launched in 2007; and the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), launched in early 2016, attached to the International Space Station (ISS). The company will build upon those modules and the work they have already done for their future large modules – the 330 cubic meter B330. Under NextSTEP, Bigelow will develop and test their Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE). It is essentially a modified version of their B330 design with a specific mission of being attached to the ISS as a visiting vehicle. Boeing Image Credit: Boeing Boeing already has experience in designing, building, and assembling many of the already-in-orbit modules of the ISS. Additionally, the company is developing the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to ferry crews to and from the outpost. Using this experience, the company will produce a full-scale ground prototype that will provide design analysis as well as high fidelity demonstration and test capability. According to NASA, as part of the NextSTEP goals, the demonstrator will test and validate interface standards, systems functionality, and critical exploration technologies. Lockheed Martin Image Credit: Lockheed Martin By refurbishing a multi-purpose logistics module, which the Space Shuttles used to resupply the space station, Lockheed Martin will transform it into a full-scale habitat prototype. It will include integrated avionics and environmental control and life support systems. The company hopes the high-fidelity module will reduce the risk involved in creating a habitat, as this module design has flown in space before. The prototype will also demonstrate data communication can go between the habitat and Orion. Additionally, docking and crew interfaces will be modified to support Orion. Orbital ATK Image Credit: Orbital ATK Orbital ATK is expected to mature the architecture currently utilized on the company’s Cygnus spacecraft that currently services the ISS. Features of the prototype spacecraft will be modified to support testing of critical interfaces with Orion and other modules. Additionally, the Cygnus-derived habitat will be designed for long-term operations in deep space, as opposed to a couple of months in LEO at ISS. Sierra Nevada Corporation Image Credit: Sierra Nevada Corporation Utilizing the design of the cargo module from the company’s in-development Dream Chaser Cargo System, SNC will study and refine a flexible architecture that utilizes three to four commercial launches to construct a small, modular, long-duration habitat. “This program is a perfect opportunity to showcase the heritage of our 25 plus years supporting space missions,” said Mark Sirangelo, vice president of SNC’s Space Systems business area, in a statement. “This habitat will combine our experience in space technologies, satellite systems, propulsion and environmental control system from our subsidiary ORBITEC, as well as our work with the Dream Chaser spacecraft under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) and Cargo Resupply Services 2 (CRS-2) contract to support the International Space Station.” According to SNC, while details will depend on final contract negotiations, the company’s proposed habitat also includes: significant pressurized volume for long-duration human activity, docking capabilities with NASA’s Orion spacecraft and other systems, life support and environmental control, airlocks, crew health monitoring and support systems, and propulsion systems for transportation as well as maneuverability. As far as propulsion, Aerojet Rocketdyne is working with SNC to produce a fully-functional prototype PowerTrain solar electric propulsion system (SEP). “We look forward to working with our industry partners on an architectural study for a habitat system that will allow humans to live in space farther from Earth and for longer durations than ever before,” Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO and President Eileen Drake said in a press release. The PowerTrain SEP is designed to deliver power from solar arrays to thrusters on the spacecraft using peak-power a tracking capability that is compatible with current as well as future advanced Hall-effect thruster systems. The company already built and tested a prototype of the system last year, 2015. NanoRacks Image Credit: NanoRacks NanoRacks is part of a team of companies called the Ixion Initiative Team and includes NanoRacks, Space Systems Loral, and the United Launch Alliance (ULA). Their project includes a feasibility study on the conversion of rocket upper stages into habitats. It is seen as a potentially more affordable and less risky pay than fabricating modules on the ground before sending them to orbit. The goal would be to demonstrate the conversion of a Centaur rocket upper stage that could be attached to the International Space Station. “Our plan is to dramatically lower the proposed costs for habitats to allow for the largest customer base, both commercial and government,” said Jeffrey Manber, CEO of NanoRacks, in a press release. “With Loral and NanoRacks working together, we have the knowledge base to assure a solid commercial use of tomorrow’s habitats via re-purposed ULA Centaur platforms.” NanoRacks already does commercial work on the space station. The company has sent and deployed over 130 satellites from the ISS and visiting vehicles. After proving the concept in LEO, the Ixion Team believes future habitats from this approach could be used to create deep space habitats from any future rocket upper stages including the Space Launch System. Commercial Investment The first NextSTEP selections occurred in 2015 and included Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, and seven other companies. They were tasked with advancing concept studies and technology development projects in areas of advanced propulsion, habitation and small satellites both for deep space and LEO. This current round will attempt to use commercial investment that could ultimately lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions near the moon, which is expected to serve as the “proving ground” for NASA’s Journey to Mars. It is hoped that those missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment, while still being close to Earth. According to Space News, many of the concepts put forward by the companies could be re-purposed as commercial space stations. At least one company, Bigelow, already has plans to develop stations with or without NASA help. XBASE was announced in April 2016 as a potential addition to the ISS to be utilized by both NASA and other commercial entities. Tagged: Bigelow Boeing Lead Stories Lockheed-Martin NanoRacks NASA NextSTEP-2 Orbital ATK Sierra Nevada Corporation Derek Richardson Derek Richardson is a student studying mass media with an emphasis in contemporary journalism at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. He is currently the managing editor of the student run newspaper, the Washburn Review. He also writes a blog, called Orbital Velocity, about the space station. His passion for space ignited when he watched space shuttle Discovery leap to space on Oct. 29, 1998. He saw his first in-person launch on July 8, 2011 when the space shuttle launched for the final time. Today, this fervor has accelerated toward orbit and shows no signs of slowing down. After dabbling in math and engineering courses in college, he soon realized that his true calling was communicating to others about space exploration and spreading that passion.

Reply Brian Breitag August 15, 2016 9:12 am And no mention of artificial gravity, incredible. Reply Jeffrey August 15, 2016 3:21 pm Remember when they were going to try to convert the Space Shuttle’s external fuel tank into space habitat modules? It looks like Nanoracks is going to try to start that idea back up. I wonder what the decontamination process would look like when trying to clean up the unused fuel left in the tank. Do you just launch an internal skin separately and inflate it inside of the tank so you don’t have to worry about cleanup? Reply Dick Eagleson August 16, 2016 12:03 am The Centaur runs on liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, neither of which are going to leave any sort of “bathtub ring” that has to be scrubbed off. Just open the purge valves and wait awhile. Reply SC September 8, 2016 5:20 pm Hello. Do not forget about the fire…..er…explosion hazard! Reply G. Papadatos November 3, 2016 8:17 am I’ve just read this article, in early November. I look forward to reading what has happened since this article was posted (in August). I don’t think cleaning up unused fuel inside a used rocket upper stage will be a big problem. If the fuels used were liquid oxygen, hydrogen, or methane, then venting the tank will allow those substances to simply boil away into space, leaving nothing behind. I don’t think LEO or cislunar space is quite cold enough for solid oxygen to form, and it’s definitely not cold enough for solid hydrogen. I’m not sure about methane or kerosene, though. What I wonder is how anybody can attach or install usable airlocks or docking modules to a structure that doesn’t already have them, and wasn’t designed for them.

By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on August 13, 2016 The end of the hydrocarbon/fiat currency world or magnificent video fakery, Keshe device heads by backroads to White House confrontation By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor The device you are seeing, done by one of five teams testing new Keshe technology to end all dependence on wind, solar and nuclear energy, oh yes, we mean oil and coal too, is, if we can believe our eyes, powering enough appliances to run an entire house. Bari murder suspect photographed in Paris There are issues here that tie to secret societies, police informants and “crisis actor” recruiters, the terror attacks in Paris and a “Boston brakes” murder in Italy only a few weeks ago, but we are getting ahead of ourselves. The video above was requested by me after seeing the first one where everything was on a table. I am the kind of person who believes people will do anything for attention including drill holes and hide wires. I was raised “bad.” There is a massive effort out there to discredit Keshe technology as “fantasy” even though DARPA and Boeing are confirmed to be getting excellent results using Keshe MagRav units they hope will power naval vessels. Rumor has it that Boeing has a Keshe powered drone circling the planet now running on “fantasy.” This second video could be faked too so we have a well known Washington law firm aided by top scientists, doing their own. A little snip here, it seems “top scientists” are all to familiar with the technology being used. I then ask myself, if they knew about this all along, technology valued now (in a written offer I have seen from the government of China) at $1.5t, why didn’t they take the money? VT Science Editor and particle physicist Jeff Smith says that this is the coverup of all time, that as far back as 1880, according to his research in the secret archives of the US Department of Energy, everyone knew electricity was free. Then we go back to the real or imagined discussion between Tesla and financier (read criminal) J.P. Morgan. Tesla had, if the story is accurate and we believe it is, just told Morgan he was looking for financing in order to set up a worldwide grid for the delivery of wireless electrical power…through the air. Morgan’s answer: “Can we put a meter on it?” As history shows us, Tesla was crushed, his inventions claimed by Edison and hydrocarbon slavery has ruled the world.  A century later 17% of the world has no electricity whatsoever and 38%, according to World Energy Outlook, and powerplant projects, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, are mysteriously crushed, IMF roadblocks or the “unseen hand.” Organizing and financing these is not only frustrating but it can be bad for your health as well, if you get what I am not saying, personal experience here in a dozen countries. We are noting a ground wire being used and note that devices in the loop, the refrigerator compressor in particular, have capacitors in the circuit. What you see in the video is now loaded into the back of a rusty pickup truck and heading across Kentucky, into Ohio, then Pennsylvania, down into Maryland and into the District of Columbia. For those of you who don’t know of Keshe, I will keep this short. He was born in Iran, trained as a nuclear engineer in Britain and worked for their power company until recruited by the Ministry of Defense for some unknown reason. Keshe left the MOD and went on his own, announcing astounding technology. Britain tried to bring him back into the fold, inviting him to a private “show and tell” at a “pre-day” for the Farnborough Air Show, a major defense exhibition. Oddly, I was in attendance that day as well, a curious coincidence. Keshe then received an invitation through the Belgian Royal family. There, a group of human barnacles attached themselves to him, members of a pedophile ring working with Belgian police, all Freemasons. The head of the group runs an anti-Keshe website and, according to French intelligence sources, is directly tied to terror recruiting for the recent Paris attacks including the Bataclan holocaust. Here he is “burned” Working with them is another “anti-Keshe blogger” out of Paris who claims to be a journalist. Our sources, highest level, say this is a police informant, a Tunisian, who “shops” activists to the police and helped recruit the Bataclan killers. The police are protecting him and may well have killed one of their own to protect his role in the Hebdo incident as well. The entire group ties together with a network of bogus companies in Paris controlled by Freemasons, companies which all tie to a shady Brussels “investment bank.” Quickly finishing up the Keshe background; when Keshe turned out to be uncooperative even after threats, local police, off duty of course, in Belgium tried to run Keshe and his wife off the road, mind you while firing their service weapons at him like something out of a TV show. Keshe then left for Italy where he remains. However, a few weeks ago, 24 year old Fabio Alonzo and his fiance, Natalie, were run off the road by 3 semi-trailer trucks driven by Albanians who were allowed to flee Italy without questioning. When private forensic investigators were hired to review the scene, local police threatened Keshe. Fabio is dead, after what appears to be more of a beating with a tire wrench than car accident. Natalie is in a coma under police protection, for what that is worth. Sources (highest) at a NATO counter-terrorism organization opened their files for us. Local police in Bari, Italy, where the accident occurred, run the smuggling port there, part of a Mafia organization, and are contracted with ISIS through the Tunisian consulate in Milan (and Israeli intelligence). Milan makes documents to move Tunisian “refugees,” read “terrorists” into Italy under special arrangement between the two countries, who are then given instant citizenship in the EU through the Milan document factory. Then the terror cells, with perfect papers and weapons, travel this “ratline” to Paris and beyond, ready to bring down the EU. Who are the players here? Who do you think? As this moves on and on, our young man is still in his truck, picking up a security detail now, heading into Eastern Ohio. For those who saw the video, did he hide a power cable under his walkway or is this going to mean and end to it all? Please remember, nobody involved in this is an expert and certainly no one has the power to oppose the incredible forces arrayed to crush what we hope is the first pure “more than simple over-unity” power system. _____________ Related Posts: ANNOUNCEMENT: Keshe to make birthday gift to mankind, August 2nd NEWS FLASH!

Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 18, 2016 at 8:05 pm The Keshe demos & meetings in Washington DC were successful — but nowhere near as successful as Keshe & Co. credibly expect to be in very near future — with U.S. military, U.S. industry, U.S. media & U.S. consumers (who are tired of paying big bucks for electricity that can be cheap if not free). Mehran T. Keshe himself spoke & answered questions at the National Press Club via video conferencing. The video of this event is or will be at Keshe Foundation website. Keshe staffers will soon return to Wash DC to do additional presentations & demonstrations of Keshe energy, medical & other tech — with smaller & more advanced stand-alone devices soon to be available. Veterans Today & other media will soon post additional articles, audio & video about these events and additional Keshe tech. Keshe staffers recently achieved major advances in Washington DC, Arizona, Iran, Syria, Russia, Italy, Ghana & China. More advances & tech coming soon — to a home near yours. For +/-$100, you too can build some Keshe tech. Simple blueprints/plans available at the Keshe site.

If Keshe Tech is really true, i think his doing the rigth regarding strategic/politics. He is using the Internet , another invention, but it mostly used protocol , the HTTP, created in early 90s. Using Internet to widespread his Tech , giving the blueprints freely to everyone who has access to the Internet, we will reach a point that everyone will know about Keshe, it´s the viral effect of Internet.

Log in to Reply nawlins  August 15, 2016 at 6:58 am Any boy scout who has built a home-made crystal set knows that you can get electricity (a small amount) over the air. The idea was to get electricity of sufficient current to do useful work. Tesla could do this, but since the earth was the returning conductor it tended to have side-effects, such as the grains of sand arcing under your feet as you walked as you got close to his tower. As for this stuff, I think most of your commenters do not realize this is an amplification device, not a source generator. I will still go with the Aussies design. It is clunky and doesn’t put out great gobs of power, but it is completely independent and it is as reliable as an electric motor. What’s more, it’s output is mechanical. Log in to Reply markurban  August 15, 2016 at 6:32 am You would think that a simple, well laid out diagram with decent instructions would be available. I would love to see a simple proof of concept schematic we could all use to build the mechanism. Years ago I saw a video of a green sprite bottle producing varying amounts of voltage as time passed. The device in the above video appears to be putting out 120 volts ac at an amperage necessary to power household appliances. That is quite a leap forward. By my estimation, you could put the above device in the trunk of a Tesla P85D and lock the steering wheel so it would make a decent size turning circle and switch the car on autopilot and watch it run until either the tires went flat or the suspension parts wore down to the point of failure. Somebody has to contact Elon and make it so!

Log in to Reply Todd Marshall  August 14, 2016 at 11:20 am What a silly video! With the obvious questions everyone should have (what does the circuit look like; what is known about the principles involved), why all the nonsense of hanging all the loads on it. Why shooting the temperature of the wires (is that to prove the so-called “nano coating” is delivering zero resistance?). And my most obvious question: Why is this thing putting out 120VAC at 60 Hz? Log in to Reply jamesjohnson  August 14, 2016 at 11:36 am I think the grid input of 120 vac is the trigger voltage, not the source of the current output. e.g., 10 watts in 1000 watts out. RogerBall1962  August 14, 2016 at 2:16 pm Silly video and silly people who do not understand fundamental electrical principles, you are right Todd Marshall. The Facebook crowd is taking it hook, line and sinker. Keshe has some insight into plasma fields, and quantum physics is starting to explain gravity and superconductivity, like graphene (which will indeed change our lives) but the fact remains that the Keshe Foundation is recalling every generator they ever sold. Wish VT would recall every article they wrote about science, aliens and the metaphysical. Hard to believe that investigative minds can be so ignorant. Displaced envy again I guess. Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 14, 2016 at 2:39 pm Todd: Your questions are silly. For such a serious subject, the video is amateur — but certainly not silly. IF it works, who cares WHY it works? Although I am curious about the technologies, design & construction, my primary question is WHETHER it works. Conventional physics & EE does not explain it. James & Todd: Your question about 120VAC is interesting. We’ll probably find out the answer to the 120VAC question before or during the Keshe demos in Washington DC. Regardless, this is a Keshe generator (not the earlier Keshe device with which you might be familiar) — which does NOT require any electrical INPUT. Zero volts, zero amps & zero watts input — with 4,000 watts at 120VAC output. If true, that’s impressive. Jeff Smith  August 14, 2016 at 3:29 pm Good question. In mode one it is a poly phase toroidal current transformer that stores excess magnetic energy by spinning the magnetic field. Only poly or more than one phase currents can do this. This is done by using a split phase capacitor to kick start it with single phase 110 volt ac systems. The original device was designed by Tesla and was use to balance peak loads in electrical street car systems. Circa 1900. In this mode very large units will store excess energy from the grid at night when load is at a minimum and return it during the day. Thereby allowing utilities to double there daytime output capacity with no new infrastructure costs. In mode two it draws linear wave radiated from high voltage power line and acts as a tuned Tesla radiant energy system. 30% of all power line energy is lost by linear wave radiation. The device just simply tunes into the wasted energy field and returns it to the customer wirelessly. All HV power lines are basically Tesla transmitters emiting linear electrostatic waves. RogerBall1962  August 14, 2016 at 10:07 pm VT keeps ‘moderating’ my comments out. You are absolutely right Todd.

Dean, Managing Editor  August 14, 2016 at 9:52 am There is one down side to this “area” which a friend outside of Palm Springs exposed me to. Some of the less expensive bedroom communities near there had jumped on board putting the investment into solar with the buyback guarantee and price from the city utility. But so much is being produced for buy back now that the city can no longer afford it and cut the pay rate by 60%, protected by a clause where they can’t be sued. With the Keshe technology being affordable and not dependent on recovering high start up cost where “buy back” is needed. So there appears to be a market to replace solar, or be used as a co-generating system so those who have solar and can sell back into the grid and and recoup their investment much faster. This leaves room for “installers” to make a living doing this for people, which could be a nice cottage industry for middle class workers.

I thought it was going to go a few years ago when Mazda built prototype RX8’s that burned hydrogen in a a rotary engine. The “exhaust” is water! Mazda was “convinced” to abandon their plans but it worked just fine. I searched Keshe MagRav and found plenty of hits. One very interesting story reported an application of Keshe MagRav technology was from March 24, 2015. It is here: http://beforeitsnews.com/eu/2015/03/how-the-new-iranian-russian-technology-magrav-checkmates-the-us-navy-2580478.html “How the New Iranian-Russian Technology “Magrav” Checkmates the US Navy” I’m not familiar with the site and the source of the story came from whatdoesitmean.com and they are kind of “out there” but if true then Mr Keshe’s work might have already saved humanity last year.

Hate to be a naysayer, but unless proven otherwise, I say you’re right on the puzzling source of AC current. Also, the gauge of the power (source) wire seems awfully thin considering all the amperage gobbling appliances hooked up to it. In addition, I can’t see how the ground connection (and the earth ground itself) could absorb enough current to make all this run so smoothly as it appears. Also don’t understand the need for pliers on the outlet strip switch, since those type of breaker switches normally require someone to reset them manually. I’ll admit I don’t a degree in electrical engineering, but have worked and played with electricity enough to know when something doesn’t add up. I would love to see someone prove me wrong, but please, do it in a clear way that is both understandable and plainly evident. A maze of wires, a loud hairdryer running in the background and a shaky video don’t make for a clear presentation in my view. I want to learn like the rest of us but understand in doing so I have to weed out the “chaff” at the same time. Log in to Reply Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 13, 2016 at 3:37 pm Toby: The Keshe device was designed & built to generate 120V AC (alternating current). Otherwise, the refrigerator & some of the other devices would not work. The Keshe device is straight from original Maxwell equations (NOT modified & truncated by Heaviside) — most of which no one can find, but the Russians have them (captured in Germany at WW2’s end). NO conventional scientist or EE will understand Keshe tech — including you.

It is a basic property of all waves and cannot be circumvented. This can be easily deduced from his promise to build a narrow beam (1 micron) capable of destruction at 250 miles. No laser nor any other entity may be used in that manner. Appart from diffraction athmospheric turbulence and fluctuations add to the difficulties. But he was a truly great inventor and all inventors make mistakes and learn from them. Had he ever had a go at it he would have learnt and discarded it. The free energy idea is based on a basic misunderstanding of quantum mechanics and in particular how to deal with the energy concept with respect to atoms. Zero-point energy is not accessible for extraction only differences relative to excited energy states. Tesla wasnt young when quantum mechanics came along and he read too much into it. He would have changed his mind if he had dealt more with it and interacted with those in the know. Still no free lunch folks!

Emma Yacht  August 13, 2016 at 12:40 pm Currently it’s possible that only those who continue to pay their loyalty dues to the matrix are allowed to go “off the grid”; and that to go off the Grid/matrix, one has to continue to pledge allegiance to certain covenants, regardless. In this fractal greenscreen of the matrix (why are grass and trees green? why is chlorophyll green? It’s easier to do a greenscreen projection, as in the movies), humans seem to have been pledged to certain monopolies. If were to all wake up and, together, state our declaration for a better deal, that would be a different story, sort of like the Indians did with Custer.

Have American scientists developed the most dangerous nuclear weapon ever produced? A NUCLEAR smart bomb developed by the US is so accurate presidents might be tempted to use it, experts claim. By SIMON OSBORNE PUBLISHED: 03:13, Mon, Aug 15, 2016 | UPDATED: 07:46, Mon, Aug 15, 2016 REVEALThe B61-12 The B61-12 bomb, described as the most dangerous ever produced, features a tail kit from aircraft manufacturer Boeing which will enable a precision-guided trajectory. It also has a mechanism that enables an adjustment of the explosive force – ranging from a high of 50,000 tons of TNT to a low of 300 tons - and can be delivered by stealth jet bomber. Military experts believe the weapon's accuracy and variable power reduces the risk of collateral damage and potential widespread civilian casualties. Related articles Russia says US is now MORE likely than ever to use a nuclear bomb Solar storm 'almost sparked WORLD WAR THREE and nuclear devastation' GETTYArchive image of a nuclear explosion General James Cartwright, the retired commander of US Strategic Command, told America's PBS News: "If I can drive down the yield, drive down the likelihood of fallout, does that make it more usable in the eyes of a president or national security decision-making process? "The answer is yes, it likely could be more usable." But this has led to a number of former and current senior US defence officials voicing concerns that the precise nature of the weapon could provide a rationale for its future use in conflict. GETTYB2 stealth bomber The US National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) confirmed the development and testing phase of the B61-12 had been completed and the production engineering phase was now under way. Full-scale production is expected by 2020. NNSA Administrator Lieutenant General Frank G. Klotz said: "Reaching this next phase is a major achievement for NNSA and the exceptionally talented scientists and engineers whose work underpins this vital national security mission."

Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz said: "These life extension programs directly support President Obama's directive to maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent, while reducing the size of the stockpile. "Once completed, the B61-12 LEP will allow for the retirement of the B83-1— the last megaton-class weapon in America's nuclear arsenal while supporting the nation's continued commitment to our national security and that of our allies and partners."

(Photo: David J. Phillip / AP file photo) United Continental Holdings Inc. won approval for a new contract with flight attendants and reached an “agreement in principle” with mechanics, setting the stage for labor peace for the first time since the 2010 merger that created the airline. The Association of Flight Attendants voted 53 percent in favor of a five-year pact that raises top pay rates as much as 31 percent, according to a joint statement with the carrier Friday. United also reached a proposed deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters covering 9,000 technicians and related employees, which will be voted on once the language is finished. The results bolster Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz’s strategy of winning over a disgruntled workforce, even if it means accepting higher costs. United reached new agreements or extensions of existing ones with pilots, ground workers and dispatchers during the past year. “Upon ratification, this will be the first time in almost a decade that all United work groups will have labor contracts in place,” Munoz said in a joint statement with the Teamsters. “When I took this job last year, I promised to turn the page and write a new chapter in our approach to labor and management relations at United,” he said in the statement with flight attendants. Flexible Scheduling Maximum pay for flight attendants with at least 13 years of experience will be set at $62 an hour, according to the contract ratified by the 25,000-member union. United had failed to reach a joint flight-attendant contract since its October 2010 merger with Continental Airlines. The new deal will allow the carrier to put attendants from United and Continental on the same planes for the first time. A combined group of flight attendants should give United more flexibility in scheduling, especially when a cabin crew runs up against federally mandated allowable work hours and must be replaced.Until now, for example, a Continental crew could only be replaced by another from the same predecessor airline. Attendants were further split by jet type. For example, Continental employees worked on Boeing Co. 737 jets, while United crews staffed jumbo 747s. Both camps got a piece of the 787 Dreamliner, with former Continental crews working on the first 25 to join the company’s fleet and United the next 25. Cost Increase Mechanics overwhelmingly rejected an earlier deal that would have given them a 25 percent raise, an average bonus check of $9,000 and other benefits, with 93 percent of voters opposing the company’s contract offer. While many analysts see the labor pacts generally as positive, the deals will boost costs significantly. JPMorgan Chase analyst Jamie Bakerin June estimated that the new agreements would increase United’s costs by about $900 million annually.Those expenses could hinder Munoz’s plan to find $3.1 billion in extra revenue or savings by 2018, analysts have said. Leaders of the flight attendants union overcame significant opposition over the past six weeks to get members to support the deal. Some from the Continental camp complained that the contract was more generous to United attendants because Continental workers have had a slightly higher wage scale in recent years. Other attendants wanted a signing bonus. The union countered that the airline would have offset any such provision with lower wages. 16 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2bg3KrZ TOP VIDEOS Pistons return to Detroit 2:35 American Center for Mobility breaks ground at historic Willow Run plant 2:42 Mary Barra, Michiganian of the Year 2:39 GM opens new Company Store at Renaissance Center 1:54 Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55

NASA is starting to… Ready to live in deep space? NASA is starting to develop habitats for our journey By Lulu Chang — August 13, 2016 12:24 PM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends We may not yet be able to live in deep space, but we can already check out our proposed accommodations, thanks to NASA’s plan to build deep space habitats here on Earth. It’s all part of the space agency’s latest project known as NextSTEP-2, which involves the selection of six U.S. companies “to help expand knowledge, commercial capabilities, and opportunities in space by developing full-sized ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats.” NASA says that the goal is to provide support for lengthier and more involved human space flight missions, which will lead to Mars missions. This will also advance commercial development of space while moving forward with deep space exploration capabilities. The result will be more extensive human space flight missions by the moon that will be the proving grounds for Mars. “The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit,” said Jason Crusan, Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA Headquarters. Related: NASA adds five novel ideas to its initiative to cut planes’ fuel usage in half An appropriate deep space habitat requires a few key components, including docking capabilities, environmental control and life support systems, and radiation mitigation and monitoring processes. By building the proposed habitats on Earth first, NASA and its partners will have the opportunity to evaluate the configurations and observe how the systems interact with one another. Additionally, tests can be run to determine the viability of the prototypes. Included in the six selected partners are major players like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which are designing various modules for space exploration and habitation. Based on its findings and those of its partners, NASA will determine its “acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space.” The current estimated budget for this research and development stands around $65 million, and hopefully, it’ll lead to the development of a real-life space habitat.

MATT YORK , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FILE PHOTO 1 of 2 In this Dec. 9, 2014, photo, Christine Anderson, executive director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority, poses for a photo at the end of the taxiway at Spaceport America in Upham, N.M. Anderson is resigning, saying she still believes in the commercial space industry and that Spaceport America has a role to play. Anderson announced her resignation in a memo sent Tuesday, July 19, 2016, to the authority's board of directors and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez.

New Mexico Spaceport Authority director Christine Anderson, who is resigning, said the spaceport is on the right track and she believes it will be a game changer for New Mexico. MATT YORK , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FILE PHOTO By SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF At what was once a remote desert outpost with spotty cell service and little infrastructure other than the shell of a quarter-billion-dollar futuristic hangar, Christine Anderson has watched the transformation of Spaceport America from her office window. The hangar sits just to the south, its patina metal paneling and glass walls rising from the valley floor. It’s Anderson’s favorite view. “I always get inspired,” she said of being at the spaceport. “It sounds so trite, ‘the dawn of the new space age,’ but you know it really is. I think it’s just going to be amazing what we in our lifetime get to see happening in this industry.” Even though commercial flights at Spaceport America have yet to begin, Anderson – executive director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority – says her job is done as the spaceport stands ready for anchor tenant Virgin Galactic and other companies working in the industry. Anderson announced her resignation this summer. Her last day is next week, and the search is underway for her successor. Anderson told The Associated Press the decision to leave was difficult but noted she initially signed up for only a year. She has served in the position now for more than five years. “I figured, ‘This sounds fun. Let’s see if I can help out for a year as part of the transition process,“’ she said. “Of course, I got so involved and so excited about the job and the commercial space industry that one year led to the next and the next and the next.” It hasn’t been easy. There were numerous contracts to manage during a rocky construction period. Then there were delays and other setbacks as Virgin Galactic worked to develop and test its spacecraft. Some state legislators called for pulling the plug, adding fuel to criticisms that the project – first initiated by former Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, and British billionaire Richard Branson – was a boondoggle. Anderson was grilled at legislative hearings. She held fast to the idea that the spaceport would be a game changer for New Mexico. “There are naysayers,” she said. “I think you just have to maintain the high road with all of that because it’s an important project, and with any new thing – this whole spaceport business is new – you just have to have patience.” Spaceport Authority board chairman Rick Holdridge praised Anderson after news broke of her resignation. He said she took a collection of contracts that were barely in place and built a fully functional spaceport. “I don’t think the people of New Mexico realize what she has done for the state,” he said. After beefing up its business plan more than a year ago, the spaceport has attracted new customers and hosted events for the public. The next open house will be in October. Officials also are in discussions with three major aerospace companies interested in using it as a testing ground. Many companies have nondisclosure agreements that prevent spaceport officials from talking about the projects being conducted at the facility, Anderson said. While the names may remain secret, Anderson said the effect on the bottom line is welcome. Spaceport America is on track this year to have three-quarters of its operating budget covered by revenues. Next year, that’s projected to be 90 percent. The goal is to have operations paid entirely by lease revenues and other user fees given that the state and taxpayers in southern New Mexico already have contributed about $220 million to construct what is the nation’s first purpose-built spaceport. Another six rocket launches are planned over the next six months, and the spaceport is readying to serve as a base for a major project with Boeing and the adjacent White Sands Missile Range as researchers work on a transportation system that can shuttle cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. After starting with little, Anderson said the spaceport is on the right track. “When I got here in 2011, it was a construction site. You couldn’t go out there without your hard hat on,” she said. “It was tough because it is in the middle of nowhere. We actually had to build a whole city in the middle of nowhere.” Stretching across 28 square miles of the Jornada del Norte desert basin north of Las Cruces, the spaceport also benefits from thousands of square miles of restricted air space belonging to the missile range. That remoteness is drawing customers, Anderson said. “They value the privacy and our airspace and our 24-7 security,” she said. “This is a competitive industry, and they’re doing a lot of aerospace testing that they don’t want other people to necessarily keep tabs on.” Anderson, who spent 30 years with the U.S. Air Force as a civilian before heading up the spaceport authority, said the one thing she’ll miss is being in the front row as the burgeoning industry grows. The tons of files and boxes of notes she has amassed have been handed down to her crew. “I thoroughly believe in the commercial space industry, and I think we’ve gotten to that place where we can pass the baton,” she said.

It was a seminal moment for women in the sciences. Many, at the time, predicted Ride’s breaking the “highest glass ceiling” as she exited Earth’s atmosphere would inspire more young women and quickly close the gender gap in the sciences. But a little more than 30 years later, women are still underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, fields. Ride’s flight did inspire a generation of women to pursue careers in the sciences, but it also left more work to be done. That is why, before her passing in 2012, she made it her life mission to help inspire young girls to go into the sciences. Most Popular 1 Donald Trump called son of slain SAPD Det. Benjamin Marconi,... 2 Exclusive: Accused cop killer Otis McKane married in San... 3 35-point monster whitetail buck shot by hunter near San... It is a mission and a passion that we share at Girls Inc. of San Antonio. For more than a decade, we have worked to help girls in our community be strong, smart and bold, building on the example set by pioneers such as Sally Ride and celebrating a new generation of women in science, including today’s astronauts. The issue is not only about curiosity in the subject matter, but also confidence in the skills needed to do the work. For girls, building self-assurance in their abilities in STEM areas early in their education is key because given the right tools, support and guidance, we know girls can change the world. But even today, too many girls don’t have the role models and mentors needed to cultivate and validate their interest in STEM fields. Women, who make up 47 percent of the American workforce, only make up 39 percent of chemists and material scientists. And they are only 17 percent of industrial engineers, 8 percent of electrical engineers and 7 percent of mechanical engineers. In higher education, the gap isn’t as stark but it still exists. Last year, for the first time ever, women in the U.S. were more likely to have a bachelor’s degree than men. But in the physical sciences and mathematics, women made up only 42 percent of the graduating students in 2014. They were only 20 percent of the students who earned engineering degrees, and only 18 percent of those who graduated with a computer science degree. Girls in early childhood and elementary school show the same interest and aptitude for math and science as boys. But study after study shows that the STEM breakdown starts in middle and high school. Part of the problem seems to be a lack of mentors and role models. Fortunately, this is something we can definitely change. Since 2009, Girls Inc. of San Antonio has partnered with Boeing to encourage girls to pursue science and math-based education and careers. The company provides funding for our girl-focused STEM programs and shares its people power through employees who volunteer as mentors. The company helped us launch our annual Girls Inc. science festival and our STEM Saturday programs, which foster girls’ interest in STEM fields through hands-on activities and interaction with women who have already broken through in STEM professions. Boeing’s investment in STEM activities where girls can ask questions, get involved and solve problems, can help develop enthusiasm for STEM fields. Last year, the company provided seed funding for Eureka! — our program that helps engage young women in STEM starting in the eighth grade and continuing through high school. This program provides continued support and mentorship as they grow up. Encouraging girls to be strong, smart and bold today will lead to a larger percentage of successful women in STEM fields tomorrow. As Ride showed, it takes more than just inspiration to help close the long-standing gap for women in the sciences. It takes hard work, sustained encouragement and help from forward-looking private sector partners such as Boeing to make progress. Lea Rosenauer is president and CEO at Girls Inc. San Antonio.

The 86-ton antennas, which the Hawthorne, Calif.-based company acquired from NASA’s KennedySpaceCenter at Cape Canaveral, will be used to track flights of the crewed version of SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft from Cape Canaveral to the International Space Station, probably in 2017. The company already has made multiple cargo runs between Earth and ISS using its uncrewed Dragon capsules, driven into space by the company’s Falcon 9 rockets. In 2012, SpaceX became the first private company to rendezvous with ISS. SpaceX and Boeing both have contracts to fly crews to ISS. Since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, NASA has depended on Russian Soyuz flights to get astronauts to ISS. As one of the contract’s “milestones,” NASA requires SpaceX to track the flights from ground stations at various locations, thus the Boca Chica antennas. sclark@brownsvilleherald.com A more complete version of this story is available on www.myBrownsvilleHerald.com Discuss Print Posted in Local News on Saturday, August 13, 2016 10:16 pm.

The world's fastest-growing major aviation market is grappling with a paucity of traffic controllers to meet growing demand, as many of them shun employment with the state-run Airports Authority of India, where starting monthly salaries can be as low as $250, and choose monetarily rewarding jobs with private airlines. Photographer: Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg Profit up at Etihad Indian partner Jet August 13, 2016 Updated: August 13, 2016 07:24 PM Topics: Etihad Airways Frank Kane India airline Jet Airways, a member of the Etihad Airways partnership, reported a surge in operating profit in the first quarter of the 2016-17 financial year, but warned intense competition in the air travel market would continue into the second half. The operating profit leapt by 124 per cent to US$33 million in the three months to June end for India’s second-largest carrier, boosted by a jump in the number of passengers and revenue delivered by its Etihad connection. Naresh Goyal, the chairman, said: "Jet Airways has strengthened its core operations and achieved better capacity utilisation and greater efficiency. We have been able to report lower non-fuel costs in spite of inflationary increases and the almost 6 per cent weakening of the Indian rupee against the US dollar." The strategic partnership with Etihad continues to be strong, he said. Code-share traffic delivered by Etihad and its other partner airlines to Jet grew by 41 per cent, while revenue from the Etihad alliance was up by 38 per cent. Mr Goyal, however, pointed to a tightening of aviation market conditions, which has put profits under pressure for American and European airlines. "Because of the intense competitive environment, industry yields were under pressure in the first quarter and the trend is expected to continue in the second." At the net level, profit fell to $19m compared with $33m last year, when there was an exceptional item on account of a contribution from aircraft lessors, the results stated. James Hogan, the vice chairman of Jet Airways and chief executive of Etihad Aviation Group, said: "Jet Airways is a key player in the Indian aviation market offering a full service product and a robust network. "We will continue to strengthen the partnership between Jet and Etihad by driving further synergies, along with other partner airlines. In a competitive market, we have together created a winning combination of a wider combined network and exceptional guest experience for travellers to and from India. "Jet continues to grow its traffic over the Abu Dhabi gateway, complementing the Etihad Airways network. "Together, we are the largest combined scheduled operator of flights to and from India with a 20 per cent market share. Our robust partnership continues to go from strength to strength," he said. Jet’s focus is on operational efficiency, reducing costs per available seat kilometre by 7 per cent and increasing aircraft use across its fleet of Boeing 737s to among the highest levels in the industry. Its passenger numbers increased by 4.4 per cent to 6.6 million. The UK’s Brexit vote, economic worries, fears of terrorist attacks and over-capacity on some transatlantic routes have all led to an increasingly negative view among investors on the big global airlines. Airberlin, another Etihad partner, last week announced widening losses and ongoing restructuring as terrorist attacks in Europe discouraged air travel in "challenging and volatile" conditions. Its second-quarter loss totalled €62.7m (Dh257m) before interest and tax, up from €15.9m in the comparable period last year. fkane@thenational.ae Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Super Hornet fighter jets order for Canadian military Maiden Airbus A350-1000 flight set for tomorrow Abu Dhabi Airports all geared up for F1 fans deluge Emirates A380 blossoms at Dubai Miracle Garden – video MOST VIEWED Business | All RAK opens unique Via Ferrata on Jebel Jais, the UAE’s highest mountain BlackBerry Dtek60 review: Phone maker returns to the fray Database for Dubai buildings set to complete next year Dubai granted land decree a catalyst for city building, says official Maiden Airbus A350-1000 flight set for tomorrow Can Dubai property owner terminate deal with real estate agency for not fulfilling duties?

Share story This week, let’s look at the state in the Pacific Northwest with one of the nation’s best economies, where its biggest city is seeing the country’s fastest housing-price appreciation — and no, this is not about Washington. Welcome to Oregon, 2016. With its dependence on durable-goods manufacturing and housing, Oregon suffered in the Great Recession. In May 2009, the unemployment rate nearly touched 12 percent, a high not seen since the nasty downturn of the early 1980s. Fast forward to this year. In May its unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, the lowest since modern record keeping began in the 1970s. June’s rate ticked up 0.3 points, a modest rise signaling discouraged workers re-entering the rising labor force.

By contrast, Washington’s June unemployment rate stood at a seasonally adjusted 5.8 percent. Nationally, unemployment was 4.9 percent in June. Other yardsticks are impressive, too. The state’s labor force is at a record high and jobs are keeping pace with population growth. Real gross domestic product rebounded early past its pre-recession peaks and has reached new records, too. It grew by 3.9 percent in the first quarter, tied with Washington and Arkansas for the fastest growth in the nation. According to the Census Bureau, real median household income shot up to $58,875 in 2014, the latest year for which data are available. That’s just shy of Washington’s number. It’s a convergence not seen since the end of the 1990s boom; historically Oregon trailed Washington. Nationally, median household income was $53,657. It’s also worth noting that while income for Oregonians hit a record in 2014, Washington was down nearly $9,800 from its peak in 1998. The epicenter of the Oregon boom is Portland, which has seen the hottest housing market in the nation for months. Last year, 11 percent of the metropolitan workforce was in advanced industries, the 15th strongest out of 100 metros nationally. This is no longer simply “the city where young people go to retire,” if it ever was. I don’t want to compare apples and cattle. Washington and Oregon share many characteristics but are not economic twins. Oregon is less populous, 4 million in 2015, vs. 7.1 million for Washington. Although Portland is nearly as large as the city of Seattle (632,309 vs. 684,451 in 2015), metro Seattle is much larger. The Seattle area also boasts two of the most valuable companies in the country, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as such major headquarters as Starbucks, Nordstrom, Weyerhaeuser and Expedia. It is home to one of the nation’s leading public universities, a major biomedical cluster and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. And don’t forget Boeing and the aerospace sector. Portland lost container shipping service while Seattle and Tacoma remain major seaports. Beyond Nike and Columbia Sportswear, PDX’s headquarters are less well known. Its big deal is semiconductor engineering and manufacturing, especially with Intel and its approximately 19,500 workers. But this undersells a shift in Silicon Forest to a constellation of younger homegrown tech companies, according to a 2014 report in The Oregonian. Like Seattle, Portland has also been a beneficiary of Silicon Valley companies opening outposts there. It’s more affordable than the Bay Area, but growth and rapidly rising house prices are causing local angst (sound familiar?). The housing-cost problem is made worse by the little new construction seen after the recession. So, what’s driving Oregon’s economy? Population growth is a big factor, especially of college-educated young people. Job increases are broad-based, but especially in health care, business and professional services, and leisure and hospitality. Still, the state has a history of volatility, especially in construction and manufacturing jobs, including those connected to chipmaking. In May, Intel warned employees they could see more layoffs if enough don’t take buyouts. Which state has the better wine? That’s beyond my tippling expertise: I enjoy both. Like all states, Oregon shows sharp differences among its regions, especially between metro and rural areas. For example, nonmetro areas in southern Oregon “still have a long way to go to regain all of their lost jobs,” according to Josh Lehner, an economist in the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, who writes an illuminating blog on the state economy. Most of rural Oregon is growing again but still suffers from the decline of the timber industry that started in the 1980s. The population is older and less likely to be of prime working age. On the other hand, nearly all of the state’s counties have seen population growth. The resort-retirement area of Bend, savaged by the housing crash, is booming again. Without the cushion of the Puget Sound aerospace cluster, Oregon manufacturing remains weak. Among its head winds are loss of demand for material in the Oil Patch because of falling petroleum prices and a strong dollar. Job polarization — the loss of middle-wage jobs — is another common problem found in Oregon. For example, factory employment remains well below pre-recession levels. The workforce in accommodations and food services, which typically pays less, has been at record highs. Lehner told me the state’s fast growth should ease off as it reaches close to full employment. “The problem is the economy does not typically then transition down to something sustainable,” he said. “It slams down into recession and you start the cycle over. But we are approaching full employment and there aren’t too many worrisome things on the horizon at the moment.” You may reach Jon Talton atjtalton@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us National World US Elections Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos Director: New Mexico spaceport positioned for next frontier SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN13 August 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share View photos FILE - In this Dec. 9, 2014, file photo, Christine Anderson, executive director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority, poses for a photo at the end of the taxiway at Spaceport America in Upham, N.M. Anderson is resigning, saying she still believes in the commercial space industry and that Spaceport America has a role to play. Anderson announced her resignation in a memo sent Tuesday, July 19, 2016, to the authority's board of directors and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez. (AP Photo/Susan Montoya Bryan, File)More At what was once a remote desert outpost with spotty cell service and little infrastructure other than the shell of a quarter-billion-dollar futuristic hangar, Christine Anderson has watched the transformation of Spaceport America from her office window. The hangar sits just to the south, its patina metal paneling and glass walls rising from the valley floor. It's Anderson's favorite view. "I always get inspired," she said of being at the spaceport. "It sounds so trite, 'the dawn of the new space age,' but you know it really is. I think it's just going to be amazing what we in our lifetime get to see happening in this industry." Even though commercial flights at Spaceport America have yet to begin, Anderson — executive director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority — says her job is done as the spaceport stands ready for anchor tenant Virgin Galactic and other companies working in the industry. Anderson announced her resignation this summer. Her last day is next week, and the search is underway for her successor. Anderson told The Associated Press the decision to leave was difficult but noted she initially signed up for only a year. She has served in the position now for more than five years. "I figured, 'This sounds fun. Let's see if I can help out for a year as part of the transition process,'" she said. "Of course, I got so involved and so excited about the job and the commercial space industry that one year led to the next and the next and the next." It hasn't been easy. There were numerous contracts to manage during a rocky construction period. Then there were delays and other setbacks as Virgin Galactic worked to develop and test its spacecraft. Some state legislators called for pulling the plug, adding fuel to criticisms that the project — first initiated by former Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, and British billionaire Richard Branson — was a boondoggle. Anderson was grilled at legislative hearings. She held fast to the idea that the spaceport would be a game changer for New Mexico. "There are naysayers," she said. "I think you just have to maintain the high road with all of that because it's an important project, and with any new thing — this whole spaceport business is new — you just have to have patience." Spaceport Authority board chairman Rick Holdridge praised Anderson after news broke of her resignation. He said she took a collection of contracts that were barely in place and built a fully functional spaceport. "I don't think the people of New Mexico realize what she has done for the state," he said. After beefing up its business plan more than a year ago, the spaceport has attracted new customers and hosted events for the public. The next open house will be in October. Officials also are in discussions with three major aerospace companies interested in using it as a testing ground. Many companies have nondisclosure agreements that prevent spaceport officials from talking about the projects being conducted at the facility, Anderson said. While the names may remain secret, Anderson said the effect on the bottom line is welcome. Spaceport America is on track this year to have three-quarters of its operating budget covered by revenues. Next year, that's projected to be 90 percent. The goal is to have operations paid entirely by lease revenues and other user fees given that the state and taxpayers in southern New Mexico already have contributed about $220 million to construct what is the nation's first purpose-built spaceport. Another six rocket launches are planned over the next six months, and the spaceport is readying to serve as a base for a major project with Boeing and the adjacent White Sands Missile Range as researchers work on a transportation system that can shuttle cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. After starting with little, Anderson said the spaceport is on the right track. "When I got here in 2011, it was a construction site. You couldn't go out there without your hard hat on," she said. "It was tough because it is in the middle of nowhere. We actually had to build a whole city in the middle of nowhere." Stretching across 28 square miles of the Jornada del Norte desert basin north of Las Cruces, the spaceport also benefits from thousands of square miles of restricted air space belonging to the missile range. Read More That remoteness is drawing customers, Anderson said. "They value the privacy and our airspace and our 24-7 security," she said. "This is a competitive industry, and they're doing a lot of aerospace testing that they don't want other people to necessarily keep tabs on." Anderson, who spent 30 years with the U.S. Air Force as a civilian before heading up the spaceport authority, said the one thing she'll miss is being in the front row as the burgeoning industry grows. The tons of files and boxes of notes she has amassed have been handed down to her crew. "I thoroughly believe in the commercial space industry, and I think we've gotten to that place where we can pass the baton," she said.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 13, 2016 at 11:15AM Huntington Ingalls stock hit the iceberg after releasing earnings last week. And there are a few things you might want to know about why. Image SOURCE: Getty Images. In a week of strong earnings reports from American defense contractors, and reports generally well received by investors, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) stock stuck out like the proverbial sore thumb. And shareholders are probably pretty sore as well. After Huntington missed on revenues, and just barely beat estimates for earnings, Huntington shareholders saw their stock price sink 4%. But was Huntington's news really bad enough to justify the sell-off? To try to figure that out, we listened in on Huntington Ingalls' post-earnings conference call. Here are five things they told us that we thought you'd like to know. Thing 1: Inflection point? "While positive performance continues at Ingalls, we'll continue to see volume and margin pressure in Newport News as we focus on delivering the three aircraft carriers. With that said, we continue to expect total revenues in fiscal year 2016 to be relatively flat to 2015 and segment operating margin in shipbuilding to be in the 9% to 10% range." -- CFO Christopher Kastner Huntington has been warning for some time that the 11%-plus operating profit margins we've been seeing of late are not sustainable over the long term. 9% to 10% margins, says Huntington, are much more likely to be the norm over long periods of time. That time may be now. But have you ever wondered why? Thing 2: Get to know the business "I'd just remind you what we've said about the 9% to 10% range. If you are operating outside of that range for any period of time you have to ask yourself why. If you are above the range, it probably means that you have a lot of mature programs and you're harvesting pretty well, but the fundamental thing you need to be focused on is what's the new work?" -- CEO Mike Petters It's useful for Huntington Ingalls shareholders to know that management regards 9% to 10% profit margins to be its norm. That alone injects a note of caution into the decision whether to buy a stock that's suddenly become more profitable than we've been accustomed to seeing. What's even more useful, though, for investors who may own other defense stocks other than just Huntington Ingalls, is knowing why margins in this industry tend to revert toward certain levels -- and why deviations from that norm are temporary. Huntington Ingalls' CEO thus does us a useful service when he explains the dynamics: It takes a lot of work to develop a new type of warship (or a new stealth fighter jet, a new tank, or a new variety of ICBM). That extra work -- risk reduction, bug stomping, and supply line unkinking -- adds costs to a weapons system and depresses profit margins for its maker. But as a weapons system matures, and enters full-rate production, the profit margins from producing it may likewise improve. That very improvement in profits, however, may act as a harbinger of eventual declines in sales, as the weapon becomes obsolete, and approaches its retirement date. Good to know. Thing 3: Free cash flow "Capital expenditures were $48 million or 2.8% of revenues in the quarter compared to $29 million in the second quarter last year. Our capex spend is typically back end loaded for the fiscal year, so we continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be between 3.5% to 4.5% of revenues." -- Kastner Changing the subject abruptly, last week I dinged Huntington Ingalls for the lack of guidance on what to expect for its profits as this year rolls along. Let me walk back that chiding just a bit, though, based on this revelation. While Huntington Ingalls management hasn't provided investors complete guidance on its expectations for this year, it has at least told us something. Revenues, according to management, should be "relatively flat to 2015" -- so about $7 billion. At an operating profit margin of 9% to 10%, that works out to roughly $630 million to $700 million in operating profit this year. Meanwhile, analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence are still projecting operating cash flow of $740 million. Minus $280 million for CapEx (4% of $7 billion revenues), that leaves $460 million total free cash flow for the year. And now, with your forbearance, I'll abruptly change subjects once again, and turn to the broader prospects for defense spending as a whole. Thing 4: Where we're at with the defense budget "In Washington, House and Senate conferees have begun the process of reconciling FY2017 Defense Policy Bill and measured progress is also being made in the markup before consideration of respective appropriations bills. We are encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for Navy and Coast Guard shipbuilding programs in the various committee markups and bills. --Petters Revenues, management tells us, are likely to hold up pretty well through the rest of this year, relative to what we saw in 2015. Going forward, too, management seems confident that there is "strong bipartisan support" for continuing to give the Navy and Coast Guard the money they need, to buy the ships they need -- and the ships they intend to buy from Huntington Ingalls. That's good to know, but there's a caveat. Thing 5: "Sequester." Yes, that's still a thing "[We] remain concerned about the prospect of a long term continuing resolution as well as the implications of returning to a sequester top line for defense spending after the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ends. Given the Navy's firm commitment to funding the higher replacement program, a sequester top line would create significant funding challenges across the Navy's budget that could severely impact a broad array of shipbuilding and ship repair programs. --Petters Four years ago, a divided Congress still scarred by the trauma of the Great Recession decided to solve its budget problems by "splitting the baby." Congress enacted a "sequester" that reduced spending on both social programs and defense spending. Now, there's no guarantee that Congress will resort to such drastic action again. But Huntington Ingalls isn't taking anything for granted. Unless and until Congress passes a defense budget, and President Obama signs it, there's still a chance Congress will revisit sequester, and that this could damage business prospects for Huntington Ingalls, and for other defense contractors as well. By no means is this certain to happen, but there's a non-zero chance that it will. If you're contemplating an investment in a defense stock today, this is a risk you need to be aware of. Especially because of ... Bonus thing: Caveat investor "Quite frankly what we're dealing with today is that ... valuations are pretty high and ... it's kind of challenging given some of the valuations that are out there today that we could really make the case that we're such a better owner that we would create the value that we need to create." -- Petters About halfway through last week's earnings call, Petters was asked -- kind of out of the blue -- whether he had any plans to make acquisitions of other companies in the defense space. His response was something that might give investors pause. While Huntington Ingalls continues to feel its own stock is undervalued, as evidenced by the 239,000 shares of stock it bought back last quarter, the CEO is hard pressed to see similar value in other companies operating in the defense space. If you're contemplating an investment in Lockheed, in Boeing, or even in Huntington Ingalls itself, these are words worth considering. If the CEO of one of the nation's biggest defense contractors, a man who lives and breathes defense-stock valuations, cannot find much of anything worth buying at today's high prices, then what are you seeing that he's not?
