Rocket and Space Corporation Energia (RSC Energia) and Boeing have finally managed to reach a settlement over a sizeable $330 million debt incurred by the Russian company over the Sea Launch project. Russia's RSC Energia and US' Boeing have finally managed to hammer out a settlement following a lengthy litigation which began almost four years ago. "The settlement came into effect on February 22, and a joint claim was made by Boeing and RSC Energia on March 16. The California court made a final decision to end this litigation. The issue is now closed forever," Solntsev told RIA Novosti. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by Boeing. The goal of the project was to employ a mobile maritime launch platform to conduct commercial space launches from the equator which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. In 2009 Sea Launch Co LLC, the provider of the Sea Launch service, filed for bankruptcy, and in 2013 Boeing filed a lawsuit claiming that RSC Energia, PO Yuzhnoye and KB Yuzhnoye failed to reimburse Boeing for over $350 million paid to third-party creditors. On May 12, the US District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of Boeing, stating that Energia owed Boeing more than $320 million plus legal fees. According to Solntsev, both parties had to overcome numerous hurdles during the settlement negotiations but finally managed to reach a mutual compromise, and that the deal between Energia and Boeing will now allow the companies to engage in a number of joint ventures. "The details of these negotiations remain a commercial secret; what matters is that the partners were able to break the deadlock. We're now discussing ongoing and ambitious future joint projects, from trips to ISS to deep space flights, which would've been impossible without a settlement," he added. Solntsev also pointed out that the S7 Group which purchased the Sea Launch project, did not take part in the negotiations with Boeing and will not be making any payments to the US company.

Total revenue came in at $20.98 billion, a 7 percent drop from 1Q16. In the commercial aircraft division, revenue edged down 1 percent to $14.3 billion as fewer 737s were delivered. Boeing is transitioning to 737 MAX production, with entry into service of the new aircraft expected in May. The first quarter operating margin increased to 8.5 percent, from 7.2 percent, reflecting improved performance on production and services, the Chicago-based company said. Boeing took $27 billion of net orders in the quarter as the value of its backlog rose to $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the start of the period. The commercial aircraft division booked 198 net orders during the quarter, with the backlog now standing at more than 5,700 planes valued at $417 billion. Boeing’s chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said that milestones achieved during the quarter included certification of the 737 MAX 8 and first flight of the 787-10 Dreamliner. “We remain on track to achieve our full-year revenue, earnings and cash flow targets,” he said in a company statement. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft during the quarter, a drop of seven from last year. The 737 saw the biggest fall in deliveries as Boeing ramps up production of the 737 MAX. Wide-body deliveries were broadly similar to the first quarter 2016. Boeing maintained its 2017 delivery forecast of 760-765 commercial aircraft, and left its revenue guidance for that sector unchanged at $62.5 billion to $63.5 billion. Total revenue guidance is also unchanged at $90.5 billion to USD$92.5 billion.

Revenue fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion in the first quarter, about $200 million less than analysts had estimated. Weak sales overshadowed a surprise gain in free cash flow as the manufacturer kept costs in check and started to reap a long-awaited payoff from the 787 Dreamliner. The report spotlighted Boeing’s need to tamp down costs and make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn’t boost the cash outlook — a crucial number for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. “‘The stock has been a high flier for a while,” George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Wednesday. “People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report.” The shares dipped 1.5 percent to $180.73 before the start of regular trading in New York. Boeing rose 18 percent this year through Tuesday, the third largest gain among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The manufacturer plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing’s factories. It represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane’s manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what’s typically the company’s slowest period. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets, the fewest since the first quarter of 2014, as it began to stockpile 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. First-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up from a previous estimate of $9.10 to $9.30, mainly because of a reduction in the expected tax rate. “Although we don’t see investors giving Boeing much credit for a tax-driven EPS ‘beat and raise,’ we would expect there to be a positive response to the solid cash-flow performance in the first quarter, given historic seasonality,” Robert Stallard, an aerospace analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients.

It was a matter of remaining competitive in a harsh "business environment." And not only that, but "'fewer sales opportunities and tough competition' would drive further cuts in 2017." At the opening of the story, Gates wastes no time pointing out that no cuts are happening at Boeing's South Carolina plants. What he is really saying by this is: Unions are the real the problem here. Their demands are unrealistic, considering the harsh "business environment." But the workers in South Carolina, who recently voted not to unionize, are far more realistic about the business environment—they also believe that having a job is more important than having lots of benefits and cash (bosses really get hard when workers have this understanding, hands down). The realism of labor is finally in harmony with the realism of capital. But, of course, all this talk about competition and "sales opportunities" is complete nonsense, if you add an important factor that is completely missing in Gates's post but is indeed found in the Everett Herald's account of the current round of layoffs. It is buybacks. But what is this we are now talking about? And how does it have anything to do with making planes and profits? What we must always keep in mind during these times is this: Any explanation of a business environment or market (real estate, for example) that excludes finance (equity markets, bond markets, investment banks, interest rates, and the like) provides you as much useful information as the sight of a bear extinguishing a burning itch by rubbing its back on the bark of a tree. Buybacks are as real as the clap. And they represent, to use the words of Bill Lazonick—a real economist (meaning, he considers history and politics in his economic picture and theories)—the current model for big business in the US: downsize and distribute. A buyback is basically a company using its own money to purchase its own shares; this then reduces the number of the company's shares on the stock market and, as a consequence, increases the price of the remaining shares. This increase in effect transfers money from the company to the shareholders. As always, the business of buybacks began small. And the way shareholders mostly made money was through dividends—sharing of profits, if there were profits. These days, buybacks account for 54 percent of income for shareholders in the S&P 500. Back in the day (2000), companies annually spent $300 million on buybacks; now it is $4 trillion. Buybacks are the crack of corporate America. In the way a crackhead could use the dollars in his or her pocket to look for work or pay for a trip to school, the money used in buybacks might have been used for R&D or maintaining a happy, loyal and healthy workforce. Read this vivid account of the steps leading to Boeing's next big buyback (the plans for which were being made at the end of 2016), and please keep in mind this fact: between 2013 and 2016, Boeing had already spent an astounding $19 billion on buybacks: Boeing management thinks its stock is cheap and last week announced plans to buy back $14 billion worth of its own stock — roughly 15% of all shares outstanding. Can Boeing pay? Boeing cannot afford to buy back $14 billion worth of stock immediately. But despite its size, given enough time, this buyback is definitely within Boeing's reach. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing already has $9.6 billion in cash and short-term investments on its books. Granted, some of this money is needed to fund the company's ongoing operations. Granted, too, it's not entirely unencumbered cash — Boeing also carries $9.8 billion in long-term debt. But S&P Global data shows Boeing generating $8.15 billion in free cash flow annually. That money, combined with what Boeing already has in the bank, should suffice to fund the company's entire $14 billion buyback in less than a year — should Boeing decide to proceed with it. What does this have to do with making and selling airplanes? Nothing. And so any theory or explanation of value creation (as stated by the executives and parroted by Seattle Times) is worthless. What is needed is a theory of value extraction. 3 You might also be interested in these: Formerly Homeless Man Sues Seattle Police Officer Who Punched Him in the Face by Steven Hsieh What Would It Take?

Net income for the quarter ending March 31 rose 19 percent to $1.5 billion. But revenues fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion, below the $21.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company underperformed in terms of revenues. The firm has been trimming jobs in its civil aviation division due to slowing sales. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg pledged to have a “sharp focus on performance and productivity” to reach its financial targets. Boeing plans to cut hundreds of engineering jobs on June 23 and expects additional cuts by the end of the year. Since the start of 2017, it has eliminated 3,500 positions, or about 2.3 percent of its staff at the end of 2016. “We are having to deal with a lot of competitive realities in the marketplace,” Muilenburg said on a conference call. While Boeing has experienced net job loss, it has been adding some technology-oriented positions out of recognition that “we need to fuel the research and development for the future,” Muilenburg said. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft in the quarter, down seven from the same period of 2016. Commercial deliveries are closely scrutinized by Wall Street because of their connection to revenues. Boeing modestly increased its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents a share to a range of $10.35 to $10.55, citing a lower-than-expected tax rate. Muilenburg said he was encouraged that President Donald Trump had nominated two board members for the Export-Import Bank, which has been hamstrung due to a lack of a quorum following an effort by some in Congress to eliminate the bank. Muilenburg called the nominations “a very big step” and said he was hopeful “that soon we’ll see a fully operational board.” The Ex-Im Bank has sometimes been dubbed the “Bank of Boeing” because of its role in providing key financing to Boeing customers over the years to purchase aircraft. Boeing shares fell 1.0 percent to $181.71 in midday trading.

PROVIDED PHOTO Entertainment April 26, 2017 4:03 PM Players Centre stages French farce ‘Boeing Boeing’ By Marty Clear mclear@bradenton.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story France has given the world some of the greatest and most enduring plays, from “Tartuffe” and “Cyrano de Bergerac” to “Rhinoceros” and “No Exit.” But the French play that’s produced most often around the world is the 1960s farce “Boeing Boeing.” It’s next up at the Players Centre for Performing Arts in Sarasota. In America, more people probably know the story from the 1965 film version that starred Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis, but the play is performed often in regional theaters. It’s about a bachelor named Bernard who lives in Paris. He’s involved with three stewardesses whose schedules ensure that only one is in Paris at any given time. It’s complicated, but Bernard has it all worked out. But then his friend Robert comes to stay, and a new, speedier Boeing jet throws off Bernard’s intricate timing. All three stewardesses end up in town simultaneously, and Robert keeps forgetting which lies to tell to which stewardess. Playwright Marc Camoletti has had other international successes, including “Don’t Dress for Dinner,” which ran for seven years in London.

April 27, 2017 0700 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:191610 Publish Date: Wed, 26 Apr 2017 22:24:55 GMT Service: Iran Iran says early Boeing delivery cancelled Iran says a plan for the early delivery of a plane from US aviation giant Boeing has been cancelled and the plane will not be delivered before next spring. Farhad Parvaresh, the head of the country’s national flag carrier airline Iran Air, told the domestic media that Boeing had proposed to hand over a 777-300ER by summer after Turkish Airlines withdrew its order for it.      “We welcomed that proposal and started the due technical and commercial studies,” Parvaresh said. “However, when we were almost certain that we wanted the plane, it was no longer available.”    He said Iran Air had announced that it would only go ahead with purchasing the plane provided that it would be available. “We have currently stopped our negotiations in absence of the plane,” added the official.   Parvaresh further rejected speculations that Iran Air had come across financial difficulties and thus had cancelled the purchase of the plane.  Boeing has already signed a deal worth $16.6 billion to sell 80 planes to Iran Air. It has also signed a $3 billion deal to sell 30 planes to Iran's Aseman Airlines. Boeing’s biggest European rival – Airbus – has signed another deal estimated to be worth some $25 billion to sell above 100 planes to the same company. Airbus has so far delivered three planes to Iran and more deliveries are expected to be made in the near future. On 14 April, Parvaresh was quoted by media as saying that Boeing officials were in capital Tehran to discuss an earlier-than-expected delivery of the first plane.  He had emphasized that the proceedings to receive the plane would start provided that Iran Air conditions were met.  “We are currently discussing this matter with them (Boeing).  If Iran’s conditions are met, this plane would be most probably delivered to Iran within the next 45 days.”            KeyWords Iran Boeing plane   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News 8 border guards martyred in southeastern Iran Trade cooperation with Iran guarantees regional stability: Envoy in UK Iran says early Boeing delivery cancelled 8 border guards killed in clashes with outlaws in southeastern Iran Iran condemns Turkish air raid in Iraq’s Sinjar Iran in Syria at Damascus request, Lavrov tells Saudi FM Iran: Turkey’s air raid violates Iraq national sovereignty Zarif shrugs off Trump's remarks over nuclear deal Sport sciences seminar starts Pour-Mousavi: We will celebrate booking Round of 16 berth at home Most Visited Trump has 'dangerous mental illness,’ some experts say Trump orders review of US nuclear posture amid North Korea tensions US ground forces in Syria kill 'close associate' of Daesh leader www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1079 sec

Net income for the quarter ending 31 March rose 19% to $1.5 billion. But revenues fell 7.3% to $21 billion, below the $21.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company underperformed in terms of revenues. The firm has been trimming jobs in its civil aviation division due to slowing sales. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg pledged to have a "sharp focus on performance and productivity" to reach its financial targets. Boeing plans to cut hundreds of engineering jobs on 23 June and expects additional cuts by the end of the year. Since the start of 2017, it has eliminated 3,500 positions, or about 2.3% of its staff at the end of 2016. "We are having to deal with a lot of competitive realities in the marketplace," Mr Muilenburg said on a conference call. While Boeing has experienced net job loss, it has been adding some technology-oriented positions out of recognition that "we need to fuel the research and development for the future," Mr Muilenburg said. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft in the quarter, down seven from the same period of 2016. Commercial deliveries are closely scrutinized by Wall Street because of their connection to revenues. Boeing modestly increased its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents a share to a range of $10.35 to $10.55, citing a lower-than-expected tax rate. Mr Muilenburg said he was encouraged that President Donald Trump had nominated two board members for the Export-Import Bank, which has been hamstrung due to a lack of a quorum following an effort by some in Congress to eliminate the bank. Mr Muilenburg called the nominations "a very big step" and said he was hopeful "that soon we'll see a fully operational board." The Ex-Im Bank has sometimes been dubbed the "Bank of Boeing" because of its role in providing key financing to Boeing customers over the years to purchase aircraft. Boeing shares fell 1% to $181.71 in midday trading.

(AP Photo/Mic Smith) Aerospace blog Boeing sales fall, cuts may continue, shareholders get boost Dan Catchpole Wed Apr 26th, 2017 9:40pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Boeing executives won’t say how much longer they see the slow-motion job cutting continuing. The company cut its global workforce by 1,176 during the first three months of the year. Most of those cuts have come around the Puget Sound area, including nearly 500 layoff notices issued last week. Previously, Boeing executives have said they want to keep up the pace of job cuts in 2016, when they slashed nearly 11,000 jobs, mostly through buyouts and attrition. Company-wide efforts to cut labor and other costs contributed to Boeing posting better payouts to shareholders for the first quarter of 2017. Better earnings from the 787 Dreamliner program also boosted cash flow for the manufacturer. The bigger dividends came despite slumping sales and a drop in revenue to nearly $21 billion, about 7.3 percent less than the $22.6 billion revenue from first quarter in 2016. Revenue was about $200 million less than analysts expected for the U.S. planemaker, which plans on delivering the newest version of its best-selling airplane, the 737, in May. During a conference call with investment analysts and reporters Wednesday, Boeing Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg said the company is committed to maintaining the talent it needs, even as it cuts its workforce. While Boeing’s workforce has dropped overall, including 8,500 fewer jobs in Washington since the start of 2016, the company has hired more than 11,000 people in recent years, Muilenburg said. As Boeing grapples with declining revenues in the next few years, the priorities remain sending cash to shareholders and investing in future development, he said. During the call, he praised efforts by President Donald Trump and the Republican majority in Congress to simplify and lower corporate taxes and streamline federal regulations. “These are things that clearly are working to our benefit broadly as an industry,” he said. Wednesday’s earnings report highlights the Chicago-headquartered company’s need to continue squeezing costs and improving factory efficiency. The company increased how much it expects to earn this year due to paying fewer taxes, rather than an increase in revenue or other factors. “The stock has been a high flier for a while,” George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Wednesday. “People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report.” Production of the 787 could increase to 14 airplanes a month by the end of the decade. Company leaders had backed off that goal somewhat in public comments in 2016. However, during the teleconference, Muilenburg reiterated the goal of increasing production. “Our plan is still to go to 14 a month by the end of the decade,” up from the current rate of 12 a month, he said. Some industry analysts have said they expect the company to stay at the current rate or cut production. Production of the 777 is dropping to about 3.5 deliveries a month after August. No further cuts are planned, Muilenburg said. Next year, factory work is expected to pick up on 777X, successor to the 777, at Boeing’s Everett plant. Muilenburg seemed to imply but did not explicitly say that the 777X work will mean no net layoffs for the two aircraft programs. With each 787 Dreamliner that rolls out of the factory, Boeing continues to whittle down the mountain of money it previously sank into the program, which entered the market three years late because of production and supply-chain delays. The tally, known as deferred production costs, fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. Boeing executives are counting on a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as the company refines the plane’s manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. Increased cost on the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program slightly dampened profits for Boeing. The total was about $140 million more than expected, but that covers the rest of the year, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said. The company expects to start delivering the first tankers to the U.S. Air Force in early 2018. First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what’s typically the company’s slowest period. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets, the fewest since the first quarter of 2014, as it began to stockpile 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. First-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in a statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up from a previous estimate of $9.10 to $9.30, mainly because of a reduction in the expected tax rate. Material from Bloomberg was used in this report.

(Photo by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images) The Export-Import Bank of the United States -- informally known as the “Ex-Im Bank,” but irreverently referred to as “Boeing's Bank” behind closed doors -- is hosting a ritzy conference for power players in Washington this week. It's another exercise in willful deception. Bank beneficiaries and bureaucrats will attempt to conceal their blatant cronyism from the public with misleading platitudes about protecting U.S. exports, job creation, and in particular small businesses. Here's an example: “In FY 2013, Ex-Im Bank approved more than $27 billion in total authorizations to support an estimated $37.4 billion in U.S. export sales and approximately 205,000 American jobs in communities across the country. For the year, the Bank approved a record 3,413 transactions, or 89 percent, for small businesses.” Sounds pretty impressive, no? Americans know small businesses struggle in this uncertain economy, and are understandably inclined to view the bank’s operations in a more positive light when they hear statements like that. There’s one big problem: The claim is misleading. It's true that small businesses account for 89 percent of the total number of deals. But the value of those deals tells a different story. For fiscal year 2013, for instance, only $5.2 billion of the $27.3 billion in total authorization amounts, or 19 percent, was designated as “small business” activity on the Ex-Im Bank's annual report. The bank is also pretty fast and loose with its definition of “small business" to include manufacturing and wholesale firms with 500 to 1,500 employees. Other sectors can contain “small businesses” that earn annual revenues of up to $21.5 million. For instance, in the general construction sector, a firm counts as "small" if it earns anywhere between $13.5 million and $17 million a year. The organization’s definition of “small business” is more expansive than the Small Business Administration’s. With few exceptions, the SBA sets their threshold at 500 employees and average annual receipts at $7 million — considerably smaller than the bank’s. Other government institutions like the Federal Reserve adhere to the SBA’s definitions — thus raising the question of why the Ex-Im Bank in particular found it necessary to create their own standards. It is clear that what is a “small business” to the Ex-Im Bank is not what most Americans think of when they hear the term. Perhaps this can be explained by Ex-Im’s long history of rubbing elbows with the big guys. The Ex-Im Bank has been in the “big business” business for so long it can’t distinguish a publicly traded corporation from a local coffee shop. In truth, the bank's main beneficiaries are giant manufacturing conglomerates and aerospace contractors. The bank's main customer happens to be America's No. 1 exporter and manufacturing giant: Boeing. According to the bank's data, in fiscal year 2013, Boeing procured roughly 66 percent of Ex-Im's loan guarantees. Ex-Im reports that Boeing was designated primary exporter for 55 deals (including insurance, loans, and guarantees) valued at roughly $8.3 billion in total assistance. Sometimes, the bank doesn’t report where the money goes at all. The second-largest exporting beneficiary, topping off at $2.9 billion in Ex-Im assistance in fiscal 2013, is simply labeled as "unknown." And the top 10 exporter beneficiaries received roughly 75 percent of total assistance last year. Diane Katz, a Heritage Foundation regulatory research fellow, assembled a helpful list of some of the biggest beneficiaries. The list reads like a “who's who” of powerful exporting empires: General Electric, Dow Chemical, Bechtel, Caterpillar, and John Deere all enjoy the bank's support of “small business” and “job creation.” The bank’s transparent “small business” pitch should bother us. But the truth is it's unrealistic to expect Americans to monitor every deal and bald-faced half-truth that comes out of Ex-Im reports and balance sheets. This is the tragic conclusion of public choice economics: Private benefits for Boeing and Caterpillar continue unabated because the costs are dispersed among millions of taxpayers who simply don’t have the time and energy to fight this injustice. Big business lobbyists have “all hands on deck” at this year's conference to protect their cash cow. But that's no reason for us to buy what they are selling.

(GuruFocus) Generally speaking, the bigger the size of the company, the more difficult it is to grow. This concept was front-and-center after two major Dow components signaled to investors growing their business isn't an easy task. Procter & Gamble Shares of Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) were trading lower by more than 2 percent Wednesday after the $226-billion consumer packaged goods company reported its first-quarter results — in which earnings and revenue fell short of expectations. According to a Bloomberg report, sales during the quarter fell 1 percent year-over-year to $15.6 billion, missing the $15.7 billion analysts were expecting. The company's new CEO David Taylor attributed the revenue miss to a slowdown in overall growth, geopolitical disruptions and foreign-exchange woes. Meanwhile, the company's products may be out of favor among consumers who don't care about branding and place an emphasis on price. For example, sales of P&G's Gillette-branded razors and blades are facing pressure from upstart rivals such as Dollar Shave Club, which was acquired by rival Unilever plc (ADR) (NYSE: UL). Overall, grooming products declined by 6 percent in the quarter with shaving products leading the way in declines. Boeing Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), a fellow Dow component valued at $110 billion, also reported its first-quarter results Wednesday. Unlike P&G, Boeing's print was mixed as the company reported better-than-expected earnings per share but revenue fell short of expectations. Revenue fell more than 7 percent to $20.976 billion, also missing the $21.34 billion analysts were expecting; Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets in the quarter, marking the fewest since the first quarter of 2014. Looking forward, Boeing boosted its full-year 2017 earnings-per-share outlook from $9.10–$9.30 to $9.20–$9.40 per share. However, this doesn't mean the company's growth prospects and jet deliveries are expected to increase. According to a separate Bloomberg report, Boeing's improved earnings outlook could be attributed to the better tax environment. More telling, the company didn't raise its cash outlook — a key metric for investors as orders for aircraft are fading late into the sales cycle. "The stock has been a high flier for a while," George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said. "People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report."

Executives at Boeing (NYSE:BA) have long touted the company's plans to significantly increase its output toward the end of the decade. That process will begin this year, when commercial airplane deliveries are expected to rebound from a slight dip in 2016. That said, Boeing acknowledged at the beginning of 2017 that while aircraft deliveries will rise, revenue is expected to fall again this year. Sure enough, the company's first-quarter earnings report revealed revenue declines across every major business segment. However, Boeing still managed to generate strong earnings and cash flow in the quarter. Q1 by the numbers Boeing's revenue fell 7% last quarter. Most of the decline was driven by a 12% drop in its defense segment revenue, more or less reversing a 19% surge in that segment during the same quarter a year ago. But from a profitability perspective, Boeing improved last quarter. Here are the details of its performance. Commercial airplanes deliveries slipped year over year in Q1 primarily due to the impending entry into service of the new Boeing 737 MAX 8. Boeing hasn't actually reduced its 737 production — in fact, it is on the verge of boosting output from 42 per month to 47 per month. But Boeing is building a few 737 MAX planes already, and those won't be delivered to customers until later this year. Despite its revenue decline, Boeing reported double-digit growth in its core earnings per share, which excludes volatile pension costs. That's because Boeing incurred pre-tax charges of more than $300 million in the first quarter of 2016, related to plummeting demand for its 747 line of jumbo jets and cost overruns for its KC-46 military tanker program. Most impressively, free cash flow more than tripled year over year last quarter. This reflects the improving cash profitability of the Dreamliner program, lower capex, and strong orders during the first quarter (and an associated increase in customer deposits). All eyes on the Dreamliner While rising 737 production will be a reliable source of earnings growth in the next few years, the 787 Dreamliner program could be more of a wild card. One issue is profitability. Boeing is counting on cost cuts, product mix improvements, and better pricing for later aircraft sales to dramatically increase the Dreamliner program's cash profits, offsetting the huge losses incurred during the first few years of production. 787 deferred production costs declined by $316 million in Q1, compared to a $215 million decrease in the final quarter of 2016. While that's a meaningful improvement, profitability will have to improve at an even faster rate in the future for Boeing to meet its targets. The second issue is sales. While the Boeing 737 continues to sell quickly, 787 order activity has been slow lately. Over the past three years, Boeing has averaged fewer than 60 net orders annually for the 787. The sales slump continued last quarter, as Boeing brought in only 11 net firm Dreamliner orders. Meanwhile, Boeing is building 144 787s per month. Unless order activity picks up within the next couple of years, Boeing could be forced to slash production. Looking ahead Boeing raised its full-year EPS guidance by $0.10 on Wednesday, due to a slightly lower expected tax rate, but otherwise its outlook remains unchanged. 2017 looks like it will be another transitional year for the aerospace giant. Boeing is in the midst of introducing a handful of new models over the next three years, including multiple variants of its 737 MAX family; the largest (and most profitable) member of its Dreamliner family, the 787-10; and the first member of its new 777X family, the 777-9. This will pave the way for a return to revenue growth over the next several years, along with continued cash flow growth. The main thing Boeing must do to maximize its medium-term growth potential is to double down on its efforts to sell the 777X and 787.

But when they do, their picks have beaten the market by nearly 10x on average.* That's why many investors consider their joint stamp of approval to be a "total conviction" signal to buy.

The Boeing Co. reports earnings, Wednesday, April 26, 2017. (AP Photo/Mic Smith) CHICAGO — Boeing topped expectations for first-quarter profit, but the aerospace giant's sales fell short of forecasts, and the shares fell in Wednesday-morning trading. Chicago-based Boeing Co. said Wednesday that it earned $1.45 billion in the first quarter. Excluding non-repeating gains, the profit came to $2.01 per share. The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was $1.91 per share. Revenue was $20.98 billion. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $21.44 billion. Boeing blamed the disappointing sales number on delayed deliveries of commercial and defence aircraft. The company delivered 169 commercial planes in the quarter, down from 176 a year earlier. Boeing said it planned for fewer deliveries of its workhorse 737 plane as it prepares to launch a new version next month. Revenue from sales of military planes plunged 28 per cent, to $2.64 billion. Boeing expects full-year earnings in the range of $9.20 to $9.40 per share, an increase of a dime per share, as the company now expects a full-year tax rate of 31 per cent instead of 32 per cent. In morning trading, the shares were down $3.01, or 1.6 per cent, to $180.50. _____ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

Chicago-based Boeing Co. said Wednesday that it earned $1.45 billion in the first quarter. Excluding non-repeating gains, the profit came to $2.01 per share. The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was $1.91 per share. Revenue was $20.98 billion. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $21.44 billion. Sign up for the online chat with Air Force Deputy CIO Bill Marion II on May 9, at 10 a.m. (EDT). Advertisement Boeing blamed the disappointing sales number on delayed deliveries of commercial and defense aircraft. The company delivered 169 commercial planes in the quarter, down from 176 a year earlier. Boeing said it planned for fewer deliveries of its workhorse 737 plane as it prepares to launch a new version next month. Revenue from sales of military planes plunged 28 percent, to $2.64 billion. Boeing expects full-year earnings in the range of $9.20 to $9.40 per share, an increase of a dime per share, as the company now expects a full-year tax rate of 31 percent instead of 32 percent. In morning trading, the shares were down $3.01, or 1.6 percent, to $180.50. _____ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business Boeing’s sales fall as company delivers fewest jets since 2014 Wed., April 26, 2017, 7:51 a.m. In this Friday, March 31, 2017, file photo, Boeing employees walk the new Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner down toward the delivery ramp area at the company's facility in South Carolina after conducting its first test flight at Charleston International Airport in North Charleston, S.C. (Mic Smith / Associated Press) By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Boeing’s sales slumped as the U.S. planemaker delivered the fewest jetliners in three years, ahead of the impending debut of a new version of the company’s best-selling plane. Revenue fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion in the first quarter, about $200 million less than analysts had estimated. Weak sales overshadowed a surprise gain in free cash flow as the manufacturer kept costs in check and started to reap a long-awaited payoff from the 787 Dreamliner. The report spotlighted Boeing’s need to tamp down costs and make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn’t boost the cash outlook — a crucial number for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. “’The stock has been a high flier for a while,” George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Wednesday. “People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report.” The shares dipped 1.5 percent to $180.73 before the start of regular trading in New York. Boeing rose 18 percent this year through Tuesday, the third largest gain among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The manufacturer plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing’s factories. It represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane’s manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what’s typically the company’s slowest period. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets, the fewest since the first quarter of 2014, as it began to stockpile 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. First-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up from a previous estimate of $9.10 to $9.30, mainly because of a reduction in the expected tax rate. “Although we don’t see investors giving Boeing much credit for a tax-driven EPS ‘beat and raise,’ we would expect there to be a positive response to the solid cash-flow performance in the first quarter, given historic seasonality,” Robert Stallard, an aerospace analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients.

April 27, 2017 0700 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:191583 Publish Date: Wed, 26 Apr 2017 18:48:09 GMT Service: Iran Iran Air to receive first Boeing passenger plane in 2018 Giant US aviation company Boeing will deliver its first passenger plane to the Iranian national flag carrier early next year, said the managing director of Iran Air. Farhad Parvaresh told reporters on Wednesday that the first Boeing 777 will be handed over to Iran in April 2018, Fars News Agency reported. He noted that the 777 model of Boeing is a 350-seater aircraft. In early April, Iran signed an agreement with Boeing to purchase several twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. The deal, signed between Iran's Aseman Airlines and Boeing, involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes. The agreement came after almost a year of negotiations between Aseman Airlines and Boeing. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air's order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. The planes are expected to be delivered to Aseman Airlines from 2019. The Iranian airline is expected to receive at least five of the aircraft during the same year. Boeing 737 MAX planes that would enter service in the second half of 2017 have a seating capacity of 130 and are specifically adequate for domestic and regional flights. The planes that Aseman Airlines purchased from Boeing would increase the company's passenger transportation capacity to over 8,000 seats. Parvaresh said on Tuesday that the first ATR passenger plane will be handed over to Iran on Friday. "The ATR 72-600 passenger plane is currently undergoing flight tests in France and it will arrive in Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Friday," he said. He noted that three other ATR 72-600 passenger planes are also slated to fly to Tehran next Sunday, Wednesday and Friday. The senior aviation official reiterated that all four airplanes purchased from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR have successfully passed preliminary tests and are conducting pilot takeoffs and landings at Toulouse Airport in France. "Additionally, the logo of Iran Air has been painted on the fuselage of the manufactured jetliners," he added. Earlier In April, Parvaresh said that the Iranian airline will receive four ATR aircraft within three weeks given that the deadline for the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer has expired for a week. He also pointed to the latest status of the negotiations with the largest German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG, and said, "Not long ago, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed with Lufthansa on technical and operational training, catering and corporate restructuring as well as business cooperation. The agreement was recently implemented in the commercial sector though talks are still underway on other provisions."     KeyWords Iran Air Boeing plane   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News 8 border guards martyred in southeastern Iran Trade cooperation with Iran guarantees regional stability: Envoy in UK Iran says early Boeing delivery cancelled 8 border guards killed in clashes with outlaws in southeastern Iran Iran condemns Turkish air raid in Iraq’s Sinjar Iran in Syria at Damascus request, Lavrov tells Saudi FM Iran: Turkey’s air raid violates Iraq national sovereignty Zarif shrugs off Trump's remarks over nuclear deal Sport sciences seminar starts Pour-Mousavi: We will celebrate booking Round of 16 berth at home Most Visited Trump has 'dangerous mental illness,’ some experts say Trump orders review of US nuclear posture amid North Korea tensions US ground forces in Syria kill 'close associate' of Daesh leader www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1231 sec

Russia's RSC Energia and US' Boeing have finally managed to hammer out a settlement following a lengthy litigation which began almost four years ago. "The settlement came into effect on February 22, and a joint claim was made by Boeing and RSC Energia on March 16. The California court made a final decision to end this litigation. The issue is now closed forever," Solntsev told RIA Novosti. © Photo: Pixabay Space Tourism: Russia, US Ready to Give You a Lift to Moon Orbit, ISSSea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by Boeing. The goal of the project was to employ a mobile maritime launch platform to conduct commercial space launches from the equator which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. In 2009 Sea Launch Co LLC, the provider of the Sea Launch service, filed for bankruptcy, and in 2013 Boeing filed a lawsuit claiming that RSC Energia, PO Yuzhnoye and KB Yuzhnoye failed to reimburse Boeing for over $350 million paid to third-party creditors. On May 12, the US District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of Boeing, stating that Energia owed Boeing more than $320 million plus legal fees. According to Solntsev, both parties had to overcome numerous hurdles during the settlement negotiations but finally managed to reach a mutual compromise, and that the deal between Energia and Boeing will now allow the companies to engage in a number of joint ventures. "The details of these negotiations remain a commercial secret; what matters is that the partners were able to break the deadlock. We’re now discussing ongoing and ambitious future joint projects, from trips to ISS to deep space flights, which would’ve been impossible without a settlement," he added. Solntsev also pointed out that the S7 Group which purchased the Sea Launch project, did not take part in the negotiations with Boeing and will not be making any payments to the US company. ...

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 26 April 2017 | MYT 8:59 PM Boeing profit jumps 19%; full-year target lifted Boeing’s earnings rose 19% to US$1.45bil (RM6.3bil) in the first quarter. - AFP pic SEATTLE: Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19% rise in first-quarter profit despite declining revenue, and it notched up its forecast for full-year earnings. The world’s biggest plane maker said it had earned US$1.45bil (RM6.3bil), or US$2.34 per share, compared with US$1.22bil (RM5.3bil), or US$1.83 per share, a year earlier. The company’s core earnings, which exclude some pension and other costs, rose to US$2.01 per share from US$1.74, beating the analysts’ consensus estimate of US$1.94, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 7.3% to US$20.98bil (RM91.2bil), missing the consensus estimate of US$21.30bil, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The decline came as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176, and because last year’s revenue figure included delivery of three C-17 military transport aircraft, a plane Boeing has stopped making. Deliveries of 737s also dipped as Boeing built 737 MAX 8 jets that it plans to begin delivering this quarter, now that the plane has regulatory certification. While Boeing delivered two fewer 777s in the quarter, it delivered two more 787s. The results also showed the effect of Boeing’s cost-cutting and factory productivity improvements. Boeing is honing its ability to make 787s, and the larger 787-9 model is more profitable that the earlier one. Boeing’s KC-46 aerial refueling tanker continued to weigh on results. The company said it still expected to deliver 760-765 commercial aircraft in 2017. - Reuters   Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Airlines , Boeing Co Related Stories Related Stories Boeing plans more layoffs affecting hundreds of engineers - source Boeing sees higher 2017 plane deliveries as earnings jump Boeing to consolidate defense, space and security business Boeing Q3 profit jumps; raises delivery and revenue outlook Boeing’s profit hit by tanker charge; outlook unchanged You May Be Interested Deutsche Bank Q1 profit surges on debt trading Engtex secures RM60m contracts in Q1, tenders RM300m jobs Ringgit lower against US$ early Thursday Hong Leong Bank expresses regret over mutilated notes incident How to own your first home with zero down payment Save the planet with a fun day out this May Others Also Read England's Ansari retires at 25 to pursue other ambitions Safe drivers to gain from easing of motor insurance tariffs Serdang cops bust two gangs of thieves and nab Nigerian drug pusher Property Related advertisement Latest News Airbus Q1 profit slides on weak pricing, higher costs STMicro posts solid quarterly growth for first time in 6 yrs Deutsche Bank Q1 profit surges on debt trading Nestle maintains advertising expenditure in 2017 Samsung Elec flags stronger Q2; Elliott welcomes share cancellation Most Viewed in Business Hong Leong Bank expresses regret over mutilated notes incident Malaysia's economy faces more headwinds to stay resilient GentingM, Genting weigh on KLCI at midday Malaysia Airlines offers to lease A330s from Alitalia Maxis posts higher normalised profit after tax at RM510m in Q1FY17, div 5c TM to complete broadband speed upgrades by year-end Ringgit to be less volatile this year as economy stabilises Ringgit lower against US$ early Thursday Astro and Turner form strategic joint venture Engtex secures RM60m contracts in Q1, tenders RM300m jobs advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

(NASDAQ:ATSG), has launched its Passenger-to-FlexCombi™ and Passenger-to-Freighter conversion programs for the Boeing Next Generation 737-700 aircraft. The programs will be marketed as B737-700FC (FlexCombi™) and B737-700F (Freighter). “We’re excited to finally announce the launch of our 700-series conversion programs for the Boeing 737,” said PEMCO Director of Conversion Programs Mike Andrews. “Over the past several months, we have worked closely with our customers to fully understand their requirements and implement a comprehensive solution.” The launch customer for the PEMCO B737-700FC is Bahrain-based Chisholm Enterprises, an internationally recognized provider of tailored aviation and business solutions in the Middle East. Its subsidiary Texel Air, a non-scheduled cargo airline, will operate the B737-700FC from Bahrain International Airport. “We made a significant investment to develop our specification for the FlexCombi™ to meet our operational requirements,” shared Chisholm Enterprises CEO George Chisholm. “I acknowledge the professionalism and support received from the PEMCO team during our extensive evaluation process culminating in PEMCO’s confirmation of proof of concept. This underwrote our decision to become the launch customer for the B737-700FC.” Chisholm added, “We have also worked with PEMCO as the end customer for four previous B737-300 conversions including the current two aircraft in the Texel fleet. We have benefited from the trouble-free PEMCO cargo system since 2009. We are very confident of a successful partnership with PEMCO on the -700FC.” PEMCO will induct the first aircraft for B737-700 Passenger-to-FlexCombi™ modification at PEMCO’s facilities in Tampa, Fla., during the second quarter of 2017. PEMCO expects to receive a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration supplemental type certification (STC) by mid-2018. After the initial issuance, PEMCO plans to certify both B737-700 conversion programs with the European Aviation Safety Agency and the Civil Aviation Administration of China shortly thereafter. The first of its kind, the PEMCO B737-700FC offers three configurations: a 24-passenger cabin plus a 2,640-cubic-foot cargo hold for up to 30,000 pounds of payload in six pallet positions; a 12-passenger cabin plus a 3,005-cubic-foot cargo hold for up to 35,000 pounds of payload in seven pallet positions; or full-freighter mode consisting of a 3,370-cubic-foot cargo hold for up to 40,000 pounds of payload in eight pallet positions. The available positions will accommodate 88” x 125” or 88” x 108” pallets, with the seventh and eighth positions accommodating smaller pallets. The B737-700F PEMCO-converted aircraft features nine pallet positions, up to 45,000 pounds of payload, and 3,844 cubic feet of total volume. The available positions will accommodate 88” x 125” or 88” x 108” pallets, with the ninth position accommodating a smaller pallet. “This has been a very carefully thought out process for us,” PEMCO General Manager Pastor Lopez said. “We are leveraging our extensive knowledge and market leadership in the Boeing 737 Classic and designing a great product, at a sensible price, for our customers.

 Boeing beats on earnings, misses on revenue Ankit Ajmera, Reuters Apr. 26, 2017, 8:29 AM 503 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing (Reuters) - Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit despite declining revenue, and it notched up its forecast for full-year earnings. The world's biggest plane maker said it had earned $1.45 billion, or $2.34 per share, compared with $1.22 billion, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. The company's core earnings, which exclude some pension and other costs, rose to $2.01 per share from $1.74, beating the analysts' consensus estimate of $1.94, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 7.3 percent to $20.98 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $21.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The decline came as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176, and because last year's revenue figure included delivery of three C-17 military transport aircraft, a plane Boeing has stopped making. Deliveries of 737s also dipped as Boeing built 737 MAX 8 jets that it plans to begin delivering this quarter, now that the plane has regulatory certification. While Boeing delivered two fewer 777s in the quarter, it delivered two more 787s. The results also showed the effect of Boeing's cost-cutting and factory productivity improvements. Boeing is honing its ability to make 787s, and the larger 787-9 model is more profitable that the earlier one. Boeing's KC-46 aerial refueling tanker continued to weigh on results. The company said it still expected to deliver 760-765 commercial aircraft in 2017.

Net income for the quarter ending March 31 rose 19 percent to $1.5 billion. But revenues fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion, below the $21.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company underperformed in terms of revenues. The firm has been trimming jobs in its civil aviation division due to slowing sales. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg pledged to have a "sharp focus on performance and productivity" to reach its financial targets. Boeing plans to cut hundreds of engineering jobs on June 23 and expects additional cuts by the end of the year. Since the start of 2017, it has eliminated 3,500 positions, or about 2.3 percent of its staff at the end of 2016. "We are having to deal with a lot of competitive realities in the marketplace," Muilenburg said on a conference call. While Boeing has experienced net job loss, it has been adding some technology-oriented positions out of recognition that "we need to fuel the research and development for the future," Muilenburg said. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft in the quarter, down seven from the same period of 2016. Commercial deliveries are closely scrutinized by Wall Street because of their connection to revenues. Boeing modestly increased its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents a share to a range of $10.35 to $10.55, citing a lower-than-expected tax rate. Muilenburg said he was encouraged that President Donald Trump had nominated two board members for the Export-Import Bank, which has been hamstrung due to a lack of a quorum following an effort by some in Congress to eliminate the bank. Muilenburg called the nominations "a very big step" and said he was hopeful "that soon we'll see a fully operational board." The Ex-Im Bank has sometimes been dubbed the "Bank of Boeing" because of its role in providing key financing to Boeing customers over the years to purchase aircraft. Boeing shares fell 1.0 percent to $181.71 in midday trading. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

T-X training aircraft completes maiden flight Boeing and its partner Saab have conducted the first flight of the second production-ready T-X aircraft for the US Air Force (USAF). With an advanced cockpit, the aircraft is being developed for military pilot training. The one-hour flight was conducted by lead T-X test pilot Steve Schmidt and Boeing test pilot for air force programmes Matt Giese. Both pilots trained for the flight using the complete Boeing T-X system, which includes ground-based exercises and simulation. During the flight, the front and back cockpits of the aircraft worked together seamlessly, according to Giese. Giese said: “The jet was handled exactly like the first aircraft and the simulator, meeting all expectations. "It’s the perfect aircraft for training future generations of combat pilots.” "It’s the perfect aircraft for training future generations of combat pilots." Schmidt said: “Our successful flight test programme is a testament to the fact that our offering is the right choice for the USAF. “This aircraft was built to airforce requirements and designed to fulfil the Air Education and Training Command mission.” The single-engine powered T-X will replace the USAF’s ageing fleet of T-38 Talon aircraft, and is expected to achieve initial operating capability in 2024. The system features twin tails, stadium seating, and an advanced cockpit with embedded training. Boeing and Saab launched the T-X design last September, and flew the first aircraft in December.

The world’s biggest plane maker said it had earned US$1.45 billion (RM6.31 billion), or US$2.34 per share, compared with US$1.22 billion, or US$1.83 per share, a year earlier. The company’s core earnings, which exclude some pension and other costs, rose to US$2.01 per share from US$1.74, beating the analysts’ consensus estimate of US$1.94, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 7.3 per cent to US$20.98 billion, missing the consensus estimate of US$21.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The decline came as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176, and because last year’s revenue figure included delivery of three C-17 military transport aircraft, a plane Boeing has stopped making. Deliveries of 737s also dipped as Boeing built 737 MAX 8 jets that it plans to begin delivering this quarter, now that the plane has regulatory certification. While Boeing delivered two fewer 777s in the quarter, it delivered two more 787s. The results also showed the effect of Boeing’s cost-cutting and factory productivity improvements. Boeing is honing its ability to make 787s, and the larger 787-9 model is more profitable that the earlier one. Boeing’s KC-46 aerial refuelling tanker continued to weigh on results. The company said it still expected to deliver 760-765 commercial aircraft in 2017. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Ringgit opens at 4.3490/3550 against US greenback Ivanka Trump to discuss fund for women with World Bank Trump’s taxes slash seen as ‘guidepost’ by Republicans (VIDEO) Bursa shares open marginally lower, but later turned higher Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Petronas Dagangan registers record profit in 34 years Why are global players chasing Proton?

That is one upshot of Boeing’s plan to expedite delivery of its airplanes sold to Iran. It is also why President Trump should move quickly to scuttle the deal by which Boeing agreed to sell 80 civilian aircraft for $16.6 billion. Sen. Marco RubioMarco RubioWhat’s with Trump’s spelling mistakes? Boeing must be stopped from doing business with Iran Top Trump officials push border wall as government shutdown looms MORE (R-Fla.) and Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), among others, have already made a persuasive case against the sale. They argue that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards fly airplanes, like the Boeing ones, to ferry weapons to their clients, such as Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and the terrorist group Hezbollah. Both have shown little mercy in the mullahs’ drive to destabilize and dominate the Middle East. ADVERTISEMENT The possibility of a permanent Iran lobby should also give the deal’s proponents pause. For years a loose, but committed network of regime apologists in Washington pushed an unpopular pro-Tehran agenda. Then, under former President Obama, they gained a foothold in the executive branch. Regime surrogates managed to shape the Iranian narrative to the extent that they achieved the nuclear deal they desperately wanted.   Now the regime hopes to consolidate and even extend its gains. Flush with cash from the removal of sanctions, the ruling clerics would like to modernize their aging fleet of aircraft, but it comes with an added bonus. If the sale goes through, it will trigger a gold rush of business to Iran. Even if American firms don’t immediately strike deals, they will nonetheless be able to cement their relationships with regime elites for future transactions. For an example of this, look no further than the 2014 Europe-Iran Forum held in London. As the Wall Street Journal has reported, the gathering encouraged “global law firms, business consultancies, marketing firms, auctioneers and telecom providers to ‘prepare and evaluate the post-sanctions trade framework and investment opportunities’ in Iran.” Once the taint of doing business with the regime has been erased, it will be much easier for U.S. companies to justify their entrance into the Iranian market. Corporate America’s burgeoning business ties with Iran would inevitably create in DC an entrenched constituency that would block legislation targeting Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, its support for international terrorism, and its myriad of human rights abuses. Boeing has already said the deal “will support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs directly associated with production and delivery of the 777-300ERs and nearly 100,000 U.S. jobs in the U.S. aerospace value stream for the full course of deliveries.” With the public’s demand for job creation, individual congressional members won’t act against Iran if it means losing jobs in their home districts and states. To truly put America’s national security interests first, the Trump administration should resist the temptation to appease American corporate interests and nip the gold rush to Iran in the bud by blocking the Boeing deal. It might not be the most popular thing to do right now, but it is the wisest move for America in the long run.

"The first Boeing 777 jumbo jet will be handed over to Iran in April 2018," Parvaresh told reporters on Wednesday. He noted that the 777 model of Boeing will be 350-seated aircraft. In a relevant development in early April, Iran signed a new agreement with Boeing to purchase several twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. The agreement was signed between Iran's Aseman Airlines and Boeing and involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes. The agreement came after almost a year of negotiations between Aseman Airlines and Boeing. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran’s flag-carrier airline Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. The planes are expected to be delivered to Aseman Airlines from 2019. The Iranian airline is expected to receive at least five of the purchased aircraft during the same year. Boeing 737 MAX planes - that would enter service in the second half of 2017 – have a passenger capacity of 130 people and are specifically adequate for domestic and regional flights. The planes that Aseman Airlines has purchased from Boeing would increase the company’s passenger transportation capacity to above 8,000 seats. Iran Air said in December 2016 that it had finalized an agreement with Boeing to buy 80 new planes. The company accordingly announced that Boeing would start to deliver the planes in 2018 and the deliveries would be completed within 10 years. Iran has already received the first three of a total of 100 Airbus planes that it has purchased from the European company through an agreement worth around $18 billion. More deliveries are expected to take place over the next months.         Related News Official: ATR to Deliver First Passenger Plane to Iran on Friday  Source: Boeing to Deliver 2 Passenger Planes to Iran in 1 Month  Iran Inks New Deal with Boeing to Buy 30 Passenger Planes  Iran Announces Deal with Foreign Financier on Purchase of 77 New Boeing, Airbus Planes  Minister: Trump Not Able to Annul Boeing Contract with Iran  Iranian Experts Build Boeing 737 Simulator  Iran Air Signs Contract with US Boeing to Buy 80 Passenger Planes  LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Takes Control of More Areas after Intense Clashes with Terrorists in Al-Qaboun Syrian Army Advances into Depth of Sham Desert in Eastern Ghouta Iraqi Popular Forces Take Control over 3 More Villages, West of Mosul Deir Ezzur: Syrian Army Troops on Guard in Cemetery Region Iraqi Popular Forces Cut off ISIL Supply Line between Ba'aj, Al-Hadher in Nineveh Province Post-Militants Era: People of Zabadani & Madaya Start Peaceful Life A Cry for Help: Millions Facing Famine in War-Torn Yemen Syria: Madaya Alleys Become Children's Playground Again Fate of Syria Must Not Be Decided by US and Fellow Warmongers Russian Air Force Conducts Four Times More Air Raids Than US-led Coalition Aircraft in Syria Al-Baghdadi's Senior Aide Captured in Syria Iranian Defense Minister: US Policies in Syria 'A New Form of Fascism' Russian FM: Hezbollah, Iranian Forces Present in Syria at Government’s Request Moscow: Russian Position Unchanged by France’s Anti-Syria Stance Syrian Army Advances in More Regions Near Palmyra Syrian Army Takes Control of More Areas after Intense Clashes with Terrorists in Al-Qaboun TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army continued its military operations in Al-Qaboun neighborhood in the Eastern outskirts of Damascus and won control of several buildings and a power plant on the Eastern side of the neighborhood.

Pavel Kanygin found the Russian colonel’s comrade-in-arms who is considered to be responsible for transporting the Buk missile that shot down the Boeing MH17 RIA Общество13:12 26 апреля 2017 1 Обсудить A veteran who served as a scout in the Afghan war, recognized his war buddy among those who figure on the list of the involved in the Malaysian Boeing crash. Exclusive certificate. Pavel Kanygin, a special correspondent of the Novaya Gazeta met the veteran in Zaporozhye and went to a closed military town near Rostov having a message for his friend. FROM THE EDITORS   Novaya Gazeta is investigating the causes of the crash of the MH17 Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur palne, which happened in the sky over the Donbass on July 17, 2014. There were 298 people that is 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board of the civilian liner. All of them died. Last autumn, the International Investigation Group (JIT*) presented the conclusions according to which the Malaysian Boeing was hit by a surface-to-air missile from the Buk missile system that fired from the Donbass town of Snezhnoye (at that time it was controlled by the DPR). * An investigative group called for ascertaining the reasons and perpetrators of the MH17 death. The group is represented by five countries which are Malaysia, Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Ukraine. Russia refused to participate in the joint investigation of the group. However, the Buks producer that is the Russian state concern Almaz-Antey investigating the tragedy from its side, insisted that the missile was fired from the village of Zaroshchenskoye suburbs. In the opinion of the Almaz-Antey representatives, on July 17, 2014, that village was controlled by Ukrainian security forces. Residents of the Zaroshchenskoye refused the information presented by the Almaz-Antey having told Pavel Kanygin, a special correspondent of Novaya Gazeta, that the Ukrainian military forces and the Buk missile system had never been seen in the village, and its surroundings were controlled by the DPR forces from the first days of the war. We are presenting the new details of the investigation. Place of crash of Boeing of Malaysian airlines. Picture: Zinaida Burskaya / Novaya Gazeta In October 2015, investigators from JIT published intercepted telephone conversations between «Hmuriy», a head of the DPR military intelligence service and a separatist whose call sign is «Buryat», their conversation took place on the day of the tragedy. «Buryat» and «Hmuriy» were discussing the details of the Buk transportation. In the materials presented by JIT, «Hmuriy» appears as responsible for moving the missile unit from the border with Russia over the territory controlled by the separatists. According to our data, besides these telephone conversations, the investigators do not have any other evidence of the involvement of Colonel Dubinsky in the Malaysian Boeing crash. Officials from Moscow call the JIT evidence «fakes» from the Internet. However, Novaya Gazeta managed to find a person who confirmed that it is «Hmuriy’s» voice heard on the recording. Sergei Tiunov, a leader of Zaporozhye self-defense and a veteran of the Afghan war, recognized the voice of his former war buddy, Russian Colonel Sergey Dubinsky having the call sign «Hmuriy». In an exclusive interview with Novaya Gazeta, Tiunov said that he and Sergey Dubinsky, the former head of the «GRU DPR», were friends and discussed the consequences of the MH17 tragedy. Sergey Tiunov (on the background) and Sergey Dubinsky (on the foreground with a tommy gun. Photo from Sergey Tiunov’s archive In the late 1980s, Tiunov and Dubinsky served in the intelligence troop of the 181st regiment in Afghanistan. In the first months of the war in the Donbass, thanks to his acquaintance with Dubinsky, Tiunov managed to release several dozens of Ukrainian soldiers from captivity in Donetsk. Tiunov claims that he fears for Dubinsky's life, who, he said, is a key witness in the case of the MH17crash able to shed light on the circumstances of the tragedy and name those who ordered to attack the passenger liner, and who is directly responsible for the death of people. Telephone conversations of the head of the "GRU DPR" Sergey Nikolaevich Dubinsky and a separatist nicknamed «Buryat». 07/17/2014:   Buryat: "Where should we deliver this beauty, Nikolayevich?" Dubinsky: "Which one? This?" B: «[The one] that I brought. I'm already in Donetsk». D: "That's what I'm thinking about, right? That "M"? " B: «Yes, yes, yes, Buk, Buk». D : "Is it on this, on trac? " B : "Yes ... It must be unloaded somewhere to hide". D : "Is it with the crew?" B : «Yes, with the crew». D : "Do not hide it anywhere. She will go there now... I will tell you where she should go. She will go along with the tanks of the "East". Telephone conversations of the head of the "GRU DPR" Sergey Nikolaevich Dubinsky and a separatist nicknamed «Buryat». 07/17/2014: Comrade-in-arms I talked to Tiunov on March 16 at the headquarters of self-defense in Zaporozhye, which was located in the premises of one of the city schools. The flags of Ukraine were hung in the big office, and there was a new generator. In a few days it would be taken to the Zaporozhye volunteers at the Mariupol Front. In the meantime, Tiunov instructed his subordinates about the details of the trip: «We'll leave early in the morning. Do not take weapons. Clear?» Tiunov, a tightly built man with glasses of about 50 years of age, worked as a lawyer before the war. The lawyer Tiunov organized and became a leader of local self-defense in the spring of 2014, when a wave of shares of «Russian Spring» supporters swept across the southeast of Ukraine. There are several videos on YouTube. In one of them, on March 23, 2014, Tiunov, dressed in camouflage and his comrades, blocked the road to a column of cars with pro-Russian activists at the entrance to Zaporozhye, and then pulled the tricolors sticking out of their quarter lights. We defended our city. But the Moscow TV channels showed this video with a comment that we had brutally attacked the Russian people. Many of my Russian comrades wrote: «Fascist, punisher, lied out under a junta». I did not expect that, and it was a shame that propaganda poisoned my comrade so much, Tiunov told me. And Seryoga Dubinsky did not say anything that time. Last time  when I was at his home, near Donetsk, was in April 2014, before the war. We argued a lot, of course, as he was opposed to Maidan, he did not like it. But we talked as usual, I told him my truth, and he told me his own. It was hard to imagine what would happen to us afterwards». As Tiunov says, at that time Dubinsky was a retired Russian officer for 10 years already. But in May 2014, he unexpectedly went to fight for the "DPR". Tiunov recalls that then a group of Ukrainian volunteers "firmly occupied" the village of Velikaya Novoselka, where Dubinsky lived after conducting a raid in search of sympathizers for the "Russian Spring". «Seryoga was not so excited about the latest events, and here it is. The last drop, as they say». Tiunov recalls that during his service in Afghanistan he did not communicate with Dubinsky. The former comrades-in-arms became friends only in late 2010, met on the newly created Internet forum for veterans. In 2011, the war buddies met. Dubinsky, who served in the intelligence troop as a deputy commander, invited Sergey Tiunov and Vladimir Vorotilov, the Ukrainian «Afghans», to come for his birthday on August 8, to his home that is in the village of Velikaya Novoselka in the Donetsk region. Dubinsky settled there in 2004 after he retired from the Russian army and returned from the service in Chechnya in the rank of colonel. The comrades called on the phone. Tiunov, who lived in Zaporozhye, said that he and Vorotilov would come in one car and asked whether to grab any products. «Guys, just come, that is most important!» - answered Dubinsky. «Karakhan*, I warn you that I will not drink as I am at the wheel,» said Tiunov. "Redhead, do not be a bore," Dubinsky joked. * "Karakhan", "Hmuriy", "Not good", "Petrovsky" are Sergey Dubinsky’s callsigns and nicknames. The meeting was warm. Dubinsky introduced his young wife and mother-in-law to his war buddies and showed the house. They laid the table on the veranda, remembering old comrades in Afghanistan; the first thing they drank for were died  comrades-in-arms. Dubinsky remembered up the story of Idris Saraliev, who also fought in Afghanistan in the same intelligence group, and was awarded the Order of the Red Star and the Medal «For Courage». But in the Chechen war, Saraliev was on the side of Maskhadov's troops, and in 2002, the special forces unit soldiers, headed by Dubinsky, killed him during a special operation. Seryoga was very upset about this fateful case, claiming that it happened by chance, - says Tiunov. And if only he knew that, he would not have allowed it. He also said that we all have one country, and the enemies divided and quarreled all of us in 1991. He was worried about all of that. ... By September 2014, several hundred of Ukrainian soldiers who had been surrounded in a trap under Ilovaisk, were in the captivity of the «DPR». Only few people broke out of the trap. Tiunov, a leader of the Zaporozhye volunteers, was able to take out a group of his people in a jeep, but he was wounded. After leaving the hospital, with the help of his familiar «Afghans», searched  the «DPR» commanders to agree on the release of one of the fighters. Soon Tiunov got an SMS containing a phone number and text: «A man from military intelligence from that side. Call him. You’ll wonder who will answer you». Tiunov immediately dialed the number and blurted out: I'm a lawyer from Zaporozhye, Tiunov Sergei, and I want to enter into negotiations on the release of my fellow countryman ... - Speak normally, Redhead, - laughed a hoarse voice at that end. - Talk in order how many people, from where, who will take them? Tiunov recognized the voice, but could not believe it. - Whom am I speaking wth?" - he asked. - This is «Karakhan»! - answered the voice. - Dubinsky. «Hmuriy». Got is? At Tiunov’s request, Dubinsky released the captured Ukrainian soldier, ordering to put him on a passenger bus from Donetsk to Kurukhovo, and on the border line he was met by his relatives. A week after his countryman was successfully released, Tiunov called Dubinsky again and asked to release a group of captured soldiers from Zaporozhye. «No problem, take them! We only feed and guard them here, waste of money», agreed  «Hmuriy». The same day Tiunov contacted Ukrainian military men and the Security Service of Ukraine, and told them about his agreement with Donetsk, and asked to provide logistics. The officials answered that personal initiatives of social activists can be useful, but they will be considered in the general order... Tiunov rented a bus in Zaporozhye himself for releasing the captured. And on the October morning he went to Donetsk, where Dubinsky assigned a meeting. «On the one hand, the trip seemed a sure death at the time, and all my nerves were at their limit. On the other hand, I knew who I was going to, and he could not let me down as gave his word. For Afghans, this word is concrete. At the meeting place armed «DPR» fighters in masks were waiting for Tiunov. A few minutes later, several more people appeared, and among them there was a familiar figure of short stature with a motionless left arm - the effects of Dubinsky's old wound, which his close people knew about. «Hmuriy» was accompanied by security guards. Tiunov defined them as Chechen special forces, whom «Hmuriy» served with during the Chechen war. The captured were loaded onto a bus. Tiunov and Dubinsky stepped aside to talk. «You see what life it is now, Seryozha,» said Hmuriy. - In Afghanistan, we fought on the same side, but now we are fighting against each other. I do not understand why you are for the junta». - In response, I could not restrain myself and said that it was them who knocked down the passenger plane in a gangster way! - recalls Tiunov. - I saw by his face that it touched him, and he took it very personally. «You don’t think that I did this [myself], do you?» said he. And then he pointed upward: «The bastards from Moscow did it!» - He did not like such a conversation, because he had to justify himself. Still, he is a military man, not a bandit,» continues Tiunov. - [It was obvious to me]: he understood that he was involved and partly guilty of the death of civilians. So he quickly turned off the conversation like enough, go away or they will find out and fire a mortar both you and me. The Zaporozhye soldiers were then released without recourse. Officially in the DPR, the action was called a gesture of goodwill on the eve of the anniversary of the liberation of Zaporozhye from the Nazis... Next time, the exchange took place in November 2014. Tiunov wanted to pull out the volunteers of the «Donbass» battalion from the captivity. But that time, the DPR did not want to release the captive volunteers under any conditions. Under the agreement, Tiunov undertook to bring «Hmuriy» 2 DPR fighters for five Donbass soldiers. During the exchange, there was another conversation between Tiunov and Dubinsky about the Malaysian Boeing. - That time he told me distantly: «Seryozha, we are not involved in the plane crash. The Boeing was shot down by an Ukrainian pilot flying on the SU», - recalls Tiunov. - I immediately realized that by that time they had already developed a legend. Because [«Hmuriy»] no longer expressed any resentment or emotions... After that time, we have not seen each other anymore. Tiunov showed me some old photos from their joint rest and then talked about the service in the «Afghan» intelligence troop. «He was not a bitch or a rat in the war. I know it. In intelligence service, such people just do not stay long. But, of course, a civilian can say in another way  if he looks at some things, which we did in Afghanistan. Yes, something was contentious, maybe. But that was necessary for survival. - For example? - I asked. - Well, you need some food, and you go into the house in the village and take it; you need warm clothes and you take it; you take cigarettes. In Afghanistan, everyone behaved so, and in this war too. I told my soldiers the same. But taking out television sets or equipment is looting. Killing unarmed and civilians is a crime. These are the boundaries that you do not cross. - You said you did not consider him a bandit. Whom do you consider him in this case? - He fought [in the Donbass] as a soldier. Yes, probably, by the [criminal] order of his leaders. But I am 100% sure that if he knew it was a [civil] aircraft, and it was his duty to launch the missile, he would never have kill the civilians. Moreover, I heard from him personally: «These Moscow … did it!» ... And I will never agree with the fact that now he is the biggest culprit. I asked Tiunov a direct question if he recognized the voice of his comrade-in arms Dubinsky from the records of JIT and the SBU and if he is he ready to repeat on camera what he told me an hour earlier in a personal conversation. Tiunov paused. Then he said: - Let’s say so  - the person whoin the records [of telephone conversations presented] of the SBU, is signed as Hmuriy, is very similar [in a voice] to Dubinsky. I can admit that this was him. During the conversation on the camera, Tiunov carefully selected the words. Later he once again told me that he did not consider Dubinsky guilty of a catastrophe: «He is a key witness, but not a murderer. And he's also my war buddy. I want him to stay alive. I believe that he did not click on the button of this Buk, but only coordinated the transfer". Tiunov showed me some old photos from their joint rest and then talked about the service in the «Afghan» intelligence troop. «He was not a bitch or a rat in the war. I know it. In intelligence service, such people just do not stay long. But, of course, a civilian can say in another way  if he looks at some things, which we did in Afghanistan. Yes, something was contentious, maybe.

I believe that he did not click on the button of this Buk, but only coordinated the transfer". Sergey Dubinsky was not surprised by the news from Tiunov, however, having listened to me, the colonel said that he was not in Rostov that time and was going to come back only a week later. «Let's meet in a week,» he suggested and then added: «And was that you having problems with the Ministry of State Security in Donetsk? I recognized you»*. * On June 16, 2015, making his business trip to the military operations zone, a special correspondent of Novaya Gazeta, Pavel Kanygin was indeed arrested by representatives of the Ministry of State Security of the DPR «for the preparation of materials unfavorable for the Republic of Donetsk». Released due to the Russian authorities involvement. Dubinsky said he would call back himself two days later to agree on a place and exact time. But he did not call back and did not answer the calls. On April 24, three weeks after our conversation, I managed to contact Dubinsky again. That time he said that my mediation in transferring the message was irrelevant, since he had communicated with Tiunov himself those days, and the last one promised to send him an e-mail. «Hmuriy’s» voice was extremely alarming. The question of whether his voice sounds on the SBU records or not, Dubinsky left without an answer. Tiunov denied the fact of his recent communicating with Dubinsky. Dossier:  Sergey Dubinsky received the allowance from the Ministry of Defense of Russia in 2015 There is a lot of information about a man named Sergey Nikolaevich Dubinsky, who uses the call sign "Hmuriy", from open sources. Dubinsky also willingly reports a lot of curious things about himself, that is similar with Igor Strelkov-Girkin, another prominent figure of the Ukrainian war. He has accounts in the «Vkontakte» and «Facebook» social networks where he chats actively with his former comrades-in-arms and discusses near-war themes and even conflicts with them. At the forum of veterans of the 181st motorized rifle regiment that participated in the Afghan war, the name of Sergey Dubinsky is listed among the servicemen of the intelligence troop. The forum was founded in 2010 by another veteran named Sergey Tulupov, and since that time Dubinsky wrote 365 posts under the nickname «Karakhan» (the user's registration details include his real name) at the forum. At the forum, Dubinsky wrote that he was born on August 9, 1962; from 1985 to 1987, he served in Afghanistan, and from 2002 to 2004 he served in Chechnya in the rank of colonel of the Main (Intelligence) Directorate of the Russian Army; from 2014, Dubinsky participated in the war in the south-east of Ukraine where he was a creator and the first head of military intelligence of the «Donetsk People's Republic». In 2015, Dubinsky left his post and moved to Rostov. As it became known to Novaya Gazeta, Sergei Dubinsky received payments from the Russian Defense Ministry at least until mid-2015 (more than 300 thousand rubles in 2015). As Novaya Gazeta got to know, Sergey Dubinsky received payments from the Russian Defense Ministry at least until mid-2015 (more than 300 thousand rubles in 2015). In a telephone conversation, Dubinsky informed me that he did not remember receiving any money from the RF Ministry of Defense. «Besides the [military] pension, I don’t remember that I received anything. No, no, well, there was more... Ah! There were old disability payments, probably in 2015. Well, not by disability, but by old injury. I received about 300 thousand [rubles] of payments by disability and injury, but now only the pension is given to me from the Ministry of Defense". Dubinsky almost did not communicate with reporters. It is known only about two interviews with him. At the end of 2014, Anastasia Mikhailovskaya, a journalist and colleague of Igor Strelkov-Girkin, recorded an interview with Dubinsky for the Zavtra newspaper. During the conversation with me, she confirmed that Dubinsky used the nickname «Petrovsky» and the call sign «Hmuriy», and Mikhailovskaya recognized him in pictures from the forum of fellow soldiers that I showed her. The MH17 topic was not touched on in the interview, but «Hmuriy» described in detail the DPR military intelligence service created by him («Our subversive and reconnaissance operations are conducted daily»), and the long-standing acquaintance with Strelkov-Girkin in Chechnya («We worked together in from 50 to 80 operations»). According to Mikhailovskaya, Dubinsky agreed to an interview with her after the journalist organized an actor Ivan Okhlobystin’s visit to Donetsk. Their joint pictures later appeared on Sergey Dubinsky’s account in Odnoklassniki. In 2003, the colonel «Hmuriy» figured in the Chechen reportage made by Vadim Rechkalov, Izvestia's military correspondent. Hmuriy» named himself as a «sabotage specialist» Petrovsky. Rechkalov presented large quotations of the officer in the text. «[I'm fighting] for the Russian people. For its small part, which is still preserved,» said colonel «Hmuriy». «And whom are you fighting with?» the military correspondent asked. «With those who do not want to live in Russia according to our Russian laws and do not want to pray to our faith». - Do you find it hard to kill people? Rechkalov asked. - Very hard. It is disgusting to realize that you are depriving a person of life. - But have you overcome it? - Hatred has helped me. I killed the first one in the battle during the first [Chechen] war, - answers «Hmutiy». - He aimed at me, but I shot first. When you kill in the battle from afar, this is not exactly murder. Murder is when you see the face of the one you are killing. Rechkalov died in early 2017, even earlier, Rechkalov’s family cottage burned down in the suburbs of Moscow, where the journalist kept audio tapes and photographs. A colleague from the close circle of Rechkalov, who asked not to be named (he is in the editorial office), informed me that the records of that Chechen interview also did not survive. However, he told me that shortly before his death, Rechkalov shared with him that he recognized the hero of his publication «Petrovsky» in «Hmuriy», whose talks were published by the JIT group. - Vadim was worried because of this,» his colleague remembered. - He initially reacted to the «Russian Spring» with sympathy, and even when the Boeing case happened, he thought that ours could not do that. Then these records of negotiations appeared, and he recognized the voice [of «Hmuriy»], whom he met then [in Chechnya]. For him, this fact was very painful. In his book «Safety circuit. Generation of the DPR» published in March 2017, Andrey Pinchuk, an ex-head of the DPR Ministry for State Security, mentioned that Dubinsky was the Deputy Minister of Defense of the DPR and headed the military intelligence of the self-proclaimed republic (GRU DPR). Mentioning «Hmuriy»-Dubinsky in Pinchuk's book caused a conflict among former colleagues. From his Facebook account, Sergey Dubinsky said that Pinchuk was spinning and distorting the facts. In response to the «Hmutiy’s» claim, Pinchuk wrote an article on the Politnavigator website, where he made it clear that Dubinsky's public indignation was out of place in his situation. «But if the demonstrated trend continues, it will be necessary to give expanded and detailed comments on the diversity of «Hmuriy’s» activities with relevant conclusions and consequences,» Pinchuk wrote. For my request to tell more about the mentioned activity, the ex-head of the DPR Ministry for State Security answered that he was ready to talk on any topic, but he did not want to talk about Dubinsky. I was told about the fact that Dubinsky had a page in Facebook, by Alexander Chalenko, a journalist of the Politnavigator, who personally met with him in Rostov in November 2016. Then there was a conference of the Donbass veterans in the city, convened by Alexander Boroday,  the first head of the DPR. Chalenko took a short interview from «Hmuriy». Vera Girkina, Igor Strelkov’s former wife, who also came to the conference, saw «Hmuriy». «In fact, he behaved very modestly not communicating with anyone much,» Girkina told me. Via his Facebook account, Dubinsky actively communicates with other prominent persons of the «Russian Spring», for example, with Igor Bezler, a former «People's Mayor» of Gorlovka, and Alexander Kofman, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the DPR, and Vadim Pogodin, a commander of the «Kerch» battalion. «The communication is quite open and frank, as people have so many memories,» says Chalenko. The Ukrainian negotiator Vladimir Ruban also takes part in charting with the separatists. According to the stories of prominent figures of the «Russian spring», «Hmuriy» was expelled from the DPR for fraud and appropriating property from local residents. In his article, Andrei Pinchuk also hints at this. The editors cannot confirm the information, but we have managed to find out that on his return from Donetsk to Rostov in 2015, Sergey Dubinsky registered several cars, including the luxury SUV Volkswagen Tiguan, in his name. Expertise of the voice Despite the fact that we received evidence from several different sources that the voice of «Hmuriy» on the SBU and JIT records belongs to the colonel Sergey Dubinsky, the editors decided to conduct a phonoscopic study. We turned to specialists from the Moscow Bureau of independent expertise «Version» with a request to study the recording of my telephone conversation with Dubinsky. And to compare it with the sample of the «Hmuriy’s» voice recorded during the interception in July 2014. Having asked about the context in detail, the Bureau «Version» told me that the study could turn into «serious political consequences» for the company, and asked for time to think. We understood that the experts could refuse to conduct phonoscopy for understandable reasons. However, the bureau told us that it would take up work and moreover the research would not take a lot of time. The next day, Yuri Makeev, a radio engineer from Moscow, prepared a technical analysis* containing conclusions that astonished us. The substantive part of the expert's conclusion ** was presented on one page; Yury Makeyev said that when studying the samples presented, «it was not possible to carry out reliable identification studies of the persons involved according to the voice and sounding speech because of low characteristics in terms of bit rate, total stream, bit depth and frequency». * Technical analysis is studying acoustic parameters of the voice, such as timbre, frequency, etc. In contrast to the linguistic analysis, which strictly requires appropriate education and qualifications of the expert, it can be conducted by a person having technical education. ** «Conclusion of a specialist» is a legal term from the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, which denotes a judgment on the questions for a specialist. In contrast to the conclusion of an expert (appointed in the framework of the criminal process), it is not a fact-finding study or proof. However, in the next paragraph, the radio engineer who did not have any linguistic education, gave a linguistic assessment of the talks between «Hmuriy» and «Buryat» published by the JIT (spelling and punctuation preserved: P.K.): «Dynamics, motor skills, abertonation, composition and structure of the pauses of the hezitation, emotional richness of voices and sounding speech of the figurants testify pronouncing learned texts or reading the texts from carriers within the framework of telephone dialogues». Then Makeev made a conclusion that on the tape, published by the Security Service of Ukraineon the day after the MH17crash, voice simulated Dubinsky's voice, sounded. «The study <...> indicates a significant difference in the frequency of the fundamental tone, and partial coincidence in terms of abertonation, style and speech, which, with the greatest probability and taking into account the structure of the material, indicates an attempt to imitate voice and sounding speech». We learned even more unexpected facts from the radio-electronic engineer personally. During the meeting in his laboratory, he told a little about himself. «I am from Rostov and an officer, by the way,» said Makeyev. «And I went to the DPRto bring them humanitarian help, and I also worked with fighters with my call sign ... So I can tell you for sure that nobody in the DPR will not call each other even on the patronymic in the talks, as you have in the file! He is called Nikolaich there, so it's just impossible!» Having received such a result, we thought that this research could be completed. However, we decided to reinsure ourselves and, just to order another study for any case... Research No.2 On behalf of the editorial board of Novaya Gazeta, I asked the experts on the speech analysis from the Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg to conduct a new study of two voices. The analysis was carried out in the laboratory Voxalys (carries out forensic examinations by order of the Swedish prosecutor's office, police and courts) using the «blind test» method without immersion in the context and in accordance to the instructions of the International Association of Criminalistic Phonetics and Acoustics (IAFPA). We did not say the experts about when, with whom and for what reason the recording we gave them as materials for research, was said. It was important for us that experts were not subject to any influence (of the current political moment). Jonas Lindh, a criminalistics analyst and member of the IAFPA executive committee, supervised the study. Swedish experts analyzed only technical (acoustic) parameters such as tone, frequency and timbre of voices. To assess the similarity, the experts from the University of Gothenburg used a nine-point scale, approved by the Swedish National Forensic Science Center. +4 corresponds to the highest degree of coincidence of the researched voices (« the voices on the records belong to one person with extremely high degree of probability»), -4 corresponds to the smallest degree ("the voices on the records belong to different persons with extremely high degree of probability "), and a neutral indicator of 0 points indicates the impossibility for the experts to calculate the likelihood of similarity / difference. Having spent 10 days on the study, the Swedes prepared a forensic report where they reported that the records represented a small but sufficient amount of material. So the results of their research testified to the hypothesis that the compared voices samples belonged to the same person - +2 points. DOCUMENT. CONCLUSION OF EXPERTISE   +2. The result of the examination support that the compared speech material originated from the same person. This strictly technical analysis and other evidence collected by us, confirm that the voice of «Hmuriy» (Nikolaich), the organizer of the Buk complex transportation on the Donbass territory, belongs to Sergey Dubinsky, a Russian officer. His comrade-in-arms Tiunov insists that Dubinsky had no intention of attacking the plane with civilians on board but there was a mistake, an excess. Novaya Gazeta is collecting more evidence.

Tax plan: President Trump plans to present his new tax plan on Wednesday. Businesses will be interested to see if Trump explicitly pushes for the 15% corporate tax rate he promised during the campaign. Another key question is whether Trump calls for real tax reform or just fleeting tax cuts. The plan is likely to face a couple major hurdles: Tax cuts are expensive, and Trump risks angering deficit hawks if he hasn't found a way to make up for the lost revenue. Democrats are unlikely to vote for the proposal without major concessions. "Stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill," said Kathleen Brooks, the research director at City Index. 2. Boeing earnings: Boeing will release its quarterly earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday. The company said earlier this month that the number of planes it delivered in the first quarter dipped this year compared to 2016. Investors will be looking for any comments on Boeing's efforts to sell airliners to Iran. Relations between Iran and the U.S. have been strained under Trump, who has been critical of the nuclear deal that was signed under the Obama administration. The deal made the Boeing sales possible. 3. Earnings bonanza: A slew of major companies will report their quarterly results on Wednesday. Anthem, Boeing, Dr Pepper Snapple, PepsiCo, Fiat Chrysler and Procter & Gamble are among the firms set to release earnings before the opening bell. PayPal and Amgen will follow after the close. 4. Global market overview: U.S. stock futures were flat early on Wednesday. Most European markets opened lower, as the French election rally began to fade. Asian markets ended the session higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.1% higher on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 added 0.6%. The Nasdaq increased 0.7% to surpass the 6,000 point milestone. Oil prices dipped further below $50 per barrel ahead of the latest U.S. crude inventories report at 10:30 a.m. ET. 5. Stock market movers -- Kering: Kering, the owner of luxury brand Gucci, shot up 10% in early trading in Paris after it reported record sales in the first three months of the year. Wynn Resorts Ltd shares were set to open higher after the company reported strong earnings. 6. Coming this week: Wednesday -- Steve Mnuchin speaks on tax reform; Twitter reports earnings; Crude oil inventories report Thursday -- Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon report earnings; ECB meeting; U.S. trade balance data Friday -- GM earnings; U.S. and U.K. first quarter GDP data TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Tax plan: President Trump plans to present his new tax plan on Wednesday. Businesses will be interested to see if Trump explicitly pushes for the 15% corporate tax rate he promised during the campaign. Another key question is whether Trump calls for real tax reform or just fleeting tax cuts. The plan is likely to face a couple major hurdles: Tax cuts are expensive, and Trump risks angering deficit hawks if he hasn’t found a way to make up for the lost revenue. Democrats are unlikely to vote for the proposal without major concessions. “Stocks may pause on Wednesday as the market waits for the reaction from Congress who actually has to pass the bill,” said Kathleen Brooks, the research director at City Index. 2. Boeing earnings: Boeing will release its quarterly earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday. The company said earlier this month that the number of planes it delivered in the first quarter dipped this year compared to 2016. Investors will be looking for any comments on Boeing’s efforts to sell airliners to Iran. Relations between Iran and the U.S. have been strained under Trump, who has been critical of the nuclear deal that was signed under the Obama administration. The deal made the Boeing sales possible. 3. Earnings bonanza: A slew of major companies will report their quarterly results on Wednesday. Anthem, Boeing, Dr Pepper Snapple, PepsiCo, Fiat Chrysler and Procter & Gamble are among the firms set to release earnings before the opening bell. PayPal and Amgen will follow after the close. 4. Global market overview: U.S. stock futures were flat early on Wednesday. Most European markets opened lower, as the French election rally began to fade. Asian markets ended the session higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.1% higher on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 added 0.6%. The Nasdaq increased 0.7% to surpass the 6,000 point milestone. Oil prices dipped further below $50 per barrel ahead of the latest U.S. crude inventories report at 10:30 a.m. ET. 5. Stock market movers — Kering: Kering, the owner of luxury brand Gucci, shot up 10% in early trading in Paris after it reported record sales in the first three months of the year. Wynn Resorts Ltd shares were set to open higher after the company reported strong earnings. 6.

By Pramod Sharma April 26, 2017 09:46 BST Boeing's 737 MAX-9 is pictured under construction at their production facility in Renton, Washington, U.S.,Reuters Boeing is said to be coming close to a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 jet within a two-month window. The decision to launch the 737 MAX10 is being undertaken as a response to counter the robust sales of competitor Airbus' A321neo, Reuters reported on Tuesday (April 25). The Boeing 737 MAX10 would be an upgrade over the currently supplied 737-9, which can seat up to 220 passengers. By comparison, the Airbus A321neo, which dominates sales over the 737-9 by a ratio of 3:1, can seat up to 240 passengers. The companies are fiercely competing with each other in an attempt to capture a larger share of the top end of the narrowbody jet market. The market is valuated to be worth $2tn (£1.5tn)over 20 years. "Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X," a spokesman told Reuters. "No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative." Forbes contributor Scott Hamilton has said that Boeing had undertaken a soft launch of the 737 MAX10 model during the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading (ISTAT) in San Diego earlier last month. Hamilton also questioned the interest of airline companies in purchasing the Boeing 737 MAX 10, and mentioned that low cost airlines could be a potential target for the firm. "By the time the MAX 10 enters service in 2020, Boeing will be only a few years away—perhaps just two or three—from launching a replacement for the entire 737 family," he added. "Buying the MAX 10 will be like buying last year's automobile model. There will be something newer, shinier and more advanced just around the corner."

sources 1 day ago Boeing is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus, sources told Reuters. Roselle Chen reports. Video Transcript Boeing is close to launching the 737 MAX 10X to counter strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, sources told Reuters. The plan is to unveil the new jet at the Paris Airshow in June. Reuters sources say, Boeing is talking to airlines and expects to sell 1,000 of the fuel-efficient, long-range planes. It could begin delivery in 2020 if airlines start ordering this year. But, asked for comment, Boeing said no decision has been taken, and it's too early to talk about launch. Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt (SPUNDBITE) HENRY H. HARTEVELDT, PRESIDENT & TRAVEL INDUSTRY ANALYST, ATMOSPHERE RESEARCH GROUP (ENGLISH) SAYING: "It's a long-haul airplane. It's not designed to be short-haul flying. And Boeing wants this to be competitive, both for defensive reasons to get sales that would otherwise go to Airbus, but also it's a stop-gap in the Boeing product mix. Right now, the largest plane that Boeing has is the 737 MAX 9, which can carry approximately 189 - 200 people, and, while that's good, some airlines want more capacity." The 737 jetliner has been Boeing's best selling product for the past fifty years. The company is making four new 737 versions, including MAX 10X. But the new planes are coming to market just as demand for aircraft has slowed. Multimedia gallery Tough times ahead?

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — US aerospace giant Boeing has received a nearly $50 million contract to extend the service life of the Super-Hornet combat jets beyond the original flight hour service life, the Department of Defense said in a press release. "The Boeing Company [of] St. Louis, Missouri, is being awarded a $49.7 million… [contract] to extend the service life of the F/A-18E/F beyond the original design of the 6,000 flight hour service life,” the release stated on Tuesday. © Photo: Lockheed Martin NeverEnding Story: Pentagon Awards $109M to Upgrade F-35's Hardware, SoftwareUS Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a comparison of the hugely expensive and controversial Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Aircraft and the F/A-18 not long after President Donald Trump was inaugurated. Around the same time Boeing which manufactures the F/A-18, circulated a document suggesting that the Navy had a "significant capability gaps against emerging threats" with the F-35, according to the Navy Times, and that updating the F/A-18 was more efficient that buying new F-35s. ...

(Photo: Jeff Baenen / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Last year was considered by some to be less-than-stellar for commercial aerospace and defense, but both sectors are projecting healthier growth this year. In fact, total world spending in the commercial aerospace and defense industries will continue to rise in the foreseeable future, thanks in large part to an increased demand for passenger air travel and cargo delivery and escalating tensions in some of the world’s toughest neighborhoods. The upsurge in defense spending will be a boon to the more than 3,300 local companies that support the industry, which currently employs 94,000 workers with an average annual income of more than $91,000, according to the Detroit Regional Chamber. In the aerospace industry, Moody’s Investor Service projects a 7 percent gain in commercial aviation sales in 2017. Along with easy credit terms and growing air traffic, the drop in fuel costs will continue to stimulate airline profits while boosting orders for additional planes. According to the Economist, however, this could be a mixed blessing for aircraft manufacturers since it also reduces the need for fuel-efficient models that manufacturers have so heavily invested in during recent years. Much of the shift in product demand can be attributed to new Asian airline upstarts that favor narrow-bodied jets rather than the wider ones — good news for Airbus A320 “neos” but not so great for Boeing’s 737 MAX’s. Despite this, it is hardly a zero-sum proposition for these two competitors given the industry’s overall growth projections. Case in point: IHS Aerospace, Defense & Security points to a strong backlog of new orders for passenger and cargo jets that will exceed $317 billion in sales by 2018, almost double that of 2013. To be sure, Boeing’s current orders of 5,800 planes along with Airbus’ pipeline of 6,400 jets ensures that their respective supply chains will remain occupied for the next decade or so. As for defense, worldwide military spending in 2017 should increase from last year’s $1.57 trillion by 3.2 percent, to $1.89 trillion. Predictably leading the pack is the U.S., with budget outlays slightly north of $635 billion, assuming the Trump Administration’s request to eliminate the sequestration and increase appropriations for more jet fighters, navy ships and enhanced battlefield readiness is approved by a recalcitrant Congress. In addition to the U.S., the other top-five spending nations are a distant China ($211 billion), India ($57 billion), U.K. ($54 billion) and Saudi Arabia ($47 billion). Noticeably absent from the list this year — and, for that matter, last year — is Russia. Kremlin planners have been stung by Western economic sanctions imposed in response to their foray into neighboring Ukraine. Moreover, world oil and gas prices, which constitute Moscow’s number one export and foreign currency earner, have spiraled precipitously downward in the last five years. Broadly speaking, most of the defense spending outside the U.S. will be concentrated in the usual trouble spots in the Middle East (e.g., Oman, Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E.) in response to threats posed by Iran, ISIS, and the simmering civil war in Syria; Southeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, Philippines, and Vietnam) to restrain Beijing’s adventurism in the East and South China Seas; and India, which is long overdue for a next-gen modernization of its dated weapon systems. But make no mistake: the Pentagon still outspends the next nine top-spending nations combined, constituting almost 40 percent of total global defense spending. Growth in the aerospace and defense sectors is also significant because these industries are at the forefront of innovation and technological development, which cross-pollinate into other previously disparate sectors of our economy. Indeed, our nation’s future success depends on this spillover effect and wide-scale adoption of high-tech manufacturing processes practiced by aviation and defense to ensure our nation’s global competitiveness in 2017 and beyond.

While the "Mad Money" host is skeptical about the plan passing Congress, he looked at how a corporate tax cut from 36 percent down to 15 percent could change the stock market layout. "There are a lot of investors on the sidelines waiting for this market to come down to a more reasonable price," Cramer said. "What happens if so many companies are suddenly making more money because they have a lower tax rate? I bet it that would force billions and billions of dollars into the stock market in a virtuous circle of wealth creation." Still, for the moment, Cramer still recommends staying the course. And while investors should keep tax cuts in mind as a potential blessing on their portfolios, don't count on them too heavily. "Should you buy stocks in anticipation of this huge tax cut? The answer is point blank: no. The truth is we have no idea what will pass, and I seriously doubt this current plan can make it through Congress," the "Mad Money" host said. Susana Gonzalez | Bloomberg | Getty Images When PepsiCo, Boeing, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments all reported great earnings numbers but saw their stocks go down, Cramer decided to investigate. "The answer is that nothing's really wrong with any of these companies except their stocks simply got ahead of themselves. Investors got so excited that they bid them up to unsustainable levels," the "Mad Money" host said. In reality, the market's reaction was not an accurate reflection of the companies' successes, but a product of lofty expectations that came from each stock's massive run. "We can't ask, 'What's wrong?' We have to say, 'This is our chance.' And that's exactly what I think PepsiCo, Boeing, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments are worth buying right here," Cramer said. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images Then, Cramer spoke with Jim Fish, the president and CEO of Waste Management, a waste and recycling giant that saw its stock slide on earnings despite meeting expectations. Some of the market's nerves were wrought when the company reported timid guidance, which Fish attributed to a large drop in Waste Management's recycling business tied to Chinese buyers halting their purchases of recyclable newspaper material. "We're still feeling pretty optimistic about recycling right now, very optimistic," Fish told Cramer on Wednesday. "We just didn't want to raise guidance with something that doesn't have great visibility to it." And with corporate tax cuts now more concretely on the federal government's slate, Fish said he is looking forward to their benefits, saying the company would look into acquisitions as a first step. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Pipelines run toward oil storage tanks at the Enbridge Cushing storage terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. Finally, with investors on the lookout for high-quality stocks that could be lifted by the president's policies, Cramer turned to one unusual energy play that could be one of the biggest winners. By acquiring Spectra Energy, Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge became the largest energy infrastructure company in North America. That positioned it to gain from U.S. projects, being that it operates the longest crude oil and gas liquids transportation system in the world. "Yep, the president may have run on an America First platform, and he's suddenly started to get very tough on trade with Canada, but that doesn't change the fact that right now, one of my favorite Trump stocks is a Canadian company," the "Mad Money" host said. In Cramer's lightning round, Cramer flew through his take on some caller favorite stocks: Sanofi: "I like that stock. I've got to tell you, [it's] got a good yield. Mostly what I really like is they've got that big position in Regeneron. They should merge and really kill it." Micron Technology: "This is very tough, because what happened is the price has spiked so much that people believe that they may have actually ruined the demand curve. And Seagate reported a number today that people didn't regard as being as strong as they'd like, so it's pulled down everybody. I think Micron is fine. It's just not in the explosive phase anymore because people keep thinking there's going to be one day [where] there's too many DRAMs, and then boom. But I don't think that day is here yet. I think we're OK. I'm no longer as confident as I've been saying because we've liked that from the teens." Questions for Cramer?

This resource illustrates the mathematical modeling functionality of COMSOL Multiphysics® software and how it can be used by simulation experts to overcome design challenges that, among other issues, are not always possible to resolve experimentally. Read to learn how engineers across a wide range of industries used multiphysics simulation to improve critical aspects of product design. One story highlights how Boeing used multiphysics simulation to model thermal expansion in protective coatings for aircraft composites, which allowed engineers to use a lighter material, and still maintain sufficient lightning protection. An electrically conductive expanded metal foil (EMF) inner layer was added to the composite structure such that excess current and heat would dissipate rapidly in the event of lightning. However, thermal cycling induces stress that can result in cracks in the coating, which is not ideal for the EMF. Engineers at Boeing used COMSOL Multiphysics® software to optimize EMF layer design, balancing current-carrying capacity, displacement due to thermally induced movement of protective layers, and weight, to create an optimized design that is both lightweight and protective against lightning. Another article describes how the car manufacturer, Toyota, optimized topology for improved cooling in their hybrid vehicles. Toyota’s hybrid vehicles contain complex electrical systems that contain power semiconductor devices such as diodes and insulated gate bipolar transistors that are used for power conversion. To keep the systems within thermal operating conditions, the devices are mounted on aluminum heat sinks, around which a water/glycol coolant mixture is pumped. Engineers at the Toyota Research Institute of North America (TRI-NA) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, used simulation to redesign the topology of the aluminum heat sink to reduce the size by half while dissipating the same amount of heat. Miele, the German manufacturer of induction stoves, is also highlighted in the Manager’s Guide. Engineers at MieleTec FH Bielefeld (a joint research laboratory between Miele & Cie. KG and the University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld, Germany) used COMSOL Multiphysics® to solve important design challenges in the development of their induction stoves. Simulating the induction heating process involved solving heat transfer concurrently with electromagnetics to determine the best operating conditions, materials, and geometry. Making use of simulation, the engineers were able to reduce the number of experiments needed to finalize their designs by 80%. Continue reading here to see how companies in industries ranging from auto manufacturing to graphene and plasmonics incorporated multiphysics simulation into their work flow to optimize production design.

Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. “The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is,” Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. “I haven’t heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we’ll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it’s not being factored into the market yet.” In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.22 percent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90 The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 percent and 1.1. percent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 percent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company's margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts' expectations. “We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. “The quality of the quarter was disappointing,” Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. “Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated.” Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration’s intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. "It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges," Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 percent increase from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index advanced 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, as did France’s CAC40 Index.

"The answer is that nothing's really wrong with any of these companies except their stocks simply got ahead of themselves. Investors got so excited that they bid them up to unsustainable levels," the "Mad Money" host said. In reality, the market's reaction was not an accurate reflection of the companies' successes, but a product of lofty expectations that came from each stock's massive run. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer: Why these 4 stocks went down after spectacular earnings reports    8 Hours Ago | 05:02 Take PepsiCo. "It delivered you exactly what we've come to expect from [CEO] Indra Nooyi's PepsiCo, a dependable set of numbers with great execution and a lot more organic growth that Coca-Cola," Cramer said. So why did its stock go down when it reported? Because PepsiCo's shares ran up from $103 in February to $114 heading into the quarter, one of the best moves in the packaged goods space. "PEP just isn't going to be rewarded for doing its usual great stuff after that kind of advance," Cramer said. "So you get this kind of pullback, the kind of pullback that lasts for a couple of days and then you buy." Aerospace giant Boeing saw a similar effect on its stock after surprising the market with strong cash flows and order numbers as well as belated gains from its newest airplane, the Dreamliner. Cramer argued that the stock had already seen a massive run from $142 to $184 after the U.S. election, partly due to President Donald Trump's victory and partly because of better-than-expected earnings. "Even though the numbers were terrific, though, it wasn't terrific enough. I don't know if anything could have been enough to move the stock higher after that move," he said. Procter & Gamble's earnings were not particularly stunning to Cramer, though the household goods and personal products maker still beat estimates. The company's organic growth has been lagging at 1 percent, but when Nelson Peltz's activist fund Trian Partners took a $3.5 billion position in the stock in February, it soared above $90 and has hovered near that high since. "You need to understand that while the quarter wasn't anything fabulous, Nelson Peltz is pretty much the only large, engaged investor where it's paid to buy the stock he likes after he's announced a position," Cramer said. "This is your chance to piggy back on his yet unannounced plan for what he wants to do with Procter. I think it's a gift to get it down here at $87." Finally, Texas Instruments' stellar quarter seemed to have left the market wanting more after the semiconductor play's tear from $67 just before the election to $82 ahead of its report. "It had to do far more than magnificently if it was going to do what the stocks of Caterpillar or McDonald's or DuPont did, report some number that seemed insanely better, almost alchemy," Cramer said. "It didn't. It's consistent. Consistency means no surprises [and] solid numbers." At the end of the day, all investors want to own the stocks of companies that continue to outperform and occasionally shock the market with incredible results. "But we also need reliable, consistent performers that allow us to sleep at night, and if possible, we want to buy those at a discount," Cramer said. "We can't ask, 'What's wrong?' We have to say, 'This is our chance.' And that's exactly what I think PepsiCo, Boeing, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments are worth buying right here." Questions for Cramer?

"The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is," Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. "I haven't heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we'll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it's not being factored into the market yet." In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 per cent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased 0.22 per cent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90. The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 per cent and 1.1per cent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 per cent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company's margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts' expectations. "We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets," PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. "The quality of the quarter was disappointing," Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. "Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated." Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration's intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. "It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges," Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 per cent increase from the previous close. Germany's DAX Index advanced 0.1 per cent, while the UK's FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 per cent, as did France's CAC40 Index. - BusinessDesk By Margreet Dietz Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

(U.S. Air Force) The U.S. test fired the Boeing (BA)-made Minuteman III missile amid growing tensions with North Korea over the Kim regime’s nuclear program. Continue Reading Below The Minuteman III is an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of carrying nuclear warheads. When it was built in the 1970s, each missile had a price tag of $7 million, or more than $40 million in current dollars. Since the initial production run, the Air Force has made upgrades to the Minuteman III including modern targeting systems. The missile test, conducted from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, sent a Minuteman III about 4,200 miles to a test range in the Marshall Islands. Col. John Moss, 30th Space Wing commander, said the launch “was an important demonstration of our nation’s nuclear deterrent capability.” “Test launches like this one are vital to validating the effectiveness and readiness of our operational nuclear systems, so it is critical that they are successful,” Col. Moss added.

(U.S. Department of Defense, Missile Defense Agency/Handout via Reuters) Also on Wednesday, the U.S. began installing an anti-missile battery in South Korea to defend against threats from North Korea. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, made by Lockheed Martin (LMT), is expected to be operational in South Korea in a matter of days, according to congressional testimony by Adm. Harry Harris, head of U.S. Pacific Command. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy recently deployed a strike group led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson to the region. The Pentagon’s moves come as the White House is scheduled on Wednesday to host the entire Senate for a briefing on North Korea. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will lead the meeting, the White House said. Majority leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said he asked the Trump administration to update all senators on the issue. “Kim Jong-Un has, by all appearances, broken from a predictable cycle of escalation demonstrated by previous leaders, where the regime takes a provocative action, draws the U.S. into a negotiation, and extracts concessions. Instead, Kim appears willing to risk the disapproval of the U.N. and our regional allies by undertaking a breakneck testing program,” Sen. McConnell said in a statement ahead of the briefing.

That's their loss.

Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr The miss on the top line — Boeing’s fourth in the past six quarters — apparently has made investors gun-shy about buying BA stock near 52-week highs. It’s fair reasoning. However, considering that Boeing’s cash flow is still on the rise, and factoring in shares’ 3.2% dividend yield, BA stock still looks like a bargain. Here’s why. Another Solid Boeing Quarter For the quarter that ended in March, the Chicago-based defense company reported adjusted earnings of $2.01 per share — a 15.5% improvement year-over-year, and easily better than analyst estimates of $1.94 per share. The troubling point was Q1 revenue, which declined 7.2% YOY to $20.98 billion, missing consensus estimates of $21.34 billion. “With a sharp focus on performance and productivity, our team delivered another quarter of solid financial results, including year-over-year earnings growth and strong operating cash flow,” Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. “In turn, we continued to position Boeing for growth with investments in new products and services, innovation, and our people, while again demonstrating our commitment to return significant cash to our shareholders.” Looking forward, though, it’s hard to see anything other than blue skies. Boeing raised its full-year earnings per share forecast to a range of $10.35 to $10.55 from a prior range of $10.25 to $10.45 per share. BA also raised its adjusted full-year outlook to $9.20 to $9.40 from a prior range of $9.10 to $9.30. Revenue is expected to range from $90.5 billion to $92.5 billion. The Bottom Line for BA Stock Boeing has resorted to cost cutting in recent quarters to offset the decline in revenue. The company’s plan to scale back on its engineering workforce in June is one recent example. At the same time, however, Boeing currently has a $473 billion backlog of aircraft orders with more than 5,700 commercial airplane orders it can still rely on. The company expects to deliver between 765 to 800 planes this year, well above 2016 deliveries. Boeing has already announced 198 net orders for first quarter, compared to just 121 in the year-ago quarter. The fact Boeing believes it can achieve its delivery goals on a lower engineering headcount means more profits will trickle down to the bottom line. In that vein, Boeing management –which still forecast 2017 core earnings to be in the range of $9.10 to $9.30 per share — is focused on returning value to shareholders. And when factoring President Donald Trump’s promise to increase defense spending, the attractive combination of income and value from BA stock could appeal to patient investors with long-term horizons. Plus, with the company still forecasting higher deliveries for fiscal 2017, combined with rising free cash flow, Boeing stock can still pay. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The group, Divest This Time at GW, wants the university to divest from companies like Boeing, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, and Lockheed Martin, according to the resolution obtained by Campus Reform and reported Wednesday. The resolution alleges that Boeing built the attack helicopter Israeli Defense Forces operate in Gaza. It also accuses Caterpillar of providing the Israeli government with bulldozers they later used to destroy Palestinian homes. “Palestinians suffer mistreatment from these companies,” said resolution co-sponsor Jack Jomarron to Campus Reform. “We have Palestinian students at our university and our endowment should not be investing in the mistreatment of our peers and, in general, we shouldn’t engage in investments that profit off of human suffering.” Jomarron argued for transparency in universities investments. “Socially conscious investing is something I feel passionate about as a student leader and student advocate. I would support other measures that divest from problematic companies,” explained the student. “This was something that was brought to me. If other measures/legislation/movements to divest from problematic situations were brought to me, I would support them as I did this.” Pro-Israel groups at GW, including GW for Israel and Chabad Colonials, are coordinating to oppose the resolution. Maralee Csellar, the Director of Media Relations at George Washington University, told The Daily Caller News Foundation that it was “too soon to comment on a student proposal that has not been finalized or voted upon.” Follow Rob Shimshock on Twitter Connect with Rob Shimshock on Facebook Send tips to [email protected] .

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 26, 2017 12:46pm   Comments Share: Even though earnings might be a little overshadowed by the big tax reform announcement planned for today, that won’t likely  detract from the mostly positive first-quarter results across sectors. Dow components Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG), and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) all reported earnings this morning that beat expectations. UTX’s revenue also beat expectations, but revenue for PG and BA came in slightly below forecasts. Next up, Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) and MGM Resorts International (NYSE: MGM) report before market open tomorrow, April 27.    Under Armour: What Might Be in Store After Tough Q4? It’s been a tough environment for brick-and-mortar retailers in general, but it’s been particularly tough for sporting goods retailers. There’s been a string of bankruptcies as ecommerce disrupted the industry, the largest being Sports Authority when it liquidated in 2016 and shuttered all its locations. That can put pressure on companies’ such as UA and Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE) wholesale business, but it also can pressure profit margins as full-price products struggle to compete with cheaper merchandise being liquidated in store closings—two impacts commonly cited over the past year on sporting apparel companies’ earnings calls. UA is expected to post a loss of $0.04 per share—its first projected loss in the past 8 quarters—on revenue of $1.1 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. Up until last quarter, the company had 26 consecutive quarters of revenue growth over 20%. UA and UAA, the two classes of the company’s stock, lost about half their value over the past year. The options market has priced in about a 8.4% potential stock move in either direction around UA’s earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim platform. In short-term options trading at the April 28 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 19 and 20 strike prices while puts were active at the 17 and 17.5 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 56th percentile. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Gambling and Casinos with MGM Earnings Vegas might be the thing that comes to most people’s minds when they think of casinos, but attention has been increasingly shifting to Macau—Asia’s gambling mecca. Macau gaming revenue, a metric widely followed by casino analysts, jumped 13% in the first three months this year. Many analysts think that increase could potentially translate into higher profits for casinos with operations there. Instinet analyst Harry Curtis recently pointed out MGM has been heavily investing in new projects, including its new $3 billion MGM Cotai in Macau. Curtis expects free cash flow to increase significantly once those projects end, allowing it to potentially increase dividends or buy back shares.  For the first quarter, MGM is expected to report earnings of $0.26 per share--up $0.13 from Q1 2016—on revenue of $2.6 billion, according to consensus third-party analyst estimates. The company missed analyst earnings estimates by a wide margin in the last quarter, causing the stock to tumble 9.3% in trading that day. The options market has priced in about a 4% potential stock move in either direction around MGM’s earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator. In short-term options trading at the April 28 weekly expiration, calls were active at the 28.5 and 29 strike prices while puts were active at the 28 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 51st percentile.  If you haven’t had a chance, check out what might be expected when Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) report earnings this week.

The Boeing Co. reports earnings, Wednesday, April 26, 2017. (AP Photo/Mic Smith) Posted: Wednesday, April 26, 2017 10:16 am | Updated: 10:45 am, Wed Apr 26, 2017. Boeing beats 1Q profit forecasts but revenue falls Associated Press | CHICAGO (AP) — Boeing topped expectations for first-quarter profit, but the aerospace giant's sales fell short of forecasts, and the shares fell in Wednesday-morning trading. Chicago-based Boeing Co. said Wednesday that it earned $1.45 billion in the first quarter. Excluding non-repeating gains, the profit came to $2.01 per share. The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was $1.91 per share. Revenue was $20.98 billion. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $21.44 billion. Boeing blamed the disappointing sales number on delayed deliveries of commercial and defense aircraft. The company delivered 169 commercial planes in the quarter, down from 176 a year earlier. Boeing said it planned for fewer deliveries of its workhorse 737 plane as it prepares to launch a new version next month. Revenue from sales of military planes plunged 28 percent, to $2.64 billion. Boeing expects full-year earnings in the range of $9.20 to $9.40 per share, an increase of a dime per share, as the company now expects a full-year tax rate of 31 percent instead of 32 percent. In morning trading, the shares were down $3.01, or 1.6 percent, to $180.50. _____ Elements of this story were generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

The company needs to make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. Advertisement Boeing Co.’s sales slumped as jet deliveries fell to the lowest in three years, ahead of the impending debut of a new version of the company’s best-selling plane. Revenue dropped 7.3% to $21 billion in the first quarter, about $200 million less than analysts had estimated. Weak sales overshadowed a surprise gain in free cash flow as the manufacturer kept costs in check and started to reap a long-awaited payoff from the 787 Dreamliner. The report spotlighted Boeing’s need to make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn’t boost the cash outlook -- a crucial number for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. “The stock has been a high flier for a while,” George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said on April 26. “People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report.” The shares fell 1.2% to $181.23 at 10:09 a.m. in New York, the second-biggest drop among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Boeing rose 18% this year through April 25. Popular Now GE Digital's Secret Weapon Five Elements to Include in a Compelling Business Case The Internet of Things (IoT): Opportunities for Smarter Supply Chains Commercial Margins Boeing had indicated the quarter would be the weakest of the year. Even so, the company posted the lowest profit margin for its commercial jetliner business since the first quarter of 2011 after excluding accounting charges, Seth Seifman, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to clients. While Boeing’s earnings were better than analysts predicted, most of the gain was driven by taxes and not operations, he said. The commercial airplane business posted an operating profit of $1.22 billion, an 18% gain from a year earlier, as services sales helped soften the impact from seven fewer jetliner deliveries. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets, the fewest since the first quarter of 2014, as it began to stockpile 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. The 8.5% operating margin for the unit was well below the mid-double-digits goal that Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has set for late decade. “Commercial profits were a little lighter than I would’ve expected,” said Howard Rubel, managing director at Jefferies. The defense business’s profit fell 10 percent to $737 million, as the company’s space business spent to develop satellites and a capsule to haul humans to space. The division’s operating margin rose to 11.3 percent from 10.3 percent. The second-largest U.S. defense contractor is poised to enjoy gains as the U.S. Navy orders F/A-18 Super Hornets to fill a gap created by late deliveries of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35C fighter. New 737 Boeing plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing’s factories. It represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane’s manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. Cash Flow First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what’s typically the company’s slowest period. Earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The per-share results also gained a boost from Boeing itself, which has been a major purchaser of its own stock in recent years. The manufacturer acquired 14.9 million shares for $2.5 billion during the quarter. It also paid $868 million in dividends, 30% more than a year ago. For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up from a previous estimate of $9.10 to $9.30, mainly because of a reduction in the expected tax rate. “With something for both bulls and bears to point to in this print, we’d expect shares to struggle to hang on to recent gains in early trading,” Carter Copeland, analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a report on April 26.

The company’s first-quarter expenses decreased 9.6% YOY to $17.3 billion and operating income was $2 billion, up 12.8% over an operating profit of $1.8 billion in the prior-year quarter. Boeing chairman, president and CEO Dennis Muilenburg credited “a sharp focus on performance and productivity” for the improved performance. The Commercial Airplanes unit posted a 0.6% YOY dip in revenue to $14.3 billion as commercial aircraft deliveries fell 4% to 169. Commercial Airplanes booked 198 net orders during the quarter and the company’s backlog at the end of the quarter stood at 5,700 aircraft valued at $417 billion. Boeing’s full-year guidance remained steady: it is sticking with projections of $90.5 billion-$92.5 billion for overall revenue; $62.5 billion-$63.5 billion for Commercial Airplanes’ revenue; and 760-765 commercial aircraft deliveries.

(NYSE: BA) reported first-quarter 2017 results before markets opened Wednesday. The aerospace company posted adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.01 on revenues of $20.98 billion. In the same period a year ago, the company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.74 on revenues of $22.63 billion. First-quarter results also compare to consensus estimates for EPS of $1.95 and $21.35 billion in revenues. On a GAAP basis, Boeing posted EPS of $2.34, which includes $315 million of unallocated pension and retirement benefits income. The company raised it GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. Boeing now expects GAAP EPS to rise from a prior range of $10.25 to $10.45 to a new range of $10.35 to $10.55. Adjusted EPS is now forecast to rise from between $9.10 and $9.30 to a new range of $9.20 to $9.40. Boeing still expects to deliver 760 to 765 new commercial aircraft this year and maintained its estimate of $10.75 billion in operating cash flow. Commercial jet deliveries slipped 4% compared with the first quarter of 2016, and revenues from commercial jets dipped 1%. Operating earnings rose 18% and operating margin rose 1.3 points to 8.5%. Boeing delivered 189 commercial planes in the first quarter and took new orders for 198, raising its backlog to more than 5,700 airplanes valued at $417 billion (actual sales price, not list price). Defense division revenue dropped 18%, from $7.96 billion to $6.53 billion. The division’s global services and support revenues fell 9% to $2.32 billion, an inauspicious signal for reaching a services and support revenue goal of $50 billion in 10 years. Boeing does not break out its commercial division’s services numbers, but one analyst estimates the total at $7 billion to $8 billion annually, and a grand total of around $17 billion for a full year for the defense division. Boeing’s deferred production costs on the 787 program fell to $226.99 billion, down by $316 million sequentially. Tooling and other nonrecurring costs for the program also declined, from $3.63 billion at the end of the third quarter to $3.58 billion. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said: With a sharp focus on performance and productivity, our team delivered another quarter of solid financial results, including year-over-year earnings growth and strong operating cash flow. In turn, we continued to position Boeing for growth with investments in new products and services, innovation, and our people, while again demonstrating our commitment to return significant cash to our shareholders. … We remain on track to achieve our full-year revenue, earnings and cash flow targets as our teams deliver on our large and diverse order backlog. As we do so, we’re focused on accelerating productivity, quality and safety improvements, strengthening execution on development programs, and capturing new business opportunities. During the quarter, the company repurchased 14.9 million shares for $2.5 billion and paid $868 million in dividends. Boeing said it had $11.5 billion remaining under its current buyback program. The stock traded down about 1.6% Wednesday’s morning to $180.47, in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $185.71. The consensus price target before the report was $181.90.

Photographer: Travis Dove/Bloomberg Boeing Co. surprised analysts by generating cash rather than burning it and reporting a first quarter profit that blew past estimates. Neither impressed investors. They focused instead on a disappointing 7.3 percent drop in revenue as the planemaker delivered the fewest jets since 2014. The quality of the earnings was another concern as Boeing’s profit benefited from a low tax rate, even as the commercial airplane business showed signs of strain. The report spotlighted Boeing’s need to make its factories more efficient as the company navigates a difficult aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn’t boost the cash outlook -- a concern for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. “It’s not a bad report, it’s just not a blockbuster,” George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Wednesday. “The stock has been rolling and people clearly had high expectations.” The shares dipped 1 percent to $181.71 at the close in New York, the second-biggest drop among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Boeing has advanced 17 percent this year. Commercial Margins Boeing had indicated the quarter would be the weakest of the year. Even so, the company posted the lowest profit margin for its commercial jetliner business since the first quarter of 2011 after excluding accounting charges, Seth Seifman, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to clients. While Boeing’s earnings were better than analysts predicted, most of the gain was driven by taxes and not operations, he said. The commercial airplane business posted an operating profit of $1.22 billion, an 18 percent gain from a year earlier, as services sales helped soften the impact from seven fewer jetliner deliveries. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets as it stockpiled 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. The 8.5 percent operating margin for the unit was well below the mid-double-digits goal that Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg has set for late decade. The results were dinged by $120 million in costs to prepare the first KC-46 aerial tankers for delivery to the U.S. Air Force early next year, Greg Smith, Boeing’s chief financial officer and chief strategist, told analysts during a conference call. The defense business’s profit fell 10 percent to $737 million, as the company’s space business spent to develop satellites and a capsule to haul humans to space. The division’s operating margin rose to 11.3 percent from 10.3 percent. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace company, continues to seek new ways to improve profitability in a highly competitive and uncertain environment, Muilenburg said. The measures include investing in new sources of growth such as the proposed 737 Max 10 jet and a constellation of small satellites. Boeing is also bringing outsourced work back in-house, and closely managing a workforce that has shrunk by more than 27,000 people since the end of 2012. “Some of the tough affordability actions we’ve had to take have been necessary so we can continue to fuel our R&D and our innovation machine for the future,” Muilenburg said. New 737 Boeing plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance shrank by about $8.8 million for each 787 that rolled out of Boeing’s factories in the quarter, said Douglas Harned, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The deferred costs represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane’s manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. Cash Flow First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what’s typically the company’s slowest period. Earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The per-share results also gained a boost from Boeing itself, which has been a major purchaser of its own stock in recent years. The manufacturer acquired 14.9 million shares for $2.5 billion during the quarter. It also paid $868 million in dividends, 30 percent more than a year ago. “We view this as a good start to the year for Boeing, particularly cash flow,” Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said Wednesday. “Although this year looks to be on track, beyond 2017 we think there remains the usual concerns about potential weakening in the aerospace cycle.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Alitalia is preparing for special administration proceedings after workers rejected its latest rescue plan, making it impossible for the loss-making airline to secure funds to keep its aircraft flying. Workers are hoping the Italian government will step in with an alternative rescue deal. Malaysia Airlines could take between six and eight Airbus A330s from Alitalia, CEO Peter Bellew told Reuters in Dubai. "I hope Alitalia stays in business but it doesn't look good to me today. I think it's hard to see how they are going come back from the pressure they are sitting on at the moment," he said. An Alitalia spokesman declined to comment. Malaysia Airlines is emerging from a turnaround after suffering two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared in what remains a mystery, and then flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Its load factors - or how full its planes are - averaged around 80 percent in the three months to March 31, Bellew said. Malaysia Airlines wants to lease between six and eight A330s or Boeing 777s for use from 2018 and a further seven to nine from 2019, he said, expecting to finalise most of those deals in the next four to six weeks. This is an increase on the six for 2018 and six for 2019 he told Reuters last month he was interested in. "The world really is awash right now" Bellew said with regard to spare widebody aircraft, adding that he also saw opportunities to take aircraft from Middle East carriers. "There are really good deals out there at the moment. It's a buyer's market right now." Bellew also said he planned to make a decision on an order for 30-35 new Airbus A330neo or Boeing 787-9 widebody planes in the next four to six months to replace existing aircraft in its fleet from the end of 2019. "If the prices are good ... we will do an order," he said. "But they need to sharpen their pencils because they are still unrealistic with the pricing in the current market." Malaysia Airlines would look for more leases if it doesn't get the pricing it wants, he said. It could also convert or add to an existing order for 25 of Boeing's new generation 737 MAX 8 narrowbody aircraft or the proposed bigger MAX 10 version currently being offered informally to the market by the U.S. planemaker. Bellew did not say how many could be ordered or when a decision might be made. Industry sources said on Tuesday that Boeing was nearing a decision to launch the MAX 10 plane at the Paris Airshow in June. Malaysia Airlines plans to trim its narrowbody fleet to between 35 and 40 aircraft from 54 currently and increase its number of widebodies from 15 to 35. The airline is aiming for a return to profitability by 2018 and stock market listing in March the following year. Bellew said he believed a majority of the airline would be listed.

NEW YORK: Aerospace giant Boeing said Wednesday declining costs boosted earnings for the latest quarter, but revenues missed analyst expectations as commercial plane deliveries dropped. Net income for the quarter ending March 31 rose 19 percent to $1.5 billion. But revenues fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion, below the $21.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company disappointed expectations. The aerospace giant has been trimming jobs in its civil aviation division due to slowing sales. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg pledged to employ a "sharp focus on performance and productivity" to reach its financial targets. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft in the quarter, down seven from the same period of 2016. Commercial deliveries are closely scrutinized by Wall Street because of their connection to revenues. Boeing modestly increased its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents a share to a range of $10.35 to $10.55, citing a lower-than-expected tax rate. Shares fell 1.6 percent to $180.65 in pre-market trading.

( BA ) reported a profit for the first-quarter 2017 that increased about 19 percent from last year driven by solid execution on production programs and services. But, quarterly revenues decreased 7.3 percent to $21.0 billion, reflecting the timing of commercial and defense aircraft deliveries. Earnings per share topped analysts' expectations, while quarterly revenues missed their estimates. The company raised its 2017 profit guidance reflecting continued solid performance across the company and the impact of the lower-than-expected tax rate. But the company maintained its annual revenue guidance. "We remain on track to achieve our full-year revenue, earnings and cash flow targets as our teams deliver on our large and diverse order backlog. As we do so, we're focused on accelerating productivity, quality and safety improvements, strengthening execution on development programs, and capturing new business opportunities," said Boeing Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg. For the full year, GAAP earnings per share guidance increased to between $10.35 and $10.55 from $10.25 and $10.45 and core earnings per share guidance increased to between $9.20 and $9.40 from $9.10 and $9.30, primarily driven by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Analysts expect annual earnings of $9.35 per share. Looking ahead for fiscal year 2017, the company still expects revenue to be in the range of $90.5 billion - $92.5 billion. Analysts expect revenue of $92.05 billion for the fiscal year. It still projects commercial deliveries of between 760 and 765 aircraft. Net earnings for the first-quarter 2017 rose 19.03 percent to $1.45 billion from the prior year's $1.22 billion, with earnings per share improving to $2.34 from $1.83 in the previous year. Core earnings per share grew to $2.01 from $1.74 last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $1.95 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Operating cash flow in the quarter of $2.1 billion was driven by solid operating performance and timing of receipts and expenditures. During the quarter, the company repurchased 14.9 million shares for $2.5 billion, leaving $11.5 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization which is expected to be completed over approximately the next two years. The company also paid $868 million in dividends in the quarter, reflecting a 30 percent increase in dividends per share compared to the same period of the prior year. Total company backlog at quarter-end was $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the beginning of the quarter, and included net orders for the quarter of $27 billion. Total revenues for the quarter declined 7.3 percent to $20.976 billion from $22.632 billion in the prior year. Analysts expected revenue of $21.35 billion for the quarter. Commercial Airplanes first-quarter revenue was $14.3 billion on services growth, offset by lower planned 737 deliveries, as we prepare for 737 MAX entry into service in May. First-quarter operating margin increased to 8.5 percent, reflecting improved performance on production and services programs, cost growth on the initial production of KC-46 Tanker aircraft, and less favorable delivery mix. Defense, Space & Security first-quarter revenue was $6.5 billion. First-quarter operating margin increased to 11.3 percent, reflecting improved performance at BMA. Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) first-quarter revenue was $2.6 billion, reflecting lower planned deliveries, and operating margin increased to 12.2 percent on improved performance. During the quarter, BMA was awarded a contract for 268 AH-64E Apache helicopters from the U.S. Army, a contract for 17 P-8A Poseidon aircraft from the U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, and the U.K.Royal Air Force, and a contract from the U.S. Air Force for an additional 15 KC-46 Tanker aircraft.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files By Alwyn Scott Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit despite declining revenue, and it boosted its forecast for full-year earnings. The world's biggest plane maker said it earned $1.45 billion, or $2.34 per share, compared with $1.22 billion, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. The company's core earnings, which exclude some pension and other costs, rose to $2.01 per share from $1.74, beating the analysts' consensus estimate of $1.94, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Boeing increased its full-year forecast for core profit to a range of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up 10 cents. The company did not change is forecast of delivering 760-765 commercial aircraft in 2017 and also left its revenue target unchanged at $90.5 billion to $92.5 billion. Revenue fell 7.3 percent to $20.98 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $21.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company were down 1.6 percent in pre-market trade to $180.57. The decline in revenue came as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176, and because last year's revenue figure included delivery of three C-17 military transport aircraft, a plane Boeing has stopped making. Deliveries of 737s also dipped as Boeing built 737 MAX 8 jets that it plans to begin delivering this quarter, now that the plane has regulatory certification. While Boeing delivered two fewer 777s in the quarter, it delivered two more 787s. The results showed the effect of Boeing's cost-cutting and factory productivity improvements, which helped increase profits as revenue declined. Boeing is honing its ability to make 787s, and the larger 787-9 model is more profitable than the earlier version. Boeing's KC-46 aerial refueling tanker continued to weigh on results.

(AP Photo/Mic Smith) Boeing sales fall as company delivers fewest jets since 2014 Wed Apr 26th, 2017 10:48am Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Julie Johnsson / Bloomberg News Boeing’s sales slumped as the U.S. planemaker delivered the fewest jetliners in three years, ahead of the impending debut of a new version of the company’s best-selling plane. Revenue fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion in the first quarter, about $200 million less than analysts had estimated. Weak sales overshadowed a surprise gain in free cash flow as the manufacturer kept costs in check and started to reap a long-awaited payoff from the 787 Dreamliner. The report spotlighted Boeing’s need to tamp down costs and make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn’t boost the cash outlook — a crucial number for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. “The stock has been a high flier for a while,” George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Wednesday. “People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report.” Boeing rose 18 percent this year through Tuesday, the third largest gain among the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The manufacturer plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing’s factories. It represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane’s manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what’s typically the company’s slowest period. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets, the fewest since the first quarter of 2014, as it began to stockpile 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. First-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up from a previous estimate of $9.10 to $9.30, mainly because of a reduction in the expected tax rate. “Although we don’t see investors giving Boeing much credit for a tax-driven EPS ‘beat and raise,’ we would expect there to be a positive response to the solid cash-flow performance in the first quarter, given historic seasonality,” Robert Stallard, an aerospace analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients.   Most Read Work set to start on new Seattle Children’s clinic in Everett EVERETT — After years of planning, construction is set to begin here… Apr 25th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Everett man investigated for extortion, cyberstalking MUKILTEO — An Everett man has been accused of extorting a woman… Apr 25th, 2017 by Caitlin Tompkins Everett mirror maker says knock-offs have cost it millions EVERETT — Electric Mirror is fighting to protect manufacturing jobs in Everett,… Apr 26th, 2017 by Dan Catchpole Proposed assisted-living facility, housing project in same area EVERETT — Sunrise Services, a 40-year-old operator of adult group homes, plans… Apr 25th, 2017 by Chris Winters Budget deal secures pay hike for state troopers OLYMPIA — A big pay hike from lawmakers and a large graduating… Apr 25th, 2017 by Jerry Cornfield © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

(BA) reported a profit for the first-quarter 2017 that increased about 19 percent from last year driven by solid execution on production programs and services. But, quarterly revenues decreased 7.3 percent to $21.0 billion, reflecting the timing of commercial and defense aircraft deliveries. Earnings per share topped analysts' expectations, while quarterly revenues missed their estimates. The company raised its 2017 profit guidance reflecting continued solid performance across the company and the impact of the lower-than-expected tax rate. But the company maintained its annual revenue guidance. In the Wednesday's pre-market trade, BA is trading at $181.40, down $2.11 or 1.15%. "We remain on track to achieve our full-year revenue, earnings and cash flow targets as our teams deliver on our large and diverse order backlog. As we do so, we're focused on accelerating productivity, quality and safety improvements, strengthening execution on development programs, and capturing new business opportunities," said Boeing Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg. For the full year, GAAP earnings per share guidance increased to between $10.35 and $10.55 from $10.25 and $10.45 and core earnings per share guidance increased to between $9.20 and $9.40 from $9.10 and $9.30, primarily driven by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Analysts expect annual earnings of $9.35 per share. Looking ahead for fiscal year 2017, the company still expects revenue to be in the range of $90.5 billion - $92.5 billion. Analysts expect revenue of $92.05 billion for the fiscal year. It still projects commercial deliveries of between 760 and 765 aircraft. Net earnings for the first-quarter 2017 rose 19.03 percent to $1.45 billion from the prior year's $1.22 billion, with earnings per share improving to $2.34 from $1.83 in the previous year. Core earnings per share grew to $2.01 from $1.74 last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to report earnings of $1.95 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. Operating cash flow in the quarter of $2.1 billion was driven by solid operating performance and timing of receipts and expenditures. During the quarter, the company repurchased 14.9 million shares for $2.5 billion, leaving $11.5 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization which is expected to be completed over approximately the next two years. The company also paid $868 million in dividends in the quarter, reflecting a 30 percent increase in dividends per share compared to the same period of the prior year. Total company backlog at quarter-end was $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the beginning of the quarter, and included net orders for the quarter of $27 billion. Total revenues for the quarter declined 7.3 percent to $20.976 billion from $22.632 billion in the prior year. Analysts expected revenue of $21.35 billion for the quarter. Commercial Airplanes first-quarter revenue was $14.3 billion on services growth, offset by lower planned 737 deliveries, as we prepare for 737 MAX entry into service in May. First-quarter operating margin increased to 8.5 percent, reflecting improved performance on production and services programs, cost growth on the initial production of KC-46 Tanker aircraft, and less favorable delivery mix. Defense, Space & Security first-quarter revenue was $6.5 billion. First-quarter operating margin increased to 11.3 percent, reflecting improved performance at BMA. Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) first-quarter revenue was $2.6 billion, reflecting lower planned deliveries, and operating margin increased to 12.2 percent on improved performance. During the quarter, BMA was awarded a contract for 268 AH-64E Apache helicopters from the U.S. Army, a contract for 17 P-8A Poseidon aircraft from the U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, and the U.K. Royal Air Force, and a contract from the U.S. Air Force for an additional 15 KC-46 Tanker aircraft. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story Corporate News Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Samsung Q1 Profit Up 46%; Rejects Holding-company Structure Gainers & Losers Of Apr.26: AKBA, FLKS, BIOL, BABY, FLXN...

Boeing's sales fall as company delivers fewest jets since 2014 By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg 6 hrs ago (…) Travis Dove Boeing Dreamliner 787 planes sit on the production line at the company's final assembly facility in North Charleston, S.C. Bloomberg photo by Travis Dove. Updated at 3:30 p.m. Boeing's sales slumped as the aerospace company delivered the fewest jetliners in three years, ahead of the impending debut of a new version of its best-selling plane. Revenue fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion in the first quarter, about $200 million less than analysts had estimated. Weak sales overshadowed a surprise gain in free cash flow as the manufacturer kept costs in check and started to reap a long-awaited payoff from the 787 Dreamliner. The report spotlighted Boeing's need to tamp down costs and make its factories more efficient as it girds for a slowing aerospace market. While the Chicago-based manufacturer raised its forecast for 2017 earnings because of improved tax expectations, it didn't boost the cash outlook — a crucial number for investors as aircraft orders fade late in a sales cycle that began more than a decade ago. "'The stock has been a high flier for a while," George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said Wednesday. "People clearly had high expectations and this was a middling report." Shares of Boeing fell nearly 1 percent on Wednesday to close at $181.71.  The manufacturer plans to cut output of the 777, long its second-largest source of profit, for a second time later this year. The 787 Dreamliner should help dull some of the pain and Boeing will also gain as initial deliveries start next month for the 737 Max, the newest member of its most profitable jet family, Ferguson said. Deferred production costs for the 787 fell $316 million to $27 billion from the previous quarter. The balance of deferred costs has started to shrink with each 787 that rolls out of Boeing's factories. It represents the money the company sank into inventory and manpower after the Dreamliner entered the market three years late following a series of production and supply-chain breakdowns. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Boeing has promised a steep improvement in cash and savings from the Dreamliner as it refines the plane's manufacturing process, builds more higher-margin models like the 787-9 and no longer has to compensate customers for late deliveries. The marquee aircraft, with a frame made of spun carbon-fiber, emerged as a money maker for Boeing last year after a decade of losses. First-quarter free cash flow of $1.63 billion contrasted with the average analyst estimate that the planemaker would consume $137 million during what's typically the company's slowest period. Boeing delivered 169 commercial jets, the fewest since the first quarter of 2014, as it began to stockpile 737 Max jets ahead of the initial delivery of the upgraded narrow-body next month. First-quarter earnings adjusted for pension expenses were $2.01 a share, the company said Wednesday in statement. That compared to the $1.91 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. For the full year, the company forecast adjusted earnings of $9.20 to $9.40 a share, up from a previous estimate of $9.10 to $9.30, mainly because of a reduction in the expected tax rate. "Although we don't see investors giving Boeing much credit for a tax-driven EPS 'beat and raise,' we would expect there to be a positive response to the solid cash-flow performance in the first quarter, given historic seasonality," Robert Stallard, an aerospace analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a report to clients.

The company also paid $868 million in dividends in the quarter, reflecting a 30 percent increase in dividends per share compared to the same period of the prior year. Table 3. Cash, Marketable Securities and Debt Balances Quarter-End (Billions) Q1 17 Q4 16 Cash $8.2 $8.8 Marketable Securities1 $1.0 $1.2 Total $9.2 $10.0 Debt Balances: The Boeing Company, net of intercompany loans to BCC $7.7 $7.1 Boeing Capital, including intercompany loans $3.1 $2.9 Total Consolidated Debt $10.8 $10.0 1 Marketable securities consists primarily of time deposits due within one year classified as „short-term investments.” Cash and investments in marketable securities totaled $9.2 billion, down from $10.0 billion at the beginning of the quarter (Table 3). Debt was $10.8 billion, up from the beginning of the quarter, primarily due to the issuance of new debt. Total company backlog at quarter-end was $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the beginning of the quarter, and included net orders for the quarter of $27 billion. Segment Results Commercial Airplanes Table 4. Commercial Airplanes First Quarter (Dollars in Millions) 2017 2016 Change Commercial Airplanes Deliveries 169 176 (4)% Revenues $14,305 $14,399 (1)% Earnings from Operations $1,215 $1,033 18% Operating Margin 8.5% 7.2% 1.3 Pts Commercial Airplanes first-quarter revenue was $14.3 billion on services growth, offset by lower planned 737 deliveries, as we prepare for 737 MAX entry into service in May (Table 4). First-quarter operating margin increased to 8.5 percent, reflecting improved performance on production and services programs, cost growth on the initial production of KC-46 Tanker aircraft, and less favorable delivery mix. During the quarter, Boeing successfully completed first flight of the 787-10 Dreamliner. The 737 program rolled out the first 737 MAX 9 and received FAA certification for the 737 MAX 8. Demand continues to be strong for the 737 MAX with more than 3,700 orders since launch. Commercial Airplanes booked 198 net orders during the quarter. Backlog remains robust with more than 5,700 airplanes valued at $417 billion. Defense, Space & Security Table 5. Defense, Space & Security First Quarter (Dollars in Millions) 2017 2016 Change Revenues Boeing Military Aircraft $2,636 $3,659 (28)% Network & Space Systems $1,564 $1,735 (10)% Global Services & Support $2,332 $2,562 (9)% Total BDS Revenues $6,532 $7,956 (18)% Earnings from Operations Boeing Military Aircraft $321 $334 (4)% Network & Space Systems $98 $148 (34)% Global Services & Support $318 $340 (6)% Total BDS Earnings from Operations $737 $822 (10)% Operating Margin 11.3% 10.3% 1.0 Pts Defense, Space & Security first-quarter revenue was $6.5 billion (Table 5). First-quarter operating margin increased to 11.3 percent, reflecting improved performance at BMA. Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) first-quarter revenue was $2.6 billion, reflecting lower planned deliveries, and operating margin increased to 12.2 percent on improved performance. During the quarter, BMA was awarded a contract for 268 AH-64E Apache helicopters from the U.S. Army, a contract for 17 P-8A Poseidon aircraft from the U.S. Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, and the U.K. Royal Air Force, and a contract from the U.S. Air Force for an additional 15 KC-46 Tanker aircraft. Network & Space Systems (N&SS) first-quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, reflecting lower volume on Commercial Crew. Operating margin was 6.3 percent driven by lower satellite services volume and investments in development efforts. During the quarter, N&SS announced an order for a 702 satellite with a dual payload from SKY Perfect JSAT and Kacific. Global Services & Support (GS&S) first-quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, reflecting timing of contracts. Operating margin increased to 13.6 percent largely reflecting improved performance. During the quarter, GS&S was awarded a contract from the Republic of Korea Air Force to continue long-term sustainment of F-15 aircraft over the next five years. Backlog at Defense, Space & Security was $63 billion, of which 34 percent represents orders from international customers. Additional Financial Information Table 6. Additional Financial Information First Quarter (Dollars in Millions) 2017 2016 Revenues Boeing Capital $92 $64 Unallocated items, eliminations and other $47 $213 Earnings from Operations Boeing Capital $39 $5 Unallocated pension/postretirement $315 $94 Other unallocated items and eliminations ($282) ($166) Other (loss)/income, net $22 $26 Interest and debt expense ($87) ($73) Effective tax rate 25.9% 30.0% At quarter-end, Boeing Capital’s net portfolio balance was $4.0 billion. Total pension expense for the first quarter was $334 million, down from $629 million in the same period of the prior year. Unallocated items, eliminations and other revenue decreased primarily due to the elimination of intercompany revenue for one aircraft delivered under operating lease. The effective tax rate for the first quarter decreased from the same period in the prior year due to higher-than-expected tax benefits related to share-based compensation in the first quarter of 2017. Outlook The company’s 2017 updated financial and delivery guidance (Table 7) reflects continued solid performance across the company and the impact of the lower-than-expected tax rate. Table 7. 2017 Financial Outlook Current Prior (Dollars in Billions, except per share data) Guidance Guidance The Boeing Company Revenue $90.5 – 92.5 $90.5 – 92.5 GAAP Earnings Per Share $10.35 – 10.55 $10.25 – 10.45 Core Earnings Per Share* $9.20 – 9.40 $9.10 – 9.30 Operating Cash Flow ~$10.75 ~$10.75 Commercial Airplanes Deliveries 760 – 765 760 – 765 Revenue $62.5 – 63.5 $62.5 – 63.5 Operating Margin 9.5% – 10.0 9.5% – 10.0 Defense, Space & Security Revenue Boeing Military Aircraft ~$11.5 ~$11.5 Network & Space Systems ~$7.0 ~$7.0 Global Services & Support ~$10.0 ~$10.0 Total BDS Revenue $28.0 – 29.0 $28.0 – 29.0 Operating Margin Boeing Military Aircraft ~12.0% ~12.0% Network & Space Systems ~9.0% ~9.0% Global Services & Support >12.5% >12.5% Total BDS Operating Margin ~11.5% ~11.5% Boeing Capital Portfolio Size Stable Stable Revenue ~$0.3 ~$0.3 Pre-Tax Earnings ~$0.05 ~$0.05 Research & Development ~ $3.6 ~ $3.6 Capital Expenditures ~ $2.3 ~ $2.3 Pension Expense 1 ~ $0.7 ~ $0.7 Effective Tax Rate ~ 31.0% ~ 32.0% 1 Approximately ($0.9) billion is expected to be recorded in unallocated items and eliminations * Non-GAAP measures. Complete definitions of Boeing’s non-GAAP measures are on page 6, „Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures.” Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided: Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share Core operating earnings is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding unallocated pension and post-retirement expense. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of unallocated pension and post-retirement expense. Unallocated pension and post-retirement expense represents the portion of pension and other post-retirement costs that are not recognized by business segments for segment reporting purposes. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) are allocated to Commercial Airplanes. Pension costs allocated to BDS segments are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude unallocated pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided on page 13. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is defined as GAAP operating cash flow without capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation between GAAP operating cash flow and free cash flow.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Boeing — The jet maker reported profit of $2.01 per share, seven cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly below forecasts, and the company reported much better-than-expected free cash flow figures for the quarter. United Technologies — The maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines came in nine cents a share above estimates, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.48 per share. Revenue was also above forecasts and the company saw higher sales in all four of its business units. Procter & Gamble — The consumer products giant reported adjusted quarterly profit of 96 cents per share, two cents a share above estimates. Revenue was slightly below forecasts. P&G is citing a stronger dollar and political uncertainty among the factors holding back its results. Twitter — Twitter earned an adjusted 11 cents per share for the first quarter, 10 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was well above Street forecasts, and Twitter added more daily active users than analysts had anticipated. PepsiCo — The beverage and snack giant beat estimates by two cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 94 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecast. The results were aided by stronger pricing, although PepsiCo is giving a full-year earnings forecast that falls slightly below estimates. Anthem — The health insurer reported adjusted quarterly profit of $4.68 per share, well above estimates of $3.86. Revenue was above forecasts and Anthem gave a better-than-expected earnings and revenue forecast for the full year, helped by increased enrollment in its government-related businesses. Restaurant Brands International — The parent of Tim Hortons and Burger King reported adjusted quarterly profit of 36 cents per share, one cent a share above estimates. Revenue was also above forecasts and the company increased its quarterly dividend by 5.6 percent. AT&T — AT&T matched Street forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of 74 cents per share, however revenue fell short of estimates. The company also surprised analysts by losing postpaid subscribers during the first quarter. Chipotle Mexican Grill — Chipotle reported quarterly profit of $1.60 per share, beating estimates of $1.27. The restaurant chain's revenue was slightly above forecasts as was its first-quarter comparable sales. Chipotle also disclosed a data breach, saying it was investigating "unauthorized activity" in its payment systems during the past month. Wynn Resorts — Wynn exceeded estimates by 23 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.24 per share. The hotel and casino operator also posted a slight beat on the top line. Wynn's results have been helped in recent quarters by a recovery in its Macau operations. Arconic — The engineered products maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 33 cents per share, nine cents a share above estimates, helped by strength in transportation and rolled products. Panera Bread — Panera saw its quarterly profits match Street forecasts, with adjusted earnings of $1.83 per share. The restaurant chain's revenue beat forecasts as its comparable-store sales rose 5.3 percent from a year earlier. Deckers Outdoor — Deckers is exploring strategic alternatives, with the footwear maker hiring Moelis & Co. as a financial advisor. Activist investors have been urging the maker of UGG boots to look at a possible sale of the company. U.S. Steel — The company posted an adjusted loss of 83 cents per share, surprising analysts who had expected the steelmaker to report a quarterly profit. Revenue also missed estimates and the company gave weaker-than-expected 2017 guidance. U.S. Steel said operating challenges at some of its factories kept it from fully benefiting from improved market conditions. Costco — Costco announced a $7 per share special dividend, payable on May 26 to shareholders of record on May 10. The warehouse retailer also raised its regular quarterly dividend to 50 cents per share from 45 cents. Edwards Lifesciences — Edwards came in 12 cents a share above estimates, with quarterly profit of 94 cents per share. The medical device maker also saw revenue beat forecasts. Edwards raised its full-year forecast on strong sales of its transcatheter heart valve replacements.

Chicago-based Boeing Co. said Wednesday that it earned $1.45 billion in the first quarter. Excluding non-repeating gains, the profit came to $2.01 per share. The average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was $1.91 per share. Revenue was $20.98 billion. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $21.44 billion. Boeing blamed the disappointing sales number on delayed deliveries of commercial and defense aircraft. The company delivered 169 commercial planes in the quarter, down from 176 a year earlier. Boeing said it planned for fewer deliveries of its workhorse 737 plane as it prepares to launch a new version next month. Revenue from sales of military planes plunged 28 percent, to $2.64 billion.

Airline spokeswoman Erin Benson says the two-engine Boeing 737 circled to burn fuel, then returned Monday to the airport in Liberia, Costa Rica. She says the plane was over normal landing weight, so fire crews stood by at the airport. A reporter among the 165 passengers tweeted that it was a frightening experience. Aviation-safety consultant John Cox says Boeing 737s can't dump fuel but are designed to land slightly overweight. He says it sounds like the United crew did everything right, including throttling back and returning to Costa Rica on one engine. Benson says the passengers will get compensation and fly to Houston on Tuesday. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The world's second-largest planemaker after Boeing said adjusted operating profit fell to 240 million euros ($261.7 million) as revenues rose 7 percent to 12.988 billion. Analysts were on average expecting adjusted operating income of 344 million euros, down 31 percent, and 5.5 percent higher revenues of 12.857 billion, according to a Reuters poll. Airbus said it was still worried about problems with temperamental engines for its new A320neo passenger plane from Pratt &amp; Whitney, and commercial exposure on the troubled A400M military aircraft programme. It expects deliveries of the A320neo once again to fall predominantly in the latter part of the year, but has said it hopes to avoid the last-minute rush seen in December last year. The engine issues "need to be resolved," Airbus said in a statement. The Airbus planemaking business saw 31 percent lower profit despite a 13 percent rise in revenues. The Toulouse-based firm said this reflected a different mix of aircraft, with more of the new A350s delivered in the first quarter, "transition pricing" and higher production ramp-up costs. New aircraft tend to be sold at heavier discounts to spur further orders. The Airbus Helicopters unit slipped into loss as the world's largest commercial helicopter maker continues to suffer from the grounding of aircraft in UK and Norway, following a crash that killed North Sea oil workers. For 2017, Airbus expects to deliver over 720 aircraft and to report mid-single-digit percentage growth in operating income. Airbus' results came a day after Boeing reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit, with its U.S rival also lifting its full-year forecast.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Big U.S. companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: Who benefits? It’s hard to say precisely because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready to say at what levels these new rates would kick in. Cohn said the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting many of the richest taxpayers. Why cut corporate taxes? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. The Obama administration proposed cutting it to 28 percent. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. “Simplifying the tax code as well as getting the rate to a point of being able to compete on a global scale is certainly something that we support,” an executive at Boeing said on a conference call earlier Wednesday. Who’d benefit from the corporate rate cut? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they are structured as pass-throughs, an ungainly moniker that derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers would receive an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas’ men’s basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax, despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as “business income” and have it taxed at the 15 percent rate, tax experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses more than doubled the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” How else would big businesses benefit? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. That’s led many businesses to keep hundreds of billions of dollars outside the U.S. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the U.S. and invest it in plants and equipment. Yet some analysts argue that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. What about the deficit and growth? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster economic growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well. But the Trump team offered no details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would lower government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 of a percentage point annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 (G-20) countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday (April 26) cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 per cent from 35 per cent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 per cent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation."   asiastocks.jpg Related Story Asian shares retreat from highs on doubts over Trump tax plan   fed.jpg Related Story Fed, wary of inflation, could lean against Trump tax cut Big US companies have nearly US$1.8 trillion (S$2.5 trillion) in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service.

Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by US companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many US companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 per cent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 per cent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 per cent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform,"Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call on Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the US economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. "A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump's first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

"What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs. Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co , for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data. A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises. Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete." Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs. While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier. Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. "A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump's first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation."

Investors also questioned that the proposal was feasible. “The plan that has been announced today is very aggressive, and unlikely to pass as is,” Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta, told Bloomberg. “I haven’t heard of anyone on the street that has been adjusting earnings estimates based on the likelihood we’ll get tax reform. This remains an unknown and it’s not being factored into the market yet.” In 2.32pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.17 percent, as did the Nasdaq Composite Index. In 2.18pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.22 percent. Earlier in the day, the Nasdaq touched a record high 6,040.90 The Dow rose as gains in shares of Verizon and those of United Technologies, recently up 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of Boeing, down 2 percent and 1.1. percent respectively. United Technologies posted quarterly results that surpassed expectations, while Procter & Gamble and Boeing each failed to meet the mark with their latest earnings. PepsiCo shares fell, trading 0.5 percent weaker as of 1.34pm in New York, amid concern about the company’s margins even as it posted earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. “We achieved solid revenue growth in the first quarter underpinned by global volume growth and positive net price realisation, despite challenging food and beverage industry trading conditions in North America and continued volatility in a number of developing and emerging markets,” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said in a statement. Even so, gross margin contracted 45 basis points in the first quarter, the company said. “The quality of the quarter was disappointing,” Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a research note, Bloomberg reported. “Organic revenue, gross margin and operating margin all came in weaker than we anticipated.” Meanwhile, Canadian and Mexican stocks slid after Politico reported that the Trump administration is considering an executive order on withdrawing the US from NAFTA. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso also declined. A draft order has been submitted for the final stages of review and could be unveiled late this week or early next week, Politico reported, citing two White House officials. The effort, which still could change in the coming days as more officials weigh in, would indicate the administration’s intent to withdraw from the sweeping pact by triggering the timeline set forth in the deal, according to Politico. “It is a clear indication that they [in the White House] are wanting changes but we will have to see what emerges,” Paul Ferley, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.5 percent increase from the previous close. Germany’s DAX Index advanced 0.1 percent, while the UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, as did France’s CAC40 Index.

RUGABER WASHINGTON President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through" businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies — including Trump's own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: WHO BENEFITS? It's hard to say precisely because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Cohn said the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." Yet Trump's campaign proposals were skewed to the wealthiest Americans, and it's likely that his new proposal, once fleshed out, could be as well. Trump wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting many of the richest taxpayers. WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn't touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among the advanced economies. The Obama administration had proposed cutting it to 28 percent. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. "Simplifying the tax code as well as getting the rate to a point of being able to compete on a global scale is certainly something that we support," an executive at Boeing said on a conference call about the company's earnings earlier Wednesday. WHO'D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they are structured as pass-throughs, an ungainly moniker that derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers would receive an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas' men's basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax, despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as "business income" and have it taxed at the 15 percent rate, tax experts say. In Kansas the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. "Good luck with that," said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. "The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses." HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a "territorial" system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. That's led many businesses to keep hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump's plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Yet some analysts argue that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government's budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster economic growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered no details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don't accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would lower government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent-percentage point? annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a "crowding out" effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax cut package — smaller than Trump's — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump's proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter that with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

This is backwards. Tax is what the government takes away from taxpayers. So Government taking less away does not need to be "paid for". The related issue is that, if government continues to spend like crazy, as well as leaving tax payers with their own money to spend, save and invest, the government will rack up debts. How to resolve the problem of financial deficits due to government expenditure exceeding revenues clearly has two components - expenditures as well as revenues. Reducing revenues doesn't mean you need to pay for reducing revenues, it means you need to reduce expenditures. People being able to spend more, and government spending less, is a great combination. People typically spend their own money much better than they spend other people's money. The Trump plan has the revenues side in place here. One warranted criticism is that he has failed to define how he will reduce expenditures. If growth doesn't pick up enough to cover it, then he needs to clarify on this point. most experts suggest that it would add little to growth  These are the same experts that have overseen pathetic levels of economic growth so far this century. It's time to listen to some "alternative experts" now methinks. potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. If person A pay 10K in tax and person B pays 10MM in tax, the maximum tax cut that person A can get is 10K. But giving person A the 10K tax cut obviously results in person B getting a bigger one, since person B pays 10MM in tax, not 10K. It's only possible to cut taxes to the extent that taxes are currently paid in the first place. And it's already the wealthy who pay the most by far. Unless there are two completely different sets of rules for different people, this is the only way it can be. Trump's proposal and its likely impact The predictive stock markets rocketed to all-time highs post Trump's election, on the assumption of such a tax cut being enacted. That's a real impact that is evident to all. (And Trump getting elected was supposed to be a disaster) WHO'D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? The article neglected to mention one large beneficiary group - everyone. Think people who have a pension plan - the stock market at all-time highs thanks to the tax cut plan (and eventual higher corporate post-tax profits) benefits all of those people, even before one considers the potential boost in business activities and hiring that will come with it. some analysts argue that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. Shareholders (which includes pension funds) getting bigger dividends is hardly a disaster for the US. Is it better than the capital sits overseas contributing nothing to the US instead? Those dividends are ultimately more money to be re-invested into the economy somehow. And if the US has a better business environment than overseas then the money would be invested there. -1 ( +0 / -1 ) serendipitous1 Today 01:49 pm JST Gee, vital details missing from yet another amazing Trumpian idea.

President Donald Trump is proposing dramatically reducing the taxes paid by corporations big and small in an overhaul his administration says will spur economic growth and bring jobs and prosperity to the middle class. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through" businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies — including Trump's own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It's hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. "The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown," said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. "There's not enough specificity. It's hard for taxpayers to determine where they'll come out." Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don't itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that's on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES?

That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump’s — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump’s proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans' financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump's plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don't pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That's because Trump would apply the corporate rate to "pass through" businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. What's more, some privately held large companies — including Trump's own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here's a closer look at Trump's proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It's hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren't ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. "The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown," said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. "There's not enough specificity. It's hard for taxpayers to determine where they'll come out." Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes "especially for low and middle income families." It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don't itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that's on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn't touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. ___ WHO'D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they're structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "It would tremendously help high earners," says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas' men's basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as "business income" and have it taxed at 15 percent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. "Good luck with that," said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. "The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses." ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a "territorial" system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump's plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government's budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years.

But many experts are skeptical. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT? The administration is also proposing to tax only corporate income earned in the United States. This is known as a “territorial” system. It would replace the current worldwide system, under which corporations pay tax on income earned in the U.S. and overseas. Yet companies can avoid the tax if they keep their foreign earnings overseas. Many businesses have kept hundreds of billions of dollars outside the United States. Mnuchin said Trump’s plan would encourage corporations to return the money to the United States and invest it in plants and equipment. Some analysts counter that corporations might instead use the money to pay dividends to shareholders. ___ WHAT ABOUT THE DEFICIT AND GROWTH? The government’s budget deficit could explode under the plan, offsetting many of the benefits for the economy, economists say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s rough estimate puts the loss of revenue at $5.5 trillion over 10 years. Mnuchin argued that the tax cuts would spur faster growth, which, in turn, would produce more tax revenue. And the elimination of tax deductions and other loopholes would raise revenue as well, he contended. But the Trump team offered few details on which deductions would be dropped — a move that would likely spark ferocious opposition from the beneficiaries of those deductions. And most economists don’t accept the notion that growth would accelerate enough to offset the lost revenue. Alan Cole, an economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, calculates that the corporate tax cuts alone would reduce government revenue by $2 trillion over 10 years. That would require growth to accelerate nearly a full percentage point, to 2.8 percent a year, from its current level. Yet Cole forecasts that growth would increase only 0.4 percent annually. Other economists say that if the cuts balloon the deficit, the resulting jump in government borrowing would swell interest rates and make it harder for businesses and households to borrow and spend. Ethan Harris, chief global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says such a “crowding out” effect can cancel out any benefits to the economy. ___ SO WILL THE ECONOMY BENEFIT AT ALL? Most economists forecast that a modest tax-cut package — smaller than Trump’s — is far more likely to become law. With the deficit rising by less, a smaller cut could raise growth to 2.5 percent a year, from its roughly 2 percent pace now, Harris said. If Trump’s proposals became law, depending on the details, growth could accelerate more quickly, Harris added. But the Federal Reserve would likely counter such acceleration with more short-term rate hikes, to forestall rapid inflation. And that move, in turn, would likely slow the economy. ___ Joseph Pisani and Paul Harloff in New York contributed to this report. ___ Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber CHRISTOPHER S.

RUGABER April 26, 2017 7:47 pm 7 min read Share WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s team boasted Wednesday that its tax-cut plan would lighten Americans’ financial burdens, ignite economic growth and vastly simplify tax filing. Yet the proposal so far remains short of vital details, including how it would be paid for. And based on the few specifics spelled out so far, most experts suggest that it would add little to growth while swelling the budget deficit and potentially handing large windfalls to wealthier taxpayers. Trump’s plan would replace the current seven income tax brackets with three, and the top bracket would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would also slash the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way to 15 percent, a boon to most companies even though many don’t pay the full tax now. With tax credits and other loopholes, most corporations pay closer to 20 percent, according to calculations by JPMorgan. Perhaps the most contentious plank would enable taxpayers with business income — including those wealthy enough to pay the top tax rate — to instead pay the new 15 percent corporate rate. That’s because Trump would apply the corporate rate to “pass through” businesses. Pass-throughs include partnerships such as law firms and hedge funds as well as most small businesses — from the local florist to the family-owned restaurant on Main Street. White House ends hiring freeze, mandates workforce, mission restructuring Advertisement What’s more, some privately held large companies — including Trump’s own real estate empire — are structured as pass-throughs and would benefit, too. Here’s a closer look at Trump’s proposal and its likely impact: ___ WHO BENEFITS? It’s hard to say because the administration has released so few details. The three new income tax rates would be 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But Trump’s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, weren’t ready Wednesday to say at what income levels these new rates would kick in. Tax experts said far more details were needed to determine how average Americans would be affected. What it would take to create real hiring reform “The impact on Joe Taxpayer is unknown,” said Marc Gerson, vice chair of the tax department of law firm Miller & Chevalier in Washington. “There’s not enough specificity. It’s hard for taxpayers to determine where they’ll come out.” Cohn asserted that the plan would cut taxes “especially for low and middle income families.” It purports to do so in part by doubling the standard deduction, which is used by taxpayers who don’t itemize their tax deductions. At the same time, the Trump plan would eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, thereby benefiting some of the richest taxpayers. And that’s on top of shrinking the corporate tax rate that many affluent individuals could likely capitalize on. ___ WHY CUT CORPORATE TAXES? By making corporations more profitable, the Trump administration hopes to encourage more business spending on equipment — from computers to factories and machinery. Doing so, in turn, could make the economy more efficient and accelerate growth and hiring. Economic growth has been stuck at about 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009. Mnuchin says the administration wants to accelerate it above 3 percent, a pace it hasn’t touched since 2005. The corporate tax cuts are also intended to encourage more businesses to stay in the United States, which now has the highest corporate rate among advanced economies. Many large corporations are enthusiastic about lower rates and say they support the elimination of loopholes, which both reduce revenue and make taxes more complicated. ___ WHO’D BENEFIT FROM THE CORPORATE RATE CUT? Aside from most large companies, many partnerships and small businesses would benefit because they’re structured as pass-throughs, which derives from the fact that they pass on their profits to their owners. Those owners now pay individual income tax rates, which top out at 39.6 percent. With the pass-through rate dropped to 15 percent, those taxpayers could enjoy an enormous tax cut. The Trump team stressed the benefits that might flow to small businesses. But the richest windfalls would flow to the wealthy — lawyers, hedge fund managers, consultants and other big earners. Nearly 75 percent of pass-through income flows to the 10 percent wealthiest taxpayers, according to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “It would tremendously help high earners,” says Brian Thompson, a certified public accountant in Chicago. In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback eliminated state taxes on pass-throughs, which turned out to be a boon for Bill Self, the coach of the University of Kansas’ men’s basketball team. He had previously set up his own company, according to state media reports. As a result, he paid little state income tax despite earning nearly $3 million a year. Many people, particularly wealthy Americans, could set up companies and reclassify their paychecks as “business income” and have it taxed at 15 percent, experts say. In Kansas, the number of pass-through businesses jumped to more than double the level the state expected, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That cost the state revenue without spurring more job creation. Mnuchin said the Treasury would issue rules to prevent wealthy people from capitalizing on the lower rate. But many experts are skeptical. “Good luck with that,” said Mark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury official under President Barack Obama. “The tax agencies tend to be at least a couple of steps behind the businesses.” ___ HOW ELSE WOULD BIG BUSINESSES BENEFIT?

Tax rates would fall below those of neighbouring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals.Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control.AT&T Corp (T.N) Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Big U.S. companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has more than $200 billion of that total.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower. "What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions," Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January. Cook's comment points to a big unknown for the White House and congressional Republicans, who have said business tax cuts would result in more and better jobs.Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs.Under pressure from shareholders, listed companies have set high targets for return on invested capital. General Motors Co (GM.N), for example, has told investors it is aiming for 20 percent returns on its capital investments. Many U.S. companies have been tightfisted about investing in new plants and equipment following the last recession, which left them wary of becoming overextended. Since 2014, investment in new equipment has flatlined, according to government data.A MIXED BAG The financial impact of the White House tax plan will vary widely by company and business sector. A proposal to cut inheritance taxes, for example, is of high interest to auto dealers, which are often family-controlled enterprises.Many companies already pay less than the headline 35 percent tax rate. Companies in the S&P 500 index paid an average tax rate of 29.06 percent for 2016, Standard and Poors said. A change of a few percentage points in tax rates can make a big difference. Aircraft maker Boeing Co (BA.N) on Wednesday reported a 19 percent increase in first quarter profits, partly because of a 4 percentage-point drop in its tax rate. "At the highest level we're a big supporter of tax reform," Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told analysts and journalists on a call Wednesday. "It's going to drive jobs, it's going to drive the U.S. economy broadly speaking and it's going to allow us to compete."Boeing has been cutting jobs in the United States, warning employees last week that it planned another round of cuts that would eliminate hundreds of engineering jobs.While the tax cuts may produce a short-term boost to the economy and add fuel to a stock market rally, it falls short of the comprehensive tax reform that Trump had pledged earlier.Regarding other parts of his agenda, his administration has been stymied in its attempts to limit immigration by the courts, while an attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in Congress. “A cynic would say this is a rushed attempt to have something big to show for President Trump’s first 100 days in office," said Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Asset Management in London.

Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest. Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. Corporate leaders and business lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday cheered the administration's tax proposals, while allowing that the initial one-page plan left out crucial details. The tax plan, which includes a cut in taxes on public companies to 15 percent from 35 percent, does not detail cuts in spending that would help keep the budget deficit under control. AT&T Corp Chief Executive Randall Stephenson welcomed the tax plan but cautioned "the practical reality of getting to 15 percent is you have to get yourself reconciled to some level of deficits for a period of time as you get the economic stimulation." Big U.S. companies have nearly $1.8 trillion in cash stockpiled overseas, according to Moody's Investors Service. Technology powerhouse Apple Inc has more than $200 billion of that total. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday, but Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company was looking to bring back offshore cash if tax rates for doing so were lower.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Butler National Selling New Learjet Component Solutions Share on Facebook Share Share on TwitterTweet Share on Google Plus Share Share on Pinterest Share Share on LinkedIn Share Share on Digg Share Send email Mail Print Print OLATHE, Kan., Jan. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — Butler National Corporation (OTC Pink: BUKS), a leading manufacturer and provider of support systems for commercial and military aircraft and a recognized provider of management services in diverse business groups including the gaming industry, announces the availability of two new component solutions for sale for Learjets. Incorporating new technologies, Butler National designed, manufactured and obtained Federal Aviation Administration Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) approval of a replacement rate sensor for use by the autopilot on the roll axis and yaw axis of the applicable Learjet 31/35/35A/36/36A/C-21A and 55 Series airplanes, and on the yaw axis on the Learjet Model 24/25/28/29 Series airplanes.  The replacement rate gyro sensor is approved for installation under STC number ST02416SE.  The new rate gyros are available for immediate sale and shipment. Butler National also added another new STC to replace the existing stall warning accelerometer for the Learjet 24/25/28/29 Series airplanes and Learjet 35/35A/36/36A airplanes with the FC-200 autopilot.  The new vertical accelerometer is STC (STC number ST02417SE) approved as an alternate means of compliance for airworthiness directive 82-01-05.  The new vertical accelerometer is currently available for sale and shipment from Butler National. Parts obsolescence is a never ending battle in the airplane business.  Many aircraft, like Learjet 20 and 30 series airplanes are reaching their 40th plus year of operation.   This makes replacement part acquisition a significant challenge.  One Butler National research and development focus is providing new part alternatives to obsolescence issues with cost-effective new replacement parts for the Learjet airplanes. The new Butler National rate gyro sensor solution uses an upgraded solid-state technology and provides a noticeable improvement in yaw damper operation compared to many of the old and tired oil-filled rate gyros. Management Comments “We are pleased to continue achieving our goals to offer new components and system upgrades for sale to operators of legacy Learjets.  We believe the new replacement rate sensor gyros will offer enhanced reliability and improved performance,” commented Clark D. Stewart, President and CEO.   “An operational yaw damper is required for dispatch of Learjet 20 and 30 series airplanes, unless they are equipped with our Avcon Delta Fins.  The new yaw damper sensor provides a noticeable and quicker damping response to turbulence inputs than is experienced with the classic oil-filled devices.  We believe passengers will have a better ride experience with the new Butler National yaw rate gyro sensors.  The replacement yaw rate gyro may be used in either the primary or secondary yaw damper system with the applicable model Learjets.  Through Butler Avionics, we are offering a special introductory price to exchange an existing rate gyro for the new solid state Butler National Rate Gyro at a price of $4,500.00.” “We have an FAA approved STC solution for a new replacement stall warning vertical accelerometer in the Learjet 20 and 30 series airplanes,” commented Mr. Stewart.  He added:  “We have had numerous requests to assist with technical obsolescence solutions in Learjets, and the replacement vertical accelerometer is another prime example of combining our aviation experience with our technical expertise.  We are working to provide Learjet customers new parts with new technology.” “We stepped up to provide reasonable solutions to keep these aviation ‘workhorses’ operational.  We offer noise solutions, avionics solutions, and parts obsolescence solutions.  We believe in these aircraft, and we will continue to support these Learjets in the future,” commented Mr. Stewart. Our Business: Butler National Corporation operates in the Aerospace and Services business segments.  The Aerospace segment focuses on the manufacturing of support systems for “Classic” commercial and military aircraft including the Butler National TSD for the Boeing 737 and 747 Classic aircraft, switching equipment for Boeing McDonnell Douglas Aircraft, weapon control systems for Boeing Helicopter and performance enhancement structural modifications for Learjet, Cessna, Dassault and Beechcraft business aircraft.  Services include temporary employee services, gaming services and administrative management services.

Thursday, April 27, 2017 Politics White House Congress Campaigns All Politics Policy Defense / National Security Energy Healthcare Finance / Economy Tech / Cyber Budgets / Spending Courts Foreign All Policy News Opinion Editorials Columnists Contributors Op-Eds Editorial Cartoons All Opinion Magazine Beltway Confidential Washington Secrets As government spending grows, special interest lobbyist paydays get bigger, too by Luke Rosiak | Apr 14, 2015, 5:00 AM Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Email this article Share on LinkedIn The 1300 block of K Street in northwest Washington, Thursday, Jan. 30th, 2014. (Graeme Jennings/Examiner File) Source: Congressional Budget Office, OpenSecrets.org. Lobbying has grown in direct proportion to government spending, with special interest groups consistently spending almost exactly $1 million for every billion dollars in federal expenditures. The correlation suggests that while liberal politicians portray K Street lobbyists as villains ruining Washington, it may be Big Government policies that attract them, according to a Washington Examiner analysis. The money spent on lobbying rose from $1.5 billion in 1998 to a high of $3.6 billion in 2010, during President Obama's stimulus package. During that same time period, spending grew from $1.7 trillion to $3.5 trillion. Experts said that as lawmakers have created new government programs and pumped up spending on existing programs, companies and activist groups have mobilized lobbyists to figure out how to cash in on the newfound money. "To paraphrase James Carville, drag a billion dollars through a trailer park, and there's no telling who will turn out," said Bill Allison, a lobbying expert at the Sunlight Foundation. "Lobbying is an overhead expense of Big Government — a constant." Sunlight is a nonprofit that seeks more government transparency. In some ways, it's a chicken-and-egg relationship, and a competing theory is that lobbyists are causing the government to grow. To be sure, some companies lobby to increase the federal budget in areas on which they can profit. That includes defense contractors like General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing; government consultants like Accenture; quasi-public entities like public television stations; and healthcare firms like Emergent BioSolutions and AdvaMed. But many companies would prefer lower taxes over new government spending. If their lobbyists were successful, the result should be less government spending — in order to balance out the lower taxes — rather than the increase in government outlays, as measured by the Congressional Budget Office. Lobbying on taxes are mammoth companies like Microsoft, Wal-Mart, ExxonMobil and FedEx. Those companies may boost their lobbying presence as a reaction to government growth, which they see signaling higher taxes on the horizon. Three thousand entities hired lobbyists on federal appropriations last year, while 2,000 hired lobbyists on tax issues, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Lobbyists generally don't create demand, they sense an opportunity and respond to it, Allison said. "If I didn't think government had an interest in funding me, I wouldn't be putting the effort into lobbying it." Often that interest comes in the form of well-intentioned programs crafted by liberals from which companies almost always seem to find a way to profit. Politicians created government-backed student loans, for example, out of concern for young people. But for-profit colleges now lobby heavily for them, and depend upon the revenue that results. Soda and junk food manufacturers lobby to boost the food stamp program, and green-energy companies' business models depend on legal carve-outs. Big Government spending on defense and national security has the same effect. Creation of a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Homeland Security, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, set off a gold rush of lobbying, as did the heightened defense spending of the subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Tim LaPira, a political science professor at James Madison University. Government taking on an expanded role — as it has done recently with healthcare — brings out lobbyists for both sides of an issue, as well as a crop of entities who were formerly not politically active, but now see a chance to profit. "A governmental decision to become involved in an issue area sets the agenda for existing and potential organized interests," LaPira and colleagues wrote in an academic paper titled "Drawing lobbyists to Washington." "If government had no authority over or involvement in an issue-area, then there would be little point in forming an interest group to lobby," LaPira and colleagues wrote. Demian Brady of the National Taxpayers Union noted that, while lobbying parallels federal spending, it doesn't match up so smoothly with federal revenues. "New federal programs create new constituencies who then lobby not only for additional benefits but to protect what they've already been granted," he said. "The benefits to the constituents of a given program are concentrated, while the costs of those programs are diffused, so that those people with the benefits have a much greater incentive to lobby on behalf of themselves than" taxpayers do to keep costs down.

As he lay seriously injured Captain Kaa was fatally hit by a shell.   This isn’t the first time LAC Tangaere has represented New Zealand at a major commemorative event.   “I was part of the MCG at the 100th Anzac Day commemorations in Gallipoli in 2015. It was an honour to be there,” she said.   LAC Tangaere joined the Maori Cultural Group in 2013, shortly after she joined the Air Force.   “I wanted to be part of the MCG because it helps me stay connected to my taha maori. And what better way to go and see some parts of the world that you only ever dreamed of going to, doing something that you love.” New Zealand’s international First World War commemorations this year will focus on the Western Front where New Zealand made its most significant contribution to the First World War, and also where New Zealand suffered the greatest loss of life. “I feel very privileged to be chosen to honour the service and sacrifice of all New Zealanders who have served in military conflicts at this year’s commemorations on the Western Front.” Information about the Anzac Day-related ceremonies and First World War commemorations can be found at WW100.govt.nz/international-commemorations. – –     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on April 27, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: April 27, 2017 @ 4:56 am Filed Under: 24/7, Asia Pacific Region, Banking and Finance, Defence, English, Fifth Estate - MIL OSI, MIL OSI, New Zealand, New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Government - Public Service, Open Source Intel, Pacific Region NEXT ARTICLE → Whanau on the Western Front ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE NZDF Searches For Tongan Fisherman in Distress About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts WWF Statement on President Trump’s Antiquities Act Executive Order NZDF Finds Missing Tongan Fisherman Safe but Sunburned Dargaville Local Joins NZDF Mission to Fiji Fijian Sailor Heading Home on NZ Navy Ship Remembrance for Navy Chaplain on Western Front © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

She previously wrote an M&A column for Bloomberg News. Follow @blsuth Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 26, 2017 12:09 PM EDT UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP +1.33 At Closing, April 26th 118.20 USD Boring looks pretty good on United Technologies Corp. The $95 billion maker of jet engines, air conditioners and elevators reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday that comfortably exceeded analysts' estimates. It largely got there the old-fashioned way, with strong organic revenue growth of 3 percent and a decent enough profit performance, as opposed to relying on the below-the-line assistance that investors have shown little patience for this industrial earnings season. In Line There were a few give and takes, but United Technologies generally performed as expected across its business lines Source: Estimates are from Cowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr Boeing Co. was the latest to get blowback for relying on tax gains to help it beat analysts' first quarter estimates on Wednesday, with its shares down about 1.5 percent mid-morning in New York. Quality of earnings is out-prioritizing quantity these days, and on that front, United Technologies delivered. Interest expense and share count was lower than anticipated, but its tax rate was actually a bit higher in the period than what Stifel Financial Corp. analyst Robert McCarthy had estimated. I believe the scientific term for this kind of quarter is: "fine." This Will Do United Technologies' solid first-quarter earnings helped drive the stock up further Source: Bloomberg Sure, one could be nitpicky about some of United Technologies' numbers, but executives did a good job of acknowledging the problems, explaining them and laying out clear reasons for why they wouldn't repeat. A weak operating profit performance in its climate, controls and security business was one of the bigger disappointments. United Technologies blamed this on an unfavorable contract adjustment, acquisitions that it's still integrating and a swing to less-profitable products. The unfavorable mix should work itself out over the course of the year as higher-margin service activity picks up and the division continues its cost-cutting efforts.   Under Control CEO Greg Hayes kicked off his tenure with several guidance knockdowns, but United Technologies was able to surpass its original EPS outlook last year. This latest batch of results should help to further shore up Hayes' credibility. Source: Bloomberg The same goes for United Technologies' geared turbofan jet engine, whose rollout has been haunted by production delays and technical issues. The company fell short of its delivery target last year and said in January it was addressing durability issues in harsh climates. The bad headlines have continued: Earlier this month, Spirit Airlines took three planes out of service after discovering issues with their GTF engines. The challenges clearly aren't behind it yet, but United Technologies appears to have a handle on them. The company delivered 70 of the engines in the period -- an uptick from the 62 it handed over in the fourth quarter -- leaving it on track for its targeted 350 to 400 deliveries for the year. It has a fix for a problematic carbon seal and plans to complete most of the necessary upgrades by the middle of May. Most importantly for investors, the cost of retrofitting the GTF to fix the glitches is already factored into the outlook for the Pratt & Whitney division that handles its production. And in a positive sign, the operating margin of 10.5 percent at the Pratt & Whitney division exceeded the average of four analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg Gadfly. Crossing Wires UTX is fast approaching analysts' price target for the year Source: Bloomberg Generally speaking, things seem to be moving along OK at United Technologies. That's a victory, but it's far from enough to drive a massive outperf0rmance -- particularly on top of its 2.9 percent gain in the week leading up to earnings amid positive reports from fellow aerospace suppliers including Rockwell Collins Inc. and Honeywell International Inc. The stock has gone about as far as it's going to go this year, at least by analysts' count. A few more quarters like this though -- and no more problems with the GTF -- and United Technologies may be consistently boring enough to make investors excited. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. The company is prepared to spend as much as $50 million on additional endurance testing just to make sure no other surprises arise. It hasn't found anything yet.

SUMMARY: Hanes, the only apparel company to be honored for sustained excellence by the EPA Energy Star program in its 25-year history, continues to demonstrate that companies from all industries can make a difference in energy conservation, carbon emissions reduction and environmental sustainability. DESCRIPTION: WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., April 26, 2017 /3BL Media/ – HanesBrands (NYSE: HBI) a leading marketer of everyday basic innerwear and activewear apparel under world-class brands in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, has earned its eighth consecutive U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star Partner of the Year award for sustained excellence in energy conservation, carbon emissions reduction and environmental sustainability. Javier Chacon, chief global manufacturing operations officer, and a team from Hanes is attending today’s annual Energy Star awards banquet in Washington, D.C., to accept the award and participate in collaborative meetings to share best practices with other companies that have earned Energy Star recognition, including The Boeing Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company and General Motors Company. Energy Star was introduced by the EPA in 1992 as a voluntary, market-based partnership to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through increased efficiency. The annual Energy Star Partner of the Year award honors organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protect the environment through best practices and organization-wide energy savings. Hanes is the only apparel company to be honored for sustained excellence by the program in its 25-year history. Hanes – unique in the apparel industry because it owns the significant majority of its manufacturing and supply chain operations – is being recognized by the Energy Star program for 2016 accomplishments, including: Integrating newly acquired facilities across multiple continents into the company’s energy-management program; Implementing more than 220 projects identified through energy treasure hunts, yielding nearly $2 million in energy savings; and, Developing long-range energy plans that identify strategic projects to achieve 2020 goals of reducing energy use by 40 percent, carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent and water use by 50 percent, along with securing at least 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources. Hanes has also committed to diverting 100 percent of waste in its company-owned supply chain from landfills. “HanesBrands is very honored to earn our eighth consecutive Energy Star Partner of the Year award, and all of the credit goes to each of our more than 68,000 worldwide employees who are committed to energy management and environmental responsibility,” said Chacon, who will accept the award on behalf of the company. “We have made significant progress in reducing our environmental footprint, but remain steadfast in our drive to achieve the company’s 2020 goals. Doing so is a win-win-win for the environment we all share, the communities in which we operate, and our company and its stakeholders.” Hanes recently released the company’s 2016 environmental performance data on energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, water use, renewable energy and landfill diversion. Compared with its 2007 baseline, the company reduced its energy use by 16 percent, carbon emissions by 16 percent and water use by 25 percent. Hanes also shifted 25 percent of the energy the company uses to renewable sources, including biomass, hydroelectric and geothermal, and diverted 84 percent – or 118 million pounds – of waste from its company-owned supply chain from landfills.

The exception is Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT), which manufacturers the F-35 fighter jet Trump says costs too much. But the company said F-35 sales were robust and blamed one-time charges in the first quarter as mere hiccups in some international orders. Taken together, Trump’s bombing of Syria and Afghanistan and tough talk on North Korea coincided with the best showing in Fidelity® Select Defense & Aerospace Portfolio (MUTF: FSDAX), since roughly the first three months of former President George W. Bush’s inaugural term in 2000. Shares in the defense index fund rose from $34.81 to $39.66 under Bush, dropped 20 cents from 79.46 under former President Barack Obama, and rose from 130.09 to $139.25 under Trump. Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC), General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE: GD) and United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) all beat expectations in earnings reports issued on Wednesday. A roundup of the reports: Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman reported first-quarter 2017 sales increased 5 percent to $6.3 billion from $6.0 billion in Q1 2016. Q1 net earnings increased 15 percent to $640 million from $556 million in the year-ago period. Q1 2017 diluted earnings per share increased 20 percent to $3.63 from $3.03 in the Q1 2016. Share prices held steady and were trading at 271.04, up 9.35 percent for the three-month period. “First quarter results are a strong start to the year, with solid operational performance from all three of our businesses. We continue to position our company for long-term profitable growth," said Wes Bush, chairman, CEO and president. General Dynamics General Dynamics reported first-quarter 2017 earnings Wednesday from continuing operations of $763 million, a 16.7-percent increase over Q1 2016, on revenue of $7.4 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.48 compared to $2.08 in the year-ago quarter, a 19.2-percent increase. Shares were up half a percent at $194.26, up 9.5 percent for the last three months. "General Dynamics delivered very strong first-quarter operating performance, demonstrated by 13.9-percent operating margins and 10.3-oercent return on sales," said Phebe N. Novakovic, chairman and CEO. United Technologies United Technologies reported a 17.8-percent rise in first-quarter profit. Net earnings increased to $1.39 billion, or $1.73 a share, from $1.18 billion, or $1.42 a share, in the same period a year ago. United Tech's net income attributable to common shareholders rose to $1.39 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.18 billion a year earlier. The company affirmed its earnings forecast for the full year. United Technologies was up more than half a percent and trading at a three-month high of $117.56. Boeing Boeing reported Wednesday a 19-percent rise in Q1 profit despite declining revenue, and it notched up its forecast for full-year earnings. But shares fell 1.42 percent in early Wednesday trading, though the stock was still trading at about its three-month high at $180.86 The world's biggest plane maker said it had earned $1.45 billion, or $2.34 per share, compared with $1.22 billion, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. "With a sharp focus on performance and productivity, our team delivered another quarter of solid financial results, including year-over-year earnings growth and strong operating cash flow," said Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Boeing was awarded a $3.4 billion contract award for 268 Apache attack helicopters. Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin on Tuesday posted weaker-than-expected sales and lower profitability in three of its four divisions, sending its stock down more than 2 percent before it rallied on Wednesday to 270.60, up 6.3 percent for the past three months. The Pentagon's No. 1 weapons supplier cut its full-year earnings forecast by 10 cents to $12.15 to $12.45 per share, from $12.25 to $12.55. This was the first cut Lockheed has made to earnings per share estimates in seven years. Operating margins fell and Lockheed executives cited a variety of reasons on Tuesday, including fewer deliveries and "performance matters" on certain international contracts. The company took a total of $114 million, or 39 cents a share, in one-time charges. Revenue from its aeronautics business increased 8 percent to $4.11 billion, led by higher sales of the F-35 fighter jet. The business accounted for about 37 percent of the company's total revenue in the quarter.

Astronauts have reported funding the strange microbial growths on walls and surfaces, and it has even clogged waterlines.  Now, two instruments onboard will be used to analyse it in orbit, allowing mission controllers to work out how to deal with it Scroll down for video  NASA astronaut Kate Rubins poses for a picture with the minION device during its first test. Astronauts have reported funding the strange microbial growths on walls and surfaces, and it has even clogged waterlines, and will use the machine to analyse it Currently, the only way to identify contaminants is to take a sample and send it back to Earth. 'We have had contamination in parts of the station where fungi was seen growing or biomaterial has been pulled out of a clogged waterline, but we have no idea what it is until the sample gets back down to the lab,' said Sarah Wallace, NASA microbiologist and the project's principal investigator at the agency's Johnson Space Center in Houston.

Share this article Share 230 shares 'On the ISS, we can regularly resupply disinfectants, but as we move beyond low-Earth orbit where the ability for resupply is less frequent, knowing what to disinfect or not becomes very important,' said Wallace. The new technique will marry two pieces of existing spaceflight technology, miniPCR and theMinION, to allow for the first unknown biological samples to be prepared, sequenced and then identified in space. Developed in partnership by NASA's Johnson Space Center and Boeing, this ISS National Lab sponsored investigation   HOW THE TRICORDER WORKS The tiny, plug and play sequencer – about the size of a large candy bar – is diminutive compared to the large microwave-sized sequencers used on Earth. 'Most sequencers in Earth-based labs involve optics, fluorescence, lasers and other vibration sensitive components that are not suited for spaceflight or microgravity,' said Nasa Microbiologist and Project Manager Sarah Castro. Rubins, who studied Ebola and other deadly viruses before becoming an astronaut, will become the first virus-hunter in space, she will attempt to complete the first full-blown DNA decoding, or 'sequencing,' in orbit using this handhelp device. 'There is huge power consumption at play with those as well.' The compact biomolecule sequencer has minimal moving parts and plugs directly into a laptop or tablet, which supplies power to the device and collects the sequencing data. The data is collected as the device passes an ionic current through a perforated surface containing nanopores (natural cell membrane ion pores) and measures the changes in the current as biological molecules from samples pass through the pores.  The change in current can be used to identify a DNA sequence or other molecules. Unlike terrestrial instruments whose sequencing run times can take days, this device's data is available in near real time; analysis can begin within 10-15 minutes from the application of the sample.   'What the coupling of these different devices is doing is allowing us to take the lab to the samples, instead of us having to bring the samples to the lab,' said Aaron Burton, NASA biochemist and Genes in Space-3 co-investigator. Crew members will collect a sample from within the space station to be cultured aboard the orbiting laboratory.  The sample will then be prepared for sequencing, in a process similar to the one used during the Genes in Space-1 investigation, using the miniPCR and finally, sequenced and identified using the MinION device. 'The ISS is very clean,' said Sarah Stahl, microbiologist and project scientist.  'We find a lot of human-associated microorganisms - a lot of common bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus and different types of familiar fungi like Aspergillus and Penicillium.' In addition to identifying microbes in space, this technology could be used to diagnose crew member wounds or illnesses in real time, help identify DNA-based life on other planets and help with other investigations aboard the station. 'The Genes in Space-3 process will increase the scientific capacity of the ISS by facilitating state-of-the-art molecular biology research for both current and next generation ISS researchers,' said Kristen John, NASA aerospace engineer and Genes in Space-3 project engineer.  'The team has put a strong focus on generating a spaceflight-certified catalog of general laboratory items and reagents, and developing common methods and easily customizable reaction conditions for miniPCR and the MinION to enable other ISS researchers to use this technology.' SEQUENCING IN  SPACE  When NASA astronaut Kate Rubins sequenced DNA aboard the International Space Station in 2016, it was a game changer. That first-ever sequencing of DNA in space was part of the Biomolecule Sequencer investigation. The miniPCR (polymerase chain reaction) device was first used aboard the station during the Genes in Space-1, and, soon to be Genes in Space-2 investigations, student-designed experiments in the Genes in Space program. Genes in Space-1 successfully demonstrated the device could be used in microgravity to amplify DNA, a process used to create thousands of copies of specific sections of DNA. The second investigation arrived at the space station on April 22, and will be tested this summer.  Next came the Biomolecule Sequencer investigation, which successfully tested the MinION's ability to sequence strands of Earth-prepared DNA in an orbiting laboratory.  This process will give scientists on the ground real-time access to the experiments going on in space, allowing for more accuracy and a more efficient use of the time on the space station. 'If you could get a snapshot of the molecular signatures of your research as it was occurring on the ISS, how would you change your experiment?' said Wallace.  'Would you change your time points? Provide a different nutrient? Alter growth conditions? You can imagine how, if you had that data, you could adjust your experiment to enhance the insight being gained.'    Share or comment on this article e-mail 230 shares Most watched News videos Tensions rise as North Korea holds massive artillery drill Moment suspected thieves try to steal from white haired pensioner Moment officer kills biker by ramming motorcycle off road Dog has to SMELL owner to recognise him after drastic weight loss 'F**k your Mum': Jeremy Vine almost gets knocked off his bike North Korea says ready to sink US aircraft carrier Video of Marinna Rollins murdering her service dog Cam Female driver ploughs into learner driver while holding a phone CCTV footage shows injured Brit who was dumped on road side Aston Villa fans bully and taunt a couple on train Fox News host makes lewd comments about Ivanka Trump Damon Smith leaves tube without rucksack containing homemade bomb Kim prepares for war: North Korean leader takes the...

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great.

The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Boeing profits jump after job cutsWed, 26 Apr 2017 5:30 PM Share Your Email Aerospace giant Boeing said net income for the quarter ending March 31 rose 19 percent to $1.5 billion. Credit: AFP / Jason Redmond.     Aerospace giant Boeing said Wednesday declining costs boosted earnings for the latest quarter, but revenues missed analyst expectations as commercial plane deliveries dropped. Net income for the quarter ending March 31 rose 19 percent to $1.5 billion. But revenues fell 7.3 percent to $21 billion, below the $21.3 billion expected by Wall Street analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company disappointed expectations. The aerospace giant has been trimming jobs in its civil aviation division due to slowing sales. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg pledged to employ a "sharp focus on performance and productivity" to reach its financial targets. Boeing delivered 169 commercial aircraft in the quarter, down seven from the same period of 2016. Commercial deliveries are closely scrutinized by Wall Street because of their connection to revenues. Boeing modestly increased its full-year profit forecast by 10 cents a share to a range of $10.35 to $10.55, citing a lower-than-expected tax rate. Shares fell 1.6 percent to $180.65 in pre-market trading.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks closed fractionally lower Wednesday, retreating from intraday highs after an outline of President Donald Trump’s tax plan was seen as light on detail. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.05% which earlier had traded briefly above its previous closing high set March 1, finished down 1.16 points, or less than 0.1%, at 2,387.45. Seven out of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors finished lower ground with real-estate and consumer-staples stocks the largest decliners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10% fell 21.03 points, or 0.1%, at 20,975.09, following disappointing first-quarter earnings from Dow components, Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -2.51%  and Boeing Co. BA, -0.98% with both stocks leading decliners on the benchmark. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.00% finished down 0.27 points at 6,025.23, just short of its closing high, after touching an intraday all-time high of 6,040.89, a day after the tech-laden index surpassed the psychologically important level of 6,000 for the first time ever. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn rolled out a one-page outline of Trump’s tax-reform plan in a news conference, promising more details later. See: Live blog and video of Trump tax plan rollout by Mnuchin and Cohn While offering a useful guide what the White House wants to do, the lack of more detail contributed to some subsequent weakness, said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. Read: Full text of Trump administration tax principles The proposal, for example, calls for a one-time tax break on “trillions of dollars held overseas,” but doesn’t specify the rate. “The market was looking for more specific color on rates and the reduction of exemptions, but color on the repatriation tax, which is the single most important issue, was left unaddressed by that press conference,” Colas said in an interview. Investors had not been expecting anything other than a broad outline of the tax reform, but hoped for something with more clarity than previously vague descriptions like “massive” or “phenomenal”, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist, at Prudential Financial. Krosby noted that earnings, especially revenue growth has been underpinning the market as well as optimism about tax reform. Read: Trump’s tax reform could lift the stock-market to new heights Promises of a tax plan have been one of the linchpins of recent gains for risk assets and is likely to be a significant driver of trading action across asset classes as more details emerge. “There’s an existential problem with any kind of legislation as an investment catalyst,” Convergex’s Colas said. “Unlike earnings, this is not a specific event, this is a slow, grinding process that does not lend itself to being an investment catalyst.” Also in focus was a potential government shutdown this weekend. Some of those concerns, however, may have eased after Trump backed off on a demand for funding for a wall between the U.S.-Mexico border. See: Should Wall Street fear a government shutdown?

The major averages are adding to the gains posted in the two previous sessions. Currently, the Dow is up 55.98 points or 0.3 percent at 21,052.10, the Nasdaq is up 6.62 points or 0.1 percent at 6,032.11 and the S&P 500 is up 5.63 points or 0.2 percent at 2,394.24. The markets have benefited from recent upward momentum, but traders seem reluctant to make significant moves following the release of a mixed batch of quarterly results. Shares of Twitter (TWTR) are moving sharply higher after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is also seeing notable strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) have come under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region extended a recent upward move during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.5 percent. The major European markets also moved to the upside on the day. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both edged up by 0.2 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have pulled back near the unchanged line after seeing early strength. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by less than a basis point at 2.2329 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment Sensex, Nifty Marginally Lower Ahead Of F&O Expiry Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower On Weak Asian Cues Renewed Selling Pressure Seen For Thai Stock Market Indonesia Shares May Open Under Pressure Hong Kong Bourse Due For Consolidation Lower Open Called For China Shares Rally Tipped To Stall For Taiwan Stock Market Singapore Stock Market May Run Out Of Steam Win Streak May End For Malaysia Shares South Korea Stock Market Due For Profit Taking Major Averages Close Slightly Lower After Late-Day Pullback - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Little Changed Ahead Of ECB Meeting Stocks Seeing Modest Strength In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary <<Previous        65 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Samsung Q1 Profit Up 46%; Rejects Holding-company Structure Las Vegas Sands Q1 Profit Rises - Update Instagram Reaches 700 Mln Users Worst Business Ideas To Be Immortalized In 'Museum Of Failure' Netflix Enters Chinese Market Through Baidu Sergey Brin Working On Secret Airship Boeing Q1 Profit Tops View, But Revenues Miss; Lifts 2017 Profit View Uber Sees Flying Cars By 2020 Number Of Subway Locations Shrink For First Time Ever Twitter Q1 Adj.

Alitalia is preparing for special administration proceedings after workers rejected its latest rescue plan, making it impossible for the loss-making airline to secure funds to keep its aircraft flying. Workers are hoping the Italian government will step in with an alternative rescue deal. Malaysia Airlines could take between six and eight Airbus A330s from Alitalia, CEO Peter Bellew told Reuters in Dubai. “I hope Alitalia stays in business but it doesn’t look good to me today. I think it’s hard to see how they are going come back from the pressure they are sitting on at the moment,” he said. An Alitalia spokesman declined to comment. Malaysia Airlines is emerging from a turnaround after suffering two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing disappeared in what remains a mystery, and then flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Its load factors — or how full its planes are — averaged around 80 per cent in the three months to March 31, Bellew said. Malaysia Airlines wants to lease between six and eight A330s or Boeing 777s for use from 2018 and a further seven to nine from 2019, he said, expecting to finalise most of those deals in the next four to six weeks. This is an increase on the six for 2018 and six for 2019 he told Reuters last month he was interested in. “The world really is awash right now,” Bellew said with regard to spare wide-body aircraft, adding that he also saw opportunities to take aircraft from Middle East carriers. “There are really good deals out there at the moment. It’s a buyer’s market right now.” Bellew also said he planned to make a decision on an order for 30-35 new Airbus A330neo or Boeing 787-9 wide-body planes in the next four to six months to replace existing aircraft in its fleet from the end of 2019. “If the prices are good ... we will do an order,” he said. “But they need to sharpen their pencils because they are still unrealistic with the pricing in the current market.” Malaysia Airlines would look for more leases if it doesn’t get the pricing it wants, he said. It could also convert or add to an existing order for 25 of Boeing’s new generation 737 MAX 8 narrowbody aircraft or the proposed bigger MAX 10 version currently being offered informally to the market by the US plane maker. Bellew did not say how many could be ordered or when a decision might be made. Industry sources said on Tuesday that Boeing was nearing a decision to launch the MAX 10 plane at the Paris Airshow in June. Malaysia Airlines plans to trim its narrowbody fleet to between 35 and 40 aircraft from 54 currently and increase its number of wide-bodies from 15 to 35. The airline is aiming for a return to profitability by 2018 and stock market listing in March the following year. Bellew said he believed a majority of the airline would be listed.

By Robert G. Boatright, opinion contributor - 04/26/17 10:40 AM EDT 276   © Getty No one really knows how to talk about all of the misspellings that have thus far characterized the Trump administration. At first, some of them simply seemed like the inevitable byproduct of late night/early morning tweeting, as when Trump described his opponent Marco RubioMarco RubioWhat’s with Trump’s spelling mistakes? Boeing must be stopped from doing business with Iran Top Trump officials push border wall as government shutdown looms MORE as a “leightweight chocker.”  Trump went on to talk about the “great honer” of being a debate winner and about China’s “unpresidented” military actions. So it has always seemed as if Trump had some spelling challenges.  ADVERTISEMENT As Trump’s people have settled in, however, there have been a variety of other problems. The Department of Education misspelled W.E.B. DuBois’ name (as DeBois) in a black history month message — and then issued an ungrammatical follow-up tweet correcting the mistake. And the official White House inaugural photo featured an inspirational quote that read “No dream is too big, no challenge is to great.” So it is clearly not just Trump.    As a teacher, I spend a lot of time reading papers with spelling mistakes. If there are just one or two errors, I either ignore them or correct them without comment. But when there are a lot, I have been known to lower students’ grades. When I am challenged by students on this, the conversation always is the same. The student points out that spelling mistakes are not a big deal, that I should be more interested in the quality of the ideas in the paper than in grammar, spelling, or punctuation. I say that spelling mistakes suggest to me that the student has not taken the paper (and, by extension, my class) as seriously as he could have, and that the student’s failure to check for spelling errors is symptomatic of a failure to check for larger problems. Even if I overlooked them, future employers may not be so charitable. I am providing students with a life lesson. We both walk away from the conversation dissatisfied. In this spirit, I offer three explanations for Trump’s spelling errors we’ve seen so far: First, perhaps the implication here is that the people making these mistakes really don’t take things all that seriously. If it’s a waste of time to communicate with the public at all — if Trump, or his appointees, are merely going through the motions, why bother to spend time looking for spelling mistakes?            Second, perhaps they are in fact meant to be a sign that deep thoughts are being thought, and that things are moving so fast in Trump world that they cannot be held up by the need to check for mistakes. It’s the ideas that count.   And third, perhaps the whole point is to trap us, the public, in petty responses. Just as my students no doubt think I am being petty when I knock a few points off of their grades for repeated spelling errors, so Trump critics sound petty when they harp on spelling mistakes.  If you are a Trump opponent, the first explanation here may sound appealing. This is all part and parcel of the “deconstruction of the administrative state” that Steve Bannon discussed at the CPAC meeting. Take the Department of Education tweet, for instance. Betsy DeVos’ confirmation hearing was contentious, to say the least, in part because DeVos has always been a skeptic of the federal government’s role in public education. If the Department of Education shouldn’t even exist, then it seems as if guidance from the Department of Education regarding Black History Month certainly should not be a priority. The message in part here might be that anyone can run these agencies — if the goal is to undo federal regulations in the schools, this seems like a thing anyone can do, whether or not they can spell. This seems to fit the ethos of many of the cabinet appointments — government, Trump-style, just isn’t that hard, and it is worth reminding people of this. If that serves to undermine faith in the Department of Education, that’s part of the point. I’m somewhat partial, however, to the second explanation. We currently have an executive branch that’s not fully staffed, that is working feverishly to implement some of the Trump agenda before the long process of legislating the bigger changes begins. Yet this explanation — although it is perhaps a little bit more charitable — shows the risks involved in this strategy. If you’re in a hurry to do things, you make plenty of mistakes. You fail to consider how things will stand up in the courts. You upset decades-old alliances with other countries for no particular reason. You leave the bureaucracy — be it the ICE, the Department of State, or the EPA — without clear instructions about what they should be doing. In short, the inattention to detail is not really a sign of engagement with bigger problems; instead, it masks an inattention to larger, more fundamental problems that can cripple an administration. But then again, consider where you, the reader, are at now. You just spent a few minutes reading an article about spelling mistakes, instead of focusing on substantive policy change. This may suggest that the third explanation has some merit. Robert G.

The US is about to test launch its nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Minuteman III. Although the country's Air Force Global Strike Command insists that the test has no connection to the tensions simmering over North Korea, Igor Korotchenko, Director of the Center for Analysis of World Arms Trade (CAWAT), doubts the statement is entirely true. "[The Minuteman III ICBM] serves as a strategic deterrent and demonstrates US readiness to strike a potential adversary," Korotchenko told Radio Sputnik. © Photo: YouTube/ATFxclanxvids US Holds War Games With Japan, South Korea Amid DPRK Tensions"Every year, the US launches ballistic missiles from sea and land to confirm the operational utility of its strategic nuclear forces and to assess the technical characteristics of these missiles. Such missile tests are conducted by the Americans, and by us [the Russians], and by other countries of the nuclear club [on a regular basis]," he said. However, he believes that despite the Pentagon's statements, there is a "certain military-political component" in the upcoming ICBM launch. "As for this specific launch, it obviously has a military-political component, given the fact that the Americans continue to amass their [military] forces around North Korea. Therefore, at the given time this launch can more or less be regarded as military and political pressure on Pyongyang," Korotchenko underscored. © AP Photo/ Ahn Young-joon It is Not Just North Korea But Asia That is in US CrosshairsDubbed by Boeing as the "backbone of the [US] nuclear deterrence triad," the land-based Minuteman III are due to be launched from California on Wednesday. "These Minuteman launches are essential to verify the status of our national nuclear force and to demonstrate our national nuclear capabilities," 30th Space Wing Commander Col. John Moss stated, as quoted by the Washington Examiner. Meanwhile, the American strike group headed by the USS Carl Vinson is reportedly heading to North Korea in a show of force amid growing tensions in the region. Citing the US Navy, the Associated Press reported Wednesday that the group's air wing is currently conducting joint military drills with Japan's Air Self-Defense Forces south of Japan. "It follows a two-day exercise with two Japanese destroyers as the Vinson group passed through the Philippine Sea en route to the Koreas," the media outlet reported, adding that the two exercises "demonstrate the ability of the US and Japan to work together at sea to respond quickly to threats in the region." Washington's April 8 report regarding the USS Carl Vinson's alleged move toward the Korean Peninsula had exacerbated tensions dramatically, prompting Pyongyang to dub the supposed deployment of the US strike group in the Sea of Japan as a "reckless act of aggression" and threaten the US with a preemptive strike. Commenting on the situation in the region, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned against picking a military option while solving the Korean crisis. "It is obvious that heavy-handed approaches that are beginning to be mentioned publicly are fraught with catastrophic consequences for the Korean Peninsula and the whole of Northeast Asia," Lavrov said. © REUTERS/ Stringer Beijing Launches First China-Made Aircraft Carrier Amid North Korean Crisis (VIDEO)Lavrov also voiced Moscow's concerns regarding "the disproportionate build-up under the pretext of the North Korean threatening the US and its regional allies' military activity." Moscow is not the only geopolitical player concerned with the escalation in tension over the Korean Peninsula. On Wednesday Beijing launched the first-ever Chinese-made aircraft carrier, known as the Type 001A. The ship was constructed at the Dalian Shipyard, a port in northern China's Liaoning province, which shares a border the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). "The Type 001A is the country's second aircraft carrier, launching just over four years after the Liaoning, China's first, came into official service. While the  Liaoning, a refitted Soviet vessel, is classified as a training ship for the PLAN, the Type 001A will be the military's first combat-ready carrier which can guarantee the effective use of air power," the Chinese English-language media outlet Global Times reported Wednesday. Perhaps, it is no coincidence that Beijing launches its aircraft carrier from the port closest to the DPRK, as the US strike group approaches North Korean waters and the Air Force Global Strike Command prepares to carry out its ICBM test. ...

Buying interest has remained somewhat subdued, however, limiting the upside for the major averages. Currently, the major averages are just above the unchanged line. The Dow is up 33.67 points or 0.2 percent at 21,029.79, the Nasdaq is up 1.71 points or less than 0.1 percent at 6,027.20 and the S&P 500 is up 4.60 points or 0.2 percent at 2,393.21. While the markets have benefited from recent upward momentum, traders seem reluctant to make significant moves following the release of a mixed batch of quarterly results. Shares of Twitter (TWTR) are moving sharply higher after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is also seeing notable strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) are likely to come under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. Oil service stocks have shown a significant move to the upside on the day, driving the Philadelphia Oil Service Index up by 2 percent. The strength in the sector comes amid an increase by the price of crude oil. Natural gas and railroad stocks have also moved notably higher, while weakness is visible among electronic storage and trucking stocks. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region extended a recent upward move during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.5 percent. The major European markets have also moved to the upside on the day. While the German DAX Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index are both up by 0.3 percent. In the bond market, treasuries are regaining ground after trending lower in recent sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by nearly a basis point at 2.318 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Gainers & Losers Of Apr.26: AKBA, FLKS, BIOL, BABY, FLXN...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman HanesBrands Earns Eighth Consecutive U.S. EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year Award for Environmental Excellence WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–HanesBrands (NYSE: HBI) a leading marketer of everyday basic innerwear and activewear apparel under world-class brands in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, has earned its eighth consecutive U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star Partner of the Year award for sustained excellence in energy conservation, carbon emissions reduction and environmental sustainability. Javier Chacon, chief global manufacturing operations officer, and a team from Hanes is attending today’s annual Energy Star awards banquet in Washington, D.C., to accept the award and participate in collaborative meetings to share best practices with other companies that have earned Energy Star recognition, including The Boeing Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company and General Motors Company. Energy Star was introduced by the EPA in 1992 as a voluntary, market-based partnership to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through increased efficiency. The annual Energy Star Partner of the Year award honors organizations that have made outstanding contributions to protect the environment through best practices and organization-wide energy savings. Hanes is the only apparel company to be honored for sustained excellence by the program in its 25-year history. Hanes – unique in the apparel industry because it owns the significant majority of its manufacturing and supply chain operations – is being recognized by the Energy Star program for 2016 accomplishments, including: Integrating newly acquired facilities across multiple continents into the company’s energy-management program; Implementing more than 220 projects identified through energy treasure hunts, yielding nearly $2 million in energy savings; and, Developing long-range energy plans that identify strategic projects to achieve 2020 goals of reducing energy use by 40 percent, carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent and water use by 50 percent, along with securing at least 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources. Hanes has also committed to diverting 100 percent of waste in its company-owned supply chain from landfills. “HanesBrands is very honored to earn our eighth consecutive Energy Star Partner of the Year award, and all of the credit goes to each of our more than 68,000 worldwide employees who are committed to energy management and environmental responsibility,” said Chacon, who will accept the award on behalf of the company. “We have made significant progress in reducing our environmental footprint, but remain steadfast in our drive to achieve the company’s 2020 goals. Doing so is a win-win-win for the environment we all share, the communities in which we operate, and our company and its stakeholders.” Hanes recently released the company’s 2016 environmental performance data on energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, water use, renewable energy and landfill diversion. Compared with its 2007 baseline, the company reduced its energy use by 16 percent, carbon emissions by 16 percent and water use by 25 percent. Hanes also shifted 25 percent of the energy the company uses to renewable sources, including biomass, hydroelectric and geothermal, and diverted 84 percent – or 118 million pounds – of waste from its company-owned supply chain from landfills.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Sonu Nigam Vijay Mallya TTV Dinakaran Donald Trump IPL 2017 News World News US STOCKS-Wall St set to open flat with tax plan in focus Shares0 Wed, 26 Apr 2017-06:31pm , Reuters U.S. stocks were on track to open little changed on Wednesday, following two days of strong gains, as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of a highly anticipated tax plan. Trump is proposing to slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and offer multinational businesses a steep tax break on overseas profits brought into the United States, officials said late on Tuesday. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC that there was fundamental agreement with Congress on the goals of tax reforms and that the administration would release details of the plan later on Wednesday. "We have a pretty good idea that he (Trump) is targeting lower corporate taxes, lower individual taxes and a simplification of the process, but all that is in an ideal world," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. "The market will not interpret the plan negatively, but there are obstacles in that course, just like with anything that Trump says and does." Investors are also assessing a raft of quarterly earnings reports. Dow component Boeing's shares slipped 1.4 percent in premarket trading after the planemaker reported a decline in revenue. Dow e-minis were down 7 points, or 0.03 percent, at 8:28 a.m. ET (1228 GMT) with 27,744 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 1.5 points, or 0.06 percent, with 117,019 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 1.25 points, or 0.02 percent, on volume of 19,628 contracts. Wall Street marked its best two-day gain for the year on Tuesday after a favorable French election outcome and strong earnings boosted investor optimism and sparked demand for risk assets. The Nasdaq Composite index breached the 6,000 mark for the first time on Tuesday, while other indexes came within spitting distance of their peaks. "In this process of searching for new highs, I expect profit taking and pauses as investors question where the next push will come from" Bakhos said. Shares of Wynn Resorts jumped 5.7 percent to $125 after the casino operator reported better-than-expected revenue from its new casino in China's gambling territory. United States Steel tumbled more than 17 percent to $25.87 after the company's profit and revenue missed analysts' expectations. AK Steel were off nearly 2 percent.

This week, the California Tax Foundation released the third edition of Tax Watch: Major Taxes and Fees Introduced in the California Legislature, a report cataloging all legislation introduced since the start of the legislative session in December that proposes a new or increased tax or fee. The cumulative sum of these proposals is the highest we’ve ever identified. These proposals seek to increase the price of the most basic necessities – housing, health care, child care, groceries and driving a car. From a business perspective, these bills would make it costlier for start-ups, family businesses, neighborhood restaurants and California’s industry icons to keep their doors open. Since January, 17,687 Californians have lost their jobs due to business closures or downsizing. The state Employment Development Department reports that the businesses that have notified the state they may reduce their workforce include: Advanced Call Center Technologies, Aerojet, Alaska Air, AOL, Bebe, Boeing, Carl’s Jr., Coca-Cola, Diamond Foods, Fitbit, Gap, Google, Live Nation, Macys, Morton Salt, National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, Nordstrom, Northrop Grumman, Oracle, Payless, Sears, Shutterfly, Technicolor, United Launch Alliance and Western Digital. It is no secret that California has costly regulations, a litigious atmosphere and a high tax burden. Legislative leaders often dismiss these complaints and point to California’s economic output and job growth – and to be fair, the state has had net job gains. But how much better would the state job’s climate be without the job losses that wipe out too many of the gains? Many of the proposals identified in Tax Watch may never become law, but even an empty threat of gutting Proposition 13 protections, taxing foreign income, expanding regulatory fees, etc., is enough to stifle investment and expansion by creating uncertainty, and promoting the perception that California is hostile to business. Legislative leaders are uniquely poised to improve California’s reputation, and to make the state friendly to new businesses and jobs. As policy deliberations continue in the Capitol, it will be the role of the supermajority to thoughtfully weigh the merits of pro-growth tax reform vs. tax policies that would stifle economic growth. Throughout the legislative session, Tax Watch will be updated with information on any additional tax and fee policies that are proposed, and with status updates on all the measures in the report. We hope Californians will use this important information to stay informed, so they can be active participants in discussions about possible changes to our state’s tax structure.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a roughly flat open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by just 11 points. A lack of major U.S. economic data may keep traders on the sidelines as traders digest a mixed batch of quarterly results. Shares of Twitter (TWTR) are moving sharply higher in pre-market trading after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) could also see early strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) are likely to come under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. Traders may also be reluctant to make significant moves as they await President Donald Trump's announcement on his tax reform plan. Stocks moved mostly higher during trading on Tuesday, adding to the strong gains posted on Monday. With the continued upward move, the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed to a new record closing high. The major averages closed firmly in positive territory but off their best levels of the day. The Dow jumped 232.23 points or 1.1 percent to 20,996.12, the Nasdaq climbed 41.67 points or 0.7 percent to 6,025.49 and the S&P 500 rose 14.46 points or 0.6 percent to 2,388.61. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region extended a recent upward move during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.5 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets are seeing modest weakness on the day. While the German DAX Index has dipped by 0.2 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index are both down by 0.1 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are slipping $0.29 to $49.27 a barrel after rising $0.33 to $49.56 a barrel on Tuesday. Gold futures, which fell $10.30 to $1,267.20 an ounce in the previous session, are dipping $3 to $1,264.20 an ounce. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 111.44 yen compared to the 111.09 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0891 compared to yesterday's $1.0926. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Gainers & Losers Of Apr.26: AKBA, FLKS, BIOL, BABY, FLXN...

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Market US stock futures flat as Trump tax plan awaited US stock futures flat as Trump tax plan awaited U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Wednesday amid a flood of corporate earnings, while investors awaited President Donald Trump's tax plan. By: Reuters | Published: April 26, 2017 6:05 PM Dow e-minis were up 29 points, or 0.14 percent, with 18,754 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were down 1.25 points, or 0.05 percent, with 89,250 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 1.25 points, or 0.02 percent, on volume of 16,068 contracts. U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Wednesday amid a flood of corporate earnings, while investors awaited President Donald Trump’s tax plan. Trump is proposing to slash the corporate income tax rate and offer multinational businesses a steep tax break on overseas profits brought into the United States, officials said late on Tuesday. The plan could provide a shot in the arm to the post-election rally, which has stalled in recent weeks over the lack of clarity on Trump’s pro-growth policies and the failure of a healthcare reform bill. A flurry of quarterly earnings could also provide fresh catalysts for trading. Shares of United Technologies, Nasdaq Inc and Northrop Grumman were up in premarket trading after the companies reported a rise in quarterly profits. Boeing, Amgen and PayPal are scheduled to report results on Wednesday. Nearly 78 percent of S&P 500 companies that have reported results until Tuesday have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall profit for the index is estimated to have risen 11.4 percent – the best since 2011. Wall Street is coming off its best two-day gain of the year after a favourable French election outcome and strong earnings boosted investor optimism and sparked demand for risk assets. The Nasdaq Composite index breached the 6,000 mark for the first time ever on Tuesday, while other indexes came within spitting distance of their peaks.

Harworth Group, which specialises in the regeneration of former coalfield and other brownfield sites, has built six new units, totalling 52,068 sq ft, as part of its expansion of the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Waverley, Rotherham. Harworth said its investment was driven by demand for space from manufacturers wanting to be close to the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC). JF Finnegan began building the units in September 2016. They range from 4,966 sq ft to 26,107 sq ft and have been designed with advanced manufacturers in mind. They are available for immediate leasehold occupation. Construction was funded with a £2.5m loan from the Sheffield City Region (SCR) Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (JESSICA) Fund. The new units – a scheme of two terraces across three acres – forms part of phase two of ‘R-evolution @ The AMP’. The first phase – 52,000 sq ft of space built in 2014 – is fully occupied, with occupiers including X-Cel Superturn and Metalysis. The Advanced Manufacturing Park is home to businesses that provide world-class technology solutions for use in precision industries including aerospace, defence, construction, automotive, sport and others. Occupiers include Boeing, Rolls Royce, Castings Technology International (CTI), Dormer Tools and Sandvik Coromant. The business park is part of Waverley – Yorkshire’s largest ever brownfield mixed-use development at 740 acres, where over one million sq ft of employment space and more than 650 homes have already been built and occupied. David Travis, director of business space at Harworth Group, said: “We’re delighted with the quality of all six completed units and I want to express my continued thanks to both JF Finnegan and our appointed project team for another job well done. “We are now actively promoting these units for immediate leasehold occupation to advanced manufacturing and engineering companies wanting to be in close proximity to the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and the other high-value occupants of the AMP.” The scheme will be marketed by jointly appointed agents Knight Frank and Gent Visick. Tom Swallow, senior surveyor at Knight Frank’s Sheffield office, added: “We are witnessing good levels of demand from occupiers looking for space on the Advanced Manufacturing Park.” He added: “With one of the units already under offer, we are confident that the scheme will prove successful given the lack of existing available space in the market.” William Church, director of CBRE Capital Advisors and fund manager for SCR JESSICA, added: “The provision of such space is fundamentally important infrastructure for the economic growth of the region given limited existing supply; supporting this growth is the purpose of the Fund.” The SCR JESSICA Fund, which is made up of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Growing Places capital, aims to provide funding for regeneration projects at competitive commercial rates where funding might otherwise prove challenging in the current markets.

Shares of United Technologies, Nasdaq Inc and Northrop Grumman were up in premarket trading after the companies reported a rise in quarterly profits. * Boeing, Amgen and PayPal are scheduled to report results on Wednesday. * Nearly 78 percent of S&P 500 companies that have reported results until Tuesday have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall profit for the index is estimated to have risen 11.4 percent - the best since 2011. * Wall Street is coming off its best two-day gain of the year after a favorable French election outcome and strong earnings boosted investor optimism and sparked demand for risk assets. * The Nasdaq Composite index breached the 6,000 mark for the first time ever on Tuesday, while other indexes came within spitting distance of their peaks. * Wynn Resorts jumped 5.7 percent to $125 after the casino operator reported better-than-expected revenue from its new casino in China's gambling territory. * United States Steel tumbled nearly 17 percent to $25.87 after the steelmaker's profit and revenue missed analysts' expectations. * Twitter jumped 11 percent after reporting its strongest growth in monthly active users in more than a year and a quarterly profit that blew past expectations.

The aerospace giant was expected to post earnings of $1.94 a share on revenue of $21.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176. 18 Hours AgoReuters SHARES Randall Hill | Reuters Planes are being prepared for customer approval in the delivery ramp at Boeing South Carolina in North Charleston, South Carolina. Boeing on Wednesday reported a 19 percent rise in first-quarter profit despite declining revenue, and it notched up its forecast for full-year earnings. The world's biggest plane maker said it had earned $1.45 billion, or $2.34 per share, compared with $1.22 billion, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier. The company's core earnings, which exclude some pension and other costs, rose to $2.01 per share from $1.74, beating the analysts' consensus estimate of $1.94, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 7.3 percent to $20.98 billion, missing the consensus estimate of $21.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The decline came as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176, and because last year's revenue figure included delivery of three C-17 military transport aircraft, a plane Boeing has stopped making. Deliveries of 737s also dipped as Boeing built 737 MAX 8 jets that it plans to begin delivering this quarter, now that the plane has regulatory certification. While Boeing delivered two fewer 777s in the quarter, it delivered two more 787s. The results also showed the effect of Boeing's cost-cutting and factory productivity improvements. Boeing is honing its ability to make 787s, and the larger 787-9 model is more profitable that the earlier one. Boeing's KC-46 aerial refueling tanker continued to weigh on results. The company said it still expected to deliver 760-765 commercial aircraft in 2017. Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change BA ---

"The ATR 72-600 passenger plane is currently undergoing flight tests in France and it will arrive in Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Friday," CEO of Iran Air, national flag carrier, Farhad Parvaresh said on Tuesday. He noted that three other ATR 72-600 passenger planes are also slated to fly to Tehran next Sunday, Wednesday and Friday. The senior aviation official reiterated that all four airplanes purchased purchased from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR have successfully passed primary tests and are conducting pilot takeoffs and landings at Toulouse–Blagnac Airport in France. "Additionally, logo of Iran Air has been painted on the fuselage of the manufactured jetliners," he added. In relevant remarks earlier in April, Parvaresh said that the Iranian airline will receive four ATR aircraft within three weeks given that the deadline for the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer has expired for a week. Parvaresh also noted that, as per the contract with Boeing, the first Boeing 777 Wide-body jet airliner will be delivered to Iran Air in a year time. He also pointed to the latest status of the negotiations with the largest German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG, and said, "Not long ago, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed with Lufthansa on technical and operational training, catering and corporate restructuring as well as business cooperation; the agreement was recently implemented in the commercial sector though talks are still underway on other provisions." The French-Italian ATR plane manufacturer has signed a contract with Iran Air to provide it with 20 planes. This is a third plane manufacturer after Airbus and Boeing had successfully signed lucrative deals with Iran. Efforts to sign a deal with Brazilian manufacturer Embraer had been uninspiring and plans were abandoned in favor of Airbus and Boeing.         Related News Official: Iran Air to Receive 1st Wide-Body Boeing Passenger Plane in 2018  Minister: Iran to Use ATR Planes for Short-Distance, Small Airports  CEO: ATR Ready to Sell More Passenger Planes to Iran  Source: Boeing to Deliver 2 Passenger Planes to Iran in 1 Month  Deputy Minister: Iran Air Inks Contract with ATR to Buy 20 Passenger Planes  Iran to Buy Russian-Made Amphibious Planes  Iran Inks New Deal with Boeing to Buy 30 Passenger Planes  LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Takes Control of More Areas after Intense Clashes with Terrorists in Al-Qaboun Syrian Army Advances into Depth of Sham Desert in Eastern Ghouta Iraqi Popular Forces Take Control over 3 More Villages, West of Mosul Deir Ezzur: Syrian Army Troops on Guard in Cemetery Region Iraqi Popular Forces Cut off ISIL Supply Line between Ba'aj, Al-Hadher in Nineveh Province Post-Militants Era: People of Zabadani & Madaya Start Peaceful Life A Cry for Help: Millions Facing Famine in War-Torn Yemen Syria: Madaya Alleys Become Children's Playground Again Fate of Syria Must Not Be Decided by US and Fellow Warmongers Russian Air Force Conducts Four Times More Air Raids Than US-led Coalition Aircraft in Syria Al-Baghdadi's Senior Aide Captured in Syria Iranian Defense Minister: US Policies in Syria 'A New Form of Fascism' Russian FM: Hezbollah, Iranian Forces Present in Syria at Government’s Request Moscow: Russian Position Unchanged by France’s Anti-Syria Stance Syrian Army Advances in More Regions Near Palmyra Syrian Army Takes Control of More Areas after Intense Clashes with Terrorists in Al-Qaboun TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army continued its military operations in Al-Qaboun neighborhood in the Eastern outskirts of Damascus and won control of several buildings and a power plant on the Eastern side of the neighborhood.

(Ian Terry / The Herald) New building expands capacity at Northshore Christian Academy Kari Bray Sat Apr 22nd, 2017 1:30am News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — The new Cascade Pavilion at Northshore Christian Academy is expected to add more space for music, robotics, lunches and middle school classrooms. The building is under construction now at the private, faith-based school. It’s the latest addition at a campus that has grown over the past couple of decades to keep up with a steady increase in enrollment. Northshore Christian Church opened in 1993 as a plant of Overlake Christian Church. Two years later, the academy was founded. There were 37 students. Now, there are 1,015 students from toddlers to 8th grade. The school and church were in a leased warehouse until 2003, when they moved to a permanent home at 5700 23rd Drive W, not far from Boeing’s Everett location. Northshore Christian Academy includes specialty programs for art, music, science and engineering, and early education. Summer programs were added in 2005. The church shares space with the school, so the campus is busy all week long. “We are really using God’s house to its max capacity, and we love that,” said Denise Christian, admissions and marketing director. The academy is going from 145,000 square feet to 162,000 thanks to the addition of Cascade Pavilion. It’s the twin to Olympic Pavilion, built in 2010. The buildings are to be connected by an underground hallway and an upper story bridge. Administrators expect an increase in enrollment after opening Cascade Pavilion this fall, but the school is close to capacity. The new building is meant to expand learning areas for current students, Christian said. It’s a $3.3 million project. Workers have been putting in the foundation. Next will be steel framing, said Mark Lewinski, CEO and president of contractor Kirtley Cole. He feels good about the project and the company’s partnership with the school, he said. The pavilion is designed to add a larger cafeteria that can seat two grade levels at a time rather than one, meaning longer lunch periods are possible. The existing cafeteria will be turned into a music space, and a new music room also is planned. That’s to better accommodate the 11 performing groups at the school, including orchestras, choirs and bands. One of the new building’s rooms is for Spanish teachers, who currently rove from classroom to classroom. Another key feature of Cascade Pavilion is additional science and engineering space, a boon to the school’s three robotics teams. “The school has grown so much and provided so much,” said David Chen, who volunteers as a robotics adviser. “From an engineering perspective, this is a dream come true, not only to mentor my own child but to mentor other children.” Middle school students are mastering programming, design and manufacturing, all of which are vital skills in the workplace, he said. Cascade Pavilion will allow the school to give sixth-grade students their own space, too. Currently, sixth-grade classrooms are spread throughout the campus. Giving elementary and middle school students separate areas creates a sense of community for them, said Glen Cowan, who serves on the church’s elder board and school board. “It lets them have their identity,” he said. Administrators and volunteers say their goal is to teach students to be kind to others and steady in their faith. They want students to leave the school as leaders. Christian’s granddaughter attends the school. “She has a heart for Jesus and I love that,” Christian said. There are 17 languages spoken among the school’s students. They are not required to attend a Christian church to enroll, but Bible studies and chapel time are part of the curriculum. After finishing middle school at Northshore Christian Academy, students go on to about 17 area high schools. Kari Bray: 425-339-3439; kbray@heraldnet.com.   Construction commences on Northshore Christian Academy’s new school building in Mukilteo on April 12. The new $3.3 million section of the private school is on track to open for the 2017-18 school year.

Impressive quarterly reports were delivered by a number of large-cap companies amid more general optimism, as investors await further details regarding the President’s planed tax cuts along with broad confidence that Macron will succeed in becoming France’s next President. The Nasdaq spiked up more than 0.7%, sending the index above 6,000 for this first time ever, while the Dow Jones rose more than 200 points, with results from Caterpillar driving the construction sector as Dupont and McDonald’s also pleased both at the top and bottom lines, leaving just Coca-Cola missing analyst’s best expectations. Banking, Biotech, Chemical, Computer Hardware and Networking Stocks all performed well. Economic releases, however, presented more of a mixed bag, with new home sales seeing a substantial increase in March contrasting a separate report from the Conference Board that showed a larger than expected pullback in consumer confidence for April, although the index still remains at a strong level. More than 190 S&P components are expected to have reported by the end of the week, with other big names scheduled to release quarterlies this afternoon including Boeing, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, Twitter, United Technologies. But against this background, Trump was forced yesterday to delay his push to secure federal funds to build his promised border wall with Mexico, in order to eliminate a sticking point as lawmakers work to avoid the looming government shutdown. Asian traders this morning also expressed relief that relieved that, other than staging a brief military drill as the USS Michigan nuclear submarine docked in Busan, no significant gestures were received from Pyongyang as North Korea’s 85th People’s Army Day drew to a close. This allowed the region to extend its gains for the third day, picking up a hint from positive US and European closes during early morning trade, with Japan putting in the strongest performance, although the ASX and Hang Seng were not far behind and, more modestly, the Shanghai Composite also reversed early losses to end in the positive. European stocks also closed higher yesterday as French manufacturing sentiment strengthened to a near six-year high in April, leading the Stoxx Europe 600 to rise 0.2% while recording its fifth consecutive session of gains. The FTSE-100 put almost as much on, as safe-haven assets, like Gold and Government Bonds, continued to retreat. There is no UK or EU macro data due today, although Theresa May hosts Jean-Claude Juncker and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in London. The US releases MBA Mortgage Applications and EIA Crude Stocks change numbers. UK corporates due to report earnings or trading updates include Antofagasta (ANTO.L), Fresnillo (FRES.L), CRH (CRH.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L), The London Stock Exchange (LSE.L), GSK (GSK.L), Boohoo.com (BOO.L) and Tullow Oil (TLW.L). Investors will also be keen to hear more from the EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, following reports that Brussells wishes to expand its dialogue with Russia on key foreign policy issues, the first significant sign of a thaw in relations and a move that seemingly reflects growing concerns regarding the U.S.’s unpredictable international policy. London equities are seen having trouble sustaining recent upward momentum, with mining giant BHP Billiton cutting its annual guidance for coking coal and copper this morning, the FTSE-100 to be down 10 or so points during opening trade. " - Barry Gibb, Research Analyst   Markets Europe The FTSE-100 finished yesterday's session 0.15% higher at 7,275.64 whilst the FTSE AIM All-Share index was 0.47% up at 957.29. In continental Europe, the CAC-40 finished up 0.17% at 5,277.88 whilst the DAX was 0.10% higher at 12,467.04. Wall Street In New York last night, the Dow Jones rose 1.12% to 20,996.12, the S&P 500 firmed 0.61% to 2388.61 and the Nasdaq gained 0.7% to 6025.49. Asia In Asian markets this morning, the Nikkei 225 had risen 0.93% to 19,257.42, while the Hang Seng firmed 0.58% to 24,598.85. Oil In early trade today, WTI crude was down 0.18% to $49.47/bbl and Brent was down 0.13% to $52.03/bbl.   Headlines Boohoo online fashion retailer sees its profits double Annual pre-tax profits at online fashion retailer Boohoo (BOO.L) have almost doubled to £31m - up from just under £16m last year. Its sales have jumped by 51% to almost £300m, thanks to new overseas markets. The Manchester-based firm puts its success down to "combining cutting-edge, aspirational design with an affordable price tag". Its booming sales growth has also been reflected in its share price, which has more than trebled in the past year. On its stock market flotation in 2014, it was valued at £560m. It is now worth about £2bn. The firm has gone from strength to strength in recent years, while its High Street rivals have had to deal with increasing competition from Boohoo and other online retailers. Source: BBC News   Company news Arian Silver (LON:AGQ, 0.93p) – Speculative Buy Arian Silver Corporation, a Mexico focused resource exploration company, announced today that it will allow its option with Tierra Nuevo Mining Ltd over the Noche Buena gold and silver tailings project to lapse unexercised. As a result, the Company will now focus on its recently acquired lithium projects in Zacatecas State, Mexico. Metallurgical and mineralogical test works undertaken by Resource Development Inc (RDI) of Denver, Colorado (USA) demonstrated that the tailings were highly refractory and include gangue minerals that would inhibit extraction of gold and silver as well as attract penalties levied by potential purchasers of any concentrate produced. Our view: Whist the metallurgical results are disappointing in terms of recovery potential from the Noche Buena tailings, we note that this is an inherent risk when attempting to reprocess tailings material. As such, Arian can now focus on its recent acquired lithium prospects. We look forward to more positive updates from the first batch of assay results from the lithium projects which are expected imminently with a preliminary technical report to follow soon afterward. We maintain a Speculative Buy rating on the stock. Beaufort Securities acts as corporate broker to Arian Silver plc   AFC Energy (LON:AFC, 11.50p) – Speculative Buy The industrial fuel cell power company, yesterday announced a new phase of the its partnership with Industrie De Nora SpA. AFC Energy and De Nora are now expanding this Joint Development Agreement collaboration into Phase 2, following successful Phase 1 completion. As part of this, the two Groups expect to finalise the design of a commercial fuel cell electrode and stack during the current year for commercial application which is capable of mass automated production with warranted performance metrics. Focus will be on the integration of the best performing electrodes from Phase 1 to derive a frozen baseline technology platform. They expect to commence dialogue on terms for a long-term electrode supply agreement building on De Nora's proven know how in the automation of manufacturing processes. Demonstration of the new upscaled and enhanced fuel cell system is planned at AFC Energy's Stade industrial scale fuel cell plant in Germany in the second half of 2017. The validation will include the metrics associated with power output, longevity, efficiency and availability. Our view: De Nora's track record in industrial electro-chemistry application, capacity for manufacture and the commitment to deliver significantly cuts risks entailed in this ambitious project. Being able to warrant performance of electrodes, in terms of performance parameters and target cost, places AFC Energy, together with its commercial project partners, in a preeminent position to become preferred supplier of fuel cell systems, while also providing targeted industries with the necessary confidence to proceed in adoption of the technology. Within this, AFC expected to offer highest performance in terms of duration of continuous operation, availability based on hydrogen purity standard. Importantly, the partnership with will also allow AFC Energy to set its cost structure (modelled to result in a cost per kWh competitive amongst several of today's conventional and renewable energy generation technologies) by leveraging De Nora's manufacturing, supply chains and procurement strength. Beaufort accordingly repeats its Speculative Buy recommendation, although in consideration of the likely challenges and costs that remain with respect to securing early commercial take-up, the price target for AFC has now been set at 23p/share.   CityFibre Infrastructure (LON:CITY, 55.50p) – Speculative Buy CityFibre Infrastructure (‘CityFibre’), the leading designer, builder, owner, and operator of fibre optic infrastructure in UK towns and cities, yesterday announced results for the year ended 31 December 2016 (‘FY2016’). During the period, revenue advanced by +140% to £15.4m, against the comparative period (FY2015). Together with +2% improvement in gross margin to 88%, the Group recorded adjusted EBITDA of £2.5m compared to loss of £2.9m a year ago. Operating loss was £5.1m (FY2015: £6.2m), due to higher administrative costs of £18.7m (FY2015: £11.7m). Underlying administrative costs (excluding non-recurring costs and other charges) rose by +31% to £11.1m primarily due to increased average headcount. Loss after tax widened to £12.6m (FY2015: loss £6.4m), which includes financing costs of £7.3m (FY2015: £0.3m). Cash and cash equivalents at the period-end was £16.7m. Net debt stood at £43.1m at period end. On the operational front, CityFibre secured total funding package of £180m in January 2016, comprising £80m from the equity placing, alongside £100m in committed debt facilities. As at 31 December 2016, the Group had drawn £59.8m of its £100.0m debt facilities. The Group added £75.5m in new initial contract value, up +255%, reflecting growth from both organic and through acquisition of network asset from KCOM in January 2016 and Redcentric in September 2016. CityFibre’s CEO, Greg Mesch, commented “CityFibre now has significant presence in 42 cities across the UK and the rapid commercialisation of the Group's assets underlines the strong demand for an alternative to BT Openreach at a national level. We continue to see significant levels of demand from both business and public services sectors alongside increasing interest from mobile operators and residential broadband providers. With the regulatory and political landscapes now both favouring alternative fibre investment, CityFibre has never been better placed to capitalise on expanding its existing footprint and a growing number of near term strategic opportunities”. Our view: CityFibre delivered excellent progress during the FY2016. The revenue growth was driven by the ongoing expansion in footprint, incremental revenues from both existing and new cities, and through the acquisition of network asset from the KCOM and Redcentric. Such transformational acquisition, according to the management, has accelerated its original business plan by up to 7 years. These are reflected in more than doubling of new initial contract value to £75.5m (up +255%), addition of 29 new cities and increased service provider partner base to 54. Organic revenue grew was also strong, increased by +63% to £10.4m, which had a greater contribution from the Edinburgh project that has been completed during the year. Looking ahead, the Group said current trading is in line with management's expectations and that it remain confident to offers a powerful platform for large-scale expansion into both FTTT and FTTH over the longer term. Facilitating current work programmes suggests net debt will continue to rise sharply over the next two years, possibly approaching the Group’s current market capitalisation by 2019E, but by this time annual revenues should have spiked up to around £50m, according to Beaufort estimates. Having delivered first positive adjusted EBITDA of £2.5m in FY2016, a figure three times as large might be expected for the FY2017, following which a first modest net profit is being targeted. Recurring, relatively low maintenance business with sticky customers provides excellent forward visibility. Assuming revenues rise to some £90m within 5 years, which should be capable of producing a 60% EBITDA margin, DCF methodology suggests a current value closer to 75p/share. Beaufort retains its Speculative Buy recommendation on CityFibre.

پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Thu 27 April 2017 × Economy Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion First ATR aircraft to land in Mehrabad on Friday News ID: 3962482 - Wed 26 April 2017 - 09:12 Economy TEHRAN, Apr. 26 (MNA) – A director of Iran Air has announced that the first out of four ATR 72-600 airplanes will arrive in Tehran on Friday April 28 after going through flight tests. The official at Iran's national carrier, Iran Air (Homa), made the announcement adding “the three remaining aircraft are scheduled to fly to Tehran individually on next Sunday, Wednesday and Friday, respectively. It is worth noting that all four airplanes purchased from by the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR have successfully passed primary tests and are conducting pilot takeoffs and landings at Toulouse–Blagnac Airport in France. Additionally, logo of Iran Air has been painted in the fuselage of the manufactured jetliners. Previously on April 25, Iran Air CEO Farhad Parvaresh stated that the Iranian airline will receive four ATR aircraft within three weeks given that the deadline for the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer has expired for a week. Parvaresh also noted that, as per the contract with Boeing, the first Boeing 777 Wide-body jet airliner will be delivered to Homa in a year’s time. He also touched upon the latest status of negotiations with the largest German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG explaining “not long ago, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was sealed with Lufthansa on technical and operational training, catering and corporate restructuring as well as business cooperation. The agreement was recently implemented in the commercial sector though talks are still underway on other provisions. “So far, good progress has been made with Lufthansa for issues like repair, maintenance, pilot training and catering which will probably lead to further cooperation between the two sides,” underlined Iran Air CEO Parvaresh. The French-Italian ATR plane manufacturer has signed a deal with Homa to provide it with 20 planes. This is a third plane manufacturer after Airbus and Boeing had successfully signed lucrative deals with Iran. Efforts to sign a deal with Brazilian manufacturer Embraer had been uninspiring and plans were abandoned in favor of Airbus and Boeing.  HA/3962105/3962409 Related News Deal with ATR to provide Iran with 20 planes Iranian airliner buys 60 Boeing airplanes Iran interested in purchase of 100 Sukhoi superjet planes: Russian Min.

By Tracie Mauriello / Post-Gazette Washington Bureau WASHINGTON — One makes bolts. Another makes water purifiers. Several make money from coal. And they all helped President Donald Trump shatter the record for the most money ever raised for a presidential inauguration. Western Pennsylvania companies provided $1.5 million of the $106.7 million raised. Their contributions helped pay for three balls, an appearance by the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes, fireworks and a concert at the Lincoln Memorial with music by Lee Greenwood and Toby Keith. One of the biggest contributions nationally — $1 million — came from Clifford Forrest, owner of Rosebud Mining Co. in Kittaning. Mr. Forrest also gave $100,000 to the Trump campaign, records show. He has been a regular contributor to campaigns for many years. Since 2010, Mr. Forrest gave $482,000 to candidates for federal office on top of $725,000 to candidates for office in Pennsylvania. Most of his contributions went to Republicans. Mr. Forrest did not respond to a request for comment. Many high-dollar contributors received special access to Mr. Trump and his cabinet appointees during inauguration weekend in January, raising questions about whether such treatment of corporations conflicts with the president’s campaign promises. “It’s stunningly hypocritical when you’re telling the public you’re going to ‘drain the swamp’ and that the system is rigged and that special interests have the ear of politicians in Washington and you’re going to be different,” said Alex Howard, spokesman for the Sunlight Foundation, a Washington-based watchdog group that fights for transparency in government. “If you’re going to represent yourself as someone responsible to the people and that you’re a populist fighting for the people who’ve been forgotten, the silent Americans and the people left behind, then how does taking huge amounts of money from corporations connect with that?” Barack Obama forbade corporate giving for his first inauguration. That changed for his second inauguration, whose major contributors included AT&T, Microsoft, Chevron and Boeing. Mr. Obama’s inaugural committee raised $55 million in 2009 and $44 million in 2013. The Trump inaugural committee originally said he hoped to raise $65 to $75 million, and a spokesman recently told the Associated Press that the excess would be given to charity. Because inaugural committees are not required to disclose expenditures it’s unclear how much that is, and critics wonder whether it will be given at all. Their questions stem from the Washington Post’s Pulitzer Prize-winning work revealing that Mr. Trump had not followed through on promises to give millions to veterans groups. “The question is: why create this vector for influence from corporate and wealthy individuals when you don’t need to?” Mr. Howard said. The inaugural committee could have declined contributions once it had enough to pay for the event which, he noted, should have cost less than the Obama inaugurations because it had fewer balls and headliners. The biggest contributor to Mr. Trump’s inauguration was from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who provided $5 million. Other top contributors were Bank of America, Boeing, Pfizer, Qualcomm and Dow Chemical, which each contributed at least $1 million. Mr. Forrester was Western Pennsylvania’s only six-figure contributor. Other contributors from the region who gave at least $5,000 were: Consol Energy of Canonsburg, $150,000. Joseph Reschini of Indiana, president of The Reschini Group, $75,000. Jay W. Cleveland Jr. of Cleveland Brothers Equipment Inc. in Murrysville, $50,000. CSE Corp. of Monroeville, $39,100. Reschini Agency of Indiana, $35,000. Ashok Trivedi of Mastech Digital in Moon, $25,000. Lee Supply co. of Charleroi, $20,000. Frank Calandra Inc. of Pittsburgh, $20,000. J-Lok Corp. of Pittsburgh, $15,000. JENNCHEM of Pittsburgh, $10,000. AB Arrison of Mount Morris, $10,000. Global Mine Service of Belle Vernon, $10,000. Melanie A. Schwartz of McMurray, $5,300. Gary L. Morrell of Ellsworth, owner of Royal Hydraulic Services, $5,000. Royal Hydraulic Services of Cokeburg, $5,000. Lincoln Contracting and Equipment Inc. of Boswell, $5,000. Chemstream Inc. of Stoystown, $5,000. Many of those contributors work for energy companies or suppliers that support the energy industry. And Mr. Trump already has been taking steps that support their interests, including in February when he signed a law repealing a regulation that would have required energy companies to disclose royalty payment that oil, gas, coal and mineral companies pay to foreign governments.

Sergey Dubinsky, 54, a retired Russian colonel, confessed through a friend that he was responsible for moving a Buk surface-to-air missile system into place before it was used to shoot down the Malaysia Airlines plane in 2014. But Serhiy Tiunov, a pro-Ukrainian who took Dubinsky’s confession, says the colonel denies being personally responsible – instead blaming the ‘b******* from Moscow.’ Serhiy Tiunov (right) says his friend Sergey Dubinsky (left), a retired Russian colonel, has admitted to moving a missile launcher into position before it shot down MH17 But Tiunov (pictured) said Dubinsky denied pulling the trigger himself and instead blamed ‘the b******* in Moscow’ for the attack which killed 298 innocent people  Tiunov, a pro-Ukrainian military leader who fought with Dubinsky in Afghanistan, told Novaya Gazeta that he now fears his friend will be killed to keep the identities of those who launched the missile a secret. Everyone on board the plane, 298 passengers and crew, were killed after it was shot out of the sky. It is thought Russian-backed rebels fired at it after mistaking it for a Ukrainian military plane.r Ukrainian secret services confirmed shortly after the incident that they had intercepted audio from Russian military channels of a known Red Army commander ordering a missile system into position before the strike. Dubinsky aka Khmury (Grumpy) had already been unmasked as the man behind that voice, but Wednesday’s comments mark his first significant account of the incident. Tiunov (rear) says he believes Dubinsky (left) knows the identities of those who gave the order, and fears for his friend’s life At the time, he was head of military intelligence for the self-proclaimed and pro-Putin Donestsk People’s Republic. During the conflict in Ukraine, Dubinsky and Tiunov had met several times, and the colonel had freed a number of Ukrainian soldiers captured by the rebels. Tiunov said: ‘I could not stay calm (and I told him) it is you who hit the Boeing passenger plane like gangsters! ‘I saw the expression on his face and felt that he was hurt, and took it very personally. ‘He said: “You think I did it myself?” ‘Then he pointed his finger at the heavens and said: “It was done by b******* from Moscow!’ ‘It was hard for him to talk about it, he had to make excuses. He is a military man after all, not a gangster. ‘It was clear for me, he understood that he was linked to it and that he was partly guilty in the death of civilians. ‘So he quickly ended our conversation.’ The revelation – if true – destroys the Kremlin’s version that the plane was shot down by Ukrainian forces, and suggests a Moscow cover-up to hide the truth. This Russian claim had already been rejected by an international probe into the disaster, but would mark the first denial from a source close to the Kremlin. Tiunov said Dubinsky’s confession came when he confronted his friend over the missile launch, accusing him of being a ‘gangster’ If Tiunov’s comments are accurate, it marks the first time Dubinsky has admitted his role in the MH17 disaster, and the first time a source close to Moscow has admitted Kremlin involvement Pauline Hanson shrugs off criticism of Vladimir Putin over MH17 Tiunov said of Dubinsky: ‘He was neither a b******, nor a rat. I know this. ‘Such people just don’t survive in intelligence. He was fighting in Donbass (eastern Ukraine) as a soldier. ‘Yes, probably, he received a criminal command from his commander. ‘But I am 100 per cent sure – if he had known that it was a passenger plane, and if he had controlled the launch of the missile, he would have never chosen to kill civilians. ‘What’s more, this is what I heard from him in person: “It was done by b******* from Moscow!’ ‘And now he is pictured as the most guilty man. I don’t accept this.’ He stated: ‘He is a key witness, but he is not a murderer. ‘And he is my friend. I want him to stay alive. I believe he did not press the button of that Buk, he only coordinated its movements.’ In total 298 people died in the air disaster in 2014. It is thought Russian-backed militants fired at the aircraft, thinking it was a Ukrainian military plane The secret radio chatter that implicated Dubinsky Independent analysis by Swedish experts confirmed that the high probability that it is Dubinsky’s voice (D) that can be heard in conversations intercepted by the Ukrainian SBU secret service. One conversation with a man nicknamed Buryat (B), went as follows. On 17 July 2014 they discussed where to position the Buk complex that would later be used to shot down MH17. B ~ where shall we load this beauty? D ~ which one? This one? B ~ the one I have brought. I am already in Donetsk (in eastern Ukraine) D ~ this ~ is what I am thinking about, right? The one called M? B ~ yes-yes-yes, Buk, Buk. D ~ and she is up there, on a tractor truck? B ~ yes~ we must unload it somewhere, in order to hide. D ~ is it with a crew? B ~ yes, with a crew. D ~ don’t hide it anywhere. It will soon go there – I will say now where it has to move. It will go together with Vostok tanks.

The move is part of a strategy of cutting the journey time to London to gain an edge and pricing premium over the two dozen rivals offering one-stop flights on the so-called Kangaroo route. Qantas will charge a premium of as much as 48 per cent in economy class and 62 percent in business class relative to one-stop rivals like Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines on the Perth-London route in return for saving three hours of travel time, according to online price comparisons. Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce has said his airline could be operating non-stop flights from Sydney and Melbourne to London within five years as Airbus SE and Boeing Co introduce longer-range aircraft. The 17-hour Perth-London flight on a Boeing 787-9 will originate and end in Melbourne and will not be subject to heightened security checks for Middle Eastern flights as a result. It will cut more than an hour off the flying time from Melbourne to London relative to the current route through Dubai, Qantas said in a statement. Sydney-Dubai-London will be the Australian airline’s only flight operating through the Emirates hub once the change takes place in March. Qantas’s capacity to London will fall as a result of the switch to a 787 from a larger A380.

The robotics team will be making their second appearance at the FIRST Robotics World Championship in St. Louis, Mo. (Submitted photo) Two area robotics teams begin competition Thursday at the world championship in St. Louis, Mo. The Duluth East Daredevils will be making their fifth appearance and Esko's SubZero Robotics will be making their second appearance at the FIRST Robotics World Championship, where they'll compete until Saturday against more than 400 teams from countries that include Israel, Turkey, Russia, Australia and Mexico. With four previous trips to the world championship — coming in second place in 2015 — the Daredevils' goal is to win the world championship this year, coach Tim Velner said, adding that it's a "cool thing" that this year's team has the specific mission of taking home a first-place win. "They've had this self-consciousness that we're just some little team from Duluth ... then two years ago, we won second place at the world championships. So this team is believing that it belongs on this stage and that's so cool. It's one thing to want to get to the world championships, it's another thing to have a team that believes that they can win it," he said. SubZero Robotics' goal this year is to have fun throughout the tournament, coach Justin Scheider said. "That's been our team goal is to just go out there and have fun, whatever happens happens and we're going to do our best," he said. The team's division will be competitive but the kids are excited and they feel good about their robot. He said "it's an incredible accomplishment" that the team is going to the championship for the second time since it started three years ago. The team has two large groups of ninth graders and 11th graders, Scheider said. "The juniors have been here once, most of them, so they got the experience and it really inspired them last year. And our freshmen coming in will get a lot of cool things to see and do and they're excited to have the opportunity to learn from and see some of the best teams in the world." Teams spent Wednesday speaking with representatives at the competition's College Row. In the past, Velner has had Daredevils figure out which colleges they want to visit based on those they spoke to at College Row. He added, "Even if they don't go to any of those schools, they engage in that conversation with some really high-powered schools." Students could also spend Wednesday at the Innovation Fair, where national companies such as Boeing, Lego and Nokia demonstrate their industries and technology. "I have seen kids literally develop dreams of what they want to do because of that, because they're talking to somebody and they go, man, I didn't even know that existed. All of a sudden, they have an idea of where they want to go. This isn't just about the world competition, this is also about them finding what their next steps are, what their dreams for the future may be because it's all here," Velner said. "We're here because people develop their pathways here. It's so cool to watch that happen and it's a big part of being here."

Roselle Chen reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript U.S. stocks ticked lower as investors worried about President Donald Trump's tax cuts. Trump administration proposed to slash business tax rates by the end of this year. But it offered no specifics on how to pay for it without increasing the deficit. The dip in stocks came after two sessions of markets hitting record highs on upbeat corporate earnings. Chris Ailman, chief investment officer at CalSTRS (SOUNDBITE) CHRIS AILMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CALSTRS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "When the U.S. equity market runs like this, we take advantage of it, create some liquidity, and try and buy into some other when they're down a little bit." Among stocks, United Technologies rose after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations. On the flip side, Boeing fell after coming in with a decline in revenue. And also falling, Procter & Gamble, after reporting lower quarterly profit. European stocks got a kick from earnings. The CAC 40 hit a nine-year high building on gains from the recent vote in the presidential election.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20.48 points, or 0.10 percent, to 20975.64. The S&P 500 erased 1.14 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,387.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.27 points, or less than 0.01 percent, to 6,025.23. The tax plan would reduce the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three, and would cut the top individual income tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council (NEC), said at a press briefing at the White House. "We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big," Cohn said, noting President Donald Trump has made tax reform a priority and the Republican-controlled Congress also wants to get it done. At the same time, the plan would cut the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Investors were also accessing a batch of quarterly earnings reports. Dow component Boeing reported its first-quarter earnings before the opening bell. The company's earnings per share increased to 2.34 U.S. dollars while the revenue decreased to 21.0 billion dollars. Shares of Twitter ended the trading day at 15.82 dollars per share, soared 7.91 percent, after it reported better-than-expected earnings after several quarters of disappointing results. Stocks soared in the previous session on upbeat earnings and economic data, with Nasdaq soaring above 6,000, hitting an all-time high.

The major averages pulled back going into the close, ending the session just below the unchanged line. The Dow dipped 21.03 points or 0.1 percent to 20,975.09, the Nasdaq edged down 0.27 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 6,025.23 and the S&P 500 slipped 1.16 points or 0.1 percent to 2,387.45. The lower close on Wall Street came after officials from President Donald Trump's administration unveiled the president's highly anticipated tax reform plan. White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin outlined Trump's plan in a briefing to reporters at the White House. Trump's tax reform plan would reduce the number of income tax brackets from seven to three, with a top rate of 35 percent and lower rates of 25 percent and 10 percent. The president's proposal would also lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from the current 35 percent. Trump's plan would also eliminate the alternative minimum tax as well as the estate tax, which is also known as the "death tax." Among individual stocks, shares of Twitter (TWTR) moved sharply higher after the social media giant reported better than expected first quarter results. Restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also saw notable strength after reporting first quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Boeing (BA) also reported first quarter earnings that exceeded analyst estimates, although the aerospace giant reported revenues that came in below expectations. Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also reported better than expected third quarter earnings on weaker than expected revenues. Shares of U.S. Steel (X) came under pressure after the steel giant reported a wider than expected first quarter loss on weaker than expected revenues. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region extended a recent upward move during trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.5 percent. The major European markets also moved to the upside on the day. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both edged up by 0.2 percent. In the bond market, treasuries ended the session modestly higher after trending lower in recent sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, slipped by 1.6 basis points to 2.311 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers The 10 Biggest Imports in the USA Friendly Skies: Best Airlines for Customer Satisfaction Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Lower On Trump Tax-plan Disappointment Samsung Q1 Profit Climbs, Sees Higher Earnings Ahead; Stock Up Asian Markets Mostly Lower Amid Cautious Trades Gainers & Losers Of Apr.26: AKBA, FLKS, BIOL, BABY, FLXN...

US stocks dip as Trump releases tax overhaul plan Money Wednesday 26 April 2017 - 11:13pm FILE: Procter & Gamble lost 2.5 percent after it revealed declines in sales and profits, saying challenging geopolitical and economic conditions hit consumer demand. Photo: DANIEL ROLAND / AFP NEW YORK - Wall Street stocks finished slightly lower Wednesday following mixed earnings and after the White House unveiled details of its long-awaited tax reform plan. Tax cuts have been Wall Street's top priority since the election of President Donald Trump. But analysts characterised the muted reaction to the announcement as a pullback after a strong rally the last two days. "We got a big run up in the past few days as details of the tax plan had been leaked out and there was a bit of modest selling on the news," said Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 percent to end the session at 20,975.09. The broad-based S&P 500 also slipped 0.1 percent to end at 2,387.45, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index finished at 6,025.23, dipping slightly from Tuesday's record when it closed above 6,000 for the first time. Dow member Boeing dropped 1.0 percent after reporting a 7.3 percent drop in revenues to $21 billion(R278.70 billion), falling short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts. It was only the second time in 21 quarters the company disappointed expectations. Procter & Gamble lost 2.5 percent after it revealed declines in sales and profits, saying challenging geopolitical and economic conditions hit consumer demand. US Steel plunged 26.7 percent after reporting a loss of $180 million in the first quarter and slashing its forecast for full-year earnings to $260 million from the prior $535 million.   Twitter surged 7.9 percent as monthly active users grew nine percent from the same period a year ago to 328 million. Other companies releasing earnings included United Technologies, which gained 1.2 percent, Chipotle Mexican Grill, which gained 2.0 percent, Edwards Lifesciences, which surged 10.5 percent, and Seagate Technology, which slumped 16.8 percent.

CRAVER - kcraver@shawmedia.com12:44 am Caption H. Rick Bamman file photo - hbamman@nwherald.com A Cessna 170 lands at the Lake in the Hills airport. School district 155 is partnering with the airport for a program that puts kids on a path to getting their pilot's license. CRYSTAL LAKE – High School District 155 is partnering with Lake in the Hills Airport to offer interested students an opportunity to earn a private pilot license. A limited number of spots are available for the course, which gives students the opportunity to study for and pass the written test required by the Federal Aviation Administration before flight time with an instructor can start. Both the district and the airport see the partnership as mutually beneficial. The district can give students an opportunity to begin work pursuing jobs in the in-demand field of aviation. “This course will provide a strong foundation of knowledge and increase students’ exposure of aviation,” Superintendent Johnnie Thomas said in a statement. “Students interested in aviation can advance in high school, allowing them to reduce costs in college.” As for the airport, the course can help promote flying to a new generation, manager Mike Peranich said. “One of the challenges the aviation industry as a whole and the airport face is keeping pilots flying – maintaining an influx of new ones,” Peranich said. “The earlier we can reach kids and involve or interest them, the more they know as adults, and they may make the decision earlier to fly.” Besides pilot, the course is aimed for students who are interested in pursuing the careers of flight operations support, dispatcher, engineering and working for the FAA. Chicago-based Boeing, the world’s largest aviation company, last year projected a demand for nearly 1.5 million pilots and technicians for the worldwide commercial aviation industry over the next 20 years. For North America, the estimate predicts a need for 112,000 new pilots, 127,000 new technicians and 151,000 new cabin crew employees. The course will be taught by a commercial pilot and an FAA-certified ground instructor. Classes will be from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Mondays from Aug. 21 to Dec. 18 at Crystal Lake South High School, giving students the necessary knowledge to pass the written knowledge test. The cost of the course is $350. The district is hosting an informational meeting at 7 p.m. Thursday in the library of Crystal Lake South, 1200 McHenry Ave. The FAA requires a minimum of 40 hours of flight time on top of passing the test in order to get a private pilot license.
