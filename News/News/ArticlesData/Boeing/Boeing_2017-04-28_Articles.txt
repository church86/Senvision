Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said the filing against Bombardier was "an initiative we chose to take ourselves."   He declined to say whether Boeing also planned to ask the United States to pursue Canada through the World Trade Organization, as it has against European rival Airbus.   Domestic cases, where companies can petition for duties on specific products, typically take around a year. That is much quicker than a 13-year-old transatlantic battle on jetliner subsidies at the WTO, an international forum open only to nations.   Planemakers "often sell below costs to break into a new market or with a new product, particularly if it involves a significant launch customer," said U.S.-based trade policy expert Joel Johnson. Such tactics cause long-term harm by creating momentum that rivals find hard to reverse, Boeing's petition said, although industry analysts say Boeing and Airbus both regularly offer discounts of 50 percent or more.   Boeing has said it competed for last year's Delta order against the CSeries CS100 with used 717s, which it no longer makes, and used jets from Brazil's Embraer, since Delta was only ready to pay a low price and wanted smaller jets than its more modern 737. But it said Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of its best-selling 737.   Still, its complaint puzzled some analysts and trade lawyers, since Canada is in talks to sign a deal later this year or in early 2018 to acquire 18 Boeing fighter jets. "It's certainly the right political climate for a trade complaint. But I'm not sure this is the best idea," said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia.   Canada has rejected Boeing's accusations and says the CSeries uses many U.S. parts and generates thousands of U.S. jobs. Around half of the 110 to 130 seat CSeries is made in the United States, including the engine, cockpit control panels and avionics.   Trade experts say an investigation could result in Delta and other buyers having to pay extra duties on future deliveries, effectively raising the price but not benefiting Bombardier.

(Remy de la Mauviniere/The Associated Press) The U.S. planemaker wants the Commerce Department to impose duties on the Montreal-based jet builder before deliveries of the Canadian plane to Delta begin next year. Bombardier says the claim “is plain wrong.” Share story By Andrew Mayeda and Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News Boeing accused Bombardier of selling C Series passenger jets in the U.S. at “absurdly low” prices, adding a new salvo to an increasingly tense trade relationship between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. plane maker is asking the International Trade Commission to find that it has suffered injury to its business at the hands of Bombardier and to recommend that the Commerce Department impose duties on the Montreal-based jet builder. “Propelled by massive, supply-creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc. has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its C Series aircraft in the United States,” Boeing said Thursday in its ITC complaint. Bombardier responded Friday that Boeing’s allegations themselves are “absurd.” Most Read Stories 2017 NFL draft: Live Seahawks updates from the second and third rounds Billionaire Paul Allen pledges $30M toward permanent housing for Seattle’s homeless Seahawks trade with Falcons, 49ers to move out of first round of 2017 NFL Draft, now have 10 picks  WATCH Highway 99 tolling: Here's how much you could pay, according to new analysis Starbucks' Dragon Frappuccino is new 'secret' drink crazeUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Boeing’s contention that Delta Air Lines purchased C Series jets for $19.6 million apiece, “is plain wrong,” Bombardier spokesman Bryan Tucker said in an interview. “We can’t disclose the actual price because it’s confidential, but it’s not $19.6  million.” The crossfire opens a new front in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, which have intensified since President Donald Trump took office vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and put “America First.” The U.S. recently imposed duties on Canadian lumber, reigniting a longstanding dispute, and Trump has complained about Canadian protections for dairy farmers. Boeing said Bombardier’s 2016 Delta deal set a “new, low price ceiling,” below the $33.2 million cost of manufacturing the airplanes. The Chicago-based company urged the Trump administration to act before deliveries of the jet begin next year to Delta. The emerging tussle echoes longstanding U.S.-Europe disputes stemming from the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus SE. “Evidently taking a page out of the Airbus strategy book, Bombardier has blatantly and intentionally demonstrated its goal of muscling its way into the U.S. aviation market by offering its heavily subsidized planes at cut-rate pricing,” the U.S. company said. The C Series 100-seater lists for $76.5 million, while a 150-seat variant goes for $85.7 million. Discounts from catalog prices are customary in the industry. “The government of Canada will mount a vigorous defense against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border,” the office of Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Thursday in a statement. More than 50 percent of the jet’s components come from the U.S., his office said. Boeing said Bombardier was able to offer the rock-bottom pricing because of government assistance. The Canadian government earlier this year pledged C$372.5 million ($273 million) to Bombardier to finance two jet programs including the C Series. Quebec’s provincial government invested $1 billion in the jetliner last year. A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman declined to comment on Boeing’s complaint beyond saying that the agency gives all petitions a thorough review.

The petition against Canada's new competitor to the Boeing 737 aircraft came just days after the Commerce Department imposed duties averaging 20 per cent on Canadian softwood lumber, saying that its origin from public land amounted to an unfair government subsidy. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that he intended to begin renegotiating the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, after White House officials said Mr Trump had been considering an order to withdraw from the pact. Boeing said in its petition that Bombardier, determined to win a key order from Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) after losing a competition at United Airlines (UAL.N), had offered its planes to the airline at an "absurdly low" $US19.6 million ($F41m) each, well below what it described as the aircraft's production cost of $US33.2m ($F69m). "Propelled by massive, supply creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its CSeries aircraft in the United States," Boeing said in its petition. Boeing's similarly sized 737-700 model has a list price of $US83.4m ($F175m), with the new 737-MAX 7 priced at $US92.2m ($F193m). Sales discounts from list prices are typically 40 per cent to 50 per cent in the industry. Bombardier won the Delta order, its biggest yet, in April 2016 for 75 CS100 jets, worth an estimated $US5.6 billion ($F11b) based on the list price of about $US71.8m ($F150m).

Bombardier faces lengthy legal battle with Boeing that could hurt CSeries sales by Ross Marowits, The Canadian Press Posted Apr 28, 2017 4:54 pm EDT Last Updated Apr 28, 2017 at 5:40 pm EDT National MONTREAL – Bombardier faces a lengthy legal battle with Boeing after the aerospace giant filed a complaint with the U.S. government and the process could hurt sales of the new CSeries commercial jet, say trade experts and industry analysts. While the outcome of the case is uncertain, they said the Montreal-based company’s efforts to sell the plane into the American market could be hampered by the prospect of preliminary duties resulting from Boeing’s anti-dumping petition. “Purchasers tend to back away from making commitments until they know the outcome of the proceedings, so I would expect that there will be some form of commercial repercussions,” international trade lawyer Lawrence Herman said in an interview from Toronto. Shares of Bombardier fell four per cent to $2.11 in Toronto on Friday following the news. Boeing petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It said more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far have allowed Bombardier to engage in “predatory pricing” for an aircraft that competes directly against its 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 airplanes. Bombardier and the Canadian government have rejected Boeing’s claims. Herman expects the case could drag on for years even though an investigation and imposition of preliminary duties could known in a few months. Boeing faces a challenge proving its complaints because government funding for the CSeries came in the form of equity rather than traditional subsidies, he said, adding that Boeing has received U.S. government support in the form of research and development grants along with military contracts. Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group called Boeing’s legal approach “ill-advised.” He said the CSeries has a small impact on Boeing’s planes, adding that the argument that the plane was sold well below cost was odd since that’s standard industry practice for new planes. “The impact of the CSeries on their product line is incredibly marginal. It’s the Delta deal and not much else,” he said. Aboulafia also said Boeing could risk an order for its Super Hornet jet fighter by taking on a key sector of the Canadian economy. Herman said Boeing’s move could prompt Airbus to take a similar legal action against Bombardier, adding this could stall CSeries sales in Europe. Airbus declined to comment. Brazil has already filed a complaint about the Canadian government’s support for Bombardier with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer. McGill University professor Karl Moore said Boeing is taking advantage of President Donald Trump’s approach to trade to take an opportunistic hit at Bombardier, the world’s third-largest aerospace manufacturer. “It’s just the way the game is played these days,” he said from Abu Dhabi. “You rattle your sabre and try to scare customers a bit.” By filing a complaint in the Washington instead of Geneva, Boeing could take a quicker toll on Bombardier, said University of Ottawa professor Patrick Leblond. “A little like the softwood lumber file, we could see the imposition of countervailing duties on Bombardier products,” he said. Boeing’s legal manoeuvre is the latest challenge to Canadian trade with the United States, coming days after the Trump administration criticized Canada’s dairy sector and imposed duties on softwood lumber. The U.S. government’s protectionist tone could make it tough for other Canadian companies as well, said trade lawyer Alan Wolff. “It’s a pro-enforcement administration. That will mean that there’s a greater likelihood of these types of cases being filed,” he said from Washington, D.C. Join the conversation Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as .

The US aerospace giant asked the Department's International Trade Commission on Thursday to look into Bombardier's "illegal and unfair business practices" and impose anti-dumping duties on the sale of those airplanes. The petition comes after Donald Trump's administration on Monday slapped tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber imports, and after the US president walked back his threat to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement, but said that the trade deal with Canada and Mexico had to be renegotiated. Boeing believes that Canadian government subsidies allow Bombardier to sell its CSeries jets at an unfairly low price, undercutting sales of Boeing's own 737 passenger jets. According to Boeing, Bombardier "has embarked on an aggressive campaign to sell C Series aircraft into the US market at absurdly low prices - less than $20 million for airplanes that cost $33 million to produce, based on publicly available information." The aircraft is sold in the United States "at prices that are millions lower than those charged in Canada - the very definition of dumping". One year ago Bombardier won a US$5.6 billion order for 75 CSeries planes for Delta Air Lines. According to Boeing, Bombardier's C Series planes have "received extensive government support totaling more than $3 billion." Bombardier said in a statement signed by CEO Alain Bellemare that it is "aware of the case ... And we are closely reviewing the filing". The statement added that Bombardier "structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing." The Canadian company said that it has some 7,000 US employees in both rail and aerospace located in 17 states, and spends about $3 billion annually with American suppliers. The Canadian government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that it "objects" to Boeing's allegations, and promised to "mount a vigorous defense against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border." The statement noted that the US and Canadian aerospace industries "are highly integrated ... For example, many C Series suppliers are based in the United States and it is projected that more than 50 percent of the components for the C Series, including the engine, will be supplied by American firms".

The risk of the United States imposing a tariff, which would likely depress sales of Bombardier's newest jet, and concern over how big that tariff might be, unsettled investors, sending the Canadian company's shares down just over 4 percent. Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate what it describes as rock-bottom prices for Bombardier's new CSeries aircraft, including an "absurdly low" sum of $19.6 million it says Delta Air Lines Inc paid for a jet costing $33 million to build. "The allegation is absurd," Bombardier spokesman Bryan Tucker said, in response to numbers contained in a petition sent to the U.S. Commerce Department by Boeing on Thursday. The spat comes days after Washington imposed duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, prompting claims in Canada that Boeing was taking advantage of the Trump administration's tougher stance on trade. Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said the filing against Bombardier was "an initiative we chose to take ourselves". He declined to say whether Boeing also planned to ask the United States to pursue Canada through the World Trade Organization, as it has against European rival Airbus. Domestic cases, where companies can petition for duties on specific products, typically take around a year. That is much quicker than a 13-year-old transatlantic battle on jetliner subsidies at the WTO, an international forum open only to nations. Planemakers "often sell below costs to break into a new market or with a new product, particularly if it involves a significant launch customer," said U.S.-based trade policy expert Joel Johnson. Such tactics cause long-term harm by creating momentum that rivals find hard to reverse, Boeing's petition said, although industry analysts say Boeing and Airbus both regularly offer discounts of 50 percent or more. Boeing has said it competed for last year's Delta order against the CSeries CS100 with used 717s, which it no longer makes, and used jets from Brazil's Embraer, since Delta was only ready to pay a low price and wanted smaller jets than its more modern 737. But it said Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of its best-selling 737. Still, its complaint puzzled some analysts and trade lawyers, since Canada is in talks to sign a deal later this year or in early 2018 to acquire 18 Boeing fighter jets. "It's certainly the right political climate for a trade complaint. But I'm not sure this is the best idea," said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. Canada has rejected Boeing's accusations and says the CSeries uses many U.S. parts and generates thousands of U.S. jobs. Around half of the 110 to 130 seat CSeries is made in the United States, including the engine, cockpit control panels and avionics. Trade experts say an investigation could result in Delta and other buyers having to pay extra duties on future deliveries, effectively raising the price but not benefiting Bombardier. Canadian trade lawyer Mark Warner said Canada could challenge final decisions at the WTO or through NAFTA. Delta did not respond to requests for comment.

The new launch vehicle will be well suited for launches from the Sea Launch, and, of course, it will be competitive with the US-made Falcon rocket,” Solntsev added. Perhaps coincidentally, RSC Energia also stated April 26 that it had reached a financial settlement with Boeing over a long-standing squabble over debt incurred by RSC Energia in the Sea Launch floating rocket launch platform. “The [RSC Energia/Boeing] settlement came into effect on February 22nd, and a joint claim was made by Boeing and RSC Energia on March 16th. The California court made a final decision to end this litigation. The issue is now closed forever,” Solntsev told the RIA Novosti newspaper. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by Boeing. In 2009 Sea Launch Co, the provider of the Sea Launch service, filed for bankruptcy, and in 2013 Boeing filed a lawsuit claiming that RSC Energia and two other contractors (PO Yuzhnoye and KB Yuzhnoye) failed to reimburse Boeing for over $350 million paid to third-party creditors. On May 12th 2016, the US District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favour of Boeing, stating that Energia owed Boeing more than $320 million plus legal fees. Solntsev said both parties had to overcome numerous hurdles during the settlement negotiations but finally managed to reach a mutual compromise, and that the deal between Energia and Boeing will now allow the companies to engage in a number of joint ventures. “The details of these negotiations remain a commercial secret; what matters is that the partners were able to break the deadlock.

Next, jets? Boeing has asked U.S. trade officials to slap tariffs on a Canadian rival it says is gets unfair government support, the latest sign of growing tensions between the two major trading partners. Boeing is complaining about Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier, which until recently sold mostly business aircraft and small regional jets. But now it is getting into the market for larger aircraft that compete directly with Boeing's 737, its most popular aircraft. The request by Boeing comes in the same week that the Trump administration imposed duties on Canadian lumber, charging that those companies also receive unfair government subsidies. Canada has vowed to fight any trade actions by the United States. Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, filed petitions Thursday with the U.S. Commmerce Department and the International Trade Commission, a federal agency, asking that they take action "to end Bombardier's illegal and unfair business practices before it is too late to prevent significant harm to America's aerospace industry and thousands of good-paying aerospace jobs." Boeing is already cutting jobs. It trimmed employment in its commercial aircraft unit by 8% last year, and announcing buyouts and plans for more layoffs this year was well. But most of the cutbacks in production so far have been to the lines that build the older widebody jets, not the single-aisle 737, which is about to debut a new version, the 737 MAX, which already has 3,700 orders. Boeing charges that Bombardier is charging "absurdly low prices" for its new C Series jet, billing less than $20 million for airplanes that cost $33 million to produce. "Notably, it is selling the aircraft into the United States at prices that are millions lower than those charged in Canada -- the very definition of dumping," said Boeing. Bombadier only started delivery of the C Series jet last year, but already had orders for 360 of the jets through the end of 2016, including 75 from U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines. It issued a statement saying that it complies with the laws that Boeing cites and points out that any action against it would hurt its U.S. supplier base. "Bombardier is deeply invested in the U.S. economy, with about 7,000 employees in dozens of facilities in both rail and aerospace across 17 states," it said. Bombardier said it spends about $3 billion annually with U.S. suppliers across 48 states, generating U.S. jobs. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

"Bombardier structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing,'' the Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer said in an emailed statement. The world's third-largest airplane maker said it spends about US$3 billion annually with U.S. suppliers and employs about 7,000 people in dozens of facilities in both rail and aerospace across 17 states. An illustration of the Bombardier CS300 jet. Boeing says Bombardier has been dumping its planes in the U.S. below cost. The Seattle-based competitor said Thursday that it petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It is also seeking an order to be issued against the sale of the plane in the important American market. Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains said the government objects to the allegations and vowed to mount "a vigorous defence.'' "We are confident that our programs are consistent with Canada's international obligations,'' he said in a statement. Boeing said it asking the Trump administration to act "to end Bombardier's illegal and unfair business practices before it is too late to prevent significant harm to America's aerospace industry and thousands of good-paying aerospace jobs.'' The aerospace giant said the threat against its suppliers will only grow as Bombardier increases the annual production rate of the CSeries to between 90 and 120 airplanes by 2020. Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains says he will vigorously defend Bombardier against accusations of dumping in the U.S. (Photo: The Canadian Press/Sean Kilpatrick) It said more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far have allowed Bombardier to engage in "predatory pricing'' for an aircraft that competes directly against its 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 airplanes. Boeing claimed Bombardier has sold CSeries planes that cost US$33 million to produce for less than US$20 million each and at prices below what it charged in Canada. "It's selling the aircraft in the U.S. at prices that are millions lower than those that they're charging in Canada, which is the very definition of dumping,'' Boeing spokesman Daniel Curran said in an interview. Boeing joins Brazil, which filed a similar complaint with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer. Delta Air Lines will become the first U.S. CSeries carrier after placing a firm order a year ago for 75 CS100 aircraft valued at US$5.6 billion. It also has options for 50 more planes and can covert some of the aircraft to larger CS300s. Air Canada followed by ordering 45 CS300s for US$3.8 billion at list prices, plus options for 30 more planes. Airlines typically pay much less than list prices and early buyers of new planes usually get low prices. The latest challenge against Bombardier's largest aircraft came just days after the U.S. imposed preliminary duties of up to 24 per cent on softwood lumber imported from Canada. — With files from Peter Cameron in Toronto.

The US aerospace giant asked the Department's International Trade Commission on Thursday to look into Bombardier's "illegal and unfair business practices" and impose anti-dumping duties on the sale of those airplanes. The petition comes after Donald Trump's administration on Monday slapped tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber imports, and after the US president walked back his threat to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement, but said that the trade deal with Canada and Mexico had to be renegotiated. Boeing believes that Canadian government subsidies allow Bombardier to sell its CSeries jets at an unfairly low price, undercutting sales of Boeing's own 737 passenger jets. According to Boeing, Bombardier "has embarked on an aggressive campaign to sell C Series aircraft into the US market at absurdly low prices - less than $20 million for airplanes that cost $33 million to produce, based on publicly available information." The aircraft is sold in the United States "at prices that are millions lower than those charged in Canada - the very definition of dumping". One year ago Bombardier won a US$5.6 billion order for 75 CSeries planes for Delta Air Lines. According to Boeing, Bombardier's C Series planes have "received extensive government support totaling more than $3 billion." Bombardier said in a statement signed by CEO Alain Bellemare that it is "aware of the case ... and we are closely reviewing the filing". The statement added that Bombardier "structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing." The Canadian company said that it has some 7,000 US employees in both rail and aerospace located in 17 states, and spends about $3 billion annually with American suppliers. The Canadian government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that it "objects" to Boeing's allegations, and promised to "mount a vigorous defense against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border." The statement noted that the US and Canadian aerospace industries "are highly integrated ... For example, many C Series suppliers are based in the United States and it is projected that more than 50 percent of the components for the C Series, including the engine, will be supplied by American firms".

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon 28 Apr 2017 07:12PM Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail ANKARA: IranAir has abandoned plans to take early delivery of a Boeing 777-300ER jetliner because the passenger plane is no longer available, the head of the Islamic Republic's national flag carrier was quoted as saying by Iranian media. Iran had been expected to receive the first of 80 aircraft ordered from the U.S. planemaker in April or May 2018, but Iranian media and industry sources said this month it might get the first Boeing jet a year earlier than expected under a proposal to swap deliveries with Turkish Airlines . "Boeing had proposed to hand over a 777-300ER by summer after Turkish Airlines withdrew its order for it. We welcomed it ... However, when we were almost certain that we wanted the plane, it was no longer available," Chairman Farhad Parvaresh was quoted by Iran's English language Press TV as saying. Industry sources had said Boeing was in negotiations to release at least one 777-300ER originally built for Turkish Airlines, which is deferring deliveries due to weaker traffic following last year's failed coup attempt in Turkey. "We have currently stopped our negotiations in absence of the plane," Parvaresh was quoted as saying. Advertisement Boeing said it does not comment on specific deliveries. "Boeing and Iran Air continue to work on implementing the sales contract for commercial passenger airplanes signed in December 2016, at which time we announced first deliveries are scheduled to start in 2018," a spokesman said. "We continue to follow the lead of the U.S. government on all our dealings with approved Iranian airlines." Since last year, when most sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers, Tehran has joined a long waiting list for new airplanes and the swap would have allowed it to speed up its fleet renewal. IranAir has also ordered 100 aircraft from Europe's Airbus under a deal to lift most sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program, and has taken three deliveries. Iran's return to the aviation market after decades of sanctions is a boon to planemakers trying to dispose of some new planes discarded by airlines facing economic difficulties. But Western banks continue to shy away from financing deals between IranAir and Western companies, fearing U.S. banking sanctions that remain in force or a new chill in relations between Tehran and the West under U.S. President Donald Trump.

April 29, 2017 0701 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:191667 Publish Date: Fri, 28 Apr 2017 13:21:32 GMT Service: Iran Boeing seeks US anti-dumping probe against Bombardier jet Boeing Co. asked the US Commerce Department to investigate alleged subsidies and unfair pricing for Canadian planemaker Bombardier's new CSeries airplane, adding to growing trade tensions between the United States and Canada. The petition against Canada's new competitor to the Boeing 737 aircraft came just days after the Commerce Department imposed duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, saying that the product's origin from public land amounted to an unfair government subsidy, reported Reuters. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that he intended to begin renegotiating the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, after White House officials said Trump had been considering an order to withdraw from the pact. Boeing said in its petition that Bombardier, determined to win a key order from Delta Air Lines Inc. after losing a competition at United Airlines, had offered its planes to the airline at an 'absurdly low' $19.6 million each, well below what it described as the aircraft’s production cost of $33.2 million. "Propelled by massive, supply creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc. has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its CSeries aircraft in the United States," Boeing said in its petition. Boeing's similarly sized 737-700 model has a list price of $83.4 million, with the new 737-MAX 7 priced at $92.2 million. Sales discounts from list prices are typically 40 percent to 50 percent in the industry. In April 2016, Bombardier won the Delta order, its biggest yet, for 75 CS100 jets, worth an estimated $5.6 billion based on the list price of about $71.8 million. In its complaint against Bombardier, Boeing argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. Quebec Economy Minister Dominique Anglade said in a statement that her government would defend "the commercial partnership concluded with Bombardier" for a $1 billion injection in the CSeries. Boeing also took a shot at European rival Airbus SE, which it accuses of benefiting from similar 'unfair' government subsidies in a long-running dispute before the World Trade Organization. Bombardier is 'taking a page out of the Airbus strategy book' by trying to muscle into the US market with cut-rate pricing, Boeing charged. A Commerce Department spokesman said the petition would be given 'a thorough review' and further comment was premature. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has taken action in recent weeks to protect the US steel and aluminum industries from foreign competition, launching national security investigations that could lead to import restrictions. An investigation could lead to duties on the Bombardier aircraft to offset any below-cost pricing or any subsidies deemed unfair.     KeyWords Boeing against anti-dumping   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran rightful to respond to Mirjaveh terrorist attack Israel’s Syria raids meant to buttress terror: Iran Iran reserves right to respond to terrorist crime against border guards: Dehqan Iran holds first live debate for presidential election Iran, Russia condemn Israeli attack on Syria Putin’s envoy meets Leader’s representative in Tehran Finland to sign air transport deal with Iran Iran summons Pakistan envoy over killing of border guards Pakistan accountable for deaths of Iranian border guards: Ministry Former UK foreign secretary calls on global banks to cooperate with Iran Most Visited Trump has 'dangerous mental illness,’ some experts say US ground forces in Syria kill 'close associate' of Daesh leader US military spending millions to renovate Mideast base www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0946 sec

GRANITE FALLS — Cassie Collinge, 18, is a senior at Granite Falls High School. She plans to study aerospace engineering at the University of Washington and become an engineer or join the U.S. Air Force. She’s an athlete and volunteered with the annual food drive. Q: What are your favorite subjects, and what do you hope to pursue? A: My favorite subjects are science and math. That’s what I really excel in. I’ve taken five math classes out of four years, and six science classes. I’m going to UW this coming fall to major in aerospace engineering. Engineering runs in my family. I’ve grown up around airplanes because my dad was in the Air Force and Boeing. We went to air shows, we went to Joint Base Lewis-McChord and I saw all those airplanes. It intrigued me so much. Q: How early did you know you liked math and science? A: Always. I just knew that I could grasp it easily. Eighth grade year, when we were signing up for our freshman classes, I laid out my entire schedule so I could pack all four years. I knew I could waive one of my PE credits so I could double up on science and take all of the science classes that were offered. I was already ahead in math because I was taking a freshman class my eighth grade year. Q: What are your other interests? A: Outside of school, I’m really into sports. I’ve always played sports growing up. In high school, I’ve been captain for the varsity soccer and varsity track teams. Last year, we were 2A state champions for our four-by-two relay team. I like to hike. I really like to do yoga. Life goes by so fast. It feels like I was a freshman last year, or yesterday even. Sometimes, I just need time to reflect on everything. We can really get caught up in the motions and we don’t realize how fast our life is going. So I like to do yoga, and I really like to go to church (Holy Cross Catholic Church). Q: Do you have a vision of where you want to be after college? A: I really do want to travel. I was planning to be a part of the ROTC program. They have a program at the UW called the ALVA program, so I could get an internship with Boeing or another company during the summer, and then after I graduate I’m considering either working for Boeing or going into the Air Force. Q: What’s your family like? A: We like to travel a lot. I caught the travel bug at an early age. I love my family so much. We’re just a very open family and I know that I can tell them everything. They’ve been so supportive with me all through school. Growing up, I thought everyone went to college, so my goal was to get into a good one. It was nice having an older brother because we’re really competitive with each other. He set the bar high. He went to UW and did so well and now he has a job at Boeing. So that’s pushing me to do better. I need to one-up my brother a little bit. My family is amazing. Q: What are the most important lessons you’ll take from Granite Falls High School? A: This is a really giving community. I was part of the food drive. I learned so many lessons from that. I remember my first delivery. We were delivering four huge boxes of food and presents to a single mother. I remember carrying the boxes into the kitchen and she was so overwhelmed with happiness she started crying. She said she could finally feed her kids and not have to worry about anything, and it was life-changing. That’s one of the many things that Granite has taught me. It also taught me to love nature. We’re surrounded. That’s how I found one of my greatest interests was hiking. I learned a lot about myself while hiking, and a lot about my friends. Q: Do you have other volunteer work? A: I was involved with Link Crew. It’s the freshman orientation, so a bunch of upperclassmen welcome them and we have games and stuff. We show them that high school isn’t scary and you’re not going to get shoved into a locker. Q: What’s your advice to new students? A: Be open-minded. There are so many opportunities waiting for you, but they won’t just be handed to you. You have to go out and find them. Kari Bray: 425-339-3439; kbray@heraldnet.com.

Since the Army has said they want to fly those platforms for many years, prime contractors like Boeing and Sikorsky are working to improve those aircraft to keep them relevant.  An example is the CH-47F. The current production model is the Block I, and earlier this month, the Block II hit milestone B, allowing it to proceed into the development phase.  +1  Using new composite blades that provide an additional 1,500 pounds of lift, a Chinook completes several rotor blade tests in Mesa, Ariz. (Boeing photo) "The current aircraft has a capability of carrying up to 50,000 pounds [and] the additional structure allows the aircraft to carry up to 54,000 pounds," said Randy Rotte, Boeing's ‎Director of Business Development for Cargo Helicopter Programs. The Block II will also include improved rotor blades and could be equipped with a future new engine in development.  When it comes to the AH-64 Apache, Boeing is currently working to produce "E model Apaches, known as the Apache Guardian. In fact, the company recently signed a $3.4 billion dollar deal to modify 244 "D" models to the "E" standard. While the modification isn't a radical change, it includes improvements that are expected to help the aircraft's performance. "We've added a composite main rotor blade, which is able to increase speed, and decrease vibrations, which will reduce maintenance workload," said Mark Ballew, Boeing's Director of Global Sales & Marketing Attack Helicopter Programs in an interview at the Army Aviation Association of America's annual summit in Nashville.  Finally, Sikorsky, manufacturer of the UH-60 Blackhawk, is working to make the aircraft "optionally manned." That would allow for some missions to be flown by pilots and others to be flown remotely, which could save lives, according to the company's president of defense systems, Sam Mehta.  "We should be able to turn from moving cargo on the ground, to moving cargo through the air in a safe, cost-effective way that will help save lives over the short and long term," he said in an interview.  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily!

"The Government of Canada will mount a vigoro us defense against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border," it said in the statement.

(Xinhua/Zhao Yun) Spring may be the planting season for farmers, but this year it is the season that the world's major aircraft makers harvest what they have sown. In March and April, Airbus, Boeing and Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) have all announced milestones that their aircraft have passed on the way to production. On Sunday, COMAC put its C919 through a trial run on the tarmac, testing the aircraft's capabilities to take off. The test took the jet down the runway to the point where its nose landing gear came off the ground - a crucial test to pass before an aircraft can take its maiden flight. So far, C919 has received 570 orders from 23 customers. Domestic media has covered every step of the C919's progress toward that flight, which has been twice delayed due to production issues. Still, the most recent reports have stated that the single-aisle passenger jet could undertake its inaugural flight at the beginning of May. The maiden flight marks the beginning of a comprehensive sequence of test flights and diagnostics that an aircraft needs to get certified. The C919's recent test followed news that Boeing's 737 MAX 9 had completed its maiden flight earlier in April. The 737 MAX 9 is the second member of Boeing's 737 MAX family. The narrow-body passenger jet can carry up to 220 passengers and can fly as far as 3,515 nautical miles. A few weeks earlier at the end of March, the Airbus A319neo completed its maiden flight. The aircraft, the smallest member of Airbus' A320neo family, took off from Hamburg, Germany, and landed in Toulouse, France, after a five-hour flight. The history of the 737 MAX and A320neo families serves as something of a road map for how to advance aircraft development. About a decade ago, the two aerospace giants both found themselves in need of revamping their aging but popular single-aisle aircraft: the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320. In 2010, Airbus launched the A320neo with a new engine. Airlines applauded the new design, which received a multitude of orders. Under pressure from Airbus' new aircraft, Boeing responded the following year with its 737 MAX program. Boeing promoted the new design as being more fuel efficient than the A320neo. Airbus has received more than 5,000 A320neo orders from more than 90 customers. The first 737 MAX 8 came off the production line at the end of 2015. In March, U.S.-based Boeing announced that U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had certified the 737 MAX 8 for commercial use. The company is now in the final stage of preparing for the first 737 MAX 8 deliveries in the second quarter of this year, several months ahead of schedule. Although the first 737 MAX came out a year later than the first A320neo, the Boeing jet was still a hit with customers. Boeing has received more than 3,700 orders from 86 customers worldwide for the aircraft, making it the fastest-selling plane in Boeing's history. Boeing also said it will have more Boeing 737 MAX aircraft coming out of its factory in Zhoushan, East China's Zhejiang Province. Despite Boeing's success with the 737 MAX, Airbus has managed to take a big share of the market for single-aisle passenger jets with its A320neo family.

The petition against Canada’s new competitor to the Boeing 737 aircraft came just days after the Commerce Department imposed duties averaging 20 per cent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, saying that the product’s origin from public land amounted to an unfair government subsidy. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that he intended to begin renegotiating the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, after White House officials said Trump had been considering an order to withdraw from the pact. Boeing said in its petition that Bombardier, determined to win a key order from Delta Air Lines Inc after losing a competition at United Airlines, had offered its planes to the airline at an “absurdly low” $19.6 million each, well below what it described as the aircraft’s production cost of $33.2 million. “Propelled by massive, supply creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its CSeries aircraft in the United States,” Boeing said in its petition. Boeing’s similarly sized 737-700 model has a list price of $83.4 million, with the new 737-MAX 7 priced at $92.2 million. Sales discounts from list prices are typically 40 per cent to 50 per cent in the industry. In April 2016, Bombardier won the Delta order, its biggest yet, for 75 CS100 jets, worth an estimated $5.6 billion based on the list price of about $71.8 million. In its complaint against Bombardier, Boeing argued that the CSeries programme would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. Quebec Economy Minister Dominique Anglade said in a statement that her government would defend “the commercial partnership concluded with Bombardier” for a $1 billion injection in the CSeries. Boeing also took a shot at European rival Airbus SE, which it accuses of benefiting from similar “unfair” government subsidies in a long-running dispute before the World Trade Organization. Bombardier is “taking a page out of the Airbus strategy book” by trying to muscle into the US market with cut-rate pricing, Boeing charged. A Commerce Department spokesman said the petition would be given “a thorough review” and further comment was premature. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has taken action in recent weeks to protect the US steel and aluminium industries from foreign competition, launching national security investigations that could lead to import restrictions. An investigation could lead to duties on the Bombardier aircraft to offset any below-cost pricing or any subsidies deemed unfair. In a statement, Canada’s government objected to Boeing’s allegations and noted that the CSeries has many US suppliers, including for engines, and supports thousands of US jobs. “The Government of Canada will mount a vigorous defence against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border,” it said in the statement.— Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Royal Bank of Scotland rebounds into slender Q1 profit Oil rebounds from one-month low on hopes for output cut extension → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent A space multiplier 2 killed, 40 injured in bus-truck collision Israel planning 15,000 more settlement homes Turkey eyes new ties with US under Trump Read More ...

The White House webpage that lists Trump’s accomplishments in his first 100 days in office notes that Trump “was able to cap the cost at millions below that which was agreed to by the Obama administration” for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization. That claim is disputable, however, as the military has not yet finalized how much the replacement will cost. It is also different from Trump's initial claims that he saved $1 billion through discussions with prime contractor Boeing. ADVERTISEMENT “We've got that price down by over $1 billion and I probably haven't spoken for more than an hour on the project,” Trump said in February. “I told Boeing that isn't good enough, the price is still too high.” There are no documents or evidence to support such claims, however. Trump wrote on Twitter in December that the Air Force One replacement costs are “out of control” and threatened to cancel the program. He also claimed the two new presidential transport aircraft will cost $4 billion, but the Air Force has not released their total estimated acquisition cost. A Government Accountability Office report from last March put the cost at about $3.2 billion. Officials have said the high cost comes from needing to meet security requirements, such as secure communications and antimissile defenses. Trump has since met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg, who promised that the company will deliver “a better airplane at a lower cost.” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in January ordered a review of the program to identify specific areas where costs can be lowered, such as in autonomous operations, aircraft power generation, cooling systems and communications capabilities, according to a Pentagon memo.   Tags Boeing Donald Trump Air Force One   View the discussion thread.

Boeing’s contention that Delta Air Lines Inc. purchased jets for $19.6 million apiece, “is plain wrong,” Bombardier spokesman Bryan Tucker said in an interview Friday. “We can’t disclose the actual price because it’s confidential, but it’s not $19.6 million. The allegations are absurd.” His comments boosted the heat in the latest front of an expanding U.S.-Canada trade fracas. Tensions between the neighbors have intensified since President Donald Trump took office vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and put “America First.” Washington recently imposed duties on Canadian lumber, reigniting a longstanding dispute, and Trump has complained about Ottawa’s protections for dairy farmers. Chicago-based Boeing on Thursday lodged a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, saying Bombardier set a “new, low price ceiling” by selling Delta C Series jets for less than each plane’s $33.2 million manufacturing cost. Boeing wants the commission to recommend that the Commerce Department impose duties on the Canadian jet builder.  The C Series comes in two configurations. A 100-seater lists for $79.5 million while a 150-seat variant goes for $89.5 million. Discounts from catalog prices are customary in the industry. Bombardier’s commercial arrangements are in “compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate,” the Montreal-based company said in a  statement. Contract Provision The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Bombardier’s 2016 results included an “onerous contract provision” of $492 million stemming from 127 C Series purchase agreements -- including the planes sold to Delta. Bombardier’s chief financial officer said the provision was linked to “negative anticipated margins” that Bombardier was obligated to book under international accounting rules. Fred Cromer, who runs the commercial aircraft unit, told Bloomberg News a year ago that the company had used “aggressive” pricing to win the Delta deal, without providing specifics.  In December, Bombardier Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare said the company wanted to move away from discounting. Boeing said Bombardier was able to offer the rock-bottom pricing because of government assistance. The Canadian government earlier this year pledged C$372.5 million ($273 million) to Bombardier to finance two jet programs including the C Series. Quebec’s provincial government invested $1 billion in the jetliner last year. A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman declined to comment on Boeing’s complaint beyond saying that the agency gives all petitions a thorough review. Bombardier’s widely traded Class B stock tumbled 5.4 percent to C$2.11 at the close in Toronto, the biggest decline in two weeks. Boeing rose less than 1 percent to $184.83.

"Bombardier structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing," the Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer said. The world's third-largest airplane maker said it spends about $3 billion US annually with U.S. suppliers and employs about 7,000 people in dozens of facilities in both rail and aerospace across 17 states. The Seattle-based competitor said Thursday that it petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It is also seeking an order to be issued against the sale of the plane in the important U.S. market. Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains said the government objects to the allegations and vowed to mount "a vigorous defence." "We are confident that our programs are consistent with Canada's international obligations," he said. Boeing said it is asking the Trump administration to act "to end Bombardier's illegal and unfair business practices before it is too late to prevent significant harm to the U.S.'s aerospace industry and thousands of good-paying aerospace jobs." The aerospace giant said the threat against its suppliers will only grow as Bombardier increases the annual production rate of the CSeries to between 90 and 120 airplanes by 2020. It said more than $3 billion US in government subsidies so far have allowed Bombardier to engage in "predatory pricing" for an aircraft that competes directly against its 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 airplanes. Boeing claimed Bombardier has sold CSeries planes that cost $33 million US to produce for less than $20 million US each and at prices below what it charged in Canada. "It's selling the aircraft in the U.S. at prices that are millions lower than those that they're charging in Canada, which is the very definition of dumping," Boeing spokesperson Daniel Curran said. Boeing joins Brazil, which filed a similar complaint with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer. Delta Air Lines will become the first U.S. CSeries carrier after placing a firm order a year ago for 75 CS100 aircraft valued at $5.6 billion US. It also has options for 50 more planes and can covert some of the aircraft to larger CS300s. Air Canada followed by ordering 45 CS300s for $3.8 billion US at list prices, plus options for 30 more planes. Airlines typically pay much less than list prices and early buyers of new planes usually get low prices. The latest challenge against Bombardier's largest aircraft came just days after the U.S. imposed preliminary duties of up to 24 per cent on softwood lumber imported from Canada.

Bombardier's CSeries jets come in two configurations. A 100-seater lists for $76.5 million while a 150-seat variant goes for $85.7 million. Discounts from catalog prices are customary in the industry.  (Francois Mori / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS FILE PHOTO)   By Andrew Mayeda Julie JohnssonBloomberg Fri., April 28, 2017 Boeing Co. accused Bombardier Inc. of selling CSeries passenger jets in the U.S. at “absurdly low” prices, adding a new salvo to an increasingly tense trade relationship between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. planemaker is asking the International Trade Commission to find that it has suffered injury to its business at the hands of Bombardier and to recommend that the Commerce Department impose duties on the Montreal-based jet builder. Bombardier fell in Toronto trading. “Propelled by massive, supply-creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc. has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its CSeries aircraft in the United States,” Boeing said Thursday in its ITC complaint. The allegations open a new front in trade tensions between the U.S. and Canada, which have intensified since President Donald Trump took office vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and put “America First.” The U.S. recently imposed duties on Canadian lumber, reigniting a longstanding dispute, and Trump has complained about Canadian protections for dairy farmers. Article Continued Below Bombardier said it was “closely reviewing” the filing. In a statement, the company said it “structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate.” Boeing said a 2016 sale of Bombardier jets to Delta Air Lines Inc. set a “new, low price ceiling” that’s depressing its U.S. jetliner prices. The Atlanta-based carrier agreed to purchase the cutting-edge Bombardier jets for $19.6 million (U.S.) apiece, less than the $33.2 million cost of manufacturing the airplanes, Boeing said. The Chicago-based company urged the Trump administration to act before deliveries of the Canadian jet begin next year to Delta. JetBlue Airways Corp. is among the potential U.S. customers of the jet, Boeing said. The emerging tussle echoes longstanding U.S.-Europe disputes stemming from the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus SE. “Evidently taking a page out of the Airbus strategy book, Bombardier has blatantly and intentionally demonstrated its goal of muscling its way into the U.S. aviation market by offering its heavily subsidized planes at cut-rate pricing,” the U.S. company said. The CSeries jets come in two configurations. A 100-seater lists for $76.5 million while a 150-seat variant goes for $85.7 million. Discounts from catalog prices are customary in the industry. “The government of Canada will mount a vigorous defence against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border,” the office of Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said Thursday in a statement. The ministry also said the North American aerospace industry is highly integrated, with companies on both sides of the border benefiting from the CSeries program. More than 50 per cent of the jet’s components come from the U.S., Bains’s office said. The Commerce Department gives all petitions a thorough review and will do so in this case, said spokesman James Rockas. Further comment would be premature, he said. The Canadian government earlier this year pledged $372.5 million to Bombardier to finance two jet programs including the CSeries. Last year, Quebec’s provincial government invested $1 billion in the jetliner. “Our government will continue to defend with firmness and strength all of Quebec’s aerospace industry, including the commercial partnership we concluded with Bombardier,” Quebec Economy Minister Dominique Anglade said in a statement. “The U.S. and Quebec share a trade relationship that benefits workers on both sides of the border.” Brazil, home to Embraer SA, has also complained about government aid to Bombardier. In February, the Brazilian government formally sought “consultations” with Canada in front of the World Trade Organization with the blessing of Embraer, part of a simmering battle that predated the Ottawa government’s aid package to Bombardier.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon PARIS/NEW YORK — Boeing Co on Thursday asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged subsidies and unfair pricing for Canadian planemaker Bombardier’s new CSeries airplane, against the backdrop of rising trade tensions between the United States and Canada. The petition against Canada’s new competitor to the Boeing 737 aircraft came just days after the Commerce Department imposed duties averaging 20 percent on Canadian softwood lumber, saying that its origin from public land amounted to an unfair government subsidy. On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that he intended to begin renegotiating the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, after White House officials said Trump had been considering an order to withdraw from the pact. Boeing said in its petition that Bombardier, determined to win a key order from Delta Air Lines Inc after losing a competition at United Airlines, had offered its planes to the airline at an “absurdly low” $19.6 million each, well below what it described as the aircraft’s production cost of $33.2 million. “Propelled by massive, supply creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its CSeries aircraft in the United States,” Boeing said in its petition. Boeing’s similarly sized 737-700 model has a list price of $83.4 million, with the new 737-MAX 7 priced at $92.2 million. Sales discounts from list prices are typically 40 percent to 50 percent in the industry. Bombardier won the Delta order, its biggest yet, in April 2016 for 75 CS100 jets, worth an estimated $5.6 billion based on the list price of about $71.8 million. Bombardier’s chief executive conceded the company had been “aggressive” on pricing in order to win, and sources familiar with the deal pegged the discount closer to two-thirds off the nominal list price. Bombardier said in a statement that it was reviewing the petition. “Bombardier structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing,” the company said. The request for anti-dumping measures was also addressed to the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent U.S. trade body that will review any decisions by the Commerce Department. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

REUTERS/Matt Mills McKnight 28 Apr 2017 05:25PM (Updated: 28 Apr 2017 06:22PM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail WASHINGTON/NEW YORK: Boeing Co on Thursday asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged subsidies and unfair pricing for Canadian planemaker Bombardier's new CSeries airplane, adding to growing trade tensions between the United States and Canada. The petition against Canada's new competitor to the Boeing 737 aircraft came just days after the Commerce Department imposed duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, saying that the product's origin from public land amounted to an unfair government subsidy. On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that he intended to begin renegotiating the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, after White House officials said Trump had been considering an order to withdraw from the pact. Boeing said in its petition that Bombardier, determined to win a key order from Delta Air Lines Inc after losing a competition at United Airlines, had offered its planes to the airline at an "absurdly low" US$19.6 million each, well below what it described as the aircraft’s production cost of US$33.2 million. "Propelled by massive, supply creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its CSeries aircraft in the United States," Boeing said in its petition. Advertisement Boeing's similarly sized 737-700 model has a list price of US$83.4 million, with the new 737-MAX 7 priced at US$92.2 million. Sales discounts from list prices are typically 40 percent to 50 percent in the industry. In April 2016, Bombardier won the Delta order, its biggest yet, for 75 CS100 jets, worth an estimated US$5.6 billion based on the list price of about US$71.8 million. In its complaint against Bombardier, Boeing argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a US$2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. Quebec Economy Minister Dominique Anglade said in a statement that her government would defend "the commercial partnership concluded with Bombardier" for a US$1 billion injection in the CSeries. Boeing also took a shot at European rival Airbus SE, which it accuses of benefiting from similar "unfair" government subsidies in a long-running dispute before the World Trade Organization. Bombardier is “taking a page out of the Airbus strategy book” by trying to muscle into the U.S. market with cut-rate pricing, Boeing charged. A Commerce Department spokesman said the petition would be given "a thorough review" and further comment was premature. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has taken action in recent weeks to protect the U.S. steel and aluminum industries from foreign competition, launching national security investigations that could lead to import restrictions. An investigation could lead to duties on the Bombardier aircraft to offset any below-cost pricing or any subsidies deemed unfair. In a statement, Canada's government objected to Boeing's allegations and noted that the CSeries has many U.S. suppliers, including for engines, and supports thousands of U.S. jobs. "The Government of Canada will mount a vigorous defense against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border," it said in the statement. Bombardier’s chief executive conceded the company had been “aggressive” on pricing in order to win, and sources familiar with the deal pegged the discount closer to two-thirds off the nominal list price. Bombardier said in a statement that it was reviewing the petition and said it structures its dealings to ensure compliance with all relevant laws. The request for anti-dumping measures was also addressed to the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent U.S. trade body that will review any decisions by the Commerce Department.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen MONTREAL – Bombardier and the federal government have rejected Boeing’s claim in a complaint filed with the U.S. government that its Canadian rival has dumped its new CSeries commercial jet into the United States at below cost. “Bombardier structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing,” the Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer said in an emailed statement.

READ MORE: Deal finalized for Quebec’s US$1 billion investment in Bombardier CSeries The Seattle-based competitor said Thursday that it petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It is also seeking an order to be issued against the sale of the plane in the important American market. Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains said the government objects to the allegations and vowed to mount “a vigorous defence.” “We are confident that our programs are consistent with Canada’s international obligations,” he said in a statement. Boeing said it asking the Trump administration to act “to end Bombardier’s illegal and unfair business practices before it is too late to prevent significant harm to America’s aerospace industry and thousands of good-paying aerospace jobs.” READ MORE: European and U.S. aviation bodies certify Bombardier CSeries aircraft The aerospace giant said the threat against its suppliers will only grow as Bombardier increases the annual production rate of the CSeries to between 90 and 120 airplanes by 2020. It said more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far have allowed Bombardier to engage in “predatory pricing” for an aircraft that competes directly against its 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 airplanes. Boeing claimed Bombardier has sold CSeries planes that cost US$33 million to produce for less than US$20 million each and at prices below what it charged in Canada. “It’s selling the aircraft in the U.S. at prices that are millions lower than those that they’re charging in Canada, which is the very definition of dumping,” Boeing spokesman Daniel Curran said in an interview. Boeing joins Brazil, which filed a similar complaint with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer.

Delta Air Lines will become the first U.S. CSeries carrier after placing a firm order a year ago for 75 CS100 aircraft valued at US$5.6 billion. It also has options for 50 more planes and can covert some of the aircraft to larger CS300s. Air Canada followed by ordering 45 CS300s for US$3.8 billion at list prices, plus options for 30 more planes. Airlines typically pay much less than list prices and early buyers of new planes usually get low prices. The latest challenge against Bombardier’s largest aircraft came just days after the U.S. imposed preliminary duties of up to 24 per cent on softwood lumber imported from Canada. – with files from Peter Cameron in Toronto Report an error Boeing Bombardier C-Series Canada trade CSeries Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains U.S. International Trade Commission Editor's Picks Lifestyle The couples who found love on an app destined for casual hook-ups Canada Marijuana will be legal, but for many activists the fight isn't over Canada Why Canada wins, but many Torontonians lose, from Ontario's new housing measures Canada Inside Canada's flexible work economy.

In his speech, Dr Marshall said that the US was CSIRO's most significant international research partner, highlighting relationships with partner organisations NASA, Boeing, GE and NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In March, Mr Trump released his "America First" budget, which proposes to cut NOAA's research budget by 52 per cent, NASA's earth science budget by 5 per cent and the Environmental Protection Agency's research and development office by 48 per cent, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

"We've been in the US for a long time. We've navigated many changes in government and policy. The world needs science and the US needs it as much as anyone else does. So I'm optimistic." At the business briefing, Dr Marshall announced that CSIRO has signed a five-year $35 million dollar research agreement with Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company. Advertisement The deal extends 28 years of co-operation between Boeing and CSIRO. Dr Marshall announced the agreement while outlining CSIRO's plans for developing scientific co-operation in the US. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Monica Wulff of Startup Muster said start-ups will want to know if CSIRO understands their needs. Photo: Supplied "Adopting a global outlook for national benefit is a key pillar of CSIRO's strategy – and it's an approach that has yielded enormous benefits through our relationship with Boeing," Dr Marshall said. Dr Marshall said 23 per cent of CSIRO's total revenue in 2011-2015 came from international sources and said that was set to rise to 33 per cent of our future revenue for 2015-2020. Boeing employs 3500 people in Australia manufacturing parts of the Dreamliner aircraft, and working on projects in space sciences, military and materials science. Dr Marshall told the luncheon that CSIRO would be expanding its efforts to support new technology and start-ups in Australia reach US markets. In January, Dr Marshall announced CSIRO would open an office in California's Silicon Valley. On Friday Dr Marshall said the San Mateo office "will provide a base for visiting researchers, new business spin-outs and innovators for our commercialisation pipeline". Dr Marshall said that by 2020, "we want working with CSIRO to be synonymous with a game plan for entry into the US market." CSIRO scientists have expressed concerns that Dr Marshall's concentration on commercialisation will detract from the public good research science undertaken by CSIRO. Nigel Warren, general manager of CSIRO global, dismissed that concern, telling Fairfax Media that a staff of four in Silicon Valley out of a total of 5000 CSIRO employees showed that focus on scientific research continued. The Australian start-up community will want to know exactly what CSIRO can offer it for plans to enter the US market, said Monica Wulff who runs start-up survey, Startup Muster. "I think most Australian start-ups would be intrigued about CSIRO's plans in this space. I don't think there would be criticism yet, but the sector will want to know what CSIRO's motivation is." Ms Wulff said: "Does CSIRO understand the needs of the Australian start-up system and what America can provide for them?" Advertisement HuffPost Australia TED 2017: British Inventor Shows Off ...

The petition against Canada's new competitor to the Boeing 737 aircraft came just days after the Commerce Department imposed duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, saying that the product's origin from public land amounted to an unfair government subsidy. On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump told Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that he intended to begin renegotiating the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, after White House officials said Trump had been considering an order to withdraw from the pact. Boeing said in its petition that Bombardier, determined to win a key order from Delta Air Lines Inc after losing a competition at United Airlines, had offered its planes to the airline at an "absurdly low" $19.6 million each, well below what it described as the aircraft's production cost of $33.2 million. "Propelled by massive, supply creating and illegal government subsidies, Bombardier Inc has embarked on an aggressive campaign to dump its CSeries aircraft in the United States," Boeing said in its petition. Boeing's similarly sized 737-700 model has a list price of $83.4 million, with the new 737-MAX 7 priced at $92.2 million. Sales discounts from list prices are typically 40 percent to 50 percent in the industry. In April 2016, Bombardier won the Delta order, its biggest yet, for 75 CS100 jets, worth an estimated $5.6 billion based on the list price of about $71.8 million. In its complaint against Bombardier, Boeing argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. Quebec Economy Minister Dominique Anglade said in a statement that her government would defend "the commercial partnership concluded with Bombardier" for a $1 billion injection in the CSeries. Boeing also took a shot at European rival Airbus SE, which it accuses of benefiting from similar "unfair" government subsidies in a long-running dispute before the World Trade Organization. Bombardier is "taking a page out of the Airbus strategy book" by trying to muscle into the U.S. market with cut-rate pricing, Boeing charged. A Commerce Department spokesman said the petition would be given "a thorough review" and further comment was premature. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has taken action in recent weeks to protect the U.S. steel and aluminum industries from foreign competition, launching national security investigations that could lead to import restrictions. An investigation could lead to duties on the Bombardier aircraft to offset any below-cost pricing or any subsidies deemed unfair. In a statement, Canada's government objected to Boeing's allegations and noted that the CSeries has many U.S. suppliers, including for engines, and supports thousands of U.S. jobs. "The Government of Canada will mount a vigorous defense against these allegations and stand up for aerospace jobs on both sides of the border," it said in the statement. Bombardier's chief executive conceded the company had been "aggressive" on pricing in order to win, and sources familiar with the deal pegged the discount closer to two-thirds off the nominal list price. Bombardier said in a statement that it was reviewing the petition and said it structures its dealings to ensure compliance with all relevant laws. The request for anti-dumping measures was also addressed to the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent U.S. trade body that will review any decisions by the Commerce Department.

[Photo by Yin Liqin/For China Daily] Domestic aircraft manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp of China said on Thursday that it has started work to develop a wide-body commercial jet with Russia, and the passenger plane is expected to be delivered within 10 years. The 280-seat wide-body jet would have a range of 12,000 kilometers. The project signals the two countries' ambitions to compete in the wide-body market, which is currently dominated by US aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and European manufacturer Airbus Group SE. "Research and development of wide-body aircraft was launched recently," said He Dongfeng, vice-chairman and president of COMAC. The research and development for the jet will be conducted in Moscow, and the assembly work will be conducted in Shanghai, COMAC announced at November's Zhuhai Airshow. Li Xiaojin, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said: "It is hoped that the development of wide-body aircraft will drive the growth of many related aircraft manufacturing sectors in China. And China will be able to learn and apply the experiences from Russia, and enhance the manufacturing level of the nation's aviation industry. "Wide-body aircraft requires high standards in terms of aircraft engine technology and aircraft materials. China and Russia still face some difficulties in making competitive wide-body jets, given their current manufacturing levels," Li said. Meanwhile, the C919, China's first self-made passenger jet airliner, is technically ready for its maiden flight and will take to the skies soon, said the president of the Shanghai-based aircraft maker. COMAC said a variety of factors will be taken into consideration for C919's first flight, including the condition of the aircraft, the status of the crew and weather conditions. With the help of global cooperation, COMAC has managed to learn existing mature modes, adopt scientific methods, and utilize resources of the industry, technology and talent all over the world to create its own passenger jets. "COMAC's 256 leading suppliers come from 14 countries and regions, and our partners include leading aviation institutes and enterprises such as GE Co and Fokker Technologies Holding BV, and its OEMs including Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier Inc," said He from COMAC. Safety is the cornerstone of civil aviation, and it is all industry players' responsibility to keep flights safe, He said.

Boeing, which owns 80 percent of the 2,850-acre field lab in the southern hills of Simi Valley, secured the easement Tuesday from North American Land Trust, a national organization that holds more than 480 conservation easements in 18 states. The trust will be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the easement. “Our vision is that Santa Susana will continue to be a place where mountain lions roam free, cultural artifacts remain undisturbed and oak woodlands have the opportunity to thrive,” said Steve Shestag, Boeing’s director of environment, in a statement provided to the Acorn this week. “We remain committed to completing a cleanup that fully protects everyone who will enjoy this vast open space habitat as well as our neighbors in the community.” Cleanup efforts by Boeing, NASA, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and U.S. Department of Energy have been underway at SSFL for nearly a decade. In 2007, Boeing committed to preserving its portion of the field lab as open space upon completion of the cleanup. Stephen Johnson, North American Land Trust president, said SSFL is a “critical link in a regional wildlife corridor” connecting the Santa Monica Mountains to Los Padres National Forest that is “essential for the survival of mountain lions” and other animals. Large, undisturbed portions of the site are also home to redtailed hawks, bobcats, mule deer and more. “We are thrilled to be able to collaborate with Boeing on the conservation of this incredible property,” Johnson said in a statement. “We will ensure that the property is protected forever, and that its natural and cultural resources are enhanced for the benefit of generations to come.” —Melissa Simon Return to top Copyright © 2004-2017 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

The tool was developed in partnership with the CSIRO and allows an onsite technician to collaborate with experts anywhere in the world in a virtual reality environment that mirrors natural interaction.  It means someone using this technology and working on an aircraft in the United Arab Emirates will have the same level of support as if they had an expert standing beside them.  The technology will be released to the market this year.  TAE CEO Andrew Sanderson said TAE has been exporting its products for over five years and now has customers in over 30 countries, including the United States, India and Europe.  "TAE's growth has been the result of significant effort in developing our portfolio and product offering into new markets through understanding the opportunities and where our competencies match a growing need," Mr Sanderson said.  "We are currently in negotiations with several high profile aerospace companies around the world for fountx production and a demonstration unit is already in use with Boeing in Seattle.  "A number of government agencies including Trade and Investment Queensland (TIQ) and Department of State Development have greatly assisted with getting our fountx brand known and introducing us to potential international clients."   TAE general manager Andrew Sanderson (left) and program manager Marcus Evans with a Honeywell AGT1500 is a turbine engine from an M1 Abrams tank that is currently undergoing repair work at the companies RAAF Base Amberley site. Photo: File David Nielsen While visiting the company at its RAAF Base headquarters, Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt announced his government's Trade and Investment Queensland agency was planning to open an office in Ipswich to help local businesses.  Mr Pitt said the Palaszczuk Government's new $35 million Advancing Trade and Investment - Queensland Trade and Investment Strategy 2017-2022 would build on the state's strong traditional industries and new and developing sectors to boost exports and generate new jobs.  "TAE joins the ranks of a number of highly innovative Queensland businesses using innovative technology to radically change how traditional services are carried out," Mr Pitt said.  "The Palaszczuk Government's new Trade and Investment Strategy I launched recently is designed to foster these type of businesses that are creating new types of jobs for the future.  "For many years TAE has provided innovative and premium components and services in aerospace engineering globally but this technology takes that service to a whole new level."  State Member for Ipswich West, Jim Madden said planning was under way for a TIQ office in Ipswich.  "From next month we will be trialling the location of a trade and investment officer in Ipswich with a view to establishing a permanent presence," Mr Madden said. "TIQ, the government's global business agency, will run a six-month pilot project with an Ipswich-based principal trade and investment officer, who is likely to be co-located with one of our key agency partners in the city centre.  "There are more than 60 businesses in Ipswich and surrounds currently being serviced by TIQ and the TIQ presence will be established in recognition of the emerging importance and level of business, trade and investment activity in the greater Ipswich and Lockyer Valley area.  "These businesses can be supported by a dedicated Ipswich-based TIQ officer, rather than supporting the area from the Toowoomba office." business Read More Login to follow ipswich Read More Login to follow technology Read More Login to follow Topics:  business ipswich technology 0 PRINT Have your say Just In Rustlers to face Gladstone in local blockbuster Woods signs: next dominoes in Dogs, Tigers shuffle LIVE: Ipswich Jets v Burleigh Bears Life in jail for thug who murdered random passer-by Victory wants to re-create cauldron against Roar 'We always hoped we'd find them alive' Top Stories LIVE: Ipswich Jets v Burleigh Bears WATCH the Ipswich Jets take on theBurleigh Bears via USQ Phoenix Media Hub live stream from 3pm on Saturday.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, after all, has clashed with Trump on everything from iPhone encryption to immigration, and was even reportedly on an early short list of potential running mates for Hillary Clinton. But as Trump's first 100 days come to a close, one thing is clear: Apple stock is the biggest winner of his presidency so far. Apple (aapl) shares have returned more than 20% since Trump entered the White House, making the tech company the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average during the first 100 days. Driving Apple's gains: a great quarterly earnings report, a tax climate that could be a boon for Apple shareholders, and the stock's growing reputation as a haven for dividend-conscious retirement investors. Apple stock has run up about four times as much as the market overall, even as the so-called Trump Bump created one of the best 100-day rallies for any president elected since World War II. Since Trump was elected in November, Apple has risen 29%, eclipsing the Dow's 14% return over that period—though Boeing (ba) just barely scraped ahead, with its shares up nearly 30%. Even though Apple shares sank after Trump announced an immigration ban from several predominantly Muslim countries in late January, the tech company reversed those losses the following day when it revealed in its earnings report that its new iPhone 7 was a hit, and that it sold more iPhones over the holiday season than Wall Street had expected. Trump's proposed policies, though still in flux, have also been a boon to Apple, whose CEO Cook has participated in the President's summits of business leaders. Most notably, Apple would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Trump's promise to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, which would allow the iPhone maker to potentially bring much of its massive overseas cash hoard back to the U.S. without taking a major hit from taxes. (On the flip side, Trump's tax reform plan has hurt other stocks like Under Armour (uaa), which was the market's worst performer in the first 100 days, in part due to fears that the President's suggested import tax could more than cancel out benefits of a rate cut.) JobsHere’s the Single Biggest Reason Tech Workers Quit Their Jobs Donald TrumpTrump’s First 100 Days Make Him One of the Stock Market’s Best Presidents Under ArmourThis Is Why Under Armour Is the Biggest Stock Loser of Trump’s First 100 Days Goldman SachsHow Goldman Sachs Stock Lost $4 Billion of Its Trump Bump in a Single Day OneTimeDollar Steadies After U.S. Healthcare Bill Pulled Housing marketShould You Buy Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Stock marketThese Stocks Have Already Decided If Trumpcare Will Pass CommentaryThe Stock Market Has Woken up to the Trump-GOP Divide Still, a flush few months for Apple's stock haven't stopped Cook from openly disagreeing with Trump's agenda, even going so far as to threaten to sue the administration over its immigration ban. It's not just Trump who has given Apple a boost in the last few months. Warren Buffett has been taking bigger and bigger bites of Apple stock lately, a bet that has paid off for the legendary Berkshire Hathaway (brk.a) investor in the form of profits in the range of hundreds of millions of dollars—and helped send Apple shares to new all-time highs. (Click here for more articles from Time Inc.'s Looking Forward series.) The octogenarian stock-picker, after all, has long loved dividend stocks, and Apple's 1.6% dividend yield (relatively high for a tech stock) has made it increasingly popular with yield-seeking investors, especially those planning for retirement. If tax reform, the Trump Bump and the next iPhone continue pushing the stock higher, retirees who bet their entire nest egg on Apple stock might not seem so crazy after all.

Dismissed: Tenants lose, landlords win in Baltimore's rent court Business Going commercial a challenge for government contractors Sarah GantzContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun KEYW's founder was so confident in the company's cybersecurity services for the federal intelligence community that he decided in 2013 to branch out into the commercial sector. But the Hanover-based firm struggled to get significant traction away from its government customers and after the founder passed away in mid-2015, the company's new leadership announced plans to refocus on its core business of government contracting. It subsequently sold off pieces of its commercial business last year. The fast-growing commercial cybersecurity market, which analysts estimate will top $202 billion by 2021, is an attractive lure for companies that cut their technology teeth providing such services for the federal government, where spending has largely stagnated. But they quickly learn that even if the problems are similar, many aspects of the private sector — the product, the pitch, the size of the deal and the business model — are very different from what they know. "Almost from the ground up you're structured the wrong way," said Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of Huntress Labs Inc., a Baltimore County cyber startup that converted from a government contractor to selling threat detection technology to private companies. While some companies succeed by building out commercial offerings as an independent subsidiary or moving entirely to the private sector, others, like KEYW, retreat to their core strength. Such major defense contractors as Northrop Grumman, Boeing and General Dynamics have all divested commercial cybersecurity businesses in recent years.

(Tim Prudente) But as uncertainty mounts about whether President Donald J. Trump will follow through on promises to severely cut the federal budget, government contractors will likely continue to make the leap to the commercial sector. "While the federal government continues to be a very large source of business for cybersecurity companies, there are increasingly questions about the federal government as a customer," said Ellen Hemmerly, the executive director of University of Maryland, Baltimore County's research and development park. At the same time, "folks are recognizing that the commercial market is huge — and growing."

Gonzalez designed computer protection systems and Adkins figured out how to penetrate such barriers. Their light bulb moment came when they decided to apply their expertise to the... (Sarah Gantz) Huntress CEO Hanslovan had been in business for about two years as a subcontractor, developing intelligence-gathering tools for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, when he decided to expand to the private sector in 2015. "The business was great," Hanslovan said, "but the issue was, like a lot of government contractors, we realized we were always at the command of the government telling us what to do and how to do it, and that really stifled creativity." He quickly realized the many ways he would have to change his business. Federal agencies are aware of their security problems and seek out contractors to provide a solution. They make decisions based on who will do the best work for the lowest cost. The pitch is flipped when it comes to selling to commercial customers, said Brian Ruttenbur, an analyst at Drexel Hamilton who follows KEYW and other defense sector companies. Businesses in the commercial sector take on the risk of figuring out what their customers need, developing a product they think will address the problem and convincing customers to buy it. "It's a whole different process," Ruttenbur said. "When you sell to the government, the government says, 'This is what we need and here are 40 phone books of what we're looking for,' and you respond back with 50 phone books of how you'll execute on that." Companies that go commercial also must be prepared for a change in the size and type of deals they make. The largest corporations already have recognized the cybersecurity threats facing their businesses and established relationships with security providers. Much of the new opportunity is with small and mid-sized companies, which means contractors used to doing a few big deals a year will have to adjust their sales strategy to do many small deals in the commercial space, said Lisa Yeo, an assistant professor of information systems at Loyola University Maryland. While the federal government typically buys services designed to meet its unique needs, businesses that want to sell to other private businesses need to develop a product that is generic enough to fit a broad range of companies but that can be adapted to individual customers, analysts said. Commercial clients also consider different factors when deciding who to hire. Factors such as the company's reputation, brand and customer service were things Hanslovan, of Huntress, said he never thought about as a government contractor. The company changed its name from StrategicIO to Huntress, he said, to further separate the company's past work for the government from its new, commercial business after potential clients expressed concern about buying threat detection from a company that was also helping the government gather intelligence. Companies that venture into the commercial sector often separate their commercial and government businesses because they are so different, said Hung-bin Ding, an associate professor of management at Loyola University Maryland. Separating commercial business also protects the core business. "There are companies that have trouble making the transition, many because the public and private sector businesses are very different," Ding said. "It's not really easy to balance these two parts of business." For some companies, the difference in business models is too big to do both, and they must decide whether to go all in on commercial or withdraw to their core business. Huntress, for example, is in the process of phasing out its government contracting business. Hanslovan said he sees more opportunity for growth in the private sector and doesn't want the extra expense of trying to maintain two lines of business. Others, such as KEYW, go in the other direction and lop off their commercial ventures. "Our primary focus will remain on the intelligence, cyber and counterterrorism communities within the government solutions arena," said Heather Williams, a KEYW spokeswoman, in a statement. Cybersecurity remains a key growth area for KEYW. Earlier this year, the company announced the acquisition of competitor Sotera Defense Solutions, which it said would accelerate the KEYW's growth and give it access to new government clients. Ruttenbur, the Drexel analyst, said he thought KEYW was undersized to get the scale it was reaching for in the commercial sector. When new management took over, they faced a decision of whether to forge ahead with the expense of expanding into a new line of business and experimenting with finding the right product, or to refocus on the company's true strength of government solutions. "I'm much more positive on the company," following the decision to divest the commercial business, Ruttenbur said. "I think they're right, especially now with defense budgets going up and increased threat from Syria and North Korea." "I think they're extremely well positioned and wise for repositioning that way," he said. sarah.gantz@baltsun.com twitter.com/sarahgantz Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Loyola University Maryland Experts: Network and data security should be a C-suite concern Tenable Network Security taps head of Dell Technologies cybersecurity unit as CEO A cybersecurity future in Baltimore New entertainment center, Barnes and Noble spin-off coming to Mall in Columbia Anthem House apartments in Locust Point to open in June COPT's profit swells in first quarter Breaking Sports Maryland Business Opinion Obits eNewspaper Advertising 66°

Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released. Stocks Soar, Then Hold Gains The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests. Amazon Is E-Commerce, Cloud King The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years. Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth. Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks. Alphabet Hits New High On Earnings The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's "other" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday. McDonald's, Domino's Earnings Deliver; Starbucks Iced McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level. Microsoft Earnings Solid; Sales, Guidance Shy Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion. Intel Tumbles Amid Mixed Chip Week Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results. Defense Stocks Are In Buy DMZ Zone Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees "significant demand signals" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas. Boeing Sales Miss, Cash Flow Triples Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose. Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range. Hard Drives Split Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday. Casino Stocks Are Winners Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation. Exxon, Chevron Earnings Top Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains. T-Mobile Keeps Grabbing Customers T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low. Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains. Autos' Earnings Better Than Expected Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices. Caterpillar Earnings Crush Views Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone. Drug, Biotech Earnings Bonanza Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed. Insurers Navigate Earnings, TrumpCare Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that "20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid." Homebuilder Stocks Now Lagging PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.   Share this: Related news Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed To Grab Spotlight: Investing Action Plan 4/28/2017 Some of the most closely watched and high-profile tech companies — Apple, Tesla and Facebook — report quarterly results as... 4/28/2017 Some of the most closely watched and high-profile tech companies...

The 280-seat wide-body jet would have a range of 12,000 kilometers. The project signals the two countries' ambitions to compete in the wide-body market, which is currently dominated by US aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and European manufacturer Airbus Group SE. "Research and development of wide-body aircraft was launched recently," said He Dongfeng, vice-chairman and president of COMAC. The research and development for the jet will be conducted in Moscow, and the assembly work will be conducted in Shanghai, COMAC announced at November's Zhuhai Airshow. Li Xiaojin, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said: "It is hoped that the development of wide-body aircraft will drive the growth of many related aircraft manufacturing sectors in China. And China will be able to learn and apply the experiences from Russia, and enhance the manufacturing level of the nation's aviation industry. "Wide-body aircraft requires high standards in terms of aircraft engine technology and aircraft materials. China and Russia still face some difficulties in making competitive wide-body jets, given their current manufacturing levels," Li said. Meanwhile, the C919, China's first self-made passenger jet airliner, is technically ready for its maiden flight and will take to the skies soon, said the president of the Shanghai-based aircraft maker. COMAC said a variety of factors will be taken into consideration for C919's first flight, including the condition of the aircraft, the status of the crew and weather conditions. With the help of global cooperation, COMAC has managed to learn existing mature modes, adopt scientific methods, and utilize resources of the industry, technology and talent all over the world to create its own passenger jets. "COMAC's 256 leading suppliers come from 14 countries and regions, and our partners include leading aviation institutes and enterprises such as GE Co and Fokker Technologies Holding BV, and its OEMs including Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier Inc," said He from COMAC. Safety is the cornerstone of civil aviation, and it is all industry players' responsibility to keep flights safe, He said.

The carriers will revert to previous cockpit access provisions, plus a number of additional safety and security measures. Austrian Airlines spokesperson Peter Thier told ATW that Austrian will “revert to the previous cockpit access provisions on our Airbus, Boeing and Embraer fleet. The only exclusion is our [Bombardier] Dash 8 Q400 fleet,” he said. The Lufthansa Group introduced the two-persons-in-the-cockpit rule as a precautionary measure after a Germanwings Airbus A320—en route from Barcelona to Düsseldorf—was deliberately flown into the French Alps March 24, 2015, killing all 150 people aboard. Investigations revealed that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, alone on the flight deck, switched the selected altitude from 38,000 ft. to 100 ft.—the minimum value possible on an Airbus A320—and increased the speed of the aircraft, setting in motion an intentional fatal descent into the French Alps. In March 2015, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a temporary recommendation, proposing that two crew members, including at least one qualified pilot, should occupy the cockpit during flight. This was not a requirement. EASA revised its recommendation in summer 2016, offering airlines the option of abolishing this “two-persons-in-the-cockpit” rule, provided they met the relevant further criteria. According to SWISS, the action to abolish the rule follows an extensive safety and security review, which concluded the rule does not enhance flight safety, and actually introduces additional risks to daily operations. The decision has been coordinated with similar risk assessments by its Lufthansa Group airlines partner. SWISS, Austrian and Lufthansa said they meet all the requirements required by EASA of any airline seeking to abolish the rule, which include: Ensuring suitable selection criteria and procedures to assess the psychological and safety-relevant demands made on pilots; Ensuring stable employment terms and conditions for cockpit personnel; Giving pilots (easy) access to any psychological or other support programs they may need; and Demonstrating an ability as a company to minimize the psychological and social risks to which pilots are exposed, such as loss of license. SWISS said its decision to abolish the two-persons-in-the-cockpit rule is supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation.

But don’t expect other airlines to follow suit or for the practice to go away. Quotes in the article United Continental Holdings Inc UAL ▼ 70.21 -0.49 -0.69% Southwest Airlines Co LUV ▲ 56.22 +0.47 +0.84% Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▼ 45.44 -0.30 -0.66% Boeing Co BA ▲ 184.83 +1.61 +0.88% The strategy of overbooking, or overselling seats to account for no-show customers, remains a key part of most airlines’ game plans, especially as carriers enjoy their most profitable streak in history. Involuntary bumping of airline passengers invariably leads to pain of some sort, ranging from customer inconvenience to the kind of crisis that hit United Continental Holdings Inc. earlier this month. On average, 111 paying fliers a day were involuntarily bumped for a host of reasons last year, according to government data. Most carriers figure that there is more benefit than risk. Still, operational and safety reasons often also contribute to the shortage of seats. Mechanical or weather-related issues, for instance, lead to a reduction of available seats, which causes the unloading of passengers and luggage on a short notice. Most large carriers, which have gotten larger and fewer in number over a decade of consolidation, believe if they don’t intentionally sell more tickets than they have seats, they would have to raise their fares. Their thin profit margins can rest on the last one or two passengers who board the plane and this decades-old practice is an embedded part of most carriers’ business plans. Overbooking “is a valid business process,” Ed Bastian, Delta Air Lines Inc.’s chief executive, said told investors earlier this month. “It is not a question…as to whether you overbook. It’s how you manage an overbook situation.”Delta on Thursday stood by that remark. U.S. airlines have been so successful at the strategy that they filled 82.2% of their seats in 2016, near the record of recent years, up from 78.8% a decade earlier. It is rare that the practice leads to a physical altercation such as on United Express Flight 3411, an overbooked flight, when passenger Dr. David Dao was forcibly dragged off a plane. Often, “mini-tragedies,” like people missing weddings, funerals, and job interviews, are the result, said George Hobica, president of flier advocacy group Airfarewatchdog.com. How many seats they oversell is proprietary by airline, but experts said they have fine-tuned this practice relying in part on historical trends on no-shows by time of day, day of week, season and popularity of routes, among other factors. Southwest Airlines said it typically oversold just one seat on its each of its Boeing Co. 737 jets configured to carry 143, though still had to involuntarily bump almost 15,000 passengers last year, by far the highest level in the industry. United Express Flight 3411, which was to be the last flight to Louisville, Ky., from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on April 9, was overbooked by one person, triggering the “denied boarding” process, United said in a report released Thursday about the incident. The flight was operated by subcontractor Republic Airways Holdings Inc. One flier was involuntarily bumped before the remaining 70 passengers boarded the plane, but agents had to find four more seats for a crew needed in Louisville the next morning to operate another flight, the report said. A couple that was involuntarily bumped left the flight in return for compensation. Dr. Dao and his wife were chosen next but he refused to leave, triggering a series of decisions that led to his forcible removal. United said in the report that its “forecast of no-shows is usually quite accurate.” It typically overbooks flights by less than 3% of a plane’s seat capacity, and 4% of its flights have more ticketed passengers seeking to board than seats available. After the recent incident, however, the carrier said it plans to reduce overbooking, particularly on flights that historically have experienced lower rates of volunteers ceding their seats for compensation, on smaller aircraft and last flights of the day. To be sure, the number of involuntarily bumped passengers has gradually declined as airlines have honed their operations and made it more attractive for passengers to volunteer to fly later. More than 40,600 people were involuntarily bumped in 2016, out of the 660 million passengers who flew last year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Transportation. That was down from 43,700 fliers in 2015, out of 601 million total air travelers. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said on an investor call this week that the number of no-shows has also fallen over the years. Unlike its rivals, Southwest, the larger hauler of domestic passengers, doesn’t charge fees for people changing the dates or times or their flights. A spokeswoman said its rebooking policies that are more flexible than some other airlines may be a contributing factor. The government in 2015 also raised the mandatory minimums airlines must pay to involuntarily bumped passengers, with caveats, to as much as $1,350 for a flight, compared with a maximum of $800 as recently as 2011. United said in its report that nearly 96% of its affected customers agrees to take another flight in return for compensation and incentives. With airlines required to look for volunteers first before bumping anyone involuntarily, it can be a “win-win situation,” for both customers and the airlines, said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst for Atmosphere Research Group. But track records and policies for airlines vary, and carriers don’t report the reasons behind each involuntary bump, according to the Transportation Department. And when it comes to involuntary bumping and other airline policies, fliers have few rights. “Airline passengers are in a consumer-protection no man’s land,” said Kevin Mitchell, chairman of flier advocacy group Business Travel Coalition. United said it doesn’t gauge in advance a customer’s interest in giving up his or her seat on an overbooked flight, something some rivals do. The carrier selects passengers by looking at how much they paid for the ticket, when they checked in and whether they have frequent-flier status. Using this method, United denied boarding to 3,765 paying passengers last year, down from 6,300 in 2015. It hopes to reduce the number in the future, but still plans to use that policy. “Compensating for that show rate can leave us with more passengers than expected,” she said. JetBlue Airways Corp. is one airline already without an overbook policy, but aircraft swaps, weight restrictions and other operational factors caused it to involuntarily bump nearly 3,200 fliers last year.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide America Is Dropping So Many Bombs That We're Literally Running Out Matt NovakYesterday 10:20am Filed to: forever war bombs military 120 6 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink GIF US military airstrike on a purported ISIS VBIED facility near Mosul, Iraq, on February 26, 2017 (Video released by the US military) President Trump has said that America needs to rebuild its military, which is laughable in many ways. But he’s right in one respect. We need more bombs. Why? Because the US has dropped so many bombs in the fight against ISIS over the past two years that we’re running out. Advertisement As military news site Defense One reports, America is running short on the GPS-guided Small Diameter Bombs made by Boeing, newer models made by Raytheon, and even air-to-air missiles. Many of the existing stockpiles of bombs held by the US military are being diverted from the Pacific region to the Middle East and Africa, where the need is reportedly most urgent. But this isn’t a new problem. There have been warnings from the Pentagon for almost a year that our intensive bombing of ISIS targets around the world could lead to a shortage. We ran into a similar problem near the end of 2015. Advertisement Since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve in August of 2014, the US has spent over $11.9 billion on military operations against ISIS. That includes over 19,607 strikes in Iraq and Syria alone, at a cost of roughly $12.8 million per day. And that doesn’t even count airstrikes in places like Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen. That’s a fuck-ton of bombing. And someone has to supply those bombs so we can keep constantly bombing the shit out of those countries. But the US military is dropping them quicker than they can be restocked. “These are not exciting kinds of weapons; these are mundane sort of weapons,” PACOM commander Admiral Harry Harris told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday. Sponsored “But they’re absolutely critical to what we’re trying to do, not only… against North Korea, but also in the fights in the Middle East,” Admiral Harris continued. Yes, I guess you could call a GPS-guided bomb mundane. But you could also call it incredibly destructive and expensive. I don’t think there’s any question that ISIS are the bad guys here. But if the world’s largest military is using so many bombs that it’s literally running out, it might be a good time to consider if there is another strategy that could be employed. Advertisement After all, Trump did promise to deliver a super-duper secret plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days once in office. That plan? He told the Pentagon they have 30 days to come up with a plan. Tomorrow marks Trump’s 100th day in office, and we’re still waiting on that, I guess. Great plan, dude. In the meantime, maybe order some more bombs.

The risk of the United States imposing a tariff, which would likely depress sales of Bombardier's newest jet, and concern over how big that tariff might be, unsettled investors, sending the Canadian company's shares down just over 4 percent. Boeing wants the U.S. government to investigate what it describes as rock-bottom prices for Bombardier's new CSeries aircraft, including an "absurdly low" sum of US$19.6 million it says Delta Air Lines Inc paid for a jet costing US$33 million to build. "The allegation is absurd," Bombardier spokesman Bryan Tucker said, in response to numbers contained in a petition sent to the U.S. Commerce Department by Boeing on Thursday. The spat comes days after Washington imposed duties averaging 20 percent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, prompting claims in Canada that Boeing was taking advantage of the Trump administration's tougher stance on trade. Advertisement Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said the filing against Bombardier was "an initiative we chose to take ourselves". He declined to say whether Boeing also planned to ask the United States to pursue Canada through the World Trade Organization, as it has against European rival Airbus. Domestic cases, where companies can petition for duties on specific products, typically take around a year. That is much quicker than a 13-year-old transatlantic battle on jetliner subsidies at the WTO, an international forum open only to nations. Planemakers "often sell below costs to break into a new market or with a new product, particularly if it involves a significant launch customer," said U.S.-based trade policy expert Joel Johnson. Such tactics cause long-term harm by creating momentum that rivals find hard to reverse, Boeing's petition said, although industry analysts say Boeing and Airbus both regularly offer discounts of 50 percent or more. Boeing has said it competed for last year's Delta order against the CSeries CS100 with used 717s, which it no longer makes, and used jets from Brazil's Embraer , since Delta was only ready to pay a low price and wanted smaller jets than its more modern 737. But it said Bombardier's actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of its best-selling 737. Still, its complaint puzzled some analysts and trade lawyers, since Canada is in talks to sign a deal later this year or in early 2018 to acquire 18 Boeing fighter jets. "It's certainly the right political climate for a trade complaint. But I'm not sure this is the best idea," said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. Canada has rejected Boeing's accusations and says the CSeries uses many U.S. parts and generates thousands of U.S. jobs. Around half of the 110 to 130 seat CSeries is made in the United States, including the engine, cockpit control panels and avionics. Trade experts say an investigation could result in Delta and other buyers having to pay extra duties on future deliveries, effectively raising the price but not benefiting Bombardier. Canadian trade lawyer Mark Warner said Canada could challenge final decisions at the WTO or through NAFTA. Delta did not respond to requests for comment.

Why should a corporation pay a lower rate of income tax than its employees? The corporate tax rate is now 35% and the maximum individual tax rate is 39%. The Supreme Court has ruled that corporations are people and entitled to the same constitutional rights as people. So shouldn't people be entitled to the same rights as corporations? President Trump's tax proposal will bury the federal government in red ink by lowering corporate taxes across the board. My proposal is revenue neutral and targets tax incentives aimed directly at manufacturing corporations that we want to keep in the United States or bring back to the U.S. - Advertisement - Mr. Trump claims that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. This is not quite accurate since that although the nominal corporate rate is 35% the actual, real world corporate tax rate is closer to 15%. According to Americans for Tax Fairness, General Electric, Boeing, Verizon and 23 other profitable Fortune 500 firms paid no federal income taxes from 2008 to 2012. The organization also found that 288 big and profitable Fortune 500 corporations paid an average effective federal tax rate of just and that profitable corporations paid U.S. income taxes amounting to just 12.6% of worldwide income in 2010. Concerning corporate taxes, I propose the elimination of loopholes and a corporate tax rate of 28% with a zero tax rate for manufacturing companies. I also propose a 14% tax rate for income earned overseas to bring home $2.6 trillion of profits sitting in corporate accounts offshore. I would also cap personal taxes at 28% as well, with no deductions, except the personal deduction. Loopholes Many corporations use every tax loophole to avoid paying taxes. As a part of tax reform all of these loopholes should be closed. All income should be treated the same, with one exception. The exception is income from manufacturing. Manufacturing is the industry that has moved offshore, for cheap labor and for low tax rates. Your local restaurant, dry cleaner and retail store cannot move offshore and does not need special lower tax rates: they cannot move offshore. The President's industry, real estate investment, is built on loopholes, including depreciation. Real property does not depreciate; Depreciation is a myth. Improvements and repairs to real estate should be deductible, but depreciation should not be deductible from income. - Advertisement - Tax Amnesty for Reshoring Profits There are also more than $2.6 trillion stashed overseas by major American corporations, including Microsoft, Apple and Google. We should allow these dollars to be repatriated at a reduced rate. Under my tax proposal, companies could bring home this $2.6 trillion pie, invest this money in new factories and businesses, and the U.S. Treasury would reap a $360 billion bonus. This should cover the costs of the manufacturing tax of zero and then some. Manufacturing Tax of Zero I propose a 28 percent corporate tax rate, with a zero percent tax rate for manufacturing companies, and a onetime amnesty rate to repatriate earnings held offshore at a 14 percent rate. Overall, the corporate taxes now contribute only about 10 percent of total federal revenues. Under my proposal, corporations will pay more money to the federal treasury and thus create more jobs. On total federal tax revenues of $3 trillion a year, corporations now contribute only about $300 billion. Individual citizens pay the bulk of federal tax revenues. Manufacturing is the primary area where the United States has lost jobs over the past 20 years. Manufacturing also creates more jobs than other businesses because it creates jobs with suppliers and service providers as well as necessary buildings and equipment. - Advertisement - If we lower the corporate tax rate to 28 percent and eliminate all loopholes (no investment tax credits, no oil depletion allowance, etc.,) we can institute a tax on manufacturers of zero percent. This would be based on the amount of U.S. content in the products manufactured. This zero tax rate would apply only to products made with 100 percent U.S. content. For example, if a manufacturer assembles a product in the United States with 50 percent U.S. content, the manufacturer would pay an income tax of 50 percent of the 28 percent rate, or 14 percent. However, if the manufacturer has 100 percent U.S. content, its tax rate would be zero. This new tax rate would serve to incentivize manufacturers to make their products in the United States. It would help to create millions of American jobs by bringing manufacturing back to New York, Illinois, California, Ohio, Michigan and every other state.

(AP Photo/J. David Ake, File) Having completed my 2016 income tax form, I was prompted to take alook at the tax “reforms” being proposed by the new administration.The results of my research were disheartening. One of the needs touted by Republicans is the necessity to lower taxes on big business. This tax break supposedly will turn the modest Obama recovery into a triumphal Trump Boom.We are told repeatedly that corporate taxes in America are the highest in the world.But we are rarely told the percent of taxes actually paid by corporations is among the lowest in the world. Laura Saunders writing in theWall Street Journal (April 14) reported that 47% of federal income taxes are paid by individuals.Another 34% is from payroll taxes which are also primarily from individuals. A paltry 9% is paid by business, and most of that is by small business. Ralph Nader arguesin his most recent book,Breaking Through Power, that populists on the left and the right need to realize they agree on many tax issues related to Wall Street’sgreed.He argues that income tax relief for the top corporationsis virtually meaningless for many companies as they already pay zero income tax.No, that is not a typo. Zero. Among the total tax avoiders from 2008-2012 were General Electric, Boeing,and Verizon. In years when General Electric did pay an income tax, it averaged a 2.3% tax rate on its $80 billion in earnings. An added tax benefit is that GEoften manages to get payments (not refunds) from the federal system. These payments result from complex legislative loopholes engineered by Congress. Moreover, like other corporate non-tax payers,GE has extensive profits from governmental purchase which, of course, are tax-payer dollars. A study by Citizens for Tax Justice reveals no less than a hundred and eleven corporations paid zero income taxes for at least one year between 2008 and 2012.Ninety-three other corporations had a tax rate of 10% or less. Rather than lowering the taxes on such enterprises, a raise in taxes would bring them into closer proximity to what the average citizen pays. The national interest also would be better served by creating a means for American corporations to repatriate the $2 trillionthey hold in overseas tax-free accounts. One of President Trump’s campaign pledges was to accomplish that, but he has yet to initiate any action in his regard. Small business, rather than big business, is a far better candidate for tax reduction and deregulation as it is a quiet power house of the economy.Firms with less than 500 workers employ 48% of all workers in the private sector.Of that 48%, nearly three fourths are paid by firms with less than 100 employees with another 10% by films with less than twenty employees. Tax relief and other economic stimulation wouldhave immediate grass roots impact throughout the nation. Such aid was pledged by candidate Trump, but to date, the only action has been murmurs about easing loan terms for small business. A new proposal that affects small business is to eliminate the 12% social security payroll tax of which half is paid by employers.This “reform” is a disguised assault on the nature of social security and a step toward privatization. Social Security is a de factofederal insurance policy, not a giveaway. People pay into Social Security for decades to secure certain long-term and possible short-term benefits. Augmenting Social Security’s ultimate payback to retirees areemergency benefits involving the premature death of a parent and disability. If an individual suffers an injury that renders them unemployable for a short period or permanently, Social Security checks prevent that individual from becoming impoverished. In similar fashion, if a parent dies prematurely, children will receive Social Security payments until they are 18, an amount that assists a family to remain stable until the minor becomes a legal adult. If the Social Security payroll tax is ended, other means of funding Social Security will be needed.A favorite proposal of economic hawks is a6% Value Added Tax (VAT). This is a sales tax, even though it is often hidden in the costs of any specific purchase.How much or even if VAT funds would go to Social Security would be periodically negotiable.VAT rates in Europe now average 20%+.Even the payroll tax is eliminated, a 6%, VAT becomes a tax increase on the average American. Just who will get tax relief at what long-term cost has become part of this year’s political discourse.Whose taxes are cut with what long-term consequences are issues Americans need to confront with political activism rather than verbal outbursts. Popular opinion can be effective as demonstrated in the reaction to criticisms raised at usually low-key town halls. Demands are increasing for President Trump to release his tax returns and for legislation that would require all members of Congress to do so.Half of them are millionaires (evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans). Tax returns reveal loans, fees, and investments that might reflect a conflict of interest regarding their choice ofhow and whom they tax. Perhaps it is just coincidental but the most commonly held stock by members of Congressis General Electric.

Advertisement By By The Citizen Reporter @TheCitizenTz news@tz.nationmedia.com  The government will spend another Sh500 billion during the coming financial year to jerk the performance of Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL), Parliament heard yesterday. With the number of tourists visiting the country on the rise, the government is confident that long-haul international flights between Dar es Salaam and leading destinations in Asia, Europe and America will further increase the number of visitors and bring the country its much-needed foreign exchange. Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa told Parliament on Thursday, April 6 that Tanzania received a total of 1,284,279 tourists in 2016, an increase of 12 per cent from the 1,137,182 visitors who came in 2015. The visitors brought in $2 billion (about Sh4.5 trillion) last year. And yesterday, requesting the parliament to endorse a total of Sh4.5 trillion for his ministry and its various departments and institutions during the 2017/18 financial year, the Minister of Works, Transport and Communication, Prof Makame Mbarawa, reiterated that the government plans to buy three more planes for ATCL. “The money will be spent on completing the final payment for three aircrafts,” he said. Of the aircrafts, two will be CS300 jetliners, each with a capacity to carry 127 passengers and a long-haul Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner which has a capacity of carrying 262 passengers. “Part of the money will also be spent on paying for insurance packages and training for pilots, engineers and other cabin crew members….Part of it will also be used as start up costs,” he said. In his remarks, the chairman for a parliamentary Infrastructure Development Committee, Prof Norman Sigala, said the government should consider turning ATCL into a completely independent and profit-making business entity. “That way, it will be able to compete with the rest of other airline operators and bring profits….As things stand, ATCL is regarded to be a mere department within the ministry. We want it to be a completely independent business entity,” he said. The ATCL board and management must be independent from the ministry, said Prof Sigala. The airline, he said, must be able to advertise its airline business globally. Boeing Commercial Airlines announced in December last year that Tanzania was joining its Dreamliner family after the American multinational corporation signed a $224.6 million deal with the government. “I am pleased to welcome Air Tanzania as the newest member of the Dreamliner family,” said Van Rex Gallard, Boeing Commercial Airplanes vice president in charge of Latin America, Africa and Caribbean sales. “We are honoured that Air Tanzania has chosen the 787 to operate its long-haul operations. The 787 will significantly increase passenger numbers feeding on to its domestic flights, thereby boosting overall tourism to Tanzania,” Gallard added. The said plane has a range of 13,620 kilometres, the capacity to carry 242 passengers in a two-class configuration, and a top speed of 593 miles per hour. advertisement In The Headlines 12  hours ago Remaining Eala members election set The Clerk of National Assembly Dr Thomas Kashillilah has announced that the election to fill the 18  hours ago President Magufuli sacks 9,932 civil servants at a go  President John Magufuli has instantly sacked 9,932 workers who have been found using fake News Prof Lipumba calls for legal actions against attackers   19  hours ago News Extraction of uranium in Bahi to start early next year   20  hours ago News Govt can’t employ all graduates ,says Deputy Minister   20  hours ago News Newly employed doctors directed to report within two weeks   21  hours ago Advertisement                             Advertisement Political Reforms WARAH: Making angels out of Africa’s rogue leaders Opinion/Editorial FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR'S DESK: Scribes’ dilemma: to be or not to be objective Opinion/Editorial WHAT OTHERS SAY: Is Kenya really exceptional in E.Africa?

As the US economy expands across the south, unions are actively trying to recruit workers – but have discovered a need for organization in the face of big money Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Mike Elk in Atlanta Friday 28 April 2017 06.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 28 April 2017 12.26 EDT Seated around a table in the dimly lit auditorium of Atlanta-based nonprofit Project South last weekend, two dozen union activists of all ages and races were trying to solve a problem – one that has vexed the southern states for a generation. Longshoremen from South Carolina, nurses from Florida, campus workers from Tennessee, public workers employees from North Carolina, and fast-food workers had gathered to discuss one issue: how could these members of the Southern Workers Assembly help a fellow union attempt to unionize a company scattered at dozens of locations across the south? It’s a growing problem for unions, and one their opponents are determined to make sure doesn’t get any easier. As the US economy – and particularly manufacturing – continues to expand in the south with the relocation of the auto industry, unions see big opportunities to recruit workers into the labor movement. However, they find themselves stymied by anti-union intimidation campaigns backed by big money that often include firing, intimidation and threats of plant closures if workers unionize. With that in mind, the first question posed to the group was one that union organizers across the south find themselves asking: how would they identify workers interested in joining a union at a particular company, and make them comfortable enough to get involved in union organizing? Many workers in the room suggest that they print union flyers and handbill the plant to gather contact information of sympathetic workers. However, some in the group worried that by targeting the company directly, they could scare potential supporters away. Then, a 20-year-old fast-food worker named Sha Drummond raised his hand. Thousands of Fight for 15 protesters rise up in 340 cities across the US Read more Drummond is new to the labor movement. A little more than a year ago, he was inspired to get involved in the Fight for $15 campaign to raise hourly wages for fast-food workers after he saw some union organizers kicked out of a fast-food restaurant where he worked in Richmond, Virginia. He has already helped organize several strikes and learned a tremendous amount about organizing through taking action. “We typically throw an event or house party and invite everyone,” said Drummond. “We just don’t invite people who work there, but we invite everyone in the community so that people know they have a lot of support. They know that people have their back.” Donald Quick, a longtime veteran of the North Carolina Public Service Workers Union UE Local 150, quickly suggested that perhaps they could use social media to identify workers to invite to the event. While Drummond and Quick are separated by many years, they have one thing in common: they are both part of unions that lack traditional collective bargaining rights, and they are willing to think outside the box about how to organize in the south. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A workshop organised by the Workers School by Southern Workers Assembly, hosted by Project South in Atlanta, promoting unionization. Photograph: Manzoor Cheema/Facebook Inspired by the energy of the Fight for $15 movement and the growing labor movement, workers involved in the Southern Workers Assembly are attempting to build the groundwork for a network to inspire a mass movement by non-union workers across the south. However, instead of focusing on winning one intensive campaign at a high-profile employer such as Boeing or Nissan, the assembly is instead focused on building a network of smaller minority unions that lack collective bargaining to create a groundswell of union support. “Having a union doesn’t mean you have to have a majority of workers or a union contract,” said veteran union organizer Saladin Muhammad, co-founder of the Southern Workers Assembly. “A union exists whenever workers come together to form an organization to build power.” At the outset of the American labor movement, before the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, minority unions were quite common. Small groups of workers would often band together to put pressure on the boss. They would work the company’s internal handbooks and grievance procedures, rally community and political support to put pressure on employers, engage in shop floor disobedience and, if all else failed, go out on strike to stick it to the boss. A union exists whenever workers come together to form an organization to build power Saladin Muhammad, co-founder of the Southern Workers Assembly Eventually, these networks of minority unions built up over decades led to the massive organizing gains they achieved in the 1930s. “Rebuilding the labor movement in the south is going to require us to get back to the basics of what a union is,” said Muhammad. “A union is about workers building power through organization.” However, after the mass organizing waves of the 1930s, unions largely struck to the traditional model of only representing workers in unions. This model of union organizing often relied on union representatives and labor lawyers to make sure union contracts were enforced. Now, with the success of the strikes of Fight for $15 in building a mass movement, unions in the south are once again beginning to experiment with minority unions – where workers voluntarily join, and pay dues, to their local union rather than the union representing the entire workforce at an employer. In 2014, after losing a high-profile union election at Volkswagen in Chattanooga, autoworkers there formed a minority union, Local 42. Following their lead, autoworkers at a Mercedes plant in Vance, Alabama, decided to form UAW Local 112, despite lacking a majority of workers in the plant who wanted to be members of the union. Even without collective bargaining rights, both unions have won changes in company policies through protests and legal action. More importantly, the unions have shown real power by getting activists who they feel were wrongfully fired their jobs back. Now the Southern Workers Assembly is hoping to link these new minority union efforts with other groups of non-union workers, as workers in the south face the uphill battle of rebuilding. The United Campus Workers (UCW) in Tennessee, an affiliate of Communication Workers of America, is one of those minority unions that has built power despite lacking traditional union rights. Fight for $15: meet the enfant terrible who turned minimum wage into a national battle Read more Originally formed in 1999 to fight for living wages for workers at the University of Tennessee, UCW has now grown into a full-fledged union despite lacking collective bargaining rights. The group has more than 2,000 members who pay monthly dues, which allows the union to have a small staff. It also enabled the UCW to hold training courses for union activists, organize rallies and lobby days, and campaign for state legislators who share their agenda of improving conditions for workers in the University of Tennessee system. Jessica Buttermore, an administration assistant at the University of Memphis, decided to join UCW after attending the union’s annual lobby day in Nashville five years ago. She said that at first when she got active, it was sometimes difficult to get people to voluntarily agree to pay monthly dues. However, after the union won a $3 across-the-board rise in minimum wage for campus workers two years ago, she says it has become a lot easier to get workers to feel ownership of their minority union. “If they see someone take action then talking about it, it encourages people,” says Buttermore. “For people to see that the work we are doing does have an effect, really encourages people to be involved.” For many involved in the Southern Workers School this weekend in Atlanta, rebuilding the labor movement is less about winning union elections and more about teaching workers about the power they have to effect change. “We gotta bring forces together who are not unionized to engage them in the labor movement,” says Muhammad. “When people think that the starting point for being in the labor movement is a union opposed to a worker organization that’s when we lose power. To organize the south, we must make people realize how much power they already have.” Mike Elk is a member of the Washington-Baltimore NewsGuild. He is the co-founder of Payday Report and was previously senior labor reporter at Politico.

Airbus SE, the European planemaker with production sites dotted around the continent, is concerned that Brexit will make it harder to shift workers between countries, hobbling decades of business practice at a manufacturer built on the free movement of people and goods. Airbus makes wings for all of its jets in the U.K. and operates multiple daily delivery flights from a Welsh factory to its base in Toulouse, France, and a second assembly line in Hamburg, as well as corporate shuttles for managers. Any curbs on travel once Britain leaves the European Union would make it harder to operate, said Klaus Richter, the company’s purchasing chief. “You can’t run this operation by breathing through a straw,” Richter, who also heads Germany’s aviation association, told journalists in Berlin. “That’s something that occupies us.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Airbus is a poster-child for successful European integration after France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. pooled large parts of their aerospace expertise to create a group which today competes on a global scale with Boeing Co. The company’s production method, whereby parts are built at facilities across Europe and sent to Toulouse or Hamburg for final assembly, allows it to manage work requirements more nimbly while granting workers time abroad. Restrictions on free movement are seen as an inevitable consequence of Brexit, with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May vowing to reduce net migration to below 100,000 a year. Key industries and services in Britain says the curbs mustn’t go too far, since they need a steady supply of foreign labor to fill posts that local people are unwilling to take or aren’t sufficiently qualified for. Vital Expertise Airbus employs more than 4,000 people at its Filton site near Bristol, mainly in wing design and manufacturing, while the Welsh facility at Broughton has 6,000-plus workers and churns out more than 1,000 wings a year, many of which are loaded onto massive Beluga transport planes for final assembly. The biggest A380 superjumbo wings are taken to a local seaport for shipping. Airbus also has final assembly lines in China and Alabama for its single-aisle aircraft, the company’s bread-and-butter products that compete with Boeing Co.’s 737 models. While some wing components are already made in Stade in northern Germany today, Britain is wary of guarding its expertise in making the vital parts. Airbus has invested heavily at its U.K. sites to accommodate a higher proportion of carbon components as the industry moves away from metal frames to lighter composite materials, Richter said. Watch Next: Here’s What Brexit Means for Airlines Here's What Brexit Means for Airlines Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders has voiced similar concerns, saying in February that the aerospace sector “will do what we can as an industry to take influence on both sides of the Channel.” He added that there are “a lot of industries who share this concern and who share this same approach as we do.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The president of the University of California, Santa Barbara’s chapter of Students Supporting Israel criticized both the announcement and the resolution itself on Wednesday. UCSB currently invests in companies like Hewlett-Packard, Raytheon, General Electric, Boeing, and others. These companies have also done business with the Israeli government in various capacities. Continuing to invest in them makes UCSB a “complicit third-party” to “human rights abuses” of the Palestinian people, the resolution reads. If the A.S. Senate were to pass the resolution, the university would divest its holdings from the companies. For years, senators at UCSB have tried — and failed — to pass divestment from companies that support the Israeli government. Resolutions similar to the latest one fell short of success in 2013, 2014, and 2015. A number of senator resignations during the 2015-16 school year forced SJP to reconsider trying another resolution, SJP member Anumita Kaur told The Bottom Line on Tuesday. This year, senators Unique Vance and Jonathan Lopez will bring divestment back to the table, and Kaur is confident it will be a success. “We have more ‘yes’ votes from the get-go than we have ever had before,” Kaur said of the current Senate. Kaur, a fourth year sociology major, campaigned heavily in support of previous attempts to divest.   She also said her organization aims to “divest to educate,” rather than “educate to divest.” What that means, she said, is that simply raising the topic allows more students to “sympathize with the struggle for Palestinian liberation.” Divestment came closest to passing in 2015. After hours of deliberation and hearing dozens of speakers at a packed Girvetz Hall, the senate arrived at a 12-12-1 deadlock. Internal Vice President Angela Lau broke the tie with a “no” vote, bringing SJP’s hopes to an end. Already, the latest resolution has drawn controversy after SJP posted an announcement Sunday night on its Facebook page, UCSB Divest. Sunday, Apr. 23 also marked the beginning of Yom HaShoah, Israel’s commemorative Holocaust Remembrance Day. “It’s the one day out of the whole year that is specifically dedicated to remembering the atrocities of the Holocaust,” said Nate Erez, president of the UCSB chapter of Students Supporting Israel. Though he said he “doesn’t have reason to believe” SJP’s timing was deliberate, he did say the group should issue an apology regardless. SJP issued a follow-up post Monday evening on Facebook, saying the scheduling decision was made to avoid interfering with students’ midterm exams and A.S. Elections. The group rejected the notion that the timing was anti-Semitic, calling the memorial day and divestment “separate issues.” “Whether intentional or not, to me, it doesn’t matter,” Erez told The Bottom Line on Wednesday. “It’s horrendously insensitive.” Erez, a fourth year economics and accounting major, said he would “love” the prospect of dialogue with SJP. He also said he welcomes the resolution itself, so he can publicly prove it is “intellectually dishonest.” Divestment from Israel has already passed at a number of nearby universities, including every other undergraduate campus in the UC system. SJP member Kaur said Tuesday that UCSB’s relatively unique position on divestment speaks to the “lack of real choices” in the A.S. elections. The movement behind divestment is “premised on love,” Kaur said. She hesitated to identify its detractors as the “opposition,” saying anti-divestment advocates misunderstand the movement’s basis in “humanity.” Criticizing Israel is not an anti-Semitic gesture, Erez said. But the resolution, as well as the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, is “unequivocally rooted in anti-Semitism,” he said. He alleged that the founders of the BDS movement want to deny the right of a Jewish state to exist in Palestine. Erez referred to a video in which BDS leader Omar Barghouti says no “rational Palestinian” would “ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine.” “We have to criticize Israel,” Erez said, “but do it honestly. Don’t hold a double standard. This is a two-sided issue. Don’t make it seem like one side is innocent and the other is wrong.”   UPDATE: April 27, 10:36 p.m.: An earlier version of this article included the sentence: “Erez said divestment from corporate American support of Israel is not an anti-Semitic gesture.” The line was included by mistake and the article has been updated for accuracy.

The company, whose customers include planemakers Boeing , Airbus and Bombardier, reported adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 157 million euros ($170.6 million), against average analyst expectations for 140 million euros. Its commercial maintenance business saw revenues rise 37 percent thanks to demand for services for the V2500 engines that power A320 jets, helping to lift the EBIT margin to 12.4 percent from 12 percent a year ago. It confirmed it expects revenues of 5.1 to 5.2 billion for 2017 and an operating margin stable at around last year's level of 10.6 percent. French rival Safran earlier this week reported higher then expected first quarter sales, also helped by aerospace services.

Thales said it will pay as much as $215 million for San Mateo, Calif.-based Guavus, a 250-person business with more than $30 million in expected 2017 sales. Boeing Co., the world's largest plane maker by deliveries, last year agreed with Microsoft Corp. to jointly work on data analysis tools for commercial aviation. British aircraft engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC signed a similar agreement with Microsoft. Thales, which makes items such as satellites, missiles, submarines and rail signaling equipment, has undertaken a string of technology deals. It acquired LiveTV in 2014 from JetBlue Airways Corp. to boost its in-flight entertainment portfolio and last year bought an optics business from Switzerland's Ruag Holding AG to augment its satellite activities. Guavus has some of the biggest U.S. telecommunications companies as its customers, Thales said, and handles about 5,000 terabytes of data a day, roughly the data of 3 million feature films. Philippe Keryer, Thales executive vice president for strategy, research and technology, said in an interview that the company plans to use Guavus's know-how in analyzing data in real-time across its products. The ability to rapidly sift through huge volumes of data could help intelligence analysts find key information in spy-satellite photos. The system should also make it easier to spot cybercrime by examining computer logs in real-time, Mr. Keryer said. Thales set out last year to expand its data analysis capability and evaluated several businesses for potential acquisition or partnerships. It opted for Guavus after running trials in real-world scenarios, Mr. Keryer said. The acquisition, which is scheduled to close in the third quarter pending regulatory approvals, would also help broaden the French company's overseas footprint. Guavus also has operations in Canada and India.

The U.S. Department of Energy, which is responsible for cleaning up the area, announced in January that remediation will not begin until this year or next, despite a 2010 agreement in which the agency committed to having the soil decontaminated by 2017. ACORN FILE PHOTO The state agency responsible for overseeing the removal of contamination at the Santa Susana Field Lab says the U.S. Department of Energy’s plans to remediate a highly controversial portion of the site does not comply with a 2010 cleanup agreement. The DOE released a draft environmental impact statement Jan. 6 outlining how it would like to clean up part of Area IV of the field lab, which was the site of a partial nuclear meltdown in 1959. Boeing Co. owns 80 percent of the 2,850-acre field lab, and the site is part of Boeing’s portion. The statement included goals to demolish and remove 18 structures in Area IV, remediate chemically contaminated soil and groundwater in the area and a buffer zone to the north, and restore the environment. But on April 14, Mohsen Nazemi, a spokesperson for the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, sent a letter to the DOE listing concerns with the federal agency’s statement. According to the letter, DOE’s statement lacks sufficient data to determine whether the proposed cleanup options would be feasible. Furthermore, the statement lacks solutions to overcome challenges in implementing cleanup requirements, Nazemi wrote. He also wrote in the letter that the DOE appears to be violating a legally binding agreement signed in 2010 by DTSC, DOE, NASA and Boeing, the agencies responsible for cleaning up the field lab in the southern hills of Simi Valley. Under the 2010 agreement, all detectable soil contamination was supposed to be cleaned up by this year and plans to remediate the groundwater were to be in place. Instead, DTSC officials said in January that cleanup will not begin until this year or next. “This (environmental statement) is inconsistent with the Department of Energy’s earlier statement describing the cleanup’s purpose and need,” Nazemi said in the letter. “Given this, we must reiterate that the (DTSC) will hold the (DOE) accountable for complying with the (2010 agreement).” A DTSC representative could not be reached for further comment as of press time Thursday. John Jones, a DOE spokesperson, declined to comment on Nazemi’s letter, saying only that the agency is “appreciative of comments” received during the feedback period, which ended April 13. “Going forward, DOE will evaluate and consider the comments as it prepares the final environmental impact statement,” Jones said in an email to the Simi Valley Acorn last week. “The comments DOE received during the comment period and responses to those comments will be available in the comment response document, a part of the final environmental impact statement regarding the future cleanup of the site.” Dan Hirsch, president of environmental group Committee to Bridge the Gap and one of many advocates in favor of a full SSFL cleanup to background standards (meaning all material unnatural to the site is removed), said the DTSC has “called out DOE for breaking its commitment to clean up all the radioactive and chemical contamination on its part of the property,” per the 2010 agreement. Hirsch asserts that DOE “now proposes to leave in place—not clean up—between 34 percent and 99 percent of the contaminated soil.” “The (2010) agreement is legally binding, and DTSC is DOE’s regulator,” he said. “DOE can’t unilaterally break the agreement.” Earlier this year, Jones told the Acorn that the DOE’s proposed remediation options do line up with the 2010 cleanup agreement. But in his letter, Nazemi said the data provided does not “sufficiently support” the agreement. “(DTSC) is committed to require that the Department of Energy comply . . . and the (DOE) must pursue solutions to achieve that compliance,” Nazemi said. “We look forward to working with the (DOE) in achieving the cleanup in a manner consistent and in compliance with the (agreement).” Hirsch said the matter of whether cleanup will occur now depends on DTSC enforcing prior agreements, which he alleges the DOE is trying to break. “The protection of the health of the people in the area around Santa Susana depends upon DTSC being forceful and successful in enforcing cleanup commitments,” he said.

IN A NUTSHELL The California Department of Toxic Substances Control will hold a meeting at 6:30 p.m. Tues., May 2 at the Rancho Santa Susana Community Center, 5005 E. Los Angeles Ave., Simi Valley, to highlight Santa Susana Field Lab activities from the past six months and talk about what to expect over the next six months. For more information, contact Marcia Rubin at (818) 717-6565 or marcia.rubin@dtsc.ca.gov. This story was updated April 28.

(Ryan Remiorz / THE CANADIAN PRESS) The Canadian Press Published Thursday, April 27, 2017 7:59PM EDT Bombardier is rejecting Boeing's claim in a complaint filed with the U.S. government that it has dumped its new CSeries commercial jet into the United States at below cost. In a statement, the Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer says it structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the countries where it operates. The Seattle-based rival petitioned the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It is calling for the Trump administration to issue an order against the sale of the plane in the important American market. The move comes days after the U.S. imposed preliminary duties of up to 24 per cent on softwood lumber imported from Canada. Boeing joins Brazil which filed a similar complaint with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer.

The launch will take place with a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States. No details were made public about the payload, known only as NROL-76, which was first announced last year. SpaceX shared a post on Twitter as well, regarding the launch. Static fire test complete.

The estimated cost is $300 million. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale on April 27, 2017. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has requested the possible sale of follow-on support for three (3) C-17 aircraft to include participation in the Global Reach Improvement Program, contract labor for Class I modifications and kits, in-country contractor support, alternate mission equipment, major modification and retrofit, software support, aircraft maintenance and technical support, support equipment, personnel training and training equipment, additional spare and repair parts, technical orders and publications, airworthiness certification support, engine logistics support, inspections, and other U.S. Government and contractor engineering, logistics and program support. The total estimated program cost is $300 million. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States (U.S.) by providing sustainment for three (3) C-17s operated by a consortium of twelve nations, including the U.S. This program flies missions in and around Europe, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Levant, and North Africa. This proposed sale will provide a similar readiness level for these C-17s as U.S.-operated C-17s. The current FMS case supporting these C-17s will expire on 20 September 2017. The proposed sale will advance U.S. and NATO policy goals of expanding the capabilities of strategic airlift to NATO allies and partners and sustain the ability to deploy in support of contingency operations outside of Europe. As the C-17 is a support asset, it would not affect the basic military balance in the region. NSPA will have no difficulty absorbing this support. The prime contractor will be the Boeing Corporation of Chicago, Illinois. There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to the NATO Support and Procurement Agency. There will be no adverse impact to U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal are authorized for release and export to the NSPA. This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded. All questions regarding this proposed Foreign Military Sale should be directed to the State Department's Bureau of Political Military Affairs, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, pm-cpa@state.gov. -30- NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

The estimated cost is $1.46 billion. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale on April 27, 2017. New Zealand has requested the potential sale of up to four (4) P-8A Patrol Aircraft. Each includes: commercial engines, Tactical Open Mission Software (TOMS), Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) MX-20HD, AN/AAQ-2(V)1 Acoustic System, AN/APY-10 Radar, ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures. Also included are eight (8) Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS); five (5) Guardian Laser Transmitter Assemblies (GLTA) for the AN/AAQ-24(V)N; five (5) System Processors for AN/AAQ-24(V)N; thirty (30) AN/AAR-54 Missile Warning Sensors for the AN/AAQ-24(V)N; ten (10) LN-251 with Embedded Global Positioning Systems (GPS)/Inertial Navigations Systems (EGIs); support equipment; operation support systems; maintenance trainer/classrooms; publications; software, engineering, and logistics technical assistance; foreign Liaison officer support, contractor engineering technical services; repair and return; transportation; aircraft ferry; and other associated training, support equipment and services. The total estimated cost is $1.46 billion. This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and national security of the United States by strengthening the security of a Major Non-NATO ally which has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability within the region. New Zealand is a close ally in the region and an important partner on critical foreign policy and defense issues. The Government of New Zealand intends to use these defense articles and services to continue its Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (MSA) capability, following retirement of its P-3K maritime patrol aircraft. The sale will strengthen collective defense and enhance New Zealand's regional and global allied contributions. New Zealand has procured and operated U.S. produced P-3 MSA for over 40 years, providing critical capabilities to NATO and coalition maritime operations. New Zealand has maintained a close MSA acquisition and sustainment relationship with the U.S. Navy over this period. The proposed sale will allow New Zealand to recapitalize, modernize and sustain its MSA capability for the next 30 years. As a long-time P-3 operator, New Zealand will have no difficulty transitioning its MSA force to the P-8A and absorbing these aircraft into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not alter the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractor will be The Boeing Company, Seattle, WA. Additional contractors include: Air Cruisers Co LLC Arnprior Aerospace, Canada AVOX Zodiac Aerospace BAE Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)/EMS Compass David Clark DLS/NiaSat, Carlsbad, CA DRS Exelis, McLean VA GC Micro, Petaluma, CA General Electric, UK Harris Joint Electronics Marin Baker Northrop Grumman Corp, Falls Church, VA Pole Zero, Cincinnati, OH Raytheon, Waltham, MA Raytheon, UK Rockwell Collins, Cedar Rapids, IA Spirit Aero, Wichita, KS Symmetries Telephonics, Farmingdale, NY Terma, Arlington, VA Viking WESCAM There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will require approximately five (5) contractor representatives to support the program in New Zealand. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded. All questions regarding this proposed Foreign Military Sale should be directed to the State Department's Bureau of Political Military Affairs, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, pm-cpa@state.gov. -30- NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark Standard & Poor's/TSX Composite climbed 79.66 points, or 0.51 percent to end the week at 15,586.13 points. All but one of the 10 sub-groups closed the trading day higher. The TSX Materials group, which consists of producers of gold, precious metals, and raw materials, was the biggest winner on the day, rising 1.85 percent following gains in gold and copper prices. The spot price of gold advanced 0.33 percent to 1,267.70 U.S. dollars an ounce, while a pound of copper ended the week at 2.5868 dollars, a 0.74 percent gain. Gold miners Kinross Gold Corporation, Yamana Gold Inc, and B2Gold Corp all closed the session ahead and among the top-30 traded stocks on the day, rising 2.81 percent, 2.23 percent, and 2.08 percent, respectively. Vancouver-based Detour Gold Corporation performed even better, rocketing 13.49 percent to 17.25 Canadian dollars (12.64 U.S. dollars) after posting better than expected first quarter results. The firm which operates a mine in North-Eastern Ontario ended the quarter with a reduction in debt, revenues of 163.7 million U.S. dollars and an adjusted net income of 10.5 million dollars. Information Technology stocks also had an impact, rising 1.17 percent on Friday. Toronto-based Constellation Software Inc shares rose 1.85 percent after posting a first quarter profit of 555 million U.S. dollars and adjusted net income balloon 51 percent. Shares closed at 624.33 Canadian dollars (457.38 U.S. dollars). Descartes Systems Group and CGI Group Inc also contributed with respective gains of 2.57 percent and 1.82 percent. The remaining groups that moved up during Friday's session were: Consumer Staples (0.91 percent), Health Care (0.85 percent), Energy (0.76 percent), Financial (0.34 percent), Consumer Discretionary (0.10 percent), and Telecommunications (0.08 percent). Energy closed ahead as the price of crude oil and natural gas both finished the week on a high note. A barrel of Brent for July delivery rose 0.39 percent to 51.85 U.S. dollars, while June natural gas futures on the on the New York Mercantile Exchange shot up 0.93 percent to 3.269 U.S. dollars per million British thermal units. Shares of Calgary-based Baytex Energy Corp and Crescent Point Energy Corp boosted 2.48 percent and 2.35 percent, each. Meanwhile, shares of Suncor Energy Inc, the largest crude oil producer in the country closed at 42.78 Canadian dollars (31.34 U.S. dollars), a 2.47 percent uplift. The TSX Financial group stabilized on the day after two consecutive days as the top laggard group. Home Capital Group Inc shares ticked up 0.25 percent to 8.04 Canadian dollars (5.89 U.S. dollars) after shares slipped nearly 65 percent on Wednesday followed by a 34 percent spike yesterday. Bank of Nova Scotia and Manulife Financial Corporation carried the group, advancing 0.76 percent and 0.46 percent, each. The lone group to lose ground on the day was Industrials, inching down 0.05 percent after plane and automobile maker Bombardier Inc was accused by rival Boeing for selling jets in the United States at below cost. The anti-dumping complaint to the U.S. government could see the Montreal-based firm face a lengthy investigation and hinder their ability to sell their C Series aircraft south of the border. As a result, shares of the firm dipped 4.09 percent to 2.11 Canadian dollars (1.55 U.S. dollars). The Canadian dollar retreated 0.14 cent to 0.7326 U.S. dollar.

About 10 minutes after launch, the tall portion of the rocket, known as the first stage, will power its engines and fly back toward Earth to make a controlled landing on solid ground at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral.

The California-based company, headed by internet entrepreneur Elon Musk, has already made several successful landings on solid ground and on platforms floating in the ocean. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 filed suit against the US Air Force, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX also has a pair of launch contracts coming up for the Air Force to send GPS satellites into orbit. If tomorrow's launch is postponed for any reason, another launch window opens on May 1.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — General Electric has received a more than two thirds of a billion dollar US Navy contract for 17 engine components of F/A-18 Super-Hornet and EA 18G Growler aircraft, the US Department of Defense announced. "General Electric [of] Lynn, Massachusetts is being awarded a $670.7 million… contract for repair, replacement and program support of 17 F414 engine components of F/A-18 E, F, and EA 18G aircrafts," the announcement stated on Friday. © Boeing Boeing Wins $50M to Extend Service Life of F-18 Super Hornet AircraftThe contract includes a three-year base period and one one-year optional period, which if exercised, will bring the contract value to $907 million, the Defense Department noted. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a comparison of the hugely expensive and controversial Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and the F/A-18 not long after President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. Around the same time, Boeing, the manufacturer of the F/A-18, circulated a document suggesting that the Navy had a "significant capability gaps against emerging threats" with the F-35, according to the Navy Times, and that updating the F/A-18 was more efficient that buying new F-35 jets. ...

About 10 minutes after launch, the tall portion of the rocket, known as the first stage, will power its engines and fly back toward Earth to make a controlled landing on solid ground at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral. The attempt is part of SpaceX's effort to make rocket parts recyclable, rather than jettisoning the costly components after each launch. The California-based company, headed by internet entrepreneur Elon Musk, has already made several successful landings on solid ground and on platforms floating in the ocean.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Two months ago, Mount Royal University experienced its deadliest plane crash in the aviation program’s history, but since then, the program has changed. The school voluntarily grounded its remaining two Tecnam P2006T aircrafts following the crash but it may never use them again. “We might not. We want to make sure that we the best resources for the school,” said Leon Cygman, chair of Mount Royal University’s (MRU) Aviation program. Story continues below Related Pilot killed in MRU plane crash remembered for dedication to his family Wreckage removed from Calgary plane crash site as loved ones mourn loss of pilots Memorial service at Mount Royal to honour instructor killed in plane crash Tecnam planes grounded after fatal Mount Royal University plane crash near Calgary Jeff Bird, Reynold Johnson identified as Mount Royal University pilots killed in plane crash near Calgary “We’re actively looking to find another twin [engine aircraft] to see what it would be like, and how it would fit in our program.” READ MORE: Pilot killed in MRU plane crash remembered for dedication to his family Jeff Bird and Reyn Johnson were killed when the twin-engine Tecnam they were flying went down about 30 minutes into an instructional flight northwest of Calgary on Feb. 13. They were both experienced pilots and both had been with the MRU program for less than six months. MRU is in the process of test flying other alternatives to the Tecnams, and is in the final stages of signing a lease agreement for a pair of twin-engine planes. Cygman said one important consideration for choosing a new aircraft is the near-mountain climate. “We’re actively looking to find another twin to see what it would be like, and how it would fit in our program,” Cygman said. The school also has five single-engine Cessna 172s in its fleet, and some students plan to fly throughout the summer to make up for lost time. The program was put on hold for a couple of weeks following the Feb. 13 crash, before students gradually returned to the air. “It’s a little bit tighter now. Some of us are getting less flights now because we have less planes available now, technically,” said 19-year-old Nick Blonski, a first-year aviation student. READ MORE: Wreckage removed from Calgary plane crash site as loved ones mourn loss of pilots Blonski took a Global News crew for a flight and explained what it was like the first time back in the air following the crash: “When I went up, I didn’t really feel anything different at all. I just started up the plane — did what I’ve been trained to do.” MRU has also hired three new instructor pilots. “We recently hired people who are newly minted instructors and two people with 10,000 hours experience,” Cygman said. The Transportation Safety Board (TSB) continues to investigate the crash but said the absence of a cockpit voice recorder will make it challenging. The Tecnam involved was not required to carry a voice or data recorder, according to Canadian laws. MRU is also doing its own internal review into the crash. “There’s always stuff that you don’t anticipate or you don’t expect, and that’s how most of us feel about this incident,” Juan Aragon Franssen, an MRU instructor said. He’s been with the program for four years. “That’s a reality of aviation. There are a thousand factors that we deal with everyday.” WATCH BELOW: The crash that killed two Mount Royal University instructor pilots hasn’t seemed to deter prospective students as applications are up 30 per cent. Kim Smith explains.  High demand for pilots: The crash hasn’t deterred students from getting back up in the air and hasn’t seemed to deter prospective pilots. “Everyone has returned back to the air and if anything, they’re more determined to complete their program,” Cygman said. Over the next 20 years, North America will need 112,000 new pilots, according to the Boeing long-term market outlook, and 617,000 new pilots will be needed worldwide. READ MORE: Tecnam planes grounded after fatal Mount Royal University plane crash near Calgary “The regional airlines, namely Jazz and Westjet — there’s a huge demand for pilots in that area. The reason is the larger airlines, like Air Canada, are drawing from the small regions,” Cygman said. The MRU aviation program has received more than 130 applications for enrolment in September, which is about 30 per cent more than last year. “It’s the most I’ve seen since I’ve been with Mount Royal,” Cygman said. He’s been with the program since 2012. “There’s such a high demand for pilots these days, that I feel like getting a job right now would be easier than it ever was before, in the history of aviation,” Blonski said. “Right now, there’s just endless opportunities out there.” Aragon Franssen said when he became a pilot about 13 years ago, it was challenging to land a job. “You were expected to either work on the ground or fuel airplanes or do other shores to prove or build your time.

No details were made public about the payload, known only as NROL-76, which was first announced last year. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is poised to blast NROL-76 into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida during a two-hour launch window which opens Sunday at 7am (7pm Singapore time). About 10 minutes after launch, the tall portion of the rocket, known as the first stage, will power its engines and fly back toward Earth to make a controlled landing on solid ground at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral. The attempt is part of SpaceX's effort to make rocket parts recyclable, rather than jettisoning the costly components after each launch. The California-based company, headed by internet entrepreneur Elon Musk, has already made several successful landings on solid ground and on platforms floating in the ocean. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 filed suit against the US Air Force, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX also has a pair of launch contracts coming up for the Air Force to send GPS satellites into orbit. If Sunday's launch is postponed for any reason, another launch window opens on May 1.

Xiamen Airlines vice president Hu Nan said late Thursday the first airline company in China to operate as a modern enterprise will fly to Kalibo two to three times weekly. “We are just addressing commercial terms and we will have an inaugural flight this coming June,” Hu told nine journalists from Southeast Asian countries invited by the Chinese Foreign Ministry to tour this province in a bid to remind the world of the Maritime Silk Route that made China famous, particularly its pristine ceramic products. Xiamen Airlines, which is based in this city, currently flies to Manila and Cebu with no less than 67 flights weekly. “We want to add more flights to Manila but the traffic is heavy and we can’t get slots anymore,” Hu said, adding that Chinese-Filipinos who have relatives in the province are their frequent fliers. Xiamen Airlines operates the largest all-Boeing fleet in China and now services as far as Australia, Vancouver (Canada), and various cities in Europe. It is the preferred airline of Chinese passengers, particularly those visiting Singapore and the rest of the Southeast Asian nations. It has total assets of 40 billion RMB ($5.8 billion, P290.36 billion) and net assets of 16 billion RMB. “We are increasing our clientele by transforming our Xiamen airport into a transit hub to America, including Vancouver. So far, many Filipinos are making this as transit hub, including seafarers,” Han said. At present, Xiamen Airlines has 11 destinations in Southeast Asia, and six international destinations. By 2020, it will have 286 aircraft, 15 of which will be wide-body airplanes. Han said Xiamen Airlines has the longest continuous operating profit record of any non-government-owned airline company in China and is the only local company to achieve 30 consecutive profitable years. He added that they are considering Clark International Airport as an alternative but they realized it is too expensive to maintain two airports at this time with the same clients. Other cities in Fujian Province where Xiamen Airlines operates flights to Manila include Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou. Share. Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Email loading...

Gallegos in News on Apr 28, 2017 1:00 pm Boeing (Photo by Seth Anderson via the Chicagoist Featured Photos pool on Flickr) A new study reveals that profitable corporations—many extremely profitable—have been paying fewer and fewer state taxes around the country, all while corporate profits soar. In Illinois, a state that has been suffering from a budget impasse for nearly two years, some companies pay next to nothing for the privilege of doing business in the state. The Institute on Economic Taxation and State Policy released a report that looks at how much profitable Fortune 500 pay in taxes, including state and federal taxes. The group looked at 258 companies specifically who suffered no losses from 2008 to 2015—in other words the most consistently profitable companies. Though companies are supposed to pay a 35% federal income tax, as a whole these profitable companies paid 21.2% thanks to loopholes and deductions. It's even worse at the state level. The report breaks down just how much (or little) these major corporations pay in each state. States have been racing to the bottom to try to attract corporations to their state, and as a result businesses are paying fewer taxes in states during a time of record corporate profits. On average, the state corporate tax rate is 6.25%, but these profitable companies paid just 2.9% of their profits. From 1986 to 2013, state and local corporate tax rates declined 30%, the report says. And yet states continue to compete with one another to offer tax giveaways to corporations. The report looks into 17 companies headquartered in Illinois and finds that some of the biggest companies are paying very little. Take Boeing, which has earned over $40 billion in profits during the period studied—and only paid 0.1% of that to Illinois. This comes at a time that some of the most vulnerable in the state—people with disabilities, the homelessness, opioid addicts, rape victims, low-income seniors—are watching their safety net being slashed. (And in the meantime, Illinois homeowners are paying higher property rates than anyone except New Jersey homeowners.) We should maybe stop pretending IL is a miserable place for businesses and talk about how tough it is for social service agencies. https://t.co/zJIjxF5Jeo— Scott Smith (@ourmaninchicago) April 28, 2017 You can see just how much Illinois' most profitable corporations are paying in this graph created by The Institute on Economic Taxation and State Policy: Illinois corporate tax rate by company (The Institute on Economic Taxation and State Policy) Taxes have been in the national news a lot lately, thanks to President Trump failing to show his tax returns while stumping for a reform effort that many say amounts to a giveaway for the extremely wealthy.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index advanced 79.66 points to 15,586.13, with gold and mining firms among the biggest gainers of the day. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. shares gained more than 10.5 per cent or $6.21 after the company outperformed analyst expectations in its first quarter. The results were released after markets closed Thursday.

He added that Detour Gold Corp., which also posted its first quarter results after Thursday's markets closed, helped boost the index. The gold producer's shares rose nearly 13.5 per cent or $2.05. Offsetting the gains, Saskatoon-based Cameco Corp. shed $1.19 or 8.33 per cent after the uranium producer reported a bigger-than-expected loss in its first quarter. In New York, markets ended lower after the U.S. Department of Commerce reported GDP grew by 0.7 per cent in the first three months of the year — its poorest performance for the quarter in three years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.82 points to 20,940.51, the S&P 500 index shed 4.57 points to 2,384.20, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 1.33 points to 6,047.61 "It's just kind of taking a bit of the wind out of the sails, I think," Scott said of the weak economic report. But, he added, first quarter GDP reports generally come in weaker than the rest of the year. Wall Street, however, was buoyed by strong earnings from technology firms. Shares of Google's parent company Alphabet and Amazon rose 3.63 and 0.72 per cent, respectively, after their most recent quarterly earnings releases. The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, declined 0.14 of a U.S. cent to 73.26 cents U.S. in what Scott called "a tough environment for the Canadian dollar," as the United States is ratcheting up its protectionist trade rhetoric. In commodities, the June crude contract rose 36 cents to $49.33 U.S. per barrel, while the June gold contract gained $2.40 to $1,268.30 an ounce. June natural gas gained 3.7 cents to about $3.28 per mmBTU and July copper advanced about 1.5 cents to roughly $2.61 a pound.

Gold miner Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd surged 9.3 percent to C$64.54 after beating profit and revenue estimates and upping its production forecast after the bell on Thursday. The broader materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 2.3 percent, with gold and copper prices both moving higher. The energy group climbed 1.5 percent as oil prices rose from a one-month low, with Suncor Energy Inc, the country's largest oil and gas producer, up 2.2 percent to C$42.65. Suncor posted a profit beat late on Wednesday and said it planned to buy back shares. At 11:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index rose 93.57 points, or 0.6 percent, to 15,600.04. Eight of its 10 main sectors gained. The index is on track to end flat over the course of the week. The most influential weights on the index included Cameco Corp, which fell 7.5 percent to C$13.21 after the world's second-biggest uranium producer posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, partly hurt by the termination of a contract by the operator of Japan's wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant. Bombardier Inc also fell, down 4.1 percent to C$2.11 after Boeing asked the U.S. government to investigate alleged subsidies and unfair pricing of the Canadian planemaker's new CSeries airplane. Beleagured alternative mortgage lender Home Capital Group fell 2.1 percent to C$7.85 as depositors withdrew more cash, from savings accounts that help fund its mortgage book, although the pace of exits had slowed. "It may be a great buying opportunity for someone, either on the long side or outright as an acquisition, but you got to know what's in that book, said John Stephenson, president at Stephenson & Company Capital Management. The financials group gained 0.6 percent. The Canadian economy stalled in February after a healthy start to the year but is still on track to meet and possibly exceed the Bank of Canada's forecast for first-quarter annualized growth, analysts said.

The company completed a static test fire of the rocket April 25. Credit: SpaceX CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — SpaceX is preparing to launch a classified spacecraft into orbit on a Falcon 9 rocket for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on Sunday (April 30), breaking United Launch Alliance's 10-year monopoly on launching U.S. military and national security satellites.  The rocket is slated to lift off between 7 and 9 a.m. EDT (1100 to 1300 GMT) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The launch will mark the fifth of more than 20 Falcon 9 rockets slated to fly this year.  SpaceX will attempt to land the rocket's first stage just south of the NASA spaceport at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, where three boosters have successfully touched down after dispatching spacecraft into orbit. [SpaceX Launches from Historic Launch Pad 39A (Video)] A month ago, SpaceX launched one of its previously flown rockets for the first time, a key step in company founder and chief engineer Elon Musk's quest to slash launch costs.  SpaceX battled for years to win the right to compete for the military's launch business, ultimately suing the Air Force, its prospective customer, to break United Launch Alliance's monopoly. United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, has flown nearly all of the country's major military and national security spacecraft since its formation in December 2006. In addition to the upcoming NRO mission, which the agency disclosed last year, SpaceX has won two launch contracts from the Air Force to put GPS-3 satellites into orbit. ULA did not bid for the first contract, which was awarded last year, and lost to SpaceX for the second, which was awarded last month.  In an effort to foster competition and lower prices, the Air Force told reporters last month that it intends to solicit bids for as many as 13 more launches. ULA's exclusive $11 billion, block-buy contract with the military (a single contract covering a bulk of core launch vehicles) is scheduled to end in 2019. SpaceX and the NRO have not disclosed what is being carried aboard the Falcon 9 rocket slated to fly on Sunday, nor the exact launch time. SpaceX conducted a routine test fire of the rocket's first stage on Tuesday.  Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+. Original article on Space.com.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index advanced 79.66 points to 15,586.13, with gold and mining firms among the biggest gainers of the day. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (TSX:AEM) shares gained more than 10.5 per cent or $6.21 after the company outperformed analyst expectations in its first quarter. The results were released after markets closed Thursday. "That's a big driver today," said Ian Scott, equity analyst at Manulife Asset Management. He added that Detour Gold Corp. (TSX:DGC), which also posted its first quarter results after Thursday's markets closed, helped boost the index. The gold producer's shares rose nearly 13.5 per cent or $2.05. Offsetting the gains, Saskatoon-based Cameco Corp. (TSX:CCO) shed $1.19 or 8.33 per cent after the uranium producer reported a bigger-than-expected loss in its first quarter. In New York, markets ended lower after the U.S. Department of Commerce reported GDP grew by 0.7 per cent in the first three months of the year — its poorest performance for the quarter in three years. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.82 points to 20,940.51, the S&P 500 index shed 4.57 points to 2,384.20, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 1.33 points to 6,047.61 "It's just kind of taking a bit of the wind out of the sails, I think," Scott said of the weak economic report. But, he added, first quarter GDP reports generally come in weaker than the rest of the year. Wall Street, however, was buoyed by strong earnings from technology firms. Shares of Google's parent company Alphabet and Amazon rose 3.63 and 0.72 per cent, respectively, after their most recent quarterly earnings releases. The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, declined 0.14 of a U.S. cent to 73.26 cents US in what Scott called "a tough environment for the Canadian dollar," as the United States is ratcheting up its protectionist trade rhetoric. In commodities, the June crude contract rose 36 cents to US$49.33 per barrel, while the June gold contract gained $2.40 to US$1,268.30 an ounce. June natural gas gained 3.7 cents to about US$3.28 per mmBTU and July copper advanced about 1.5 cents to roughly US$2.61 a pound. — With files from The Associated Press   Follow @AleksSagan on Twitter.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 28 Apr 2017 05:51PM (Updated: 28 Apr 2017 06:44PM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail New York: U.S. stocks ticked lower on Wednesday following two sessions of strong gains as strong corporate earnings were offset by uncertainty over the feasibility of a proposed business tax cut. The proposal from the Trump administration slashes tax rates for businesses and on overseas corporate profits returned to the country. It offered no specifics on how it would be paid for without increasing the deficit. "A lot to digest on the tax side and to be honest we don’t have a lot of details at this point aside from just a few bullet points from the press conference," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas in New York. "This is going to be a bit of an uphill fight to get this plan enacted into law." The expectation of a corporate tax cut was partly behind the rally in U.S. stocks since the November election of Donald Trump. The market stalled over the last several weeks as the administration has failed to score a major legislative victory, Republican majorities in the House and Senate notwithstanding. Advertisement The S&P 500 traded above its record closing high throughout the day, however. Some analysts say even though tax reform would be a major boost to stocks, economic and earnings growth are enough to support current market levels. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 11.8 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,975.09, the S&P 500 lost 1.16 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,387.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.27 point to 6,025.23. Despite the tick lower, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.62-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The tax proposal includes a cut on so-called pass-through business taxes that would deliver a windfall to investors in MLPs, master limited partnerships. Among stocks, United Technologies rose 1.1 percent to US$118.20 and provided the biggest boost to the Dow industrials after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations helped by higher sales in all four of its business units. "Earnings are very strong, you could see a 15 percent year-on-year growth on the S&P," said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions at Voya Investment Management in New York.

Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he will not hesitate to change course again and pull the plug on the North American Free Trade Agreement if the negotiations become "unserious." His comments came at the end of a long 24 hours during which Ottawa and Mexico City were whipsawed over the Trump administration's intentions over the 23-year-old trade pact. "You know I was really ready and psyched to terminate NAFTA," Trump said. He decided that it would be better to terminate the trade deal after hearing about Wisconsin farmers' struggles with new Canadian dairy rules that were shutting out their milk protein exports. "You saw that, you wrote about it," Trump said. "And I said I’ve had it. I’ve had it." But after administration officials said a withdrawal order was being prepared, Trump said he received phone calls from Mexican Presdent Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking to renegotiate the pact. "I’m not looking to hurt Canada and I’m not looking to hurt Mexico. They’re two countries I really like," Trump said. "So they asked to renegotiate, and I said yes." News of the possible U.S. pullout from NAFTA rattled financial markets on Wednesday. Relative calm returned on Thursday after Trump's comments, and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.86% against the U.S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar was flat versus the greenback. Related Donald TrumpLarry King on 35 Years of Knowing Donald Trump: “His Ego is Beyond Egoism” Donald Trump Larry King on 35 Years of Knowing Donald Trump: “His Ego is Beyond Egoism” Mexico, Canada and the United States form one of the world's biggest trading blocs, and trade disruptions among them could adversely affect farm, automotive, energy and other sectors in all three countries. NAFTA removed most trade and tariff barriers between the neighbors, but Trump and other critics have blamed it for deep U.S. job cuts. Trump campaigned for president last year on a pledge to pull out of NAFTA if he could not renegotiate better terms. The United States went from running a small goods trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63-billion deficit in 2016. Asked by Reuters what would make NAFTA a fair deal, Trump said: "Open markets. Open borders for trade" and "Fairness, no government subsidies so that it makes it impossible for our people to compete." He added that if the NAFTA negotiations "become unserious, I will terminate." As Trump spoke, a new trade irritant between the United States and Canada emerged, as Boeing (ba) asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged price dumping and unfair Canadian government subsidies for Bombardier's new Canadian-made CSeries jetliners. 'Get to Work' Trudeau told a news conference in Saskatchewan he had urged Trump not to withdraw from the trade pact and warned that doing so "would cause a lot of short- and medium-term pain." "That's not something that either one of us would want, so we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve NAFTA," Trudeau said. Canada sends 75% of its exports to the United States. On Tuesday, Trump said he did not fear a trade war with Canada, a day after his administration moved to impose tariffs on Canadian lumber. In Mexico City, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Pena Nieto had called Trump on Wednesday and spoken with him for about 20 minutes in a conversation focused exclusively on the looming talks over NAFTA's "renegotiation and modernization." Trump has accused Mexico of luring away American factories and jobs with cheap labor and other advantages enabled by NAFTA. During the presidential campaign he accused Mexico of sending rapists and criminals into the United States, and as president plans a U.S.-Mexico border wall. One of Trump's first major acts after becoming president in January was to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiated by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Several agriculture lobby groups in Washington were told U.S Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, met with Trump on Wednesday evening to dissuade him from withdrawing from NAFTA. American Soybean Association President Ron Moore said, "When you're talking about $3 billion in soybean exports a year, any threats to withdraw from agreements and walk away from markets makes farmers extremely nervous." Formal NAFTA talks likely will not get started until August. The U.S. Trade Representative's office must first send Congress a notice that starts a 90-day consultation period preceding any negotiations. A USTR spokeswoman said the notice would not be sent until the Senate confirmed Trump's nominee for trade representative, Robert Lighthizer.

Official data shows that aircraft and parts imports dropped to Sh7.7 billion last year, down from Sh83 billion in 2015 last year and Sh129.5 billion in 2014. The troubled national carrier Kenya Airways (KQ) #ticker:KQ and government are the main drivers of aircraft import bill given their big-ticket purchases compared to individuals and corporate bodies. Kenyan military and police have in recent years also been keen to upgrade their fleet in the fight against emerging threats like terrorism. But Kenya Airways financial woes has largely to blame for the shrinking aircraft and parts orders. The national carrier is battling a financial storm, and has been reducing its fleet, selling land and cutting jobs to recover from losses caused by a slump in tourism and the cost of renewing its fleet. The carrier’s pre-tax losses narrowed to Sh4.73 billion in the six months to September, from Sh11.86 billion in a similar period a year ago.  Also Read Economy & PoliticsCounty staff pay beats civil servants, teachers Economy & PoliticsSh320m needed to battle armyworms Economy & PoliticsKenya seeks to revive trade ties with Ghana KQ in November 2915 added to its fleet two B787-8 planes worth Sh22.4 billion each, marking the last of a batch of nine orders from American manufacturer Boeing put in 2006. The carrier has halted aircraft purchases and is instead leasing and selling some of its planes in cost-cutting and cash raising plan. This brings to a halt the fleet expansion plan that saw the carrier increase its fleet size by double digits in the years to 2012, and with it falls imports of planes and spare parts. While the number of registered aircraft in Kenya grew by a third in the past five years to 2014 to 1,268, KQ has accounted for larger share of the planes and parts import bills.

(REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory President Donald Trump told Reuters on Thursday that he was “psyched” to terminate the NAFTA trade deal with Canada and Mexico, but changed his mind after their leaders asked for it to be renegotiated instead. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he will not hesitate to change course again and pull the plug on the North American Free Trade Agreement if the negotiations become “unserious.” His comments came at the end of a long 24 hours during which Ottawa and Mexico City were whipsawed over the Trump administration’s intentions over the 23-year-old trade pact. “You know I was really ready and psyched to terminate NAFTA,” Trump said. He decided that it would be better to terminate the trade deal after hearing about Wisconsin farmers’ struggles with new Canadian dairy rules that were shutting out their milk protein exports. “You saw that, you wrote about it,” Trump said. “And I said I’ve had it. I’ve had it.” But after administration officials said a withdrawal order was being prepared, Trump said he received phone calls from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking to renegotiate the pact. “I’m not looking to hurt Canada and I’m not looking to hurt Mexico. They’re two countries I really like,” Trump said. “So they asked to renegotiate, and I said yes.” News of the possible U.S. pullout from NAFTA rattled financial markets on Wednesday. Relative calm returned on Thursday after Trump’s comments, and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.86 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar was flat versus the greenback. Mexico, Canada and the United States form one of the world’s biggest trading blocs, and trade disruptions among them could adversely affect farm, automotive, energy and other sectors in all three countries. NAFTA removed most trade and tariff barriers between the neighbors, but Trump and other critics have blamed it for deep U.S. job cuts. Trump campaigned for president last year on a pledge to pull out of NAFTA if he could not renegotiate better terms. The United States went from running a small goods trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63-billion deficit in 2016. Asked by Reuters what would make NAFTA a fair deal, Trump said: “Open markets. Open borders for trade” and “Fairness, no government subsidies so that it makes it impossible for our people to compete.” He added that if the NAFTA negotiations “become unserious, I will terminate.” As Trump spoke, a new trade irritant between the United States and Canada emerged, as Boeing Co asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged price dumping and unfair Canadian government subsidies for Bombardier Inc’s new Canadian-made CSeries jetliners. ‘GET TO WORK’ Trudeau told a news conference in Saskatchewan he had urged Trump not to withdraw from the trade pact and warned that doing so “would cause a lot of short- and medium-term pain.” “That’s not something that either one of us would want, so we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve NAFTA,” Trudeau said. Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States. On Tuesday, Trump said he did not fear a trade war with Canada, a day after his administration moved to impose tariffs on Canadian lumber. In Mexico City, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Pena Nieto had called Trump on Wednesday and spoken with him for about 20 minutes in a conversation focused exclusively on the looming talks over NAFTA’s “renegotiation and modernization.” Trump has accused Mexico of luring away American factories and jobs with cheap labor and other advantages enabled by NAFTA. During the presidential campaign he accused Mexico of sending rapists and criminals into the United States, and as president plans a U.S.-Mexico border wall. One of Trump’s first major acts after becoming president in January was to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiated by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Several agriculture lobby groups in Washington were told U.S Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, met with Trump on Wednesday evening to dissuade him from withdrawing from NAFTA. American Soybean Association President Ron Moore said, “When you’re talking about $3 billion in soybean exports a year, any threats to withdraw from agreements and walk away from markets makes farmers extremely nervous.” Formal NAFTA talks likely will not get started until August. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office must first send Congress a notice that starts a 90-day consultation period preceding any negotiations. A USTR spokeswoman said the notice would not be sent until the Senate confirmed Trump’s nominee for trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. (Additional reporting by Stephen J.

Why, you announce a tax cut! And in your self-absorbed way, you announce a tax cut that will hugely benefit yourself. Imagine those millions saved! You feel better already! I’m deeply skeptical that President Donald Trump will manage to get a tax reform package passed into law, and that’s just as well. Trump’s new tax “plan” (more like an extremely vague plan for a plan) is an irresponsible, shameless, budget-busting gift to zillionaires like himself. This isn’t about “jobs,” as the White House claims. If it were, it might cut employment taxes, which genuinely do discourage hiring. Rather, it’s about huge payouts to the wealthiest Americans — and deficits be damned! If Republicans embrace this “plan” after all their hand-wringing about deficits and debt, we should build a Grand Monument to Hypocrisy in their honor. Trump’s tax “plan” is a betrayal of his voters. He talks of helping ordinary Americans even as he enriches tycoons like himself. For example, it’s great that the tax plan promises help with child care costs, a huge burden for low-income families, especially single moms. But Trump doesn’t explain what form his help will take. Maybe he will eventually provide details, but in his campaign tax plan (which overall seems similar to the latest), fewer than 10 percent of low-income households with children would get anything at all, according to a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in February. It added that under the campaign plan, families earning between $10,000 and $30,000 a year would receive an average child care benefit of just $10. In fairness, Trump’s proposal does include some sensible elements. Raising the standard deduction is smart and would simplify everything, reducing cheating and the need for record-keeping because millions of filers would no longer itemize deductions. But the heart of Trump’s “plan” is to lower taxes for corporations and the affluent. It would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, without which Trump would have paid less than 4 percent in taxes for 2005; with it, he paid 25 percent. Conservatives emphasize that the official top corporate tax rate in the U.S. is too high, and they have a point. The top rate for American corporations — almost 39 percent, including a 35 percent federal rate and a bit more for the average state rate — is among the highest in the world, according to the Tax Foundation. Yet that’s deeply misleading, because most companies don’t pay that rate. The Government Accountability Office found that two-thirds of active corporations paid no federal tax. Even large, profitable corporations paid an average federal rate of only 14 percent — and Boeing, Verizon, General Electric and Priceline paid no federal income tax over a five-year period, according to Citizens for Tax Justice. There’ve been many studies showing that the U.S. effective marginal rate for corporations is in the same ballpark as in other industrialized countries (some say it’s a bit lower, others a bit higher). So, sure, let’s lower the official corporate tax rate while reducing loopholes, but don’t pretend this will create a ton of new jobs. Where the tax plan would have a big impact is in empowering some very wealthy people, because of another bit of chicanery in the proposal: Trump apparently would allow some business owners to dodge personal income tax by paying at the much lower corporate rate. In other words, tycoons would try to structure their incomes to pay not at a 39.6 percent top personal rate but at a 15 percent corporate rate. This isn’t tax policy; it’s a heist. Then there’s the elimination of the estate tax. The White House talks solemnly about protecting family farms and other businesses, but give us a break! The estate tax now affects only couples worth more than $11 million. About one-fifth of 1 percent of Americans are affected — but the estate tax does limit the rise of inequality and assures a hint of fairness, since much of the wealth in rich estates has never been taxed at all. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Trump’s tax “plan” would be paid for partly “with growth” — which means that he has no idea how to pay for it. The Tax Policy Center examined Trump’s campaign tax plan and found it would cause the federal debt to rise by at least $7 trillion in the first decade, and more than $20 trillion by 2036 — slowing growth, not raising it. To put the latter number in perspective, that’s additional borrowing of about $160,000 per American household. Effectively, we’d borrow from China or other countries to finance huge tax breaks for Trump and his minions. And this is populism? Nicholas Kristof is a columnist for The New York Times.

Trump said in an interview with Reuters that he will not hesitate to change course again and pull the plug on the North American Free Trade Agreement if the negotiations become "unserious." His comments came at the end of a long 24 hours during which Ottawa and Mexico City were whipsawed over the Trump administration's intentions over the 23-year-old trade pact. "You know I was really ready and psyched to terminate NAFTA," Trump said. He decided that it would be better to terminate the trade deal after hearing about Wisconsin farmers' struggles with new Canadian dairy rules that were shutting out their milk protein exports. "You saw that, you wrote about it," Trump said. "And I said I´ve had it. I´ve had it." But after administration officials said a withdrawal order was being prepared, Trump said he received phone calls from Mexican Presdent Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asking to renegotiate the pact. "I´m not looking to hurt Canada and I´m not looking to hurt Mexico. They´re two countries I really like," Trump said. "So they asked to renegotiate, and I said yes." News of the possible U.S. pullout from NAFTA rattled financial markets on Wednesday. Relative calm returned on Thursday after Trump's comments, and the Mexican peso strengthened 0.86 percent against the U.S. dollar, while the Canadian dollar was flat versus the greenback. Mexico, Canada and the United States form one of the world's biggest trading blocs, and trade disruptions among them could adversely affect farm, automotive, energy and other sectors in all three countries. NAFTA removed most trade and tariff barriers between the neighbors, but Trump and other critics have blamed it for deep U.S. job cuts. Trump campaigned for president last year on a pledge to pull out of NAFTA if he could not renegotiate better terms. The United States went from running a small goods trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63-billion deficit in 2016. Asked by Reuters what would make NAFTA a fair deal, Trump said: "Open markets. Open borders for trade" and "Fairness, no government subsidies so that it makes it impossible for our people to compete." He added that if the NAFTA negotiations "become unserious, I will terminate." As Trump spoke, a new trade irritant between the United States and Canada emerged, as Boeing Co asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged price dumping and unfair Canadian government subsidies for Bombardier Inc's new Canadian-made CSeries jetliners. 'GET TO WORK' Trudeau told a news conference in Saskatchewan he had urged Trump not to withdraw from the trade pact and warned that doing so "would cause a lot of short- and medium-term pain." "That's not something that either one of us would want, so we agreed that we could sit down and get to work on looking at ways to improve NAFTA," Trudeau said. Canada sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States. On Tuesday, Trump said he did not fear a trade war with Canada, a day after his administration moved to impose tariffs on Canadian lumber. In Mexico City, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Pena Nieto had called Trump on Wednesday and spoken with him for about 20 minutes in a conversation focused exclusively on the looming talks over NAFTA's "renegotiation and modernization." Trump has accused Mexico of luring away American factories and jobs with cheap labor and other advantages enabled by NAFTA. During the presidential campaign he accused Mexico of sending rapists and criminals into the United States, and as president plans a U.S.-Mexico border wall. One of Trump's first major acts after becoming president in January was to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiated by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Several agriculture lobby groups in Washington were told U.S Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, confirmed by the Senate on Monday, met with Trump on Wednesday evening to dissuade him from withdrawing from NAFTA.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark Standard & Poor's/TSX Composite climbed 79.66 points, or 0.51 percent to end the week at 15,586.13 points. All but one of the 10 sub-groups closed the trading day higher. The TSX Materials group, which consists of producers of gold, precious metals, and raw materials, was the biggest winner on the day, rising 1.85 percent following gains in gold and copper prices. The spot price of gold advanced 0.33 percent to 1,267.70 U.S. dollars an ounce, while a pound of copper ended the week at 2.5868 dollars, a 0.74 percent gain. Gold miners Kinross Gold Corporation, Yamana Gold Inc, and B2Gold Corp all closed the session ahead and among the top-30 traded stocks on the day, rising 2.81 percent, 2.23 percent, and 2.08 percent, respectively. Vancouver-based Detour Gold Corporation performed even better, rocketing 13.49 percent to 17.25 Canadian dollars (12.64 U.S. dollars) after posting better than expected first quarter results. The firm which operates a mine in North-Eastern Ontario ended the quarter with a reduction in debt, revenues of 163.7 million U.S. dollars and an adjusted net income of 10.5 million dollars. Information Technology stocks also had an impact, rising 1.17 percent on Friday. Toronto-based Constellation Software Inc shares rose 1.85 percent after posting a first quarter profit of 555 million U.S. dollars and adjusted net income balloon 51 percent. Shares closed at 624.33 Canadian dollars (457.38 U.S. dollars). Descartes Systems Group and CGI Group Inc also contributed with respective gains of 2.57 percent and 1.82 percent. The remaining groups that moved up during Friday's session were: Consumer Staples (0.91 percent), Health Care (0.85 percent), Energy (0.76 percent), Financial (0.34 percent), Consumer Discretionary (0.10 percent), and Telecommunications (0.08 percent). Energy closed ahead as the price of crude oil and natural gas both finished the week on a high note. A barrel of Brent for July delivery rose 0.39 percent to 51.85 U.S. dollars, while June natural gas futures on the on the New York Mercantile Exchange shot up 0.93 percent to 3.269 U.S. dollars per million British thermal units. Shares of Calgary-based Baytex Energy Corp and Crescent Point Energy Corp boosted 2.48 percent and 2.35 percent, each. Meanwhile, shares of Suncor Energy Inc, the largest crude oil producer in the country closed at 42.78 Canadian dollars (31.34 U.S. dollars), a 2.47 percent uplift. The TSX Financial group stabilized on the day after two consecutive days as the top laggard group. Home Capital Group Inc shares ticked up 0.25 percent to 8.04 Canadian dollars (5.89 U.S. dollars) after shares slipped nearly 65 percent on Wednesday followed by a 34 percent spike yesterday. Bank of Nova Scotia and Manulife Financial Corporation carried the group, advancing 0.76 percent and 0.46 percent, each. The lone group to lose ground on the day was Industrials, inching down 0.05 percent after plane and automobile maker Bombardier Inc was accused by rival Boeing for selling jets in the United States at below cost. The anti-dumping complaint to the U.S. government could see the Montreal-based firm face a lengthy investigation and hinder their ability to sell their C Series aircraft south of the border. As a result, shares of the firm dipped 4.09 percent to 2.11 Canadian dollars (1.55 U.S. dollars). The Canadian dollar retreated 0.14 cent to 0.7326 U.S. dollar.

'Vachana' is a prosaic form well known in the Kannada literature. This style of writing was used by Basavanna for spreading social awareness and bring equality in the society in the 12th century. The 23 'Vachana' volumes, edited by literary scholar late M M Kalburgi and translated by 20 people, was commissioned by the Basava Samithi at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore. Of which, the Karnataka government contributed Rs 1 crore. April 30 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will arrive in India on a two-day visit. His visit assumes importance at a time when India is aggressively seeking a seat in the exclusive club of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group (NSG), which Turkey had previously opposed. The issue is expected to be discussed during Erdogan’s bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1, although the focus of talks is going to be counter-terrorism. The Telangana Legislature will meet on April 30 to take up some important business including passing a couple of bills. After the conclusion of the budget session on March 27, the Legislature met again for a day on April 16 for passing the bills on increase in reservation to Minorities and Scheduled Tribes, Heritage Policy and on Goods and Services Tax. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had said on April 21 while speaking at the Telangana Rashtra Samithi's (TRS) plenary that a special session of the Legislature would be held again towards the month-end to pass a bill to provide for stringent action against spurious seed sellers. Elon Musk's SpaceX is all set to launch a spy satellite for the US National Reconnaissance Office on April 30. The NROL-76 will take off from SpaceX’s launch pad at the historic Launch Complex 39A (LC39A) at the Kennedy Space Center. This is SpaceX first mission for the NRO. The American government mostly uses Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s United Launch Alliance rockets for its secret missions. The NRO serves as the eye in the sky for the rest of the intelligence services and the armed forces. The BJP Rajasthan's working committee will hold a two-day meeting in Jodhpur starting April 30. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje and ministers of her cabinet will attend the meeting along with the state party president.

Globe and Mail Public Editor Sylvia Stead. SYLVIA STEAD Public Editor: Keeping sources’ anonymity is a matter of trust Add to ... Sylvia Stead Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Apr. 28, 2017 11:55AM EDT Last updated Friday, Apr. 28, 2017 11:55AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print In the midst of charges of made-up news, mostly south of the border, a reader wanted to know more about the mysterious practices around anonymous sources. “I realize there are times when a source does not want to go on the record out of concern for their position, reputation and livelihood, but the practice seems to have become an issue,” the reader said. “Fake news sites regularly cite ‘anonymous sources’ as a way to cover the fact that they’re just making things up. … The other day, Trump claimed media who quote anonymous sources are making it all up. Some clarification about why anonymous sources are used by the legitimate [media] might be helpful at this point.” Using real names of real officials, is, of course, much more credible. But sometimes, as the reader notes, a whistle-blower wants the public to know the truth without losing their job. To me, the practice of keeping people anonymous is a matter of trust. A source won’t tell a journalist inside information unless they trust the journalist not to name them. The organization shouldn’t put their own credibility on the line unless they trust that the source is in a position to know and they make efforts to verify that it is the truth. And most importantly, the reader has to trust that the information is valid. The bar is very high. Some of us remember Watergate and the anonymous source who brought down a president by leaking key data to Washington Post reporters about then-president Richard Nixon’s role in covering up a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters. The reporters and at least one of their senior editors knew the anonymous whistle-blower (known in the articles as Deep Throat) was Mark Felt, then the associate director of the FBI, but not a whiff of that could be given to the readers. Nonetheless, they had to believe the Washington Post that he could be trusted, that his documents and information were real and he had no political axe to grind. Likewise, Globe and Mail reporter Daniel Leblanc based key reporting into the federal sponsorship scandal on his source “Ma Chouette” (My Dear). While her identity has never been made public, both Mr. Leblanc and a senior editor at The Globe had confidence that she was in a position to know. But in a situation where we are asking for the readers’ trust, more can – and should – be done to enlighten them. I’ve been monitoring The Globe’s use of anonymous sources over the past month and while there is nothing obviously wrong, there are some practices which could be improved. I found a lack of consistency in describing sources and few explanations for why the source was granted anonymity. The Globe and Mail’s policy states that the justification for no attribution is “to get the fullest story possible, not to let people dodge accountability or take anonymous potshots.” Anonymous quotes and information should be used only under the following conditions: They convey important information that cannot be obtained for attribution elsewhere; they cannot be used to voice opinions or make ad hominem attacks; the sources are described as fully as possible; and, on request, an editor knows the source’s name and full details of their position. It is true that many important stories and details would not become public if it weren’t for the use of anonymous sources. I found no examples of anonymous sources taking potshots at others. But this next part of the policy needs greater attention and enforcement from the editors: “We must be diligent in describing sources as fully as possible. That includes: how the anonymous sources know what they know, why they are willing to provide the information and why we agreed to grant them anonymity.” In too many stories, the information is attributed just to “a source” or “sources” with no description of how they might know. By contrast, here is an example of good practices from an Ottawa story on marijuana legislation: “said the federal official, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the tabling of the legislation.” That description shows you it is an official and why she or he was unable to be quoted: because the legislation was still confidential. An example of good practices that could have been better followed the statement that the Trump administration did not appear to know what it wants from trade negotiations. It was attributed to “sources in the Canadian, U.S. and Mexican governments.” This was a very full description of who the people were, but could have been improved with a reference to why we granted them anonymity. Even in this case, when it might seem obvious, it is a good practice to use. Some of the international news-wire services have good standards around this practice. A Reuters news-agency story referred to Boeing layoffs according to “a source and a memo seen by Reuters.” In a story about the death of Prince, the Associated Press referred to confidential information from “an official with knowledge of the investigation [who spoke] on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.” Personally, I do not like the wording, found in several stories, “The Globe and Mail has learned.” That does not tell the reader how The Globe learned it (a document, a source, who knows?), how credible the information is and why anonymity was granted. It also feels both obvious and promotional. If The Globe is essentially saying “Trust us” when they quote anonymous sources, then readers deserve to know as much as possible without compromising the source.

Nevertheless, the "art of the deal" probably is the best and least dangerous option for dealing with North Korea. Despite Kim Jong-Un's outrageous rhetoric, bizarre behavior and brutal elimination of potential threats to his rule, he seems more sociopathic than insane. Ultimately, Kim lives like a debauched, ancient, Asian despot, and a good bet would be that he probably wants to continue living to debauch to his self's content. His behavior is more akin to that of a rattlesnake rather than an obsessed tyrant like Adolf Hitler who, being insane, preferred Gotterdammerung to loss of power. Additionally, Kim and North Korea's military leadership are far different from the Islamist jihadists in Raqqa and, for that matter, the mullahs in Tehran with their Armageddon mindsets bent on a nuclear war to advance their end-times scenarios culminating in various iterations of global, Islamic caliphates. Though he seems reckless, Kim Jong-Un does not want World War III. Neither do the leaders in Beijing. The instinct to survive to keep on behaving badly is what makes socio-paths so dangerously cunning. While tensions between Washington and Pyongyang rise, it's time to for the Trump administration to take a breath and evaluate options. Although the North Korean regime cannot survive a war with the United States, the costs could be astronomical for South Korea, the United States and China. Here's why: The ground forces in North Korea's People's Army (NKPA) number over one million, with up to seven times that number in reserve. More than 3,500 to 4,000 tanks and an estimated 2,000 armored fighting vehicles support North Korean infantry. Estimates indicate there are over 8,000 artillery pieces and 5,000 mobile rocket launchers, many of them zeroed in on Seoul, 30 miles south of the Demilitarized Zone. Because the North Korean Air Force (NKAF) is antiquated, much of Pyongyang's military would be devastated in the first few days of fighting. The approximately 1,200 combat aircraft in the NKAF are Soviet-era legacy systems, the latest acquired during the 1980s. In addition to being obsolete, most NKAF planes are flown by inexperienced and poorly trained pilots. American fighter pilots receive more training in a month than North Korean flyers obtain in a year. Fear of potential defections to the South keep NKAF pilots under rigid control. Lack of expensive jet fuel also inhibits training. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=570298765" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=570298765" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement The fangs are in North Korea's integrated air-defense system's surface-to-air missile (SAM) and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Much of this system protects artillery deployed along the frontier. Additionally, self-propelled SAMs can advance with the infantry. Nuclear and missile sites rely on SAMs and AAA for protection. It is likely enough North Korean People's Army artillery will survive long enough to devastate Seoul, injure and kill thousands, possibly scores of thousands of civilians, while dealing a crippling blow to the Asian economy, to include China's and, by extension, those of the United States and Japan. Unless Kim Jong-Un is insane—which he probably is not—starting a war with the United States would be suicidal. Provoking him with even a limited military strike, however, would be like stepping on a rattlesnake. The response will be swift and devastating. Kim will continue his weapons-development programs, even if President Trump orders those missiles shot out of the air or otherwise disabled—which could provoke Kim into a military response. While many of their missile launch sites are above ground and therefore vulnerable to U.S. airstrikes, some are concealed. Most of their nuclear facilities are deep underground and relatively invulnerable to anything other than nuclear strikes. Finally, U.S. military forces have not recovered from ravages of 16 years of deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, sequester-driven budget cuts that devastated maintenance and training and personnel policies focused on propounding a socio-political agenda that drove many warfighters to resignation or early retirement. American armed forces need rebuilding and rearming as well as a reformed focus toward warfighting with destroying the enemy as the ultimate goal. North Korea is ruled by a sociopathic personality inured to brutality exceeding anything by Uganda's Idi Amin and Haiti's Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier. What's needed is regime change. The use of American military force could prove devastatingly expensive in blood. The Trump administration's best alternative is to ratchet up pressure on China to affect regime change in Pyongyang. Additionally, it should request full funding for the Boeing Midcourse Ground Based Defense System designed to shoot down incoming missiles.

The hydrogen produced on-board during flight can be used in a fuel cell to generate electric energy for auxiliary power. In addition to fresh water, the waste water available on-board the aircraft can be used for hydrogen generation. The researchers demonstrated high reaction rates producing about 200-600 ml/min/g Al of hydrogen at a high yield of about 90% was demonstrated. The possibility to use the available waste water leads to high specific electric energy of up to about 850 Wh/kg. The work was reported in a recent paper published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. One of the main challenges associated with the use of PEM fuel cells on-board an aircraft is the hydrogen fuel storage due to hydrogen’s extremely low density (gaseous state: 0.089 kg/ m3, liquid state: 71 kg/m3). It implies storage as hydrogen gas at very high pressures (350-700 bar) or as liquid at very low temperatures (~20 K) [-253 ˚C]. Furthermore, central storage and long pipelines of elemental hydrogen within the aircraft involve safety issues due to its high flammability and explosion hazards. A novel method for in-situ and on-demand hydrogen production was developed and patented at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering of the Technion - Israel Institute of technology, based on activation of aluminum powder to react spontaneously with any type of water at room temperature. … This technology offers a good solution to the challenges mentioned above, namely, high specific energy storage with no actual storage of gaseous or liquid hydrogen. Only activated aluminum powder should be stored, producing hydrogen gas only when needed, according to the rate of its use. Furthermore, fuel cell units with their assigned hydrogen source may be located at the points of need on-board the aircraft. —Elitzur et al. The spontaneous and sustained reaction between powdered aluminum and water is enabled by a special thermo-chemical process of aluminum activation the researchers developed. The protective properties of the oxide or hydroxide film covering the aluminum particle surface are modified by a small fraction of lithium-based activator diffused into aluminum bulk, allowing water at room temperature to react spontaneously with the aluminum. The process does generate heat, which the researchers say can be used for a number of tasks, including heating water and food in the galley, de-icing operations, or heating aircraft fuel prior to starting the engines. According to the researchers, their technology would provide: Quieter operations on board an aircraft Drastic reductions in CO2 emissions Compact storage; no need for hydrogen storage tanks onboard aircraft More efficient electric power generation A reduction in wiring (multiple fuel cells can be located near their point of use) Thermal efficiency (fuel cell generated heat can be used for de-icing, heating jet fuel) Reduced flammable vapors in fuel tanks (Inert gas generation) The researchers estimated that the total mass of such a system, including hydrogen storage and a fuel cell, when using the activated aluminum-water technique, is somewhat lower compared to high pressure hydrogen gas system and somewhat higher than that of liquid hydrogen system. Even though the total mass of liquid hydrogen system is slightly lower, the safety aspect makes a lot of difference. Aircraft manufacturers, including Boeing and Airbus, have already investigated using onboard fuel cells. Boeing has experimented with them in smaller aircraft, in anticipation of using them on its 787-8, the current state-of-the-art electric airplane. According to the Technion researchers, fuel cells can even play an energy saving role in airline and airport ground support operations when they are on used for systems such as de-icing and runway light towers.

I wonder how much it costs to fuel these planes (with Al). Maybe you could make Al fuel from waste electricity when there was no demand on the grid. What do you do with the Al(OH)3 afterwards, can you regenerate it to Al? Posted by: mahonj | April 28, 2017 at 04:58 AM This is something like the aluminum battery from an Israeli company. The aluminum hydroxide can be turned into alumina. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcination Posted by: SJC | April 28, 2017 at 09:04 AM 200-600 ml/min/g (423.3 cubic feet of hydrogen at standard pressure is one kg) This would be about 60 grams of aluminum for a cubic foot of hydrogen weighing less than 3 grams. That does not seem like a good yield when you are trying for a 1000 grams of H2 to go 40 miles. That would be more than 40 pounds of alumina for each kilogram of hydrogen. If they took that 40 pounds to make electricity directly in a primary cell they might do better.

Published: 06:02 April 28, 2017 By John Defterios, Special to Gulf News   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE On March 25, the US forced 10 airports in the Middle East to implement an electronics laptop ban on three days’ notice. While the airports met the tight deadline, the leaders of the two largest regional carriers are certainly not curling up into ball and hiding in a corner. A month into the process, the President of Emirates airline and Chief Executive of Qatar Airways sat down for one-on-one interviews with CNNMoney in Dubai and Doha to share their thoughts on that decision and much more. READ MORE: Electronics ban: Emirates to redeploy aircraft on new routes Emirates flies high as world's best airline Emirates cuts US flights following electronics ban It was, however, the blunt language aimed at the chief executive of United Airlines that captured most of the headlines after the forceful removal of a passenger on an overbooked flight. “Let me say it was a disgrace. It shamed the airline industry as a whole,” Tim Clark told me at Emirates’ headquarters. “We don’t go about our business in that way. It’s symptomatic of a corporate culture within that company from the board and chief executive downwards.” United’s CEO Oscar Munoz apologised on numerous occasions and took full responsibility for actions that quickly evolved into a public-relations nightmare and eroded $250 million from the company’s market capitalisation. Munoz remains chief executive, but the board decided not to grant him the dual role as chairman. Clark said he would have fallen on his sword if he was in charge at United. “Had it been me in that position I would’ve have had blue flashing lights on cars going right through the company to find out how this could’ve been allowed to happen in the first place. That was probably the last thing I do before I resigned.” At odds The Gulf carriers have been at odds with major American airlines for years and this spilt out into the open again when Emirates decided to trim services to US cities because of all the policy changes from the Trump administration since the start of the year. This would include the attempted travel bans that targeted this region, new visa requirements, a review of the so-called H1-B visa for specialised overseas workers and, of course, the laptop ban. “It is what I call unintended consequences,” said Clark, “From the Emirates point of view, the policy of the federal government is outweighing anything else at the moment.” Clark was referring to the impact of a high-profile global advertising campaign to attract visitors to the US and even local efforts from destinations like the City of Los Angeles. For the CEO of Qatar Airways, the electronics ban took centre stage. He said it was poorly conceived and rushed into action, regardless of the security intelligence that was being gathered by the US agencies. “In today’s day and age we have so much advancement in detection systems that we should utilise them and not just shoot from the hip,” Akbar Al Baker told me during a global gathering of airport chief executives in the Qatari capital. The outspoken CEO was an early backer of Donald Trump so he was careful with his criticism of the President’s first 100 days in office. “I am always a supporter of Donald Trump but a president you know will act upon the advice of people that are around him. And I think on this matter he was ill advised,” To drive home his point he injected a bit of humour into our interview, “If [Trump] continues this way, at the end of the day you will have people sitting in the aeroplane with underwear and nothing [else] on them.” Battle over access But the battle over access to the US market is no laughing matter. Both sides have been trading verbal barbs for the last three years and have put forward thousands of pages of evidence to defend their positions.
