The House Finance Committee heard public testimony on the measures Tuesday. The bills are a tweaked version of bills introduced in previous years that never gained traction in the Democratic-controlled House but have received renewed interest after another round of Boeing layoffs were announced last month. “For me, this is a matter of taxpayer accountability,” Democratic Rep. Noel Frame, the sponsor of one of the bills, said at the hearing. In a 2013 special session, the Legislature approved a suite of tax incentives aimed at Boeing and the aerospace sector meant to ensure that the 777X was produced in Everett. Most of the tax breaks first were approved in 2003 and set to expire in 2024, but the new legislation extended them until 2040. Those tax breaks are expected to save the aerospace giant more than $8 billion in taxes through 2040. But Frame noted that since that time, the company has shed more than 12,000 jobs in the state. In the past year alone, Boeing Commercial Airplanes reduced its workforce by more than 9,000, mainly through buyouts and retirements. At the end of March, the division employed nearly 74,200 people, down from more than 83,000 at the end of 2015. Bill McSherry, vice president of government operations, said that any change to their tax incentives “would prevent Boeing from being able to respond to future market challenges.” “Subsidized foreign competitors and fewer wide body purchases across the industry have resulted in significant competitive pressure on every order,” he told the panel. He also noted that the company recently had to re-­adjust expected production of the 777 from eight planes each month to a planned rate of five planes a month. Frame’s bill would require Boeing to meet an annual employment baseline of 70,000 jobs in Washington in order to qualify for its preferential business and occupation tax rate. Boeing’s .2904 percentage rate is significantly lower than tax rates for other sectors. Under Frame’s bill, if Boeing’s annual employment level falls below 70,000 jobs, but above 67,500, its rate would increase to .387. If the level falls to 67,500, the rate would raise to the level that the vast majority of the manufacturing sector pays, .484 percent. Additionally, a tax credit the company could previously claim is reduced by 50 percent if the employment level falls below 70,000, but above 67,500 — if it falls below that level, no credit would be allowed. Any money regained by the state would go into an education account. The Legislature is in special session to address education funding as part of an overall two-year state budget that must be in place by the end of next month to avoid a partial government shutdown. Last year, Boeing announced that it saved $305 million through state tax breaks in 2015. It was the first time the company has been required by law to publicly disclose such information due to new requirement under a tax-incentive transparency law passed in 2013 that affects Boeing and hundreds of other aerospace firms in the state. At the time, the company also said it invested more than $13 billion in the state in 2015 — citing tens of millions in community contributions as well as tuition for employees seeking continuing education. McSherry pointed to that data in his testimony before the panel. “Boeing has kept its word to Washington,” he said. Republican Rep. Richard DeBolt, the sponsor of the second measure, said he felt that lawmakers needed to re-examine their policy related to the tax break. Under his bill, if the company did not maintain a seven-year average of 75,000 positions, the preferential tax rate would expire in mid-2024. Any money recouped would go to career and technical education, a new worker readjustment program and a small business tax credit account. “I have not seen the investment into the Boeing employees we thought we would get,” he said earlier in the week. “It seems every time we turn around, more are leaving.” Democratic Rep. Kristine Lytton, the chairwoman of the committee, said a decision has not yet been made on whether the bill will receive a vote. She said as lawmakers continue to try and reach a consensus on the budget, the exemption is worth a look.

(Associated Press files) By RACHEL LA CORTE, Associated Press Published: May 2, 2017, 9:34 PM A   A OLYMPIA — Frustrated by the loss of thousands of Boeing jobs in recent years, lawmakers are weighing two measures that would tie Boeing’s eligibility for tax breaks to the number of people it employs in Washington.

The C919, built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), was set to take wing over Shanghai on Friday, the company said on Wednesday, according to the official Xinhua news agency. "If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled," COMAC said, adding that engineers had completed some 118 tests. The narrow-body jet represents nearly a decade of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. "The first flight itself is not a huge deal. (But) of course, it's going to be a hugely symbolic moment in the evolution of China's aviation industry," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal. The C919 is the country's first big passenger plane and the latest sign of growing Chinese ambition and technical skill, coming one week after China launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. The C919 can seat 168 passengers and has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles). - Long way to go - China is a huge battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The Chinese travel market is expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus has estimated Chinese airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes over the next two decades, while Boeing foresees 6,800 aircraft. Both put the combined price tags for those planes at around $1 trillion. But aviation analysts said Shanghai-based COMAC has a long journey ahead before it can challenge the lock on the market by Boeing and Airbus. AFP / afp China homegrown jet "This is an important milestone for China with this new aircraft. But for it to move to the next stage, which is to sell this product, is not going to be so easy," said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. But COMAC may be able to rely on purchases by fast-growing Chinese airlines. It had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines. Waldron agreed it would take time but said that over the next century China would become a world aviation player. "You are going to have three big companies. You will have Boeing, you will have Airbus, and you will have COMAC," he said. China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. COMAC's first regional jet, the 90-seat ARJ 21, entered service in 2016, several years late. - Long-haul ambition - The ARJ 21 is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies. China also has been in talks with the FAA to obtain certification for the C919, without result. The C919's first test flight had been due to take place in 2016 but was delayed. Besides the C919, China is also working with Russia to develop a long-haul wide-bodied jet called the C929. Although the C919 is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as the engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric of the US and France's Safran. During a visit to COMAC in 2014, President Xi Jinping expressed concern that not having a homegrown plane left China at the mercy of foreign industrial groups. AFP / STR Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines China last August launched a new multi-billion dollar jet-engine conglomerate with nearly 100,000 employees, with the hope of powering its own planes with self-made engines. After the C919's first flight, it will need to pass tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification before it can be sold. 3 May 2017 Previous Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

The 737-10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of the market for narrow body jets. Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane’s landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries. The sources said a two-part technical solution is being tested and that Boeing is separately talking to airlines with the aim of launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. In all, it is said to anticipate a market of 1,000 of the planes. “Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X,” a spokesman said. “No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleArik Resumes Flight Operations To Maiduguri, May 9 Next articleAfrica Loses $50bn To Illicit Financial Flows Annually -Minister admin RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Business AMCON Injects N1.5bn In Arik Air Business Rivers Monarch Urges Local Economy Dev Through Cottage Industries Business Oil Sector Stablility Excites Buhari, NNPC Business C’River Commissioner Inspects Road Projects Business Edo Promises To Tackle Housing Sector Challenges Business NDDC Boss Salutes Workers’ Resilience Amid Tough Economic Challenges Stay connected 63,650FollowersFollow 2,841SubscribersSubscribe - Advertisement -Tweets by @TheTideNewspape Archives Archives Select Month May 2017  (153) April 2017  (831) March 2017  (961) February 2017  (825) January 2017  (897) December 2016  (427) November 2016  (496) October 2016  (870) September 2016  (674) August 2016  (583) July 2016  (962) June 2016  (696) May 2016  (648) April 2016  (813) March 2016  (580) February 2016  (594) January 2016  (726) December 2015  (508) November 2015  (144) October 2015  (356) September 2015  (334) August 2015  (948) July 2015  (831) June 2015  (737) May 2015  (436) April 2015  (690) March 2015  (783) February 2015  (879) January 2015  (808) December 2014  (675) November 2014  (771) October 2014  (903) September 2014  (619) August 2014  (783) July 2014  (752) June 2014  (796) May 2014  (801) April 2014  (889) March 2014  (863) February 2014  (678) January 2014  (995) December 2013  (804) November 2013  (614) October 2013  (789) September 2013  (591) August 2013  (570) July 2013  (750) June 2013  (656) May 2013  (433) April 2013  (801) March 2013  (895) February 2013  (747) January 2013  (687) December 2012  (735) November 2012  (714) October 2012  (720) September 2012  (797) August 2012  (927) July 2012  (856) June 2012  (792) May 2012  (765) April 2012  (751) March 2012  (933) February 2012  (681) January 2012  (660) December 2011  (536) November 2011  (663) October 2011  (649) September 2011  (677) August 2011  (651) July 2011  (858) June 2011  (404) May 2011  (370) April 2011  (113) March 2011  (215) February 2011  (497) January 2011  (617) December 2010  (445) November 2010  (393) October 2010  (505) August 2010  (234) July 2010  (680) June 2010  (1000) May 2010  (644) April 2010  (526) March 2010  (521) February 2010  (175) January 2010  (604) December 2009  (660) November 2009  (846) October 2009  (617) September 2009  (131) August 2009  (244) July 2009  (546) June 2009  (106) February 2009  (22) The Tide Newspaper is the most respected source of news and information for readers in Nigeria , with the latest stories on politics and current affairs, business and technology, sports, culture and the arts, as well as the popular citylife supplement, with nightlife news, restaurant reviews and top events.

The Boeing Company has been operating with a total market capitalizations of 111.91 B and has reported a price of 182.39 today, highlighting a positive change of -1.32%. The average volume stands at 3087.32 for The Boeing Company. Performance: The performance week for The Boeing Company is at 0.18% while the performance month is at 2.48%. The quarterly and half-yearly performance stats are 11.11% and 29.35% respectively. The performance (Year to Date) is currently at 18.16%. The current operating margin for The Boeing Company is at 6.50%. The return on assets for The Boeing Company stands at 5.70%, (ROA – calculated by dividing the total annual earnings by the company’s total assets –  illustrates how profitable a company really is in relation to its total assets). The dividend yield stands at 3.11% while the payout ratio is 60.40%. At present the return on equity (ROE) stands at 571.30% and the debt to equity is at 113.67.

The simple 20 day moving average stands at 1.79% and the simple 200-day moving average is at 20.45%. A simple definition of the simple moving average: The simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of the stock for the given time periods, say for 20 days, and then dividing it by that time period- i.e 20. It usually helps to smooth out the ‘noise’ by filtering out random price movements. Since SMA is based on past data, it will tend to have a lag. The longer the time period the greater the lag. So a 20-day SMA will have less lag than the 200-day SMA. Shorter SMAs are used for short-term trading and vice versa. The earnings per share growth rate for this year stands at 2.30% and 9.62% for the coming year.

(AP) — Frustrated by the loss of thousands of Boeing jobs in recent years, lawmakers are weighing two measures that would tie Boeing's eligibility for tax breaks to the amount of people they employ in Washington. The House Finance Committee heard public testimony on the measures Tuesday. The bills are a tweaked version of bills introduced in previous years that never gained traction in the Democratic-controlled House, but have received renewed interest after another round of Boeing layoffs were announced last month. "For me this is a matter of taxpayer accountability," Democratic Rep. Noel Frame, the sponsor of one of the bills, said at the hearing. In a 2013 special session, the Legislature approved a suite of tax incentives aimed at Boeing and the aerospace sector meant to ensure that the 777X was produced in Everett. Most of the tax breaks were first approved in 2003 and set to expire in 2024, but the new legislation extended them until 2040. Those tax breaks are expected to save the aerospace giant more than $8 billion in taxes through 2040. But Frame noted that since that time, the company has shed more than 12,000 jobs in the state. In the past year alone, Boeing Commercial Airplanes reduced its workforce by more than 9,000, mainly through buyouts and retirements. At the end of March, the division employed nearly 74,200 people, down from over 83,000 at the end of 2015. Bill McSherry, vice president of government operations, said that any change to their tax incentives "would prevent Boeing from being able to respond to future market challenges." "Subsidized foreign competitors and fewer wide body purchases across the industry have resulted in significant competitive pressure on every order," he told the panel. He also noted that the company recently had to readjust expected production of the 777 from 8 planes each month to a planned rate of five planes a month. "Sadly, rate reductions generally result in job reductions and this year is no different," he said. Frame's bill would require Boeing to meet an annual employment baseline of 70,000 jobs in Washington state in order to qualify for its preferential business and occupation tax rate. Boeing's .2904 percentage rate is significantly lower than tax rates for other sectors. Under Frame's bill, if Boeing's annual employment level falls below 70,000 jobs, but above 67,500, their rate would increase to .387. If the level falls to 67,500, the rate would raise to the level that the vast majority of the manufacturing sector pays, .484 percent. Additionally, a tax credit the company could previously claim is reduced by 50 percent if the employment level falls below 70,000, but above 67,500 — if it falls below that level, no credit would be allowed. Any money regained by the state would go into an education account. The Legislature is currently in special session to address education funding as part of an overall two-year state budget that must be in place by the end of next month to avoid a partial government shutdown. Last year, Boeing announced that it saved $305 million through state tax breaks in 2015. It was the first time the company has been required by law to publicly disclose such information due to new requirement under a tax-incentive transparency law passed in 2013 that affects Boeing and hundreds of other aerospace firms in the state. At the time the company also said it invested more than $13 billion in the state in 2015 — citing tens of millions in community contributions as well as tuition for employees seeking continuing education. McSherry pointed to that data in his testimony before the panel. "Boeing has kept its word to Washington," he said. Republican Rep. Richard DeBolt, the sponsor of the second measure, said he felt that lawmakers needed to re-examine their policy related to the tax break. Under his bill, if the company did not maintain a seven-year average of 75,000 positions, the preferential tax rate would expire in mid-2024. Any money recouped would go to career and technical education, a new worker readjustment program and a small business tax credit account. "I have not seen the investment into the Boeing employees we thought we would get," he said earlier in the week. "It seems every time we turn around, more are leaving." Democratic Rep. Kristine Lytton, the chairwoman of the committee, said a decision has not yet been made on whether the bill will receive a vote. She said as lawmakers continue to try and reach a consensus on the budget, the exemption is worth a look. "Everything is on the table," she said. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

An aircraft belonging to Myanmar Airways International (MAI) sits on the runway of Yangon Airport last week. Photo: Philip Heijmans Under the agreement, forged on the opening day of the Singapore Airshow, state-owned Myanma Airways will lease the Boeing 737s from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), the commercial leasing and financing arm of US giant General Electric. “Myanma Airways, which has suspended international operations since 1993, is now going to re-enter the international market with the support of our good friend and partner GECAS,” Myanmar Transportation Minister U Nyan Htun Aung said at the signing ceremony. “We hope that we could become well known again to international air travellers,” he said, alongside GECAS executives and US ambassador to Myanmar Derek Mitchell. Mr Mitchell described the agreement as the “largest commercial sale” by a US company to Myanmar in decades. “It is an important moment for both our countries and I assume it will be the first of many such moments among American businesses and Myanmar,” he said. Delivery of the planes, whose total list value is $960 million, is scheduled to begin in June next year. “The contract calls for six Boeing 737-800 models and four Boeing 737-MAX models. The aircraft will deliver through 2020,” GECAS said in a statement. It will be a major makeover for flag carrier Myanma Airways, which was established in 1948 and currently operates mostly domestic services using Fokker F28 jets and ATR turboprops. For flights to smaller domestic airports, Myanma Airways uses Beechcraft and Cessna planes. “We are pleased at GE to work with Myanma Airways to provide new, state-of-the-art Boeing aircraft,” said Norman Liu, president and chief executive of GECAS. “This is an important milestone for the airline and for the development of Myanmar’s aviation industry.” U Nyan Htun Aung said the new Boeing planes would be used to expand the carrier’s routes to Japan and South Korea. He said the rapid rise in both domestic and international passenger growth rates since decades of junta rule ended in 2011 provided the impetus for the airline to expand. He said the 10 leased Boeing aircraft would “greatly enhance” the reform of Myanma Airways as well as the government’s push to develop the country’s air transport sector. The carrier’s sole international destination currently is Gaya in India, which is important for Buddhist pilgrims. It carried 500,000 passengers last year compared to 230,000 in 2010. Japan’s All-Nippon Airways last year acquired 49 percent stake in another Myanmar-based carrier, Asian Wings Airways, which commenced its first international service to Thailand in January. – AFP Most Read - Business Clothing producers look to stronger exports but worry about local market Mango farming gets GAP stamp New committee tackles exchange rate Foreign NGOs accused of instigating opposition against Myitsone dam PTT may suspend M-3 offshore block on oil price tumble India-Myanmar border trade slumps Transport hardware upgrade needed for modern warehouses Malaysian firm to build 920 towers for Telenor MPE opens more tenders Commit-and-act approach expected among investors Most Read - Property News Lump sum rent a growing problem for tenants Property industry experts predict post-2010 upturn Low property tax revenue despite higher sales Ministry aims at 1 million housing units by 2030 YCDC’s $10m toilet and toll-gate tender YCDC stops accepting high-rise applications Chinese group to develop 31-acre luxury complex in Yangon MPA invites foreshore tender plans Real estate market defies Lent trend Chinese-backed condominium project launches in Yangon Most Read - Technology Local consortium to claim Myanmar’s fourth telco licence Mytel to target rural areas and compete on price Flight ban on Galaxy Note 7s Ooredoo reduces Myanmar losses Facebook racks up 10m Myanmar users Daiwa sees ‘cloud’ future for Myanmar Landlines available by plan: MPT Telenor and Yoma Bank test mobile money service Satellite program aims at Myanmar’s skies Ooredoo near to covering all of Yangon Copyright © 2017 The Myanmar Times.

The company’s net earnings fell to C$48.3 million (Dh130m) from C$87.6m a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 per cent to C$1.11 billion. "Our 2017 first quarter financial results represent our 48th consecutive quarter of reported profitability," the company said. "Our operating margin was 7.3 per cent, down 4.7 percentage points when compared to our 2016 first quarter and includes a non-cash cumulative catch up adjustment to our maintenance provision of C$18.5m and C$7m in irregular operations costs due to the severe weather experienced in the first quarter," it added. Load factor was up 0.9 percentage points on increased capacity year over year, WestJet said. The carrier said it has agreed to buy up to 20 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft from Boeing. The purchase agreement includes commitments for 10 787-9 aircraft to be delivered between the first quarter of 2019 and December 2021, with options for an additional 10 aircraft to be delivered between 2020 and 2024. As part of this purchase agreement, WestJet is converting 15 firm orders for the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that were to be delivered between 2019 and 2021 to options available between 2022 and 2024. In the first quarter of this year WestJet added two new Bombardier Q400 aircraft increasing its fleet of 36 Q400s to 36 and its total fleet to 155 aircraft with an average age of 7.4 years. It has received an additional two Q400s since then and extended leases on three Boeing 737 aircraft, which were scheduled to expire this year, to 2023. Over the next decade, it aims to increase fleet size to between 185 and 226 aircraft, depending on future decisions to exercise options to purchase and to renew leases, it said. "We continue to look for opportunities to save costs and increase revenues, and in the first quarter of 2017 announced a seat reconfiguration programme for our Boeing 737-700 and Boeing 737-800 fleet which will increase capacity on these aircraft," the carrier said. "We expect to complete the reconfigurations of the Boeing 737-700 aircraft by June 2017 and the Boeing 737-800 fleet before the end of 2018." Last month, the airline announced it would launch a new, ultra-low-cost carrier in Canada, subject to agreement with pilots and regulatory approvals. Service is expected to commence in late this year with an initial fleet of 10 Boeing 737-800s. "For the second quarter of 2017, we expect fuel costs to range between 65 and 67 Canadian cents per litre, representing a year over year increase of approximately 23 to 26 per cent. The second quarter 2017 expected fuel costs are based on current forecasted jet fuel prices of US$67 per barrel and an average foreign exchange rate of approximately 1.35 Canadian dollars to one US dollar," it said. For the full-year 2017, WestJet said it now expected capital expenditures to be approximately C$1bn, with spending related primarily to aircraft deliveries, deposits on future aircraft, overhauls on owned engines and the installation of a new inflight entertainment system on certain aircraft. This compares with a previous full-year 2017 guidance of approximately C$900m to C$920m, it said, with the difference driven primarily by the signing and deposits related to the 787-9 purchase agreement. For the second quarter of 2017, it expects capital expenditures to be between C$380m and C$400m. chnelson@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Embraer’s Phenom luxury jet retains top slot even as deliveries fall Future of Italian carrier Alitalia in the hands of officials New Sydney airport to be built by government United Airlines’ chief slammed by Congress over passenger scandal MOST VIEWED Business | All Cheap digs for global billionaires in Dubai Yoox Net-A-Porter joint venture for region to begin operations next year Future of Italian carrier Alitalia in the hands of officials Non-oil sectors to drive UAE economic growth First Abu Dhabi Bank reveals new brand identity Tales of the unexpected boost Moby Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures Huawei P10 smartphone review: just a little underwhelming IMF says GCC countries should accelerate economic reforms this year DIFC firms can obtain onshore licences More Most Viewed Luxury yachts worth $4m stolen from Dubai used for crime Adec announces holidays for next school year Beauty blogger Huda Kattan cancels Dubai Mall appearance over security concerns There is a way out of Syria’s vicious circle Car stuck on cruise control has to be stopped by Sharjah Police Development projects to bring homes and jobs to outskirts of Abu Dhabi Former heaviest woman in world set for free treatment in Abu Dhabi Saudi Arabia’s Prince Mohammed bin Salman rules out dialogue with Iran Emirati composer detained at New York airport Sacrifice of UAE soldier who died in Yemen is a ‘badge of honour’ to his family More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures The Debt Panel: Dubai travel agent with debts of Dh125,000 fears repercussions of travelling to her sister’s wedding First look at Warner Bros World Abu Dhabi theme park attractions – in pictures Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Harsher penalities for fuel smuggling will ‘safeguard the UAE’s oil producers’ War in Yemen makes even the dead suffer Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

WestJet Airlines plans to buy 10 of the 787-9 for delivery between early 2019 and the end of 2021, with options for 10 more of the planes to be handed over through 2024.  (WestJet)   By The Canadian Press Tues., May 2, 2017 MONTREAL-WestJet Airlines Ltd. plans to order as many as 20 Boeing Co. 787-9 Dreamliners valued at $5.4 billion, adding the wide-body to its fleet as Canada’s second-biggest carrier expands long-distance service. The move takes a page from Air Canada, which has relied on the Dreamliner’s fuel efficiency to lower operating costs. The order also helps clarify WestJet’s strategy for competing with the country’s largest carrier by entering new markets in Asia and the Western Hemisphere. “This answers one of the primary questions about WestJet’s future but is a significant increase in overseas capacity,” Doug Taylor, a Canaccord Genuity analyst, said in a note to clients. “The market will want more detail on this expansion.” Read more: U.S. policies could drive more foreign visitors to Canada, WestJet CEO says Article Continued Below WestJet to launch low-cost, no-frills airline later this year WestJet posts near-record quarterly profit The order marks a victory for Chicago-based Boeing over Airbus SE amid depressed sales for twin-aisle jets. WestJet Chief Executive Officer Gregg Saretsky said last year that the carrier would evaluate competing aircraft models from Boeing and the European planemaker if it decided to expand the wide-body fleet. WestJet’s order means Canada’s two biggest airlines will fly the 787, with Air Canada operating 24 Dreamliners at the end of last year. With a range of more than 14,000 kilometers , the Dreamliner “will give WestJet the ability to serve new destinations in Asia and South America, and to expand its service offerings into the European market,” the Calgary-based company said in a statement Tuesday. The carrier now operates some leased Boeing 767 aircraft that are more than 20 years old on European routes. Founded in 1996 to cater to leisure travelers, WestJet has been moving away from its original no-frills model—patterned after U.S.-based Southwest Airlines Co.—by adding premium economy seats, rolling out a short-distance unit and starting overseas flights to European destinations such as London. It unveiled plans last week to start an ultra-low-cost carrier to fend off Canadian upstarts. WestJet plans to buy 10 of the 787-9 for delivery between early 2019 and the end of 2021, with options for 10 more of the planes to be handed over through 2024. The purchase would be valued at as much as $5.4 billion, based on list prices. Discounts are typical in the industry. WestJet also will convert orders for 15 single-aisle 737 Max jets, listing for a combined $1.7 billion, to options. The Dreamliner order likely will elevate capital spending over the next several years, Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker said in a note to clients. She said she expected that management would address its plans for the ultra-low-cost carrier in a conference call Tuesday. “Clearly a lot happening in Calgary, which may cause growing pains along the way,” she wrote. WestJet announced the order as it reported first-quarter profit of 41 cents a share, trailing the 51-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue was $1.11 billion , while analysts predicted $1.12 billion. WestJet fell 3.7 per cent to $21.99 at 9:44 a.m. in Toronto, after dropping as much as 5.7 per cent for the biggest intraday decline in six months. Boeing rose less than 1 per cent to $183.08. The carrier won an agreement from pilots in December for expanding long-distance routes overseas after starting services from Canadian cities to London. At the time, it was considering adding to its fleet of Boeing 767 planes.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 5 Things Boeing Co.'s Management Wants You to Know Boeing faces some near-term headwinds, but the company's leaders are confident about the aerospace giant's future prospects. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) May 2, 2017 at 8:40AM Last week, Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported solid first-quarter earnings, despite revenue declines that impacted each of its business segments. Cash flow also improved significantly on a year-over-year basis. Following the earnings release on Wednesday morning, Boeing executives spent over an hour discussing the company's first-quarter results and its outlook with Wall Street analysts and the media. Here are five key points they emphasized. Boeing reported solid earnings and strong cash flow for the first quarter. Image source: Boeing. Demand is fundamentally healthy According to the International Air Transport Association, the 8.8% year-to-date passenger traffic growth adjusted for the leap year is well above the long-term average of 5.5%. ... These favorable industry trends, combined with our robust backlog of more than 5,700 aircraft, underpin our planned production rate increases over the remainder of this decade. -- Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg Many investors have been concerned about slowing order activity at Boeing and Airbus, especially for pricey widebody aircraft. Indeed, widebody orders have plummeted since 2014. However, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg tried to put this order slowdown in perspective. He noted that global passenger traffic continues to rise at a very strong high single-digit rate. Additionally, while airlines aren't ordering many jets right now, order backlogs remain near historic highs. (In other words, airlines have ordered jets many years in advance.) If air travel demand continues to grow quickly, airlines will eventually need to buy many more jets. Boeing is working hard to capture its fair share of those expected future orders. The defense market is improving, too [W]e're seeing a flat to moderately up top line on the defense business over the next five years. Some of this is dependent on where we end up on the U.S. defense budget. -- Dennis Muilenberg The defense business has been a weak spot for Boeing in recent years, as "sequestration" in the U.S. has held back military spending. That's still the status quo for now. That said, the Trump administration has vowed to rebuild the U.S. military. Additionally, Boeing has recently snagged a significant number of international orders. Its KC-46 military tanker is close to entering service, as well. Boeing's management sees good prospects for a return to growth in the defense segment if Congress approves Trump's proposed military spending increases. Dreamliner profitability continues to improve On the 787 program, the deferred production balance continues its downward trend with a decrease of $316 million in the quarter. And again, over the long term, we continue to focus on improving 787 cash generation, driven by favorable delivery mix, internal productivity improvements and additional supplier step-down pricing. -- Boeing CFO Greg Smith One of Boeing's biggest priorities for the next few years is to boost the profitability of its 787 aircraft program. For the first few years of production, the 787 aircraft program was burning cash at a rapid rate, but it has turned profitable. Now, Boeing needs to recoup its previous losses over the next five to seven years. Boeing made some progress on that front last quarter. The 787 program's deferred production balance -- which is a rough proxy for accumulated losses -- fell by $316 million during the quarter. Still, this left Boeing with a deferred production balance of $27 billion. The 787 family's profitability is starting to rise. Image source: Boeing. To recover all of the deferred production losses, Boeing needs to keep boosting the 787 program's cash profitability. Management believes that a mix shift to the more-profitable 787-9 and 787-10 models, productivity gains, and supplier pricing step-downs will do the trick. Making progress on the 777 777 production for 2017 is now sold out. ... At that rate [of 3.5 per month], we are about 90% sold out for both [2018 and 2019], including airplanes covered in the agreement with Iran Air, and we continue to have numerous campaigns underway. -- Dennis Muilenberg Another recent problem for Boeing has been a sharp drop in sales of its 777 widebody family. Last year, Boeing was building 777s at a rate of 8.3 per month, but by next year it will deliver just 3.5 per month. Even at that reduced rate, there are still some delivery slots available. However, Boeing is getting closer to bridging the gap until the first 777X is delivered in 2020. Year-to-date, it has booked nine firm orders for the current-generation 777. As a result, it is fully sold out of its planned production for 2017, and it is close to being sold out for the next two years -- as long as its tentative sales agreement with Iran Air doesn't fall through. Improving execution on development programs Key milestones in the quarter included the FAA certifying the 737 MAX 8 for commercial service and achieving first flight on the 787-10: one month earlier than the development schedule we established three years ago. -- Dennis Muilenberg One area where Boeing has improved in recent years is in completing development projects on time and on budget. The 737 MAX 8 is on track to enter service this summer ahead of schedule and under budget. The 787-10 variant also began flight testing slightly ahead of schedule. And while it's still early, the 777X development program seems to be on track. Of course, there's still plenty of room for improvement. For example, Boeing has had to absorb billions of dollars in cost overruns for the KC-46 tanker, which is also behind schedule. Yet Boeing is still performing much better than was the case with the botched Dreamliner development program a decade ago. Improved execution on development programs will enable Boeing to continue driving free cash flow growth while keeping customers happy. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

WestJet orders longer-range Boeings as part of wider expansion plans by Ian Bickis, The Canadian Press Posted May 2, 2017 7:59 am EDT Last Updated May 2, 2017 at 12:23 pm EDT Business National WestJet Airlines Ltd. has set out an ambitious plan that will see it expand both internationally and into ultra-low cost offerings. The company said Tuesday it has placed a firm order for 10 Boeing Dreamliners, which will allow it to serve new destinations in Asia, South America and Europe with higher-end offerings like lie-flat seating. Company chief executive Gregg Saretsky said the company is also moving ahead with a plan to launch a separate brand and operation with 10 planes to offer a lower-cost service than WestJet itself. “We’ll have three very distinct products that will address those three segments, from thrift to luxury, and all within an appropriate cost structure to match,” said Saretsky. WestJet won’t see its first Dreamliner 787s delivered until 2019, with the option of buying another 10 between 2020 and 2024. The ultra-low cost carrier, or ULCC, should be in operation by early next year with a no-frills structure modelled from the likes of European carriers Ryanair and easyJet. “The focus on the ULCC is to have the absolutely, rock-bottom entry fare, and then you pay as you consume for all the other products and services,” Saretsky said. Saretsky said the new carrier’s costs would be about 6.5 cents per available seat mile, compared with 10 cents for its WestJet operations, as it does away with free extras like snacks and baggage and squeezes more travellers into the planes. Related stories: WestJet to launch low-cost carrier late this year WestJet pilot orders pizza for rerouted Air Canada passengers in Fredericton The new offering would focus on leisure travel routes not served by WestJet to avoid cannibalizing its own business, with Saretsky saying one of the target markets is the 5.5 million flights Canadians take from airports just across the U.S. border. The company is also pushing to lower costs across its operations, with plans to add another row of seats to its to its existing 737-700s and 800s, and to shift more customer service online and away from call centres. WestJet’s expansion plans come as the company faces another pilot union drive, with voting set to begin on whether to join the Air Line Pilots Association. The plans also come as the company emerges from a tough quarter after a record number of weather interruptions, pushing first quarter net earnings down to $48.3 million or 41 cents per share from $87.6 million or 71 cents per share last year WestJet shares have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly a month. They were at $22.00 at midday, down 84 cents. Join the conversation Cancel reply Sign in to comment. You're logged in as . Edit Profile | Logout. Loading profile... Unexpected error.

Many of the firms have seen their stock prices rise in the first 100 days of President Trump’s administration. ADVERTISEMENT But the uptick in stock prices appears to have more to do with the anticipation of higher profits than with gains driven by the new administration. Analysts are predicting a flat year for major defense contractors, partly because it’s unclear whether Trump will be able to get an expansion of defense spending through Congress, as he has promised. “Until we see an across-the-board increase in funding, I think it’s hard to project big and consistent gains for the defense contractors,” one defense consultant said. “Even then, a ton of that funding is pegged for readiness accounts, and that’s not a place where all the big guys play.” Trump’s budget for next year calls for $603 billion in defense spending, a $54 billion increase from what is now expected. He had also hoped to win a $30 billion boost in defense spending for the rest of this year. But he’s not going to get that much. Lawmakers this week are expected to pass a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the government funded through the end of September that will include only $15 billion in additional defense spending. Even after the government is funded for the rest of fiscal 2017, it’s far from certain that the defense boost in the Trump budget can make it through Congress, with Democrats demanding that any increase be matched by new spending on domestic programs. “It’s beginning to sink in that Trump’s defense increases might not happen,” said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute.  While expectations are dimming in Washington, defense companies are still riding high on Wall Street. Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, United Technologies and Raytheon last week all notched double-digit jumps in their quarterly earnings from last year. At Lockheed Martin, earnings dipped but sales rose. At least some of the success has been attributed to hopes that Trump and his desire to expand the military will benefit defense companies. Wall Street has been on the upswing since Trump’s election, fueled by broader hopes that a Republican-led Congress and White House will cut regulations and taxes, sparking investment in the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average surged 8 percentage points from Election Day to Trump’s inauguration, and is up 6 points more since them. Some defense firms’ stock shares are up even more. Since Trump was elected in November, Lockheed’s shares   increased 13 percent, to about $270. Raytheon’s is up more than 15 percent, to $156, while Boeing’s stock has risen 28 percent to approximately $183. General Dynamics saw its stock price rise 27 percent, to approximately $195. But experts say the rise in those stock prices might not last. “The growth in earnings we’re seeing now is more of a reflection of how companies positioned themselves to handle the drawdown than anything else,” said Todd Harrison, the head of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “So far, there has been no boost in defense spending from Trump, and given the budget politics in Washington, there is not likely to be a big increase anytime soon.” The defense firms have cut workforces through layoffs, buyouts and job reductions, which had the effect of boosting their earnings. “The way you save money in the defense industry is by the eliminating jobs,” Thompson said. “Nobody likes to talk about it, but labor is the biggest driver of cost.” Boeing, for instance, cut more than 7,350 jobs, or 8 percent of its commercial workforce, in 2016 through a combination of layoffs, buyouts and not replacing workers. More cuts are expected this year. The CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg, last week said the company sees opportunities ahead but warned of the uncertainty in Washington. “We’re in the marketplace to compete, and we have opportunities, especially if the U.S. defense budget continues to strengthen,” Muilenburg said, according to CNBC. “But I will put that caveat on it: We need to see a long-term, stable, strong defense budget in the U.S.” Layoffs across the defense and aerospace industries have jumped to 4,496 so far this year, compared with 2,404 at the same point in 2016, according to research from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm that tracks employment trends. Defense companies have also bought back considerable amounts of stock to keep their earnings-per-share up, Thompson said. “Northrop Grumman has bought back a third of its shares since the decade started,” he said. Wesley Bush, Northrop Grumman’s CEO, expressed frustration with Congress’s decision to again pass a stopgap funding bill. “We’re in, at this point, one of the longest-running CRs that I can remember, which is unfortunate,” Bush said, according to CNBC.   View the discussion thread.

(TSX:WJA) has set out a plan to expand both internationally and into ultra-low cost offerings that has raised concerns from some analysts about being overly ambitious. The company said Tuesday it has ordered 10 Boeing Dreamliners with the option for 10 more, that will allow it to serve new destinations in Asia, South America and Europe with higher-end offerings like lie-flat seating. The move comes as WestJet is also moving ahead with a plan to launch a separate ultra-low cost brand that will start with 10 planes and offer a bare-bones service. WestJet Airlines President & CEO Gregg Saretsky speaks during the company's annual general meeting in Calgary on Tuesday. (Photo: Larry MacDougal/CP) Combined, the new avenues of thrift and luxury set the company up for a new era of growth, said chief executive Gregg Saretsky at WestJet's annual meeting Tuesday. "The opportunity to expand both in the low cost space, while at the same time growing our long-haul business, is something that creates a platform for future growth that has been unprecedented in our 21-year history,'' he said. National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen responded to the plan by lowering his rating of WestJet to underperform, citing in part the company's overall ultra-low cost strategy, the significant money that will be needed to expand abroad and the complications of doing both at the same time. "We are concerned WestJet has too many new strategic initiatives underway simultaneously, which could impair successful execution,'' wrote Doerksen in an analyst note. "The opportunity to expand both in the low cost space, while at the same time growing our long-haul business, is something that creates a platform for future growth that has been unprecedented in our 21-year history."—WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky WestJet shares have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly a month. They were at $22.03 in mid-afternoon trading, down 81 cents or about 3.6 per cent. Saretsky said at the annual meeting that WestJet's recent experience of starting its Encore regional brand sets it up well for the task. "It's a lot of work, but only three years ago we started a brand-new airline, which has grown from nothing to 45 aircraft, so I believe we have all the foundations to make starting two new initiatives really quite doable,'' he said. Doerksen said in his note, however, that international routes add a greater degree of complexity and that while the actual cost of the 10 new planes is likely much lower than the list price of $7.4 billion, it is still significant.

(Photo: Mic Smith/CP via AP) WestJet has reduced some of the complexity of the plan by spacing out the launches, with the first Dreamliner 787s not scheduled to be delivered until 2019, well after it expects to launch its discount brand. The ultra-low cost carrier, or ULCC, should be in operation by early next year with a no-frills structure modelled from the likes of European carriers Ryanair and easyJet. "The focus on the ULCC is to have the absolutely, rock-bottom entry fare, and then you pay as you consume for all the other products and services,'' Saretsky said on the conference call. Discount airline would ditch snacks, squeeze more travellers into planes Saretsky said the new discount airline's costs would be about 6.5 cents per available seat mile, compared with 10 cents for its WestJet operations, as it does away with free extras like snacks and squeezes more travellers into the planes. The new offering will focus on leisure travel routes not served by WestJet to avoid cannibalizing its own business, with Saretsky saying one of the target markets is the 5.5 million flights Canadians take from airports just across the U.S. border. The company is also pushing to lower costs across its operations, with plans to add another row of seats to its to its existing 737-700s and 800s, and to shift more customer service online and away from call centres. WestJet's expansion plans come as the company faces another pilot union drive, with voting set to begin on whether to join the Air Line Pilots Association. The plans also come as the company emerges from a tough quarter after a record number of weather interruptions, pushing first quarter net earnings down to $48.3 million or 41 cents per share from $87.6 million or 71 cents per share last year.

The painting crew was made up of people from four countries, five states, two provinces and 12 cities, according to WestJet. WestJet estimates that over the course of the next five years, the Magic Plane will fly more than 400,000 travellers nearly eight million kilometres. According to WestJet, the cookies served on board of the Magic Plane will be in the shape of Disney characters. WestJet says the two sides of the plane are mirror images of each other, in all aspects but one. The company would not say what that is. A total of 36 different colours were applied to the aircraft, says WestJet More than 150 donuts were consumed during the painting of the Magic Plane.

Wall Street also kept an eye on the Federal Reserve, with the central bank kicking off a two-day monetary policy meeting. The Fed, however, is not expected to shift monetary policy when their meeting concludes. Market expectations for a rate hike following this meeting are just 4.8 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. That said, investors will be looking for more clues about the Fed's plan to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. "The FOMC has always encountered turbulence when trying to 'land the plane.' Reducing an inventory of $4.5T of fixed income securities to something far more stable presents the biggest challenge of the most protracted and complex tightening cycle facing the central bank since its founding in 1913," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note to clients. Load Error The U.S. central bank raised rates at its March meeting, pushing the overnight funds rate to a target range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Investors also looked ahead to a slew of economic data due later this week, including the April jobs report, which is due Friday. "We have some more data later this week, so I'd expect [relative] volatility to pick up in the coming days," said Matt Weller, senior market analyst at Faraday Research. Equities closed mixed on Monday after a brief shock stemming from President Donald Trump's comments on breaking up the big banks. In an interview with Bloomberg, Trump said he was "looking at that right now." Stocks declined sharply after Trump's remarks but managed to rebound. "That seems pretty alarming, but if you look beyond the headlines, the Vix sustained those levels for most of 2004 and 2005," said Faraday's Weller. "So it may not be indicative that a top is near." In economic news, U.S. automakers will be releasing monthly sales numbers throughout the day. Earnings season continued, with Mondelez and Gilead Sciences set to report after the bell.

EVERETT — The Boeing Co. added a sixth test plane to its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program. The aerospace giant expects the additional tanker will help it complete remaining ground and flight tests. Boeing is slated to deliver the first KC-46 Pegasus tanker to the U.S. Air Force later this year, later than the contract’s deadline to hand over the first 18 aircraft. The new test plane will verify that electromagnetic fields produced by radars and other systems will not affect the KC-46s, which are based on Boeing’s 767 and assembled in Everett. So far, the KC-46 test aircraft have flown more than 1,600 flight hours. “Adding another tanker will help us to become even more efficient and significantly improve our ability to complete test points going forward,” said Jeanette Croppi, Boeing KC-46 tanker test team director.   Most Read Next stop NASA as Arlington grad rockets to top of her field ARLINGTON — Jennifer Domanowski remembers her high school astronomy teacher suggesting she… May 1st, 2017 by Kari Bray Sporting goods, restaurant to replace Sears at Alderwood LYNNWOOD — Alderwood mall plans to demolish the former Sears and replace… May 2nd, 2017 by Jim Davis Super Kid Jackson High senior has sights set on global justice Micaiah Anderson, 18, leads the Multi-Cultural Club at school and is planning… May 1st, 2017 by Chris Winters Everett School Board president steps down to focus on health EVERETT — Ted Wenta has stepped down from his role as president… May 1st, 2017 by Chris Winters New law helps inmates earn workforce-type college degrees OLYMPIA — Taxpayers have long funded programs enabling inmates to get a… May 1st, 2017 by Jerry Cornfield © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Aviation News: Jeppesen and Teledyne Controls to Deliver Increased Airline Data Connectivity through New Agreement Englewood, Colo. | 02 May 2017 | By Jeppesen and Teledyne Controls Jeppesen, a Boeing Company, has teamed with Teledyne Controls to integrate Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro with Teledyne’s GroundLink® Comm+ system with Aircraft Interface Device (AID) functionality, known as GroundLink® AID+. This will deliver greater data connectivity for carriers using FliteDeck Pro, the leading electronic flight bag (EFB) solution for airlines and large-scale operators. “Advances gained through use of Teledyne’s GroundLink® AID+ technology will continue the wave of new capabilities delivered through FliteDeck Pro to help operators access and process critical flight data,” said Scott Reagan, director, Jeppesen OEM Client Management. “Based on strong customer demand for this capability, we are pleased to team with Teledyne Controls to connect FliteDeck Pro with additional data sources, creating more intelligent capabilities on the ground and in the air.” GroundLink® AID+ technology from Teledyne will allow airlines to view real-time GPS-based, ownship positioning on navigational charts to increase situational awareness in flight. Specifically, this alliance between Jeppesen and Teledyne allows airport charts, departure charts, enroute and weather maps and arrival charts in FliteDeck Pro to be quickly and easily integrated with data from the aircraft’s existing onboard data systems to help enable the pilot to make better informed decisions to increase operational efficiency and improve safety margins. Murray Skelton, director of Business Development at Teledyne Controls, notes that the technical integration has been easy and cost-effective: “With approximately 10,000 GroundLink® units already flying, it is an easy transition for those with the technology already installed. It not only protects their legacy investment but it also enables them to make even more of it. It means that every future customer with the GroundLink® Comm+ system installed can gain instant benefit.” The integrated solution will be demonstrated at the AEEC/AMC Conference in Milwaukee, WI (May 1–4). Connectivity provides the pilot with access to the EFB at all times. Pre-flight, pilots can update their EFB database, review maintenance logs, Minimum Equipment Lists (MELs), flight release and notices to airmen (NOTAMs). During the ramp/taxi, they can calculate take-off performance and complete their checklist. During the flight, they can log flight progress and review enroute, arrivals and approach charts. After the flight, they can file the pilot log and send performance calculations off-board.

(BA) remains coy on its plans to launch a fourth version of its new 737 MAX family, the company has revealed its thinking on perhaps the thorniest problem facing the company as it comes to decision on the new 737-10. The plane would be the largest in the 737 MAX family and is expected to seat 189 passengers in a conventional dual-class cabin and to have a range of 3,000 to 3,300 nautical miles. The issue the company is wrestling with is a design for a new landing gear. The 737-10 would be 66 inches longer than the 737-9. Those extra inches require Boeing to modify the proposed plane's main landing gear to ensure adequate clearance of the longer body for takeoffs and landings. It may sound simple, but apparently it is not. ALSO READ: Analysts Getting More Positive on Boeing for 2017 and 2018 Boeing has a number of goals for the 737-10. First among them a strong challenger to the Airbus A320neo, a plane designed to carry 193 passengers over a similar range. That said, Boeing wants to limit both the cost of the new plane and get it to market as soon as possible. Many analysts expect Boeing to launch the plane this summer with a delivery date of 2020. Some potential customers for the 737-10 believe the aircraft has to meet a first delivery date in 2019. Designing a workable landing gear is probably the key to keeping the cost down and meeting a 2019 deadline for first deliveries. ALSO READ: Boeing’s Dilemma: 1 New Airplane or 2 to Address Middle Market? Now for a little inside baseball. Boeing's general manager for the 737 MAX program, Keith Leverkuhn, told Aviation Week how the company envisions the landing gear to work: [Boeing is focused] the upper portion of the gear as it integrates with the actuator. [Our new design will include] clever folding using a link mechanism at the top. [The lower part of the gear leg will include] an additional shock strut that fits inside the same forging. This moves the contact point aft a little bit. That's fundamentally what we are doing and yes, it will look like a trailing link gear. We want to make it maintainable, reliable, and we are going to need that gear to get the performance we want out of the -10 but I'm confident in the solution set. ALSO READ: Should Boeing Worry as China Preps Jetliner for First Flight? Boeing sees a market of about 1,000 for the 737-10. Is that really enough to build a new plane that may be just an interim solution to the "middle of the market" problem the company is looking at solving with an all-new dual-aisle replacement for the 767 that has been dubbed the 797?

The EPAWSS serves as an upgrades for the Digital Electronic Warfare System, or DEWS, which was released in 2008, and is part of an effort to modernize the F-15 and keep it in service for several more decades, the company announced on Tuesday. "The EPAWSS Critical Design Review is an important step toward providing our F-15 air crew with a world class defensive and jamming system that will bring them home safely," Col. Tim Baily, F-15 program manager for the U.S. Air Force, said in a press release. "Hats off to Boeing and BAE Systems for the impressive work that went into these reviews. Their efforts provide the foundation required to rapidly deliver this capability to the field." The EPAWSS is an advanced electronic warfare suite meant to analyze and jam enemy radars and missiles. In particular, it is meant to help counter enemy jamming and air-defense systems and help detect and counter enemy radar. The system completed its CDR in February, which followed a successful test of the overall warfare suite installed by BAE at the end of 2016. "Our entire team is driven by the importance of providing this enhanced EW technology to our warfighters in a timely manner," said Brian Walters, vice president and general manager of electronic combat solutions at BAE. "EPAWSS provides a critical capability, and it is our mission to provide this capability on or ahead of schedule."

(TSX:WJA) has set out a plan to expand both internationally and into ultra-low cost offerings that has raised concerns from some analysts about being overly ambitious. The company said Tuesday it has ordered 10 Boeing Dreamliners with the option for 10 more, that will allow it to serve new destinations in Asia, South America and Europe with higher-end offerings like lie-flat seating. The move comes as WestJet is also moving ahead with a plan to launch a separate ultra-low cost brand that will start with 10 planes and offer a bare-bones service. Combined, the new avenues of thrift and luxury set the company up for a new era of growth, said chief executive Gregg Saretsky at WestJet’s annual meeting Tuesday. “The opportunity to expand both in the low cost space, while at the same time growing our long-haul business, is something that creates a platform for future growth that has been unprecedented in our 21-year history,” he said. National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen responded to the plan by lowering his rating of WestJet to underperform, citing in part the company’s overall ultra-low cost strategy, the significant money that will be needed to expand abroad and the complications of doing both at the same time. “We are concerned WestJet has too many new strategic initiatives underway simultaneously, which could impair successful execution,” wrote Doerksen in an analyst note. WestJet shares have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly a month. They were at $22.03 in mid-afternoon trading, down 81 cents or about 3.6 per cent. Saretsky said at the annual meeting that WestJet’s recent experience of starting its Encore regional brand sets it up well for the task. “It’s a lot of work, but only three years ago we started a brand-new airline, which has grown from nothing to 45 aircraft, so I believe we have all the foundations to make starting two new initiatives really quite doable,” he said. Doerksen said in his note, however, that international routes add a greater degree of complexity and that while the actual cost of the 10 new planes is likely much lower than the list price of $7.4 billion, it is still significant. WestJet has reduced some of the complexity of the plan by spacing out the launches, with the first Dreamliner 787s not scheduled to be delivered until 2019, well after it expects to launch its discount brand. The ultra-low cost carrier, or ULCC, should be in operation by early next year with a no-frills structure modelled from the likes of European carriers Ryanair and easyJet. “The focus on the ULCC is to have the absolutely, rock-bottom entry fare, and then you pay as you consume for all the other products and services,” Saretsky said on the conference call. Saretsky said the new discount airline’s costs would be about 6.5 cents per available seat mile, compared with 10 cents for its WestJet operations, as it does away with free extras like snacks and squeezes more travellers into the planes. The new offering will focus on leisure travel routes not served by WestJet to avoid cannibalizing its own business, with Saretsky saying one of the target markets is the 5.5 million flights Canadians take from airports just across the U.S. border. The company is also pushing to lower costs across its operations, with plans to add another row of seats to its to its existing 737-700s and 800s, and to shift more customer service online and away from call centres. WestJet’s expansion plans come as the company faces another pilot union drive, with voting set to begin on whether to join the Air Line Pilots Association. The plans also come as the company emerges from a tough quarter after a record number of weather interruptions, pushing first quarter net earnings down to $48.3 million or 41 cents per share from $87.6 million or 71 cents per share last year.

More The foundation also presented the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement (RNASA) Stellar Awards.  Guidry News attended and gathered remarks from three guests during the reception prior to the awards program: Board of Advisors Member Charles M. Stegemoeller explained the nominee  selection process. Listen Mid Career Nominee Mirka Caro of SAIC spoke about the leadership she was being recognized for.  Listen Robert Fanick of San Antonio,Texas, father of Nominee Bryan E. Fanick of the USAF, spoke of his pride in his son's accomplishments and how much he was enjoying his first time to attend the annual event.  Listen Every year, the aerospace community anxiously awaits the announcement of the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement (RNASA) Stellar Award winners.  The 2017 Stellar Awards Evaluation Panel, Dr. Glynn Lunney, Arnold Aldrich, Colonel Eileen Collins, and Michael Coats selected the winners based on which accomplishments hold the greatest promise for furthering future activities in space and how well they meet the goal of recognizing heroes of the space program. Out of 149 nominations received, the panel selected 25 individuals and 7 teams for recognition. Prior to the evening's festivities, all nominees were treated to a behind-the-scenes tour of the Johnson Space Center and a luncheon at the Lakewood Yacht Club in Seabrook. Stellar Awards Committee Chair Jennifer Devolites welcomed the nominees and then said, "You are here because you are excellent.” She asked the nominees to consider using their excellence to provide leadership to others, take on mentoring, and to also take risks and get outside of their comfort zones with regard to what they already do well. Colonel Jeffrey Williams was the featured speaker at the Stellar Awards Luncheon. His spaceflight experience includes four missions. His first flight was aboard Atlantis on STS-101 in 2000 where he served as the flight engineer and lead spacewalker. Williams would serve as Flight Engineer on three more missions including Expeditions 13 (March 2006), 21/22 (September 2009) and 47/48 (March 2016) all of which launched aboard the Russian Soyuz from  Kazakhstan. During his 534 days in space, Williams conducted five spacewalks and contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science. Each nominee received a Fisher Space Pen donated by the company as well as a copy of the book “Hidden Figures” by Margot Lee Shetterly. The Fisher Space Pen was originally carried by the astronauts of the Apollo moon missions and is still used on manned space flights to this day. They are precision assembled, hand tested, and guaranteed to perform underwater, at any angle including upside down, in extreme temperatures, and of course in zero gravity. All the Stellar nominees had their photo taken as they received a special commemorative certificate with a United States flag that was flown in space. The Stellar Award winners were announced at the RNASA evening gala on April 28, 2017 by Astronaut Dr. Kjell Lindgren and Astronaut Dr. Kate Rubins who presented them with engraved marble trophies donated by Orbital ATK. The winners in each of the four categories, Early Career, Mid Career, Late Career and Team are:  2017 Stellar Award Winners in the Early Career Category Chelsea Shepherd of SGT – Outstanding dedication, leadership, and support to assembly and maintenance operations for the ISS.

This agreement includes commitments for 10 Boeing 787-9 aircraft to be delivered between the first quarter of 2019 and December 2021, with options for an additional 10 aircraft to be delivered between 2020 and 2024. The airline also announced it has selected General Electric’s GEnx-1B engine for the 787. “This order represents an exciting new chapter in WestJet’s history,” said Gregg Saretsky, WestJet President and CEO. “We have carefully executed on our strategic plan, first launching WestJet Encore to connect smaller communities across Canada to our growing network followed by our successful venture into wide-body flying to Hawaii and London Gatwick. Now, with the most sophisticated commercial airliner available, we turn our attention to further growing our international presence and introducing even more travellers to our award-winning guest experience.” The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is a state-of-the-art aircraft that is 20 per cent more fuel efficient than the Boeing 767 aircraft. With a range of more than 14,000 kilometres, the Dreamliner will give WestJet the ability to serve new destinations in Asia and South America, and to expand its service offerings into the European market. “We welcome WestJet to the Dreamliner family and look forward to the new destinations they will serve,” said Ray Conner, Vice Chairman of The Boeing Company. “WestJet, for its entire 21-year history, has been a loyal all-Boeing jet customer and we’re excited to see them expand their fleet with the 787.” “Our ability to compete globally and deliver our plan comes from the hard work and dedication of our more than 12,000 WestJetters and I am excited for what this news represents for them,” continued Gregg Saretsky. “They are truly representative of our Canadian values of warm hospitality and openness and on behalf of them, we now turn our attention to welcoming the Dreamliner to the WestJet family.” As part of this purchase agreement, WestJet is converting 15 firm orders for the Boeing 737 MAX that were to be delivered between 2019 and 2021 to options available between 2022 and 2024.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon WestJet Airlines is expanding its international reach with the purchase of at least 10 Dreamliner aircraft from Boeing Co., part of a larger strategy that will see the Calgary-based airline look for growth in both ultra-low-cost and longer-haul segments.  WestJet announced Tuesday that it is scheduled to receive 10 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners between the first quarter of 2019 and December 2021, and has an option to buy an additional 10 airplanes to be delivered between 2020 and 2024. The purchase of the wide-body, longer-route jets — which are more fuel-efficient than the Boeing 767 — will allow the company to serve new destinations in Asia and South America, as well as expand its European service. “Growth is still an important component of our future, but that growth now has to come from further afield,” president and chief executive officer Gregg Saretsky said in an interview, pointing to WestJet’s initial expansion of service to Europe three years ago.  “This is the next phase of that chapter of growth… these planes will both replace the old 767s that we started this journey on and give us longer legs to fly longer haul missions into places like Asia and Latin America.”  While it gears up to expand its international reach, WestJet is also preparing to launch an ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC). Details about product offerings and fare levels have yet to be released, but Saretsky said the branding will be distinct and separate from WestJet, and the ULCC would be similar to that offered by EasyJet and RyanAir in Europe.  Saretsky also said the purchase of the Dreamliners — which will be funded from cash from operations with no additional net debt — is an opportunity for the company to diversify revenues. Related WestJet Airlines plans to launch ultra-low-cost carrier by the end of the year WestJet announces 105 new flights a week from Montreal, Quebec City for a 74% bump in service “As an airline with 40 per cent of our capacity to, from or within Alberta, there is absolutely no way to avoid the hit that comes from a market that has shrunk by a billion dollars when you’re so heavily over-indexed,” Saretsky said on a call with analysts Tuesday morning. “We are to some degree dependent on Alberta coming back, but we are moving assets away from Alberta, and certainly the wide body, into markets where we think there are opportunities to drive the (return on invested capital) to 13 to 16 per cent.” Chris Murray, an analyst with AltaCorp Capital Inc., said he is cautious on the introduction of the wide-body fleet, due to capacity management and cost concerns. “We still struggle to see the economic rationale of the wide-body strategy in any form that brings them into a different part of the space where perhaps they don’t have a more competitive offering,” he said.  “Part of the challenge is getting a lot of return to justify the capital.”  Saretsky dismissed concerns that WestJet was taking on too much risk simultaneously expanding into ultra-low-cost and luxury markets. “While some are expressing concerns that this represents perhaps execution risk expanding at both ends of the spectrum at one time, ultimately it’s in service of creating great value for guests, whether their flying short, medium or long-haul travel,” he said.  In a note released Tuesday, Macquarie analyst Konark Gupta wrote that he was encouraged by the order of 10 Dreamliners for further international expansion. “Boeing 787 has been highly successful at WestJet’s main domestic competitor, Air Canada, and should drive (cost per available seat mile) significantly lower while enabling revenue growth opportunities,” he wrote.  Gupta also estimated that net capital expenditure could increase by at least $650-million over several years starting in 2017 as a result of the new purchasing order. WestJet announced a 45-per-cent drop in net profits in the first quarter Tuesday, on the back of higher fuel costs. Fuel costs per litre were up from 47 to 64 cents, an increase of 36 per cent. Aircraft fuel was WestJet’s largest operating expense, up 42 per cent to $245.6 million, from $166.4 million the same time last year.  Westjet reported profits of $48.3 million, or 41 cents per share, down from $87.6 million, or 71 cents per share, one year earlier. Revenue per available seat mile, a measure of airline efficiency that divides operating income by carrying capacity, increased 2.3 per cent from a year earlier to 14.5 cents after eight straight quarters of decline. Cost per available seat mile (CASM), a measure of how much an airline spends to fly passengers, also increased 7.8 per cent per cent to 13.4 cents. WestJet ended the day down 3.24 per cent to $22.10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. asiekierska@postmedia.com Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

The Netherlands has signed for a further two CH-47F Chinooks to add to the 12 contracted in 2016 and the six that were received from 2012. (IHS Markit/Patrick Allen) The modification was announced by the US Department of Defense (DoD) on 28 April, and should see all 14 helicopters delivered to the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) by 31 December 2020. While the DoD notification said that the agreement covered both newbuilding and remanufactured platforms, Boeing told Jane's that all 14 Chinooks will be newbuildings. Although the contract modification was listed at USD541.1 million, Boeing said that only a portion of this relates to the Netherlands (the rest is for Lot 15 US Army platforms).

The Trent XWB Engine Aircraft are safe because they go through rigorous checks before they take to the skies, writes Ashwini Phadnis We have all heard that the aircraft we fly in are ‘safe’ because they go through gruelling tests before taking to the skies. But just how brutal are these tests? Well, very. First, let’s look at tests for the the engine, the heart of an aircraft. According to engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, the most “exciting” test for an aircraft engine is the ‘Fan Blade Off Test’ as the company has to ensure that the engine is at its maximum thrust and rotational speed when the fan blade “breaks”. “Effectively, what we are doing is artificially breaking that fan blade off the engine for which we need a small explosion and then catching (the parts) in the casing that is outside,” explains Peter Johnson, Head of Marketing for Fleets, Rolls-Royce. The test is done to check if the pieces of a broken blade will be caught successfully by the fan case, preventing them from going further inside the engine and causing an explosion. During the test, which costs millions of pounds, one engine is destroyed. “European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) sets out all the tests that we have to complete. We also do our own testing to make sure that everything is working as we want it, and the engines perform at the level we want them to,” he says. Nothing is left to chance. Not even a bird hit. For this test, EASA specifies the weight of the bird, the speed of the bird and also where it goes into the front end of the engine. “We have to broadly do two sets of tests — one with a large bird and the second a medium-sized bird test where you have to fire six or seven smaller birds that give quite a big shock to the fan system, the first part of the engine that they will hit,” Johnson points out. Extreme conditions The rest of the aircraft too goes through similar gruelling tests. Given that aircraft produced by both Airbus and Boeing criss-cross the globe daily, sometimes taking off from an airport in sub-zero temperature and landing in the middle of a desert in West Asia, it is imperative that these machines undergo specific tests to handle these extreme weather conditions. Commonly called the cold soak and hot and high tests, these see an aircraft being powered up, including its systems and engines, under extreme conditions. For the Airbus A-380 extreme weather trials, Airbus flew the aircraft from Northern Canada to the desert heat in the Gulf and in the high altitudes of Ethiopia and Colombia, while the A-350 XWB (ExtraWidebody) evaluations included cold weather testing in Iqaluit, Canada, high altitude evaluations in La Paz Bolivia and a hot weather campaign in Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates. There’s more The two manufacturers also have a fatigue test which examines how the main aircraft structure responds to everyday operationsover a long period of time. This covers different stages of an operation, such as taxiing, take-off, cruising and landing. Then there is also the flutter test or flight vibration test to examine the behaviour of an aircraft structure when subjected to aerodynamic disturbances throughout the flight envelope. At the first flight of the Boeing 787-10 in South Carolina recently, Captain Craig Bomben, Vice President, Flight Operations, Boeing, said the pilots flying the first flight would have been in the aircraft for the past week (before the first test flight) doing taxi tests. “Teams start preparing for the first flight months ahead with engineering teams in a simulator to develop the profile of the flight and test systems,” he pointed out. Boeing also did the Service Ready Operational Validation (SROV) for Boeing 737 MAX with launch customer Southwest Airlines taking the MAX to several airports in the airline’s system to simulate real-life conditions. The Boeing 737 MAX is Boeing’s first new aircraft in the second century of its operations (Boeing completed 100 years in 2016). Using the MAX test airplane over a six-day period, pilots from Southwest and Boeing flew routes from Love Field in Dallas to cities including Albuquerque, Denver, Chicago, Austin and Phoenix. Southwest’s maintenance and ground crews at each airport got hands-on experience, doing everything from towing and fuelling the airplane, to conducting fit checks of ground support equipment and performing maintenance. Incidentally, a few years ago Boeing performed SROV activities with the 787, taking the Dreamliner to Japan for similar exercises with ANA.

enhance capabilities of Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro EFB solution News provided by Jeppesen 02 May, 2017, 11:41 ET Share this article ENGLEWOOD, Colo., May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Jeppesen, a Boeing Company, has teamed with Teledyne Controls to integrate Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro with Teledyne's GroundLink® Comm+ system with Aircraft Interface Device (AID) functionality, known as GroundLink® AID+. This will deliver greater data connectivity for carriers using FliteDeck Pro, the leading electronic flight bag (EFB) solution for airlines and large-scale operators. "Advances gained through use of Teledyne's GroundLink® AID+ technology will continue the wave of new capabilities delivered through FliteDeck Pro to help operators access and process critical flight data," said Scott Reagan, director, Jeppesen OEM Client Management. "Based on strong customer demand for this capability, we are pleased to team with Teledyne Controls to connect FliteDeck Pro with additional data sources, creating more intelligent capabilities on the ground and in the air."    GroundLink® AID+ technology from Teledyne will allow airlines to view real-time GPS-based, ownship positioning on navigational charts to increase situational awareness in flight. Specifically, this alliance between Jeppesen and Teledyne allows airport charts, departure charts, enroute and weather maps and arrival charts in FliteDeck Pro to be quickly and easily integrated with data from the aircraft's existing onboard data systems to help enable the pilot to make better informed decisions to increase operational efficiency and improve safety margins. Murray Skelton, director of Business Development at Teledyne Controls, notes that the technical integration has been easy and cost-effective: "With approximately 10,000 GroundLink® units already flying, it is an easy transition for those with the technology already installed. It not only protects their legacy investment but it also enables them to make even more of it. It means that every future customer with the GroundLink® Comm+ system installed can gain instant benefit." The integrated solution will be demonstrated at the AEEC/AMC Conference in Milwaukee, WI (May 1–4). Connectivity provides the pilot with access to the EFB at all times. Pre-flight, pilots can update their EFB database, review maintenance logs, Minimum Equipment Lists (MELs), flight release and notices to airmen (NOTAMs). During the ramp/taxi, they can calculate take-off performance and complete their checklist. During the flight, they can log flight progress and review enroute, arrivals and approach charts. After the flight, they can file the pilot log and send performance calculations off-board.

Scroll Staff Published Yesterday · 12:35 pm.   SpaceX/Twitter Aerospace company Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or SpaceX as it is better known, launched a Falcon9 rocket carrying the company’s first-ever spy satellite for the United States military from Florida on Monday. This broke a 10-year monopoly held by Lockheed Martin and Boeing over American military contracts, Reuters reported. The 23-storey-tall rocket took off from the Kennedy Space Center at 7.15 am (local time). It will put into orbit a classified satellite for the US National Reconnaissance Office, an agency within the Defense Department that operates the nation’s spy satellites. Nine minutes after takeoff, the rocket’s main section touched down on a landing pad at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The National Reconnaissance Office bought SpaceX’s launch services via a contract with Ball Aerospace, a Colorado-based satellite and instrument builder. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. The company’s founder, Elon Musk, has fought for years to dislodge United Launch Alliance, Lockheed Martin-Boeing partnership, from the military’s launch business. He even sued the US Air Force in 2014 over its exclusive multi-billion-dollar contract with the partnership. SpaceX later dropped the suit after the military agreed to open more launch contracts to competitive bidding.

Published Apr 18, 2017.   Wikimedia Commons Apr 18, 2017.   Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print With twenty-nine states and over 50 ethnic groups, India’s diversity is mind-boggling to most foreigners. This diversity manifests itself across areas from clothing to art and especially to food. With globalisation, growth of international travel and availability of international ingredients, the culinary diversity of India has become progressively richer. New trends in food are continuously introduced to the Indian palate and are mainly driven by the demands of generation Y. Take the example of schezwan idlis and dosas. These traditional South Indian snacks have been completely transformed by simply adding schezwan sauce to them – creating a dish that is distinctly Indian, but with an international twist. We also have the traditional thepla transformed into thepla tacos – combining the culinary flavours of India and Mexico! And cous cous and quinoa upma – where niche global ingredients are being used to recreate a beloved local dish. Millennials want a true fusion of foreign flavours and ingredients with Indian dishes to create something both Indian and international.

Is it just the growing need for versatility in the culinary experiences of millennials? Or is it greater exposure to varied cultures and their food habits? It’s a mix of both. Research points to the rising trend to seek out new cuisines that are not only healthy, but are also different and inspired by international flavours. The global food trend of ‘deconstruction’ where a food item is broken down into its component flavours and then reconstructed using completely different ingredients is also catching on for Indian food. Restaurants like Masala Library (Mumbai), Farzi Café (Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru) and Pink Poppadum (Bengaluru) are pushing the boundaries of what traditional Indian food means. Things like a kulcha pizza, dal chaawal cutlet and chutney foam are no longer inconceivable. Food outlets that stock exotic ingredients and brands that sell traditional Indian packaged snacks in entirely new flavours are also becoming more common across cities. When it comes to the flavours themselves, some have been embraced more than others. Schezwan sauce, as we’ve mentioned, is now so popular that it is sometimes even served with traditional chakna at Indian bars. Our fascination with the spicy red sauce is however slowly being challenged by other flavours. Wasabi introduced to Indian foodies in Japanese restaurants has become a hit among spice loving Indians with its unique kick. Peri Peri, known both for its heat and tanginess, on the other hand was popularised by the famous UK chain Nandos. And finally, there is the barbeque flavour – the condiment has been a big part of India’s love for American fast food. Another Indian snack that has been infused with international flavours is the beloved aloo bhujia. While the traditional gram-flour bhujia was first produced in 1877 in the princely state of Bikaner in Rajasthan, aloo bhujia came into existence once manufacturers started experimenting with different flavours. Future Consumer Limited’s leading food brand Tasty Treat continues to experiment with the standard aloo bhujia to cater to the evolving consumer tastes. Keeping the popularity of international flavours in mind, Tasty Treat’s has come up with a range of Firangi Bhujia, an infusion of traditional aloo bhujia with four of the most craved international flavours – Wasabi, Peri Peri, Barbeque and Schezwan. Tasty Treat’s range of Firangi Bhujia has increased the versatility of the traditional aloo bhujia. Many foodies are already trying out different ways to use it as a condiment to give their favourite dish an extra kick. Archana’s Kitchen recommends pairing the schezwan flavoured Firangi Bhujia with manchow soup to add some crunch. Kalyan Karmakar sprinkled the peri peri flavoured Firangi Bhujia over freshly made poha to give a unique taste to a regular breakfast item. Many others have picked a favourite amongst the four flavours, some admiring the smoky flavour of barbeque Firangi Bhujia and some enjoying the fiery taste of the peri peri flavour. Add some crunch to your manchurian Spice up your Chinese Bhel and Manchow Soup Be it the kick of wasabi in the crunch of bhujia, a bhujia sandwich with peri peri zing, maska pav spiced with schezwan bhujia or barbeque bhujia with a refreshing cold beverage - the new range of Firangi Bhujia manages to balance the novelty of exotic flavours with the familiarity of tradition.

(WJA.TO) said it has signed a definitive purchase agreement with Boeing Co. (BA) for up to 20 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft. The purchase of the fuel-efficient aircraft will enable the Canadian airline to expand its international presence. The agreement includes commitments for 10 Boeing 787-9 aircraft to be delivered between the first quarter of 2019 and December 2021. The airline also has options to buy an additional 10 aircraft to be delivered between 2020 and 2024. Further, WestJet said it has selected General Electric's GEnx-1B engine for the 787. The airline noted that the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is 20 percent more fuel efficient than the Boeing 767 aircraft that it owns. With a range of more than 14,000 kilometres, the Dreamliner will give WestJet the ability to serve new destinations in Asia and South America, and to expand its service offerings into the European market. As part of the purchase agreement, WestJet said it is converting 15 firm orders for the Boeing 737 MAX that were to be delivered between 2019 and 2021 to options available between 2022 and 2024. In a separate statement, WestJet reported a decline in net income for the first quarter to C$48.3 million or C$0.41 per share from C$87.6 million or C$0.71 per share in the year-ago period. The latest quarter's results include irregular operations related costs of C$7.0 million due to severe winter weather experienced in the quarter. However, total revenues for the quarter grew 8 percent to C$1.11 billion from C$1.03 billion in the same period last year. The company's board of directors declared a cash dividend of C$0.14 per common voting share and variable voting share for the second quarter of 2017, to be paid on June 30, 2017, to shareholders of record on June 14, 2017. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Hollywood's 10 Highest Paid Film Stars Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Giraffes On The Savannah: Africa's 10 Tallest Skyscrapers Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories European Shares Seen Subdued Ahead Of French Presidential Debate Asian Markets Mixed Ahead Of Fed Decision Gainers & Losers Of May 2: MOH, RGLS, EYES, APHB, CMRX...

(NYSE: BA) remains coy on its plans to launch a fourth version of its new 737 MAX family, the company has revealed its thinking on perhaps the thorniest problem facing the company as it comes to decision on the new 737-10. The plane would be the largest in the 737 MAX family and is expected to seat 189 passengers in a conventional dual-class cabin and to have a range of 3,000 to 3,300 nautical miles. The issue the company is wrestling with is a design for a new landing gear. The 737-10 would be 66 inches longer than the 737-9. Those extra inches require Boeing to modify the proposed plane’s main landing gear to ensure adequate clearance of the longer body for takeoffs and landings. It may sound simple, but apparently it is not. Boeing has a number of goals for the 737-10. First among them a strong challenger to the Airbus A320neo, a plane designed to carry 193 passengers over a similar range. That said, Boeing wants to limit both the cost of the new plane and get it to market as soon as possible. Many analysts expect Boeing to launch the plane this summer with a delivery date of 2020. Some potential customers for the 737-10 believe the aircraft has to meet a first delivery date in 2019. Designing a workable landing gear is probably the key to keeping the cost down and meeting a 2019 deadline for first deliveries. Now for a little inside baseball. Boeing’s general manager for the 737 MAX program, Keith Leverkuhn, told Aviation Week how the company envisions the landing gear to work: [Boeing is focused] the upper portion of the gear as it integrates with the actuator. [Our new design will include] clever folding using a link mechanism at the top. [The lower part of the gear leg will include] an additional shock strut that fits inside the same forging. This moves the contact point aft a little bit. That’s fundamentally what we are doing and yes, it will look like a trailing link gear. We want to make it maintainable, reliable, and we are going to need that gear to get the performance we want out of the -10 but I’m confident in the solution set. Boeing sees a market of about 1,000 for the 737-10. Is that really enough to build a new plane that may be just an interim solution to the “middle of the market” problem the company is looking at solving with an all-new dual-aisle replacement for the 767 that has been dubbed the 797?

The move takes a page from Air Canada, which has relied on the Dreamliner’s fuel efficiency to lower operating costs. The order also helps clarify WestJet’s strategy for competing with the country’s largest carrier by entering new markets in Asia and the Western Hemisphere. “This answers one of the primary questions about WestJet’s future but is a significant increase in overseas capacity,” Doug Taylor, a Canaccord Genuity analyst, said in a note to clients. The order marks a victory for Chicago-based Boeing over Airbus SE amid depressed sales for twin-aisle jets. WestJet Chief Executive Officer Gregg Saretsky said last year that the carrier would evaluate competing aircraft models from Boeing and the European planemaker if it decided to expand the wide-body fleet. WestJet’s order means Canada’s two biggest airlines will fly the 787, with Air Canada operating 24 Dreamliners at the end of last year. Read more: Boeing and Airbus brace for a slowdown in jet purchases WestJet fell 3.6 percent to C$22.01 at 11:52 a.m. in Toronto. The shares earlier dropped as much as 5.7 percent, the biggest intraday decline in six months, after the carrier reported earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Boeing rose less than 1 percent to $183.08. With a range of more than 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles), the Dreamliner “will give WestJet the ability to serve new destinations in Asia and South America, and to expand its service offerings into the European market,” the Calgary-based company said in a statement Tuesday. The carrier now operates some leased Boeing 767 aircraft that are more than 20 years old on European routes. Adding Frills Founded in 1996 to cater to leisure travelers, WestJet has been moving away from its original no-frills model -- patterned after U.S.-based Southwest Airlines Co. -- by adding premium economy seats, rolling out a short-distance unit and starting overseas flights to European destinations such as London. Last month WestJet said it planned to start an ultra-low-cost carrier to fend off Canadian upstarts. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up WestJet plans to buy 10 of the 787-9 for delivery between early 2019 and the end of 2021, with options for 10 more of the planes to be handed over through 2024. The purchase would be valued at as much as $5.4 billion based on list prices, though discounts are typical in the industry. WestJet also will convert orders for 15 single-aisle 737 Max jets, listing for a combined $1.7 billion, to options. The Dreamliner order likely will elevate capital spending over the next several years, Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker said in a note to clients. “Clearly a lot happening in Calgary, which may cause growing pains along the way,” she wrote. Watching Debt WestJet plans to the 787 purchases with operating cash flow without taking on debt, Saretsky said. “We’ve essentially canceled 15 Max deliveries in the same window, which takes a significant amount of capex out,” Saretsky said on a call with analysts. “That creates the money that we’ll use to fund the acquisition of 10 787s.” The Dreamliners probably will include a business class with lie-flat seats, as well as premium-economy and regular-economy cabins, he said. Separately, the airline’s proposed ultra-low-cost carrier probably will start operating in the beginning of next year with its own name and Boeing 737 aircraft reconfigured to hold 189 seats, Saretsky said. The unit will offer “absolutely rock-bottom” entry fares and charge passengers for products and services such as food, in-flight entertainment and carry-on luggage, Saretsky said, citing Europe’s EasyJet Plc and Ryanair Holdings Plc as comparable models. WestJet reported first-quarter profit of 41 cents a share, trailing the 51-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue was C$1.11 billion ($810 million), while analysts predicted C$1.12 billion. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

May 03, 2017 0700 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:191962 Publish Date: Tue, 02 May 2017 18:17:19 GMT Service: Iran Boeing moves ahead on first jet delivery to Iran next year Boeing Company is making 'steady progress' to complete the terms of an 80-jetliner sale to Iran Air and expects to deliver the initial planes next year — the first US aircraft exports to Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. "That remains on track," Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told reporters following the planemaker's annual general meeting in Chicago, reported Bloomberg. "It's really important that at every step of the process, we're working on this hand-in-hand with the US government." Airbus SE, Boeing's European rival, has already delivered the initial planes in a $19-billion sale deal struck last year after a nuclear accord with Iran lifted some international restrictions on trade with the country. The Iran Air transaction would provide a crucial sales boost for Boeing’s 777 as sales slow for long-range jetliners and customers wait for an upgraded model that is expected to enter the market in 2020. Boeing has 124 unfilled orders for the current generation 777, the company's largest twin-engine jet. The 15 aircraft ordered by Iran Air would give assurance that production runs smoothly in 2018 and 2019. "We've gone through the licensing process," Muilenburg said. The company is "working the financing structure". The company has booked nine orders for the 777 this year and has additional sales campaigns under way, Muilenburg said. "I'm bullish about the prospects for the 777."     KeyWords Boeing Iran delivery   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Rouhani, Jahangiri talk about plans to address terrorism, tourism IAEA head: Iran honoring JCPOA commitments Iran FM due in Pakistan to follow up on terror attack on border guards Iran says will send more military advisors to Syria: IRGC commander Iranian bank to open branch in Bavaria 30th Tehran International Book Fair kicks off Rouhani: Constructive engagement with world great achievement President: Those provided Saddam with mines denied Iran demining tech Iran regrets deaths of German tourists in road accident iran's Alipour nicknamed "persian cheetah" Most Visited US sends nuclear sub to S Korea amid rising tensions with North Obama to receive $400k for first paid speech: Report US pushing Korean Peninsula to brink of nuclear war: Pyongyang www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0761 sec

Transparency Market Research 02 May, 2017, 07:49 ET Share this article ALBANY, New York, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- According to a new report by Transparency Market Research (TMR), the global micro tactical ground robots market is highly competitive, owing to the presence of a large pool of participants. The top six players, namely, QinetiQ, Boeing Co., Thales S.A., Roboteam, Northrop Grumman, and iRobot Corp., together held nearly 64% of the overall market in 2016. The market is technology driven and, hence, the leading players heavily concentrate on technological advancements to expand their business. Over the coming years, their focus is expected to shift towards strategic partnerships in order to strengthen their positions in this market, states the report. Analysts at TMR expect the opportunity in the worldwide market for micro tactical ground robots to rise at a CAGR of 17.30% during the period from 2017 to 2025, increasing from a US$1.57 bn in 2016 to US$6.36 bn by the end of the forecast period. The explosive ordinance disposal segment has been reporting the most prominent demand for these robots across the world. Thanks to the augmenting usage of these robots in ensuring public safety by detecting and diffusing explosives kept in public places and vehicles, this trend is likely to remain same over the next few years. Tele-operated Micro Tactical Ground Robots to Report Strong Demand   The research report has considered tethered, tele-operated, semi-autonomous, and autonomous modes as the main modes of operations for micro tactical ground robots. Among these, the tele-operated robots registered a higher demand than others with a share of more than 50% in 2016. The trend is expected to continue on the same line in the near future with the increasing popularity of tele-operated robots. Thanks to the gradual development of wireless technology, the efficiency of tele-operated ground robots is anticipated to enhance over the next few years, reflecting greatly on their sales. However, growing trend towards autonomous robotics is likely to increase the demand for semi-autonomous and autonomous robots extensively in the years to come. The rising need for lesser control of human operators is projected to raise the demand for these robots in coming years. Get PDF Sample for this Research Report @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=23345 Geographically, the study segments the global market in the Middle East and Africa, North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia pacific. Among these, North America dominated the overall market in 2016 with a share of 45%, thanks to the increased deployment of these robots in warfare by the U.S. In the coming years, this regional market is expected to retain its position on the grounds of the increasing uptake of military robotics, thanks to the rise in spending of the U.S. government on defense and military. The advancements in robotics technology is also anticipated to boost the North America market for micro tactical ground robots. Increasing Government Spending on Defense to Boost Market's Growth  "The increasing government spending on defense and military across the world is having the most prominent impact on the global micro tactical ground robot market", says a researcher at TMR. With the growing concern for national security, governments of developed and emerging economies have increased their spending on military and defense, which is reflecting significantly on the uptake of these robots. In addition, the extensive investments in military robotics is likely to propel this market over the next few years. On the other hand, the high maintenance costs of tactical ground robots may hamper the growth of this market in the years to come, states the research study. The study presented here is based on a report by Transparency Market Research (TMR), titled "Micro Tactical Ground Robot Market (Application - Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Law Enforcement, Explosive Ordinance Disposal, and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) and Hazardous Material (HAZMAT); Mode of Operation - Tethered, Tele-Operated, Semi-Autonomous, Autonomous) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2017 - 2025."

(Randall Hill/Reuters) Fleet expansion 7:13 Fleet expansion 7:13 Related Stories Are Canadians ready for no-frills flying? WestJet's pilots go for another unionization vote WestJet Airlines Ltd. has placed a firm order for 10 Boeing Dreamliners, which will have the range and fuel efficiency to serve new destinations in Asia, South America and expand the airline's presence in Europe. WestJet's first Dreamliner 787s would be delivered between the first quarter of 2019 and December 2021. The Calgary-based airline also has an option to buy an additional 10 Dreamliners to be delivered between 2020 and 2024. With a range of up to 14,000 kilometres, the jets are said to be as much as 20 per cent more fuel efficient than WestJet's current fleet of 767s. The value of the orders wasn't disclosed, but part of the cost could be offset by converting firm orders of Boeing 737s that were to be delivered to WestJet starting in 2019. In the first quarter, WestJet reported $48.3 million or 41 cents per share of net earnings — down from $87.6 million or 71 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016. The company says its profit was down, despite eight per cent higher revenue, due to costs related to severe winter weather. © The Canadian Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Latest Business Headlines Home Capital delays release of quarterly earnings May 02, 6:54 PM ET Apple posts surprise drop in iPhone sales May 02, 6:09 PM ET The U.S. will not drown the world in oil, forecaster says May 02, 1:04 PM ET read comments How Donald Trump became a key figure in the B.C. provincial election campaign May 02, 9:00 PM ET read comments Loonie slides below 73 cents US May 02, 6:06 PM ET Must Watch Video On the hot seat 2:21 Paul Hunter reports from Washington, D.C., where U.S. airline execs faced anger from lawmakers over treatment of customers Video House market questions 6:02 Shannon Lee Simmons, financial planner and founder of the New School of Finance, on what you need to know whether you own Home Capital products or not Video Energy boost 5:58 Peter Hall, chief economist with Export Development Canada, on projections that our exports will jump six per cent this year Video Fleet expansion 7:13 Gregg Saretsky, CEO of WestJet, on plans to add 10 Boeing Dreamliners, which will allow the airline to serve Asia, Europe and beyond Watch The Exchange here Watch Recent shows and interviews Recent discussions about business news and newsmakers Markets TSX COMPOSITE   Rotate stock indices Pause stock rotation Show previous stock PLAY May 03, 2017 12:00 AM ET May 03, 2017 12:00 AM ET May 03, 2017 12:00 AM ET May 03, 2017 12:00 AM ET May 03, 2017 12:00 AM ET Index Last Trade Change TSX COMPOSITE 15619.65 44.02 DOW 20949.89 36.43 NASDAQ 6095.37 3.77 SP 500 2391.17 2.84 TSX-VENTURE 796.20 -4.86 The data on this site is informational only and may be delayed; it is not intended as trading or investment advice and you should not rely on it as such.

The top six players, namely, QinetiQ, Boeing Co., Thales S.A., Roboteam, Northrop Grumman, and iRobot Corp., together held nearly 64% of the overall market in 2016. The market is technology driven and, hence, the leading players heavily concentrate on technological advancements to expand their business. Over the coming years, their focus is expected to shift towards strategic partnerships in order to strengthen their positions in this market, states the report. Analysts at TMR expect the opportunity in the worldwide market for micro tactical ground robots to rise at a CAGR of 17.30% during the period from 2017 to 2025, increasing from a US$1.57 bn in 2016 to US$6.36 bn by the end of the forecast period. The explosive ordinance disposal segment has been reporting the most prominent demand for these robots across the world. Thanks to the augmenting usage of these robots in ensuring public safety by detecting and diffusing explosives kept in public places and vehicles, this trend is likely to remain same over the next few years. Tele-operated Micro Tactical Ground Robots to Report Strong Demand   The research report has considered tethered, tele-operated, semi-autonomous, and autonomous modes as the main modes of operations for micro tactical ground robots. Among these, the tele-operated robots registered a higher demand than others with a share of more than 50% in 2016. The trend is expected to continue on the same line in the near future with the increasing popularity of tele-operated robots. Thanks to the gradual development of wireless technology, the efficiency of tele-operated ground robots is anticipated to enhance over the next few years, reflecting greatly on their sales. However, growing trend towards autonomous robotics is likely to increase the demand for semi-autonomous and autonomous robots extensively in the years to come. The rising need for lesser control of human operators is projected to raise the demand for these robots in coming years.

Among these, North America dominated the overall market in 2016 with a share of 45%, thanks to the increased deployment of these robots in warfare by the U.S. In the coming years, this regional market is expected to retain its position on the grounds of the increasing uptake of military robotics, thanks to the rise in spending of the U.S. government on defense and military. The advancements in robotics technology is also anticipated to boost the North America market for micro tactical ground robots. Increasing Government Spending on Defense to Boost Market's Growth  "The increasing government spending on defense and military across the world is having the most prominent impact on the global micro tactical ground robot market", says a researcher at TMR. With the growing concern for national security, governments of developed and emerging economies have increased their spending on military and defense, which is reflecting significantly on the uptake of these robots. In addition, the extensive investments in military robotics is likely to propel this market over the next few years. On the other hand, the high maintenance costs of tactical ground robots may hamper the growth of this market in the years to come, states the research study. The study presented here is based on a report by Transparency Market Research (TMR), titled "Micro Tactical Ground Robot Market (Application - Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, Law Enforcement, Explosive Ordinance Disposal, and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) and Hazardous Material (HAZMAT); Mode of Operation - Tethered, Tele-Operated, Semi-Autonomous, Autonomous) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast, 2017 - 2025."

The new government aircraft, a Boeing737 Business Jet carries a price tag of €92.7m but given that the old government plane, a Fokker 70, was sold for €3.7m brings the replacement cost to €89m, just under the €90m cap imposed on the order. The Boeing is scheduled for delivery in early 2019. However European aerospace group Airbus has two similar aircraft, which use newer technology and could be delivered sooner, on the market for about €75m, the NRC said. The new government plane provides seating for 24 passengers and seven crew. It is capable of flying non-stop between the Netherlands and Aruba, a constituent country of the Netherlands in the Caribbean. It is unclear why the government opted for Boeing. But the NRC suggests that king Willem-Alexander, who holds a Boeing pilot’s license, may have have played a role in the decision. The aircraft is flown for the royal family about 12% of the time, the rest of its air hours are spent on government business.

Valerie Insinna writes the White House’s statement on cost reduction in Boeing’s Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program contradicts Trump’s original claims in February. “We’ve got that price down by over $1 billion and I probably haven’t spoken for more than an hour on the project,” Trump said in a February rally. Analysts told Defense News that the change in cost saving claims could indicate that Trump is moving toward a “more conservative estimate.” Defense Secretary James Mattis called for a review of the Air Force One replacement program in January weeks after Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said that the company initiated efforts to simplify requirements for the future presidential plane.

Boeing will deliver the initial planes next year, Muilenburg told reporters Monday following the planemaker’s annual general meeting in Chicago, according to Bloomberg. “That remains on track,” he further said, referring to the deal between Iran’s flag carrier airline Iran Air and Boeing. “It’s really important that at every step of the process, we’re working on this hand-in-hand with the US government,” Muilenburg added. On April 4, Iran signed a new agreement with Boeing for buying dozens of the company’s twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. The agreement involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes as well as the purchase rights for an additional 30 planes of the same class. It was signed between Iran’s Aseman Airlines and Boeing in Tehran. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion.

The 23-story tall rocket took off from its seaside launch pad at Kennedy Space Center at 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT.) It will put into orbit a classified satellite for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, an agency within the Defense Department that operates the nation’s spy satellites. Nine minutes after takeoff, the rocket’s main section touched down on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just south of NASA’s spaceport. Landing A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on May 1, 2017 at 6:44am PDT Last month, Space Exploration Technologies Corp flew its first recovered booster on a second mission, a key step in company founder Elon Musk’s quest to cut launch costs. The National Reconnaissance Office bought SpaceX’s launch services via a contract with Ball Aerospace, a Colorado-based satellite and instrument builder. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. Musk battled for years to break the monopoly on the military’s launch business held by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. SpaceX sued the U.S. Air Force in 2014 over its exclusive multibillion-dollar contract with United Launch Alliance. The company later dropped the suit after the military agreed to open more launch contacts to competitive bidding. SpaceX has since won two launch contracts from the Air Force to send up Global Positioning System satellites in 2018 and 2019. Monday’s launch was the 34th mission for SpaceX and the fifth of more than 20 flights planned for this year. The privately owned firm, based in Hawthorne, California, has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth about $10 billion.

The plane is marketed as a platform for advanced pilot training, with the US Air Force considered its primary customer. "The jet handled exactly like the first aircraft and the simulator, meeting all expectations," Boeing Test Pilot for Air Force Programs Matt Giese said in a press release. "The front and back cockpits work together seamlessly and the handling is superior. It's the perfect aircraft for training future generations of combat pilots." The T-X has a single-engine, is twin-tailed, and is double-seated with embedded training technology in the cockpit. "This aircraft was built to Air Force requirements and designed to fulfill the Air Education and Training Command mission," lead test pilot Steve Schmidt said. The T-X is anticipated to replace the venerable T-38 training aircraft that dates back to 1959, and is expected to be operational by 2024. The first model was revealed by Boeing and Saab in 2016, and has been in flight since December of 2016. "Boeing T-X is a production aircraft; it is not a prototype," Boeing has previously said of the aircraft. "The system also includes state-of-the-art ground-based training and a maintenance-friendly design for long-term supportability."

Basically, the Air Force's "assured access to space" policy mandated that the nation have two rockets that could launch DoD missions, but there wasn't enough military launches to support two companies in the market.  So Boeing and Lockheed Martin teamed up by creating ULA, which operates two lines of rockets, the Atlas V and Delta IV.  Then, SpaceX came along.  The California-based company started by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is all about dropping the price of their rockets, with an ultimate goal of reusing the entire system, something that no other company currently does.  They have already landed 10 booster stages after they launched a mission, but they have only reused one of those so far.  SpaceX claims they can drop the price of launch by as much as 80% though reusability.  SpaceX eventually went after the military launch certification as well, obtaining it for the Falcon 9 rocket in 2015.  The first launch they could submit a bid for was the NROL-76 mission, and they won the contract in a no contest decision because ULA did not submit a bid, citing lack of engines and inability to provide a competitive bid because of the way their accounting systems operated on what's called a "block buy" policy.  The mission launched successfully, and SpaceX landed the booster yet again.  There's not much information out there about what the NROL-76 payload is or what it will be doing, but that's standard procedure for NRO missions.  Spy agencies like their secrets.  ULA has since resumed bidding on military launches, putting forward their workhorse, and cheaper, Atlas V rocket.  They have plans to phase out both the Atlas V and Delta IV vehicles since they do not have to maintain two rockets with the Falcon 9 flying military missions.   Eventually, ULA hopes to fly the Vulcan rocket by the end of the decade, which in some ways, is a combination of the Atlas V and Delta IV.  They say maintaining a single rocket line and its associated infrastructure, as well as designing it to be manufactured as efficiently as possible, will drop the price of their launches significantly, making them more competitive in both the commercial, civil and military launch markets.

(Representative image) Company Summary NSE BSE Trent Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES By Tony Capaccio The Pentagon will attempt a new test by the end of this month of whether it can intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile like the ones North Korea is seeking to develop, according to the deputy director of the US Missile Defense Agency. "It's coming up later this month," Rear Admiral Jon Hill said in remarks Tuesday at a "Missile Defense Day" gathering on Capitol Hill that had marketing displays by top contractors including Boeing Co., Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. Hill said the test has "been planned for a while" and wasn't intended as a provocation to North Korea or any other nation. Asked after his remarks about the timing, Hill described June 1 as an approximate window for the test. The attempt to intercept a dummy target will take on symbolic importance whether it succeeds or fails, as North Korea ramps up its ballistic missile development and President Donald Trump vows to block Kim Jong Un's regime from developing a nuclear weapon that could reach the US. The next interception attempt will be the first since a successful test in June 2014. But before that, two tests failed in 2010. The Missile Defense Agency has said its extensive efforts to fix flaws with the interceptor's warhead have paid off. But the Pentagon's weapons testing office has said the $36 billion system of ground-based interceptors can't yet be counted on to shoot down a nuclear-armed missile aimed at the US West Coast by North Korea or Iran. The network of radar and communications -- combined with missiles based in California and Alaska -- has demonstrated only a "limited capability to defend the US homeland from small numbers of simple" intercontinental ballistic missiles, the testing office said in its latest annual report. 'Increased Tensions' Representative Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said the next test "takes on special significance because of the increased tensions in the world." "Rather than being provocative, I see this as a move toward stability," Franks said in an interview. "If an enemy recognizes we can knock down the first one or the second one or maybe the fourth or fifth one, they know that's going to give us the time for an offensive response -- and that is a deterrent in itself." The US test will attempt to shoot down a target that replicates for the first time the speed, trajectory and closing velocity of an ICBM. The US also will test avionics updates to the booster rocket built by Orbital ATK Inc., which carries an improved version of a hit-to-kill conventional warhead made by Raytheon, Missile Defense Agency officials have said. Boeing manages the missile defense system. Asked the implication if the test shot fails, Franks, a supporter of the missile defense system, said "it definitely has significance." But "if you ask Kim Jong Un, you learn more from your failures than you do from your successes."

Russia is forging a new era in space. Ever since the United States retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, NASA astronauts have had to hitch rides to the International Space Station (ISS) in Russian Soyuz spaceships -- paying Russian space agency Roscosmos for the privilege. The plan is for NASA to soon switch over sometime soon to using its own rockets -- built by SpaceX and  Boeing   (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) United Launch Alliance joint venture -- but it remains an open question when these companies will have their spacecraft ready for use. In the meantime, American astronauts must continue to fork over $82 million a seat in payment for rides aboard Soyuz. And what is Russia doing with all that money, you ask? It's using it to develop a new spaceship of its own -- a very interesting spaceship. Going where no cosmonaut has gone before -- on Russia's Federatsiya Roscosmos is currently developing a new and improved spacecraft -- one capable not just of ferrying supplies and astronauts to ISS, but also of fulfilling Russia's dream of one day landing a cosmonaut on the moon, or even Mars.  In a move evocative of both Star Trek and Russia's own official name -- "the Russian Federation" -- it's calling the new spacecraft Federatsiya, or "Federation." (Side note: The current Soyuz spacecraft design was named for the Soviet Union, or Sovyetsky Soyuz). Now here's what we know about the spaceship that will replace the Soyuz. Energia, a publicly traded Russian "rocket and space public corporation," has been working on developing the Federatsiya for more than a decade. According to new reports, completing the effort will require another five years and cost a further $734 million. In a break from tradition, the Soyuz rocket-Soyuz capsule combination of current spaceships will be replaced by the Federatsiya capsule being carried atop a new heavy-lift rocket called Angara. Another change -- instead of launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Angara and Federatsiya will launch out of Roscosmos's new seven-launchpad spaceport in Russia's Amur Oblast, dubbed the "Vostochny Cosmodrome" (the "Eastern Spaceport"). The new Federatsiya capsule will stand 20 feet tall and weigh 14.4 metric tons. Larger than its predecessor Soyuz, Federatsiya will accommodate between four and six cosmonauts. Plans are for Federatsiya to make its first trip to space in 2021, unmanned. Crewed missions are expected to begin as early as 2023, and Russia plans to conduct a manned moon mission with Federatsiya as early as 2025.  No crew, but... Now here's where this story gets weird. Federatsiya's first trip to space in 2021 may be unmanned, but Russia's new spaceship won't be going into space entirely uncrewed. To the contrary, the spacecraft will carry a pilot -- a robot pilot. According to Russian news agency TASS, Russia plans to crew Federatsiya's first mission with a humanoid robot named FEDOR (short for "Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research") at the helm. FEDOR will be the sole passenger aboard Federatsiya's maiden flight. TASS reports that FEDOR is capable of screwing in a light bulb, unlocking and opening a door, and driving a car -- and apparently, a spacecraft, too. Developed by Russia's Android Technics Research and Production Association under contract to the country's Emergencies Ministry, FEDOR was designed to perform work "in extreme conditions." To accomplish its missions, FEDOR has been equipped with both "fine motor skills and decision-making algorithms." Russia plans to test that thesis by giving FEDOR control over Federatsiya. What comes next? That's already pretty amazing. Not only is Russia developing a new spaceship, but it's developing an entirely new way to crew spaceships, too. What could be even more interesting is what Russia plans to do next. For example, FEDOR doesn't need to breathe, and he won't require a spacesuit -- so might Russia also decide to send FEDOR out through the hatch on an extra-vehicular activity mission? A few years from now, could we see FEDOR, or multiple FEDORs, land on and explore the moon itself, no cosmonauts required? The upshot of all this, of course, is that Russia appears set on blazing new trails in space -- even as NASA under the Trump administration endures small but significant budget cuts. Adding insult to injury, Russia is doing all this on our dime -- and will continue to do so until SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed get their act together and begin launching their space shuttle replacements. Only then will NASA be able to stop paying Roscosmos for astronaut rides and begin spending that money on developing our own space program again.  Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Huntsville Hospital's NICU unit has infant CPR kits they hand out to parents free of charge. The kits can make all the difference. In October, the Huntsville Hospital NICU received 500 infant CPR kits. "Getting these kits granted by the Boeing Employee Group, we're able to allow every parent to have the hands on demonstration. Plus they can take this home with them, and continue to practice through that," explained Cheryl Case. Case is the NICU director. She said before, they only had one kit everyone had to share in a class. Now, each set of parents is able to have their own. To date, they've given out over 150 of them. "Each kit comes complete with a mannequin, as well as DVD so that once they go home then the training can be reiterated with a video," said Case. She said the kits give parents, and even grandparents who might be watching infants, a life saving education. "I think it makes a big impact. Even though they may panic when that situation arises, then the intuition kicks in and they remember the information that they were taught," said Case. The NICU admits over 1,100 patients a year, so right now the kits are only available for NICU parents, and some parents in pediatrics. But because there is a need, Case said they are looking into grant options with the American Heart Association, who has the kits, that will allow them to expand. "As a community hospital our focus is on better preparing our parents and that's something that we could look at in the future," she said. If you are interested, for more information on how you can get your own infant CPR kit, you can visit the American Heart Association's website by clicking here.   34.730369 -86.586104 Filed in: Community Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular Sheriff identifies woman killed by a falling tree during Sunday’s storm Round one ends, another wave of showers and storms after 10 PM Latest News Crews demolish home tied to notorious Madison County “cell phone murders” Heading to Talladega Superspeedway for the GEICO 500 this weekend?

Banking & Finance Construction Education Energy Healthcare Media Real Estate Retail Technology Transport Travel & Hospitality Oman Air plans major aircraft order despite profits delay National carrier says it won't now break even in 2017 as low oil prices curb growth in the Gulf By Bloomberg Tuesday, 2 May 2017 7:23 PM Oman Air plans to move ahead with a multi-billion dollar order for wide-body jets early next year even though it won’t now break even in 2017 as the low oil price curbs growth in the Gulf. The carrier is now aiming to end losses by the end of next year, contingent on demand not deteriorating further, Chief Executive Officer Paul Gregorowitsch said in an interview on Tuesday. While the Mideast carrier will also delay plans to expand to a fleet of 70 aircraft and 75 destinations to 2023 from 2020, it still plans to order 15 new wide-body jets needed to replace older planes and add capacity, he said. Further discussions will be held with manufacturers and leasing firms next week as Oman Air seeks to agree terms to take either Airbus SE’s A350 or the Boeing Co 787-9. The US model has a slight advantage because the carrier already operates six Dreamliners, with the tally set to increase to 10 in 2018. Oman Air will also go ahead with deliveries of the 20 Boeing 737 Max planes it has on order as it leases out some of its current narrow-body fleet to better match seats to demand. While the carrier is continuing to operate 10 Airbus A330s, which form the core of its wide-body operations, those planes will be retired to make way for the new aircraft. Gregorowitsch said the upgraded A330neo isn’t of interest. While Oman Air remains unprofitable, the state-owned carrier is no longer getting government funding, having received $50 million last year and $300 million in 2014 when the CEO took over. The loss per passenger was cut by $10 last year and should decrease again in 2017, he said. Even with expansion more tentative, Oman Air has still added Nairobi and Manchester to its network this year, according to Gregorowitsch. Peshawar in Afghanistan could follow before the end of 2017, and addition next year include Hong Kong, Seoul and a city in South Africa, he said. More routes to mainland China are on hold after the company began flying to Guangzhou in 2016. It’s shelved plans for its own services to Turkey, relying instead on an agreement with  Turkish Airlines. Oman Air’s German flights are now operated as code-shares with  Deutsche Lufthansa AG and the European giant is among candidates for a joint-venture partnership, Gregorowitsch said.

Hill said the test has “been planned for a while” and wasn’t intended as a provocation to North Korea or any other nation. Asked after his remarks about the timing, Hill described June 1 as an approximate window for the test. The attempt to intercept a dummy target will take on symbolic importance whether it succeeds or fails, as North Korea ramps up its ballistic missile development and President Donald Trump vows to block Kim Jong Un’s regime from developing a nuclear weapon that could reach the U.S. The next interception attempt will be the first since a successful test in June 2014. But before that, two tests failed in 2010. The Missile Defense Agency has said its extensive efforts to fix flaws with the interceptor’s warhead have paid off. But the Pentagon’s weapons testing office has said the $36 billion system of ground-based interceptors can’t yet be counted on to shoot down a nuclear-armed missile aimed at the U.S. West Coast by North Korea or Iran. The network of radar and communications -- combined with missiles based in California and Alaska -- has demonstrated only a “limited capability to defend the U.S. homeland from small numbers of simple” intercontinental ballistic missiles, the testing office said in its latest annual report. ‘Increased Tensions’ Representative Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said the next test “takes on special significance because of the increased tensions in the world.” “Rather than being provocative, I see this as a move toward stability,” Franks said in an interview. “If an enemy recognizes we can knock down the first one or the second one or maybe the fourth or fifth one, they know that’s going to give us the time for an offensive response -- and that is a deterrent in itself.” Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up The U.S. test will attempt to shoot down a target that replicates for the first time the speed, trajectory and closing velocity of an ICBM. The U.S. also will test avionics updates to the booster rocket built by Orbital ATK Inc., which carries an improved version of a hit-to-kill conventional warhead made by Raytheon, Missile Defense Agency officials have said. Boeing manages the missile defense system. Asked the implication if the test shot fails, Franks, a supporter of the missile defense system, said “it definitely has significance.” But “if you ask Kim Jong Un, you learn more from your failures than you do from your successes.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Fred Sheldon wasn’t a bad student, just bored, so getting by was the best he did.  He didn’t fit the rote routine of school.  Sheldon was fading into nowhere, his creativity untapped. Until he learned how to blast off a bottle rocket, and get credit for it. Pegged as an “average” student, Sheldon was fortunate enough to fall into science teacher Steve Sogo’s honors chemistry class during his junior year at Laguna Beach High School.  He asked Sogo if he could put hydrogen and oxygen in a glass soda bottle and light it on fire. Sogo said okay, and they took the bottle outside to the high school’s quad, no blowing up the lab here.  They mixed the compound, using a magnesium strip for a fuse, lit it and watched. “I thought it failed,” said Sogo, “a good idea, but nothing.”  Until they went to retrieve the bottle.  “Then it went off, it went boom and it flew into the air. We were in the unknown. That was the most exciting, the unexpected.” He said the “rather explosive” experiment has morphed into a regular rocket lab each March, which evolved from Sheldon’s inquisitiveness in 1991. Continuing his trajectory of engaging borderline students, Sogo was selected last week as one of only three K-12 teachers nationwide to receive the 2013 National Science Teachers’ Association’s award for excellence in student-inquiry-based teaching. Navigating real technological systems has become part of Sheldon’s daily routine.  He went on to earn a degree in math with emphasis in physics at Humboldt State University. He quickly landed a job at Boeing in Huntington Beach, where he’s worked for 15 years, now heading up the advanced technology department for unmanned underwater vehicle development.  Not bad for a student once without game. “There’s no reason a high school student can’t do groundbreaking research,” said Sheldon, a concept he embraced from Sogo’s confidence-boosting approach to teaching.  “That’s the best way to demonstrate how he’s set apart from the traditional science teacher, or teacher period.  At the time, I would say people had low expectations of me and he proved to me that they’re wrong.” Sheldon credits Sogo as the first teacher to recognize his potential, letting him work at his own faster pace. “School can get kind of boring, and when you have someone feeding and watering you, so to speak,” he conveyed, “it really made things a lot more interesting.  It was my number one class of all time, including everything I’ve done in college.” Sogo’s NSTA award was co-sponsored by the School Specialty Science Group, which publishes “learning by doing” science curriculum and sells lab equipment science brands, including Frey Scientific products. He was also only one of six teachers in California and 32 nationwide to receive an elite award in 2003 from the Amgen Foundation, the charitable division of a Fortune 500 biotech company, for his dedication to inspiring future Nobel Prize winners. He was presented with a $10,000 check. “His most valuable asset,” said high school principal Joanne Culverhouse, “is his ability to develop experimental and analytical skills in his students.  The (advanced) class he actually wrote and designed.” Culverhouse said Sogo’s organically creative approach and focus on each student’s learning pace sets him apart from other high school teachers in the county. “Many of my best students have been kids with very low GPA’s,” Sogo recounted.  “They were the ones who did not thrive in the rote, memorization, there-is-one-answer-learn-it environment.  But they really did thrive when they were given the freedom to explore and create because that was their strength all along.  They’re the out-of-the-box, creative, I-don’t-follow-the-rules type of person.” Student Andrew Couse receives an explanation from science teacher Steve Sogo. Sogo’s academic claim-to-fame is his passion to get students in a hands-on, figure-it-out-for-yourself mindset. “I come in with the idea that creative thought is the most valuable skill,” he said.  “I don’t care whether you know an answer.  I care whether you can think about how to get an answer.” He offers his students “game scripts” drawn from film, television and novels to solve scientific mysteries in his labs, and they rarely text their friends the answers.  “The ethos of the classroom is the fun of doing it yourself,” relayed Sogo, “to figure out your own solution.” After earning a master’s degree in chemistry from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena in 1989, Sogo abandoned his research project as a Ph.D. candidate when an instructor made a simple prophetic statement, “You should do something important.”  Sogo had the thought, “Do what you like to do and good things will happen.”  He’s doing that and they’re happening. His first teaching job was at LBHS in 1989 until he left in 1992 to try a few other places.  He returned to Laguna in 2001, and is considered a hard teacher. “I had a student who said that his biology class was just hard and no fun,” Sogo recalled, “and he had another class that was just fun but said, ‘We don’t learn much.’  Mine was the class where it’s hard but it’s fun.  There’s value in the learning.  That was very gratifying to hear that.” Sheldon remembers Sogo’s “MacGyver” days where students were handed a script modeled after the secret-agent television series. They outlined an adventure needing scientific discovery with steps that would draw students through a maze of twists and turns. One particular problem was figuring out how to get through a locked door selecting possible problem-solving tools; in this case, a pile of gray stones, a wrench and a bottle. It turned out that the pile of gray rocks, when mixed with water, produced an extremely hot gas able to melt through metal, i.e., a door lock. “It was brain gymnastics at its best,” said Sheldon.  “It captured a lot of us into being excited about thinking. “Usually when you’re in class, you’re going to travel at one pace, and that’s the pace of the curriculum, even if you’ve already got it down. I was a kid at the time and I didn’t have full realization that if I wanted more, I could go seek it out myself.  That was something he showed me.” Sogo’s current frontier is bringing nature into the classroom, inspired by close friend Terry Collins, a global sustainable science proponent and professor and director of the Institute for Green Science at Carnegie Mellon University. “I’m a big proponent of green chemistry,” said Sogo, who spent three days of spring break hiking and “taking pictures of lizards” in Joshua Tree National Park with his wife Farah and their son, Jeremy, 14 (their other son, Alexander, 19, is at Brown University). Science, he said, can find ways to fulfill modern society’s demands with minimal environmental impact.  “That’s certainly something I have incorporated into my advanced chemical research class,” he said.  “We’re smart enough to make it better.”   Photos by Solveig Erngren About the Author Previous Story Diver Pulled From Shaw’s Cove is Identified Next Story Closing in on New View Rules Related Posts Technology Now Required in Fifth-Grade Classes Posted On 20 Nov 2014 , By LB Indy Staff Thurston Teachers Bring a Novel to Life Posted On 20 Nov 2014 , By LB Editor 0 Garden Potluck Stirs Up Community Posted On 13 Nov 2014 , By LB Indy Staff One Comment Pingback: Laguna Beach Local News Class Research Earns Awards for LBHS, Teacher - Laguna Beach Local News Leave a Reply Cancel reply Name * Email * Website Join the Local's List For Email Newsletters you can trust.

The company said Tuesday it has ordered 10 Boeing Dreamliners with the option for 10 more, that will allow it to serve new destinations in Asia, South America and Europe with higher-end offerings such as lie-flat seating. The move comes as WestJet is also moving ahead with a plan to launch a separate ultra-low cost brand that will start with 10 planes and offer a bare-bones service. Combined, the new avenues of thrift and luxury set the company up for a new era of growth, said chief executive Gregg Saretsky at WestJet's annual meeting Tuesday. "The opportunity to expand both in the low-cost space, while at the same time growing our long-haul business, is something that creates a platform for future growth that has been unprecedented in our 21-year history," he said. National Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen responded to the plan by lowering his rating of WestJet to underperform, citing in part the company's overall ultra-low cost strategy, the significant money that will be needed to expand abroad and the complications of doing both at the same time. "We are concerned WestJet has too many new strategic initiatives underway simultaneously, which could impair successful execution," wrote Doerksen in an analyst note. Saretsky said at the annual meeting that WestJet's recent experience of starting its Encore regional brand sets it up well for the task. "It's a lot of work, but only three years ago we started a brand-new airline, which has grown from nothing to 45 aircraft, so I believe we have all the foundations to make starting two new initiatives really quite doable," he said. Doerksen said in his note, however, that international routes add a greater degree of complexity and that while the actual cost of the 10 new planes is likely much lower than the list price of $7.4 billion, it is still significant. WestJet has reduced some of the complexity of the plan by spacing out the launches, with the first Dreamliner 787s not scheduled to be delivered until 2019, well after it expects to launch its discount brand. The ultra-low cost carrier, or ULCC, should be in operation by early next year with a no-frills structure modelled from the likes of European carriers Ryanair and easyJet. "The focus on the ULCC is to have the absolutely, rock-bottom entry fare, and then you pay as you consume for all the other products and services," Saretsky said on the conference call. Saretsky said the new discount airline's costs would be about 6.5 cents per available seat mile, compared with 10 cents for its WestJet operations, as it does away with free extras such as snacks and squeezes more travellers into the planes. The new offering will focus on leisure travel routes not served by WestJet to avoid cannibalizing its own business, with Saretsky saying one of the target markets is the 5.5 million flights Canadians take from airports just across the U.S. border. The company is also pushing to lower costs across its operations, with plans to add another row of seats to its existing 737-700s and 800s, and to shift more customer service online and away from call centres. WestJet's expansion plans come as the company faces another pilot union drive, with voting set to begin on whether to join the Air Line Pilots Association. The plans also come as the company emerges from a tough quarter after a record number of weather interruptions, pushing first quarter net earnings down to $48.3 million or 41 cents per share from $87.6 million or 71 cents per share last year.

One of the key metrics investors will be watching out for in those earnings will be iPhone sales. The tech giant makes most of its money from iPhones — and even if it meets estimates of 52 million, that's not a lot more than the 51 million it reported a year ago. Wall Street also kept an eye on the Federal Reserve, with the central bank kicking off a two-day monetary policy meeting. The Fed, however, is not expected to shift monetary policy when their meeting concludes. Market expectations for a rate hike following this meeting are just 4.8 percent, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. That said, investors will be looking for more clues about the Fed's plan to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. "The FOMC has always encountered turbulence when trying to 'land the plane.' Reducing an inventory of $4.5T of fixed income securities to something far more stable presents the biggest challenge of the most protracted and complex tightening cycle facing the central bank since its founding in 1913," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, in a note to clients. The U.S. central bank raised rates at its March meeting, pushing the overnight funds rate to a target range of 0.75 percent to 1 percent. Investors also looked ahead to a slew of economic data due later this week, including the April jobs report, which is due Friday. "We have some more data later this week, so I'd expect [relative] volatility to pick up in the coming days," said Matt Weller, senior market analyst at Faraday Research. Equities closed mixed on Monday after a brief shock stemming from President Donald Trump's comments on breaking up the big banks. In an interview with Bloomberg, Trump said he was "looking at that right now." Stocks declined sharply after Trump's remarks but managed to rebound. "That seems pretty alarming, but if you look beyond the headlines, the Vix sustained those levels for most of 2004 and 2005," said Faraday's Weller. "So it may not be indicative that a top is near." In economic news, U.S. automakers will be releasing monthly sales numbers throughout the day. Earnings season continued, with Mondelez and Gilead Sciences set to report after the bell.

SCOUT Sign In Share & Embed Bell's New V-280 Valor Tiltrotor Helicopter Engineered With Stealth Properties Kris Osborn Yesterday at 8:01 AM / Originally published onWarrior Bell Helicopters emerging V-280 Valor aims to engineer an advanced tiltrotor aircraft able to hit speeds of 280 knots, hover and maneuver like a next-generation helicopter -- all while reducing the radar signature of the aircraft. Bell Helicopter engineers and weapons developers and looking at innovative ways to reduce the radar signature of their new, next-generation V-280 Valor tilt-rotor aircraft slated to be operational by the 2030s. While developers stop short of calling the new project a “stealth” helicopter, they do acknowledge they are engineering “stealthy” characteristics -- such as infrared (IR) heat suppressing systems and various fuselage contour constructions as a specific way to make the new aircraft less targetable by enemies. “We will definitely employ some passive measures in terms of how we shape the aircraft, to make it invisible. The key is not to be able to target it and reduce the signature passively so radar sweeps do not see anything. In the end, you do not want to get detected or engaged,” Vince Tobin, vice president of advanced tiltrotor systems, Bell Helicopter, told Scout Warrior in an interview.   While, quite naturally, many of the specifics regarding stealth technology are not available, there are a few broad parameters followed closely by developers of low-observability aircraft. They include reducing the heat signature coming from engines or exhaust along with efforts to shape the exterior of the aircraft to be less detectable to “pings” or return signals to enemy radar. Radar sends electromagnetic signals, pulses or “pings” traveling at the speed of light – bounces them off of an object – and analyzes the return signal to determine the shape, size and speed of an enemy target. For this reason, electronic “jamming” is another tactic used to thwart or throw off enemy radar systems. Recognizing the importance of lowering the helicopters heat signature, Tobin explained that Bell is now investigating cutting-edge engine technologies specifically designed to reduce the heat they emit. “We are looking for opportunities to reduce that heat signature. A lot of new technologies that the engine companies are looking for include seeking the best ways to ensure maximum performance of the engine while using an IR suppressor,” Tobin explained. A key strategy, Tobin explained, is to use IR suppressor to reduce the signature so that less “jamming” is needed to confuse enemy radar.   Advancing Tiltrotor Technology  Bell intends to build upon and advance existing tiltrotor technology such as that which is currently operation in the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey aircraft. The Osprey continues to perform well in a wide range of missions and has recently been selected by the Navy to perform the Carrier On-board Delivery or COD mission transporting troops, equipment and weapons on-and-off surface ships.  The V-280 Valor is designed to be slightly bigger than an existing Black Hawk helicopter and use 24-inch seats to carry 11 passengers with gear, Tobin said.  “What Bell has done is taking its historical V-22 aircraft, and all the demonstrators before that, and applies them to this next-generation tilt-rotor. It is a straight wing versus a V-22 which is not straight. This reduces complexity,” Dan Bailey, JMR TD Program Manager, said in an interview with Scout Warrior last year. “They are also building additional flapping into the rotor system and individual controls that should allow for increased low-speed maneuverability.” The tiltrotors were engineered into the aircraft this past November, Tobin added. “We will get the gear boxes and transmission in before we get those blades on,” Tobin explained. Depending upon ultimate requirement established by the Army and DoD, Bell expects to engineer an attack variant of the aircraft with a slightly different fuselage configuration. “An armed attack version will have a gun, 2.75in folding-fin rockets and some type of point-to-point missile - hellfire or some later generation missile that would guide off of a laser or IR. We are being open ended in that we are not designing any specific requirement,” Tobin explained. V-280 Valor Uses F-35 Sensor The V-280 Valor next-generation tiltrotor aircraft for the 2030s includes the integration of a high-tech 360-degree sensor suite quite similar to the one used on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter called a Distributed Aperture Systems, or DAS, developers explained.  “Instead of having sensors mounted to the turret, you have sensors that are mounted to the aircraft – so essentially you have sensors staring in 360-degrees around the aircraft at any given time. Those images are stitched together so it appears as one continuous image to the pilot. Both pilots can make use of the same system,” Tobin said.  This technology will also allow troops riding in the back of the aircraft to wear goggles or a helmet giving them a view of the surrounding sensor feeds as they transit to a mission, Tobin added. The Northrop Grumman-built DAS system will also form the basis of a small-arms enemy fire detection technology which will search for and locate the signature of incoming enemy attacks. The sensors will be able to discern the location and heat signature coming from enemy small arms fire, giving the aircraft and opportunity to quickly attack with its weapons – lowering risk of injury to the pilots, crew and passengers. Army Future Vertical Lift - 2030s The new Bell tiltrotor, called the V-280 Valor, is part of the Army’s Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator program aimed at establishing requirements and paving the way toward a new Future Vertical Lift aircraft designed to meet a wide range of new requirements. The concept behind the Army’s joint Future Vertical Lift program is to engineer a forward-looking, future aircraft able to reach airplane speeds and yet retain and ability to hover and maneuver like a helicopter. “The aircraft will have an ability to come to a hover in challenging conditions and then, while at a hover, operate at low speeds with maneuvering capability to roll and yaw. We want it to have the handling perspective to make the aircraft able to do what it is able to do,” Tobin added. The V-280 Valor will also have yet-to-be-determined Degraded Visual Environment technology that allows sensors to see through obscurants such as brown-out conditions, bad weather and other impediments to navigation. Part of this will also include a system called Controlled Flight into Terrain wherein an aircraft has an ability to quickly re-route itself it is approaching a dangerous obstacle such as a mountain, rock wall or building structure. The new attack variant is expected to use a modernized or next-generation of existing Apache sensors and targeting systems called the Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor, or MTADS/PVS. When it comes to sensors and mission equipment, Bell engineers are building a tiltrotor aircraft with what is called “open architecture,” meaning software and hardware able to quickly integrate new technologies as they emerge. The concept is to construct a helicopter that is not intended to operate today but rather advance technology well into the 2030s and beyond. Therefore, it will need to anticipate the weapons, sensors, computer processors and avionics likely to emerge by the 2030s. This will likely draw upon a semi-autonomous navigation technology built into the aircraft known as “fly-by-wire.”  Bell Helicopter developed the initial algorithms for this technology, which is also now on the V-22 Osprey. Another survivability technology potentially slated for the aircraft is a system known as Common Infrared Countermeasure, or CIRCM; CIRCM is a lighter weight variant of an existing technology which uses a laser-jammer to throw incoming enemy missiles off course – therefore protecting the aircraft. "We are looking to the DoD customer to see what they want. Either way we can get that on the airplane,” Tobin explained. Bell helicopter has now attached the wing to the fuselage of the new tiltrotor aircraft engineered to reach speeds of 280 knots, fly for 800 kilometers on one tank of fuel, hover and maneuver in “high-hot” conditions and function as both a utility and attack helicopter platform. The intention is to build an advanced, high-tech tiltrotor demonstrator aircraft to take flight in November of 2017 as part of an effort to ultimate build a future aircraft able to begin operations in the 2030s. “There is one long wing. We attach the middle of the wing to the fuselage - the entire wing is one piece bolted to the fuselage of the airplane. One wing covers both sides. The wing is attached with aircraft grade structural fasteners. There are enough aircraft fasteners to provide sufficient strength to hold the aircraft together,” Tobin said.  As of January  of this year, Bell engineers are 81-percent complete with the aircraft; the wing is attached and the wiring is put in, Tobin said. In the next few months, Bell engineers will begin installation of the gear boxes and the fuel tanks.  Ground vibration testing is also slated to take place in coming months, to be followed by scale-model wind-tunnel data.  In addition, the future aircraft is intended to be able to use fuel-efficient engine technology to allow an aircraft to travel at least 800 kilometers on a single tank of fuel. Such an ability will enable the aircraft to operate more easily one a single mission without needing Forward Arming and Refueling Points, or FARPs. The idea is to engineer and aircraft able to fly from the west coast to Hawaii without needing to refuel. “FVL is a high priority. We have identified capability gaps. We need technologies and designs that are different than what the current fleet has. It will carry more equipment, perform in high-hot conditions, be more maneuverable within the area of operations and execute missions at longer ranges,” Rich Kretzschmar, project manager for the FVL effort, told Scout Warrior in an interview several months ago. Requirements for the program are still being refined for the Army-led program, which is aimed at service future aircraft for all four services. These requirements, now being put into actual demonstrator aircraft built by both Bell and a Boeing-Sikorsky industry teams, include building and aircraft able to reach speeds greater than 230 knots, hover in thin air at 6,000-feet and 95-degrees Fahrenheit, achieve a combat radius of at least 434 kilometers and be configured to include emerging sensors and mission equipment technologies likely to emerge by the 2030s. “We had set 230 as the speed requirement because we wanted to push the technology.  We wanted people to bring new ideas and new configurations to the table,” Bailey said.   Kris Osborn can be reached at Kris.Osborn@Scout.com.

By Franz-Stefan Gady for The Diplomat May 03, 2017               The U.S. State Department officially approved the possible sale of four P-8A Poseidon Maritime Surveillance Aircraft to New Zealand on April 27, according to a press release published by the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) — the Pentagon’s lead agency on arms sales to allied nations. “This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and national security of the United States by strengthening the security of a Major Non-NATO ally which has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability within the region,” DSCA states. “New Zealand is a close ally in the region and an important partner on critical foreign policy and defense issues.” The $1.46 billion deal includes training and associated technical and logistical support for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF). However, according to the New Zealand Defense Force (NZDF), the New Zealand government has not committed to the sale so far. The NZDF said that the $1.46 billion price tag was higher than expected and negotiations would continue in the coming months.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month. Other contenders include the Airbus DS C295 MPA and Japan’s Kawasaki P-1 maritime patrol aircraft, among others. Once selected, the new aircraft are slated to replace the RNZAF’s six P-3K2 Orion maritime patrol aircraft under the RNZAF’s so-called Future Air Surveillance Capability project by 2025. New Zealand’s Ministry of Defense awarded U.S. aircraft maker Boeing a $24.1 million contract for the upgrade of six P-3K2 Orion in April 2016. “The new upgrade will equip the aircraft with a new underwater intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capability package in order to boost the P-3K2 planes’ anti-submarine warfare capabilities,” I explained last year. While the upgrade will temporarily improve the RNZAF’s anti-submarine warfare capability, the P-3K2s will nevertheless reach the end of their service life within a decade. The P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft was first introduced into service in 1966, when the first five planes were inducted by the RNZAF. In 1985 an additional used P-3 aircraft was purchased from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The aircraft underwent an upgrade in the 1980s under the defense ministry’s Project RIGEL. The P-8A, a military variant of Boeing’s Next-Generation 737-800 commercial aircraft, was specifically designed to replace the United States Navy’s fleet of P-3 Orion aircraft. As I noted in February 2016: The P-8A has a range of up to 7,242 kilometers (4,500 miles) without refueling, reaches speeds of up to 490 knots, and can fly in the “harshest maritime flight regimes, including extended operations in icing environments,” Boeing boasts. The aircraft can carry several types of bombs, Raytheon Mark 54 lightweight torpedoes (…), mines, and depth charges, in addition to air-to-surface missiles installed on the underwing hardpoints. The P-8A also has the capability to control a number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to extend sensor reach. Given that the RNZAF’s maritime patrol aircraft will be cut by a third from six to four, the defense ministry is mulling purchasing a number of UAVs and deploying them in maritime surveillance roles to cover the RNZAF’s extensive maritime area of responsibility.

Johnson Technology’s Brilliant Factory in Norton Shores held a grand opening today, the Muskegon Chronicle reported. A company release said the 35,000-square-foot facility links design, engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, distribution and services into one system. The system collects and analyzes data to make the factory smarter, resulting in higher quality parts for the GE90 engine. There are about 2,500 engines in service and over 67 million flight hours. Johnson Technology, a subsidiary of GE Aviation, said it has hired 90 people since fall 2016, putting the company’s total employees in the state at nearly 800. The company received an $800,000 performance-based grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation for the project, plus a 12-year, 50-percent property tax abatement from the city of Norton Shores. “GE Aviation is one of our largest manufacturing employers, and one of the fastest growing employers in Norton Shores,” city administrator Mark Meyers said. “We’re pleased to be able to assist them in expansion.” The company’s headquarters are in the city of Muskegon, and its second facility is adjacent to the new one in Norton Shores. The facility has been operational since early 2017. GE Aviation is an operating unit of General Electric Company, and provides commercial and military jet engines as well as avionics, digital solutions and electrical power systems for aircraft.

Published Apr 18, 2017.   Wikimedia Commons Apr 18, 2017.   Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print With twenty-nine states and over 50 ethnic groups, India’s diversity is mind-boggling to most foreigners. This diversity manifests itself across areas from clothing to art and especially to food. With globalisation, growth of international travel and availability of international ingredients, the culinary diversity of India has become progressively richer. New trends in food are continuously introduced to the Indian palate and are mainly driven by the demands of generation Y. Take the example of schezwan idlis and dosas. These traditional South Indian snacks have been completely transformed by simply adding schezwan sauce to them – creating a dish that is distinctly Indian, but with an international twist. We also have the traditional thepla transformed into thepla tacos – combining the culinary flavours of India and Mexico! And cous cous and quinoa upma – where niche global ingredients are being used to recreate a beloved local dish. Millennials want a true fusion of foreign flavours and ingredients with Indian dishes to create something both Indian and international.

Is it just the growing need for versatility in the culinary experiences of millennials? Or is it greater exposure to varied cultures and their food habits? It’s a mix of both. Research points to the rising trend to seek out new cuisines that are not only healthy, but are also different and inspired by international flavours. The global food trend of ‘deconstruction’ where a food item is broken down into its component flavours and then reconstructed using completely different ingredients is also catching on for Indian food. Restaurants like Masala Library (Mumbai), Farzi Café (Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru) and Pink Poppadum (Bengaluru) are pushing the boundaries of what traditional Indian food means. Things like a kulcha pizza, dal chaawal cutlet and chutney foam are no longer inconceivable. Food outlets that stock exotic ingredients and brands that sell traditional Indian packaged snacks in entirely new flavours are also becoming more common across cities. When it comes to the flavours themselves, some have been embraced more than others. Schezwan sauce, as we’ve mentioned, is now so popular that it is sometimes even served with traditional chakna at Indian bars. Our fascination with the spicy red sauce is however slowly being challenged by other flavours. Wasabi introduced to Indian foodies in Japanese restaurants has become a hit among spice loving Indians with its unique kick. Peri Peri, known both for its heat and tanginess, on the other hand was popularised by the famous UK chain Nandos. And finally, there is the barbeque flavour – the condiment has been a big part of India’s love for American fast food. Another Indian snack that has been infused with international flavours is the beloved aloo bhujia. While the traditional gram-flour bhujia was first produced in 1877 in the princely state of Bikaner in Rajasthan, aloo bhujia came into existence once manufacturers started experimenting with different flavours. Future Consumer Limited’s leading food brand Tasty Treat continues to experiment with the standard aloo bhujia to cater to the evolving consumer tastes. Keeping the popularity of international flavours in mind, Tasty Treat’s has come up with a range of Firangi Bhujia, an infusion of traditional aloo bhujia with four of the most craved international flavours – Wasabi, Peri Peri, Barbeque and Schezwan. Tasty Treat’s range of Firangi Bhujia has increased the versatility of the traditional aloo bhujia. Many foodies are already trying out different ways to use it as a condiment to give their favourite dish an extra kick. Archana’s Kitchen recommends pairing the schezwan flavoured Firangi Bhujia with manchow soup to add some crunch. Kalyan Karmakar sprinkled the peri peri flavoured Firangi Bhujia over freshly made poha to give a unique taste to a regular breakfast item. Many others have picked a favourite amongst the four flavours, some admiring the smoky flavour of barbeque Firangi Bhujia and some enjoying the fiery taste of the peri peri flavour. Add some crunch to your manchurian Spice up your Chinese Bhel and Manchow Soup Be it the kick of wasabi in the crunch of bhujia, a bhujia sandwich with peri peri zing, maska pav spiced with schezwan bhujia or barbeque bhujia with a refreshing cold beverage - the new range of Firangi Bhujia manages to balance the novelty of exotic flavours with the familiarity of tradition.

Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market’s anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. Technology companies and banks have stood out in the first quarter, said David Schiegoleit, the head of investments at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. He said many different types of technology companies are doing well, especially ones that cater to consumers. A key reason is that after years of trouble, economies outside the U.S. are improving. “Emerging market economies are starting to get better momentum and we’re also starting to see some pretty decent activity out of Europe,” he said. “All the different major components of the technology sector are posting double-digit (earnings) gains.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for technology companies and banks to rise 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. While most banks have already released their results, there are dozens of technology companies remaining to report. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41. Online retailer Amazon.com stood out among consumer-focused companies as it picked up $23.44, or 2.5 percent, to $948.43. Before dawn on Monday, Congress unveiled a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The House is currently scheduled to vote on the bill Wednesday. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. With investors reassured, they sold bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.32 percent from 2.29 percent. That sent interest rates higher, which allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans. Capital One Financial advanced $1.19, or 1.5 percent, at $81.57 and Citizens Financial rose 56 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.13. Investors also sold high-dividend stocks including utilities, phone companies and makers of household goods. Aerospace companies struggled after aircraft parts distributor Wesco Aircraft Holdings gave a weak second-quarter forecast. The company also said its president and CEO retired, and its stock tumbled $2.20, or 18.1 percent, to $9.95. Boeing fell $2.44, or 1.3 percent, to $182.39 and aircraft and helicopter maker Textron gave up 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.13. Industrial companies lagged the rest of the market following a report that output by U.S. factories didn’t grow as much as analysts expected. The Institute for Supply Management said new orders and hiring grew more slowly in April. Tribune Media rose after the Financial Times reported that Twenty-First Century Fox and Blackstone may make a joint takeover bid for the company. Tribune Media has stakes in Food Network, WGN cable network and owns TV stations. Tribune stock gained $2.19, or 6 percent, to $38.75. The companies declined to comment. Sinclair Broadcast Group is also reported to be interested in buying Tribune. Investment management company AllianceBernstein fell after it replaced Peter Kraus as chairman and CEO and removed most of the directors of its board. Kraus has led the company since 2008. The company named a new non-executive chairman and separate CEO, and removed nine of the 11 members of the board. It named six new directors. The stock gave up 75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $22.15. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 6 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver fell 42 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $16.84 an ounce. Copper rose 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.66 a pound. The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111.44 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0906 from $1.0895. Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for May Day. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6 percent. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay     Tags: percent, companies, cents, technology, stocks, company, Other stories from today: Fed likely to leave rates alone but signal more hikes coming Convenience stores add hot, cheap options Tech companies, banks take stocks higher     Print this Page  |  << Back            Daily Journal Quick Poll   How closely do you follow local news?

The carrier is now aiming to end losses by the end of next year, contingent on demand not deteriorating further, Chief Executive Officer Paul Gregorowitsch said in an interview on Tuesday. While the Mideast carrier will also delay plans to expand to a fleet of 70 aircraft and 75 destinations to 2023 from 2020, it still plans to order 15 new wide-body jets needed to replace older planes and add capacity, he said. Further discussions will be held with manufacturers and leasing firms next week as Oman Air seeks to agree terms to take either Airbus SE’s A350 or the Boeing Co. 787-9. The U.S. model has a slight advantage because the carrier already operates six Dreamliners, with the tally set to increase to 10 in 2018. The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Oman Air will also go ahead with deliveries of the 20 Boeing 737 Max planes it has on order as it leases out some of its current narrow-body fleet to better match seats to demand. While the carrier is continuing to operate 10 Airbus A330s, which form the core of its wide-body operations, those planes will be retired to make way for the new aircraft. Gregorowitsch said the upgraded A330neo isn’t of interest. Aid Ended While Oman Air remains unprofitable, the state-owned carrier is no longer getting government funding, having received $50 million last year and $300 million in 2014 when the CEO took over. The loss per passenger was cut by $10 last year and should decrease again in 2017, he said. Even with expansion more tentative, Oman Air has still added Nairobi and Manchester to its network this year, according to Gregorowitsch. Peshawar in Afghanistan could follow before the end of 2017, and addition next year include Hong Kong, Seoul and a city in South Africa, he said. More routes to mainland China are on hold after the company began flying to Guangzhou in 2016. It’s shelved plans for its own services to Turkey, relying instead on an agreement with  Turkish Airlines. Oman Air’s German flights are now operated as code-shares with  Deutsche Lufthansa AG and the European giant is among candidates for a joint-venture partnership, Gregorowitsch said.

TECHNOLOGY SpaceX Sends Classified Spy Satellite into Orbit for the Pentagon Monday's launch marked the first time SpaceX launched a satellite for the Pentagon's National Reconnaissance Office, breaking Boeing and Lockheed Martin's monopoly By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT SpaceX launched a classified spy satellite for the Pentagon on Monday. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement SpaceX, Elon Musk's commercial space rocket company, successfully launched a classified satellite for the Pentagon's National Reconnaissance Office on Monday morning. The National Reconnaissance Office satellite was boosted into orbit on a Falcon 9 reusable rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 7:14 a.m., according to the company. SpaceX and the NRO, which runs the U.S. spy satellite program, did not release details about what the spacecraft will do once in orbit. Monday's launch marked the first time SpaceX sent a payload for the U.S. military. According to the Wall Street Journal, SpaceX's launch broke Boeing's and Lockheed Martin's decades-long monopoly on national-security satellite launches. SpaceX, WSJ reports, has a backlog of $10 billion in launches on its books, most of which are for the Pentagon and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. As SpaceX has been certified to send spacecraft and satellites into orbits traditionally used by the NRO, the company plans to snag more U.S. government and U.S. military contracts. SpaceX is also eligible to compete for over a dozen Pentagon launch contracts through 2019, WSJ reports. Monday's launch was also significant for SpaceX because the Falcon 9 reusable rocket returned to earth without incident. The mission marks the fourth time the Falcon 9 returned safely after hurtling into space. Last September, a Falcon 9 exploded on the launchpad during tests. Published on: May 1, 2017 Advertisement

Zephyr 8, the product name for the capability procured by the MoD (also known as Zephry-S) is known as a pseudo-satellite. The first Zephyr-S will be ready for flight trials this year. A look inside Zephyr, Airbus’s new high-altitude spy pseudo-satellite Airbus Defence and Space’s Zephyr, a new breed of solar-powered aircraft designed to circle in the Earth’s stratosphere, is set to take to the skies in 2017. Able to launch, land and re-deploy like a hand-launched unmanned aerial vehicle, the high-altitude pseudo-satellite promises consistent, satellite-like Earth observation and communication services – at a fraction of the cost. In late 2015, the UK Government began making mention of a new British-designed aircraft that would “fly at the very edge of the earth’s atmosphere and allow us to observe our adversaries for weeks on end, providing critical intelligence for our forces”. This statement, which formed part of the prime minister’s statement on the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, was fleshed out in the actual review as being a “high altitude long endurance surveillance and relay remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS)” that would form part of a wider investment in modern intelligence collection capabilities, to also include an extension of the Shadow and Rivet Joint, E-3D Sentry and Sentinel aircraft, the acquisition of the Boeing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft and the Protector unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By February 2016 the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had formalised its plans, placing an order with Airbus Defence and Space for two solar-powered Zephyr-S high-altitude pseudo-satellite (HAPS) aircraft. The £13m contract was extended in August with the order of an additional aircraft. Zephyr: high-altitude pseudo-satellite The Zephyr UAS has been around for some time. Its development began with QinetiQ back in the early 2000s under a UK-US joint capability technology demonstration programme. The system was designed for ultra-long endurance from the outset, and by 2008 had begun setting unofficial world endurance records – flying at 60,000ft above the Sonoran Desert for more than 82 hours. Following the system’s sale to Airbus in 2013, development milestones have included the prototype vehicle (Zephyr 7) flying for over two weeks continuously – eight times longer than any other UAS. It is also the only solar-powered UAS to have flown at the stratospheric altitudes required to allow continuous operation. "It endures like a satellite giving extreme persistence on-station, it can be relocated like an aircraft, and it is cheaper than both to operate." Zephyr 8, the product name for the capability procured by the MoD (also known as Zephry-S) is known as a pseudo-satellite, because it endures like a satellite giving extreme persistence on-station, it can be relocated like an aircraft, and it is cheaper than both to operate. Its capabilities include military, security and civil applications, providing real-time images and video in all weather conditions. It runs exclusively on solar power, day and night, and has the autonomous capabilities to allow it to be flown beyond line-of-sight using a low mass, low power satellite communications system. At an altitude of 20km the aircraft has a visual range of over 400km, offering a data collection and high bandwidth communications relay capacity to areas in excess of 1,000km2. Assessing capability The first Zephyr-S will be ready for flight trials this year. The three aircraft, which Airbus is building at Farnborough in the UK, will form part of an operational concept demonstrator (OCD) to assess the system’s capabilities and explore its potential for use by the UK armed forces and other government departments. The additional Zephyr-S will allow two airframes to be tested simultaneously and demonstrate operational handover to show that the capability could be sustained indefinitely. The OCD trials will help inform the MoD’s decisions around how best to provide next-generation battlefield intelligence to UK forces, and will also put the airframe’s capabilities to the test. "The airframe is being touted as being capable of flying up to 70,000ft for up to 45 days at a time." At this point, the airframe is being touted as being capable of flying up to 70,000ft for up to 45 days at a time. With a wingspan of 25m, its solar array collects 40% more sunlight and the aircraft can carry 50% more batteries than earlier prototypes. Its development is providing interesting opportunities for UK industry to get in on the action. Ground-breaking technology One of the key technologies is being developed by UK company OXIS Energy, which is working on energy cells capable of meeting the specific energy target of 425Wh/kg – which is what will enable the Zephyr aircraft to fly above any weather in the troposphere and remain aloft for three months without needing to land. “The aircraft is extremely light and the largest mass by far is the battery,” says Tom Cleaver, R&D programme manager at OXIS. “By increasing the specific energy of the cells to 425Wh/kg, the battery can be made lighter which will allow it to fly higher and therefore cover more of the globe. “The aircraft operation is actually very simple - it has solar panels on the wings that both charge the batteries and power the motors during the day and the batteries provide all of the power during the night.” "The aircraft operation is actually very simple - it has solar panels on the wings that both charge the batteries and power the motors." These cells are lithium sulphur (Li-S), an innovative battery chemistry that has a theoretical energy density five times greater than lithium-ion, with lighter weight and longer life-cycle characteristics. OXIS is carrying out extensive materials research, production process development and cell performance characterisation in order to improve the specific energy of the Li-S cells and hit the cycle life targets that Airbus has set. This will be done in an iterative manner in order to integrate the improvements the company will be making to each element. Increasing energy density further is one of the greatest challenges for a programme such as Zephyr, and requires the reduction of the dead mass of the cell - such as current collectors, pouch materials or tabs – to the absolute minimum and increasing the amount of active materials and the utilisation of them. “You could try to equate it to vehicle development. People want to be able to drive fast and have great fuel efficiency - this requires clever science and engineering as well as new materials to achieve,” Cleaver says. “[Since] the project started in November 2016 research work has commenced and is progressing, with the first built integrated cell having demonstrated 380Wh/kg against the 425Wh/kg target. We are now full speed on research and development, so we plan to make improvements to the cells. We have a target end date for the project of January 2019 but we are keen to beat this.” Zephyr will bring the UK a unique and highly flexible intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capability. With its ability to launch and land like a hand-launched UAS and circle in the earth’s stratosphere at beyond line-of-sight ranges, it will be able to provide satellite-like earth observation and communication capabilities at a fraction of the cost of the traditional assets it will work alongside. If the programme goes to plan, the sky really is the limit. Share Follow Us Facebook Twitter LinkedIn YouTube Newsletter For all the latest army industry news, sign up for our regular updates.

Consider This Growing Risk Business owners may not realize how offering employees retirement plans exposes them to lawsuits By John Taft John Taft is the former CEO of RBC US Wealth Management US. He is a 35-year veteran of and thought leader in the financial industry who has authored two books, Stewardship and A Force for Good, about how finance can better contribute to positive social goals. He served as Chair of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. John speaks and appears regularly in the media on responsible finance. He graduated Summa Cum Laude from Yale University and has a masters degree from the Yale School of Organization and Management. John currently lives in Minneapolis, MN. Former CEO, RBC US Wealth Management US WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement You've heard the word "fiduciary" a lot recently, about a new Department of Labor (DOL) rule for financial advisors who advise individual investors about their retirement savings. But for business owners and executives who offer retirement plans for their employees, it's old DOL rules that are causing heartburn. The reason: plaintiffs' lawyers have filed a blizzard of lawsuits alleging sponsors of retirement plans have breached their fiduciary duties. One law firm in Connecticut brought 19 actions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in a single year. St. Louis attorney Jerry Schlichter filed 18 lawsuits in the same period. The list of defendants reads like a who's who of corporate America: Chevron, Cigna, Edward D. Jones, JP Morgan, Fidelity, Mass Mutual, Northrup Grumman, Oracle, United Health Group. Schlichter's firm is reported to have negotiated settlements topping $300 million from firms like Boeing, General Dynamics, International Paper, including one for $62 million from Lockheed Martin. So far, targets have mostly been big firms (and, interestingly, elite universities). But in financial markets, what starts at the top generally trickles down into the middle markets and to smaller firms, and ERISA litigation is likely to be no exception. ERISA-based class action lawsuits come in several flavors, but they usually call out "excessive fees," alleging retirement plans cost participants more than they should have because the plans failed to offer the cheapest investment options, or have failed to negotiate appropriate fees with record keepers and other service providers. Financial institutions that offer their own products as options in their retirement plans - particularly actively managed mutual funds with expense ratios higher than those on index funds or ETFs - are vulnerable to charges they violate ERISA's "reasonableness" standard. Other lawsuits target too many fund offerings or poor investment performance, or offering a low-return money market fund when higher yielding cash investments - like stable value funds - might have been available. At a time when virtually no retirement plan is safe from legal challenge, what can plan sponsors do to protect themselves? First, hire specialists to help design the plan and select investment offerings. When it comes to retirement plans, the primary thing owners and managers of mid-sized to small firms are thinking about is, "Are our employees using the benefit we're providing to them?" They don't have the understanding, expertise or even the time required to set up and act as proper fiduciaries of retirement plans. Second, periodically and proactively review all vendor relationships in the retirement plan and what they are being paid. Every one to three years is probably often enough. The DOL has forms that can be used for this. And third-party benchmarking services are available which provide data about what "reasonable" compensation looks like for different kinds of vendors. Third, buy fiduciary liability insurance. Your property and casualty insurer carries it and it's not that expensive. Finally, write to your Congressman or Senator. The public policy irony is that ERISA-based class action lawsuits are having a chilling effect on defined contribution plans at a time when America's retirement savings crisis is becoming more and more acute every day. The Pew Foundation reported in 2016 that only 22% of workers at small firms have access to a retirement savings plan at work. US Senators Mark Warner (D-VA) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have introduced a bill that would ease the administrative and filing burdens of starting and maintaining a small employer retirement plan. But their bill doesn't address and won't solve the liability issue. What would solve the liability issue is reconsidering why businesses that sponsor defined contribution plans should be fiduciaries at all. Fiduciary status made sense when businesses were making investment decisions on behalf of their employees in traditional defined benefit pension plans that determined how much participants would receive throughout their retirement. But in today's world of defined contribution 401(k) plans, where employees themselves are making choices about how to invest their retirement savings, ERISA fiduciary rules may be the wrong standard. And may have unintended negative consequences.   The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: May 2, 2017 Advertisement

Investors received several headlines from the nation's capital on Monday. The first was news of an agreement between congressional leaders that, if approved, will keep the government funded through September. The deal, which puts fears of a government shutdown on hold, sent the S&P 500 into positive territory at the opening bell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average which dipped in and out of negative territory, finished down 27.05 points, or 0.1%, at 20,913.46. The S&P 500 index closed up 4.13 points, or 0.2%, at 2,388.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished up 44 points, or 0.7%, to a record 6,091.60, after touching an all-time intraday high of 6,100.73. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record Monday, with shares of Apple hitting a new high, while the Dow industrials slipped lower as investors digested a raft of economic reports and looked ahead to the start of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday. Only five of the 11 main sectors finishing higher. Tech shares led the charge, finishing up 0.9%, followed by a 0.6% gain in real-estate stocks. Telecoms were the largest decliners, down 0.8%, while utilities shed 0.7%. However, the next headline, which was a statement from President Trump, resulted in a small sell-off in the early-afternoon session. Mr. Trump said that he may favor breaking up the nation's biggest banks, which briefly sent the financial sector lower. However, stocks recovered shortly thereafter as the headline provided little new information; President Trump has mentioned reinstating Glass-Steagall prior to today's announcement. Dow was pressured by a 1.3% decline in Boeing and a 1.2% decline in shares of Home Depot . Apple shares closed up 2.1% at a record $146.60 after reaching an intraday record of $147.20. The stock is a major component in the three major U.S. stock indexes. The company reports quarterly results Tuesday afternoon. Earlier, the blue-chip benchmark briefly slipped into negative territory following comments by President Donald Trump that he was looking at breaking up big banks, with a retreat in financials contributing to much of that dip. Over the weekend, Congress cut a deal to fund the government through Sept. 30, which includes an increase in military spending. The Atlanta Fed tracker of GDP points to a strong rebound for the second quarter after the slowest quarter in three years. The GDPN ow model forecasts 4.3% growth. That would be the strongest growth since the third quarter of 2014. Strong economic growth can make the Federal Reserve tighten monetary policy and increase the fed-funds rate. Higher rates can boost the dollar and make gold less competitive against interest-bearing investments. Among other economic data on Monday, the personal-consumption-expenditures, or PCE index, fell 0.2% in March to mark the first decline in more than a year. U.S. manufacturing growth cooled off a bit in April, with the ISM manufacturing index slipping to 54.8% from 57.2%. Other U.S. reports this week include a policy statement from the Fed on Wednesday that could influence assumptions about the path for interest rates and metals which don't offer a yield. Investors will be looking at important labor-market report, with April jobs due Friday. Market is forecasting that 190,000 jobs were created in April, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.5%. On Monday, the dollar, one of the biggest drivers of dollar-pegged commodities, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index was trading nearly flat at 99.07. Crude oil prices logged their lowest finish in about five weeks Monday, 01 May 2017 on concerns that rising U.S. crude output would offset efforts by OPEC and other large crude producers to cap a nagging global oil glut. The price drop extends a downbeat tone in crude trade into May after futures contracts registered a second straight monthly decline. June West Texas Intermediate crude fell 49 cents, or 1%, to settle at $48.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. WTI prices lost about 2.5% in April. July Brent on London's ICE Futures exchange declined by 53 cents, or 1%, to $51.52 a barrel. Bullion metals ended sharply lower at Comex on Monday, 01 May 2017. Gold futures settled sharply lower with the yellow metal booking its lowest finish in three weeks, following U.S. data implying a strong rebound in second-quarter economic growth. June gold dropped $12.80, or 1%, to settle at $1,255.50 an ouncethe lowest for most-active contract since 10 April 2017. The yellow metal rose over the past two sessions, but saw a weekly loss of 1.6%, as geopolitical risks, particularly in Europe, appear to have cooled somewhat, undercutting haven demand for commodities like gold that thrive in uncertainty. Silver for July delivery declined 42 cents, or 2.4%, to $16.842 an ouncethe lowest since mid-January. In the bond market, Treasuries settled lower across the board, however, selling pressure was not distributed equally across the yield curve. The 10-yr yield finished four basis points higher while the 2-yr yield added only two basis points. Today's trading volume was relatively light. Market were closed across Europe and most of Asia in observance of Labor Day. 874.2 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow, investors will not receive any economic reports, but April auto and truck sales will be released throughout the day.

Other U.S. reports this week include a policy statement from the Fed on Wednesday that could influence assumptions about the path for interest rates and metals which don't offer a yield. Investors will be looking at important labor-market report, with April jobs due Friday. Market is forecasting that 190,000 jobs were created in April, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.5%. On Monday, the dollar, one of the biggest drivers of dollar-pegged commodities, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index was trading nearly flat at 99.07. Crude oil prices logged their lowest finish in about five weeks Monday, 01 May 2017 on concerns that rising U.S. crude output would offset efforts by OPEC and other large crude producers to cap a nagging global oil glut. The price drop extends a downbeat tone in crude trade into May after futures contracts registered a second straight monthly decline. June West Texas Intermediate crude fell 49 cents, or 1%, to settle at $48.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. WTI prices lost about 2.5% in April. July Brent on London's ICE Futures exchange declined by 53 cents, or 1%, to $51.52 a barrel. Bullion metals ended sharply lower at Comex on Monday, 01 May 2017. Gold futures settled sharply lower with the yellow metal booking its lowest finish in three weeks, following U.S. data implying a strong rebound in second-quarter economic growth. June gold dropped $12.80, or 1%, to settle at $1,255.50 an ouncethe lowest for most-active contract since 10 April 2017. The yellow metal rose over the past two sessions, but saw a weekly loss of 1.6%, as geopolitical risks, particularly in Europe, appear to have cooled somewhat, undercutting haven demand for commodities like gold that thrive in uncertainty. Silver for July delivery declined 42 cents, or 2.4%, to $16.842 an ouncethe lowest since mid-January. In the bond market, Treasuries settled lower across the board, however, selling pressure was not distributed equally across the yield curve. The 10-yr yield finished four basis points higher while the 2-yr yield added only two basis points. Today's trading volume was relatively light. Market were closed across Europe and most of Asia in observance of Labor Day. 874.2 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow, investors will not receive any economic reports, but April auto and truck sales will be released throughout the day.

He has been a reporter for Bloomberg News, Dow Jones, the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and the Guardian. Follow @davidfickling Facebook Twitter Email Print Share May 2, 2017 2:28 AM EDT SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD -0.05 As of 2:45 AM EDT 10.30 SGD Singapore Airlines Ltd. likes to project a certain consistency. Its female flight attendants wear a uniform that hasn't significantly changed since the airline's founding. The shares have traded for several years at an almost fixed price of S$10 apiece. And its board hardly ever takes on a cent of net debt. That's about to change, Abhishek Vishnoi of Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. Borrowings will exceed cash deposits by about S$568 million ($407 million) in the year through March 2018 and by S$2.59 billion the year after that, according to the median of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg -- enough to leave the carrier in a net debt position for the first time since 2004. Turbulence Ahead Singapore Air's net cash position hasn't dipped into debt since 2004 Source: Bloomberg, analyst estimates The reason for this isn't hard to discern. Singapore Air is engaging in a major fleet upgrade, with more than 200 aircraft on order from Boeing Co. and Airbus SE, worth about $54 billion at current list prices (although major customers can expect a substantial discount). Hey Big Spender Singapore Air's capital expenditure is set to soar Source: Bloomberg, company reports Such orders play out over the very long term, but capital spending still has to rise to fund them. Singapore Air forecasts a S$5.45 billion capex bill in fiscal 2019, almost double last year's level. Expenditure will remain elevated, by recent standards, for the foreseeable future. SIA aircraft on order $54 billion Many investors will argue it's long overdue for SIA to let its hair down a little. The tax advantages that debt enjoys over equity mean companies that refuse even moderate doses of the stuff are turning down one of the closest things financial markets have to a free lunch. Sticking cash in the bank is a particularly poor use of capital, especially when borrowing costs remain low. Even after the sharp fall in bond prices since late last year, the yield on a Bloomberg-Barclays index of global debentures is just 1.59 percent. Furthermore, investing against the cycle has worked spectacularly well for SIA in the past. By getting its hands on the most fuel-efficient new jets at the hefty discounts available to early customers, Singapore's flag carrier has often managed to reduce its operating costs well below what you'd expect from such a high-class outfit. Its previous dip into net debt in the early 2000s helped it build the fleet that briefly turned it into the world's biggest carrier by market value late in the decade. All this assumes, however, that what SIA is confronting this time is a cyclical, and not a secular, shift. That could prove a mistake. Borrowing to invest makes sense if you're confident you're leveraging up to ride out a weak patch and grab share in a growing market. But if you're under pressure from competitors with long-term structural advantages, it can be a distinctly shaky game. Low Flying Singapore Air's passenger yield fell to financial-crisis levels last year Source: Company presentations Note: RPK = revenue passenger kilometer, the number of passengers carried multiplied by the distance flown. Data not available for 2011 and 2012 fiscal years. That's the situation confronting SIA. State-controlled carriers in China and the Gulf are threatening the group's traditional dominance of the long-haul market, while AirAsia Bhd. is undermining it on regional routes. Last August, yield -- a measure of passenger revenue per kilometer flown -- touched its lowest level since the financial crisis at Singapore Air's brand-name carrier. Meanwhile, the competition isn't standing still and letting Singapore buy all the fuel-efficient planes. China's big three carriers are busy investing in the same A350s and 737 MAX models SIA is purchasing, while the 39 A320neos it's buying seems piddling next to the 404 AirAsia has on order. Cash Discount Most of the airlines holding more cash than debt are low-cost carriers Source: Bloomberg Net cash positions are unusual on airline balance sheets, but among low-cost carriers they're rather common. That stands to reason: If you expect to walk the tightrope of narrow margins, it makes sense to have a safety net. By discarding Singapore Air's cash pile, Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong is betting he won't be needing that security in the years ahead. Investors in the storied carrier had better hope he's right. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Yield numbers for SIA's short-haul SilkAir and discount Scoot and Tiger brands aren't available over comparable periods.

PerthNow Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend QANTAS’ next nonstop flight will be Perth to Paris starting late next year, according to airline insiders, as analysts say the Boeing 787 Dreamliner services from WA will be a game changer. The second destination from Perth will be launched with the delivery of the second batch of four 236-seat Boeing 787-9s from the middle of next year. The news of the second destination from Perth comes after questions were raised at the weekend by Britain’s Independent newspaper about the cost differential in pricing of the flights for Australians and Britons. The Independent claimed Australians were being charged about 20 per cent more for tickets but when average weekly earnings were factored in the opposite is the case, with British residents paying 37 per cent more. Qantas would not confirm the next destination, saying that a number of options were on the table. Andrew McGinnes, Qantas executive manager corporate affairs and communication, said yesterday the airline was “really excited about the potential of the Perth hub and at the moment our focus is making a success of the London route but we are looking at other options down the track”. Perth-Paris flights would provide a gateway to mainland Europe.Source:PerthNow “We’re not in a position to comment on speculation now, but one stop from Australia to Europe is a fantastic proposition that we want to build on,” Mr McGinnes said. However, senior sources in the airline’s pilot ranks confirmed a new 787 pilot base would be set up in Brisbane to support a Dallas or Los Angeles-Brisbane-Perth-Paris operation. The new WA Government has expressed doubt about the benefits to the State from the nonstop service. However the Independent reported that Merrill Lynch had changed its rating on Qantas to “buy”, because of the introduction of the Boeing 787 service. In a client report titled Perth/London Game Changer, the wealth management company says “we upgrade QAN (Qantas) to buy from neutral on the back of benefits that could flow from QAN’s Dreamliner introduction”. It said that the 787 would be 34 per cent more fuel efficient than the A380 and would be 50 per cent less costly to maintain than a 747.

Asian shares had struggled earlier following the release of weaker-than-expected China manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.6 percent to 7,247 while the CAC 40 in France added 0.4 percent to 5,290. Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent to 12,466. U.S. shares looked set for a lukewarm start, with Dow and S&P futures both down 0.1 percent. GREECE'S DEAL: Greece and its creditors agreed the country should make another round of pension cuts in 2019 and commit to a budget target when its current bailout program ends next year. The deal will restart bailout loan payments and keep the country from facing default and reigniting a eurozone crisis this summer, officials said Tuesday.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen, as shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi) U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: In other reassuring news, the House of Representatives is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed similar trends. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent to 19,445.70, helped by a weaker yen, which boosts profits for manufacturers. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.7 percent to 2,219.67. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.3 percent to 24,696.13, while the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.71. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.1 percent to 5,950.40, while shares were higher in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 29 cents to $49.13 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 37 to $51.89 a barrel. CURRENCIES: The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.0915 while the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 112.24 yen. A man walks past an electronic stock indicator of a securities firm in Tokyo, Tuesday, May 2, 2017.

Trump. Photo Credit: White House. 1 Opinion  Three Months Of Donald Trump: More Of The Same – OpEd May 2, 2017 IDN 0 Comment Donald Trump, Foreign Policy, Politics, United States By IDN By Marcelo Colussi* More than three months have passed since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the world’s leading capitalist power: the United States of America. Nothing has changed. If someone had thought that something could change with his arrival at the White House, they were mistaken from beginning to end. Why should anything change? The rhetoric used by the tycoon during his presidential campaign could certainly have led one to imagine – mistakenly – some change of scenario. Given the current crisis experienced by the US economy, his programme appeared to be – at least in words – a promise to revive a downcast national industry. But here comes the mirage. What is downcast is the purchasing power of America’s working class, while its companies remain prosperous, very healthy, managing the outlook with prospects for the future. While it is true that, in technical accounting terms, China’s gross output has surpassed that of the United States, the latter still remains the world leader in economic, political, technological and military terms. Of the largest corporations in the world, the eleven largest have their headquarters in the United States, and 54 are the most capitalised among the first 100 on the planet. They continue to manage all domains: oil (ExxonMobil Corporation, Chevron-Texaco), communication technologies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Hollywood), banking (Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Berkshire Hathaway), chemicals (Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer Inc.) and, of course, the military industry (Lockheed Martin, Boeing Company, BAE Systems Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation, Raytheon Company, General Dynamics, Honeywell Aerospace, Halliburton. All these corporations of the industrial-military complex recorded sales of almost one trillion dollars in 2016, having also seen increases of 60% since 2010, a clear sign that the economic crisis does not count for them). There is decadence and, as has happened with every empire in history, it seems to have reached the peak of its expansion and begun its slow decline. But it is far from being a defeated empire: it continues to set the pace in many aspects. Immediately after the end of World War II, America was the great capitalist power dominating the scene. The only nation with nuclear power at the time, it accounted for 52 percent of the world’s gross product. At this point in time, it no longer holds a monopoly of the atomic bomb (at least Russia and China are its rivals in parity), and its contribution to global production has dropped to 18%. Undoubtedly, it is not continuing to expand, as it did from the middle of the 19th century and throughout the entire 20th century. Furthermore, although it is beginning to be called into question, its currency – the dollar – remains largely the universal currency, and English is still the obligatory lingua franca. Hollywood, no matter what, is the cultural referent of the planet, as much as Coca-Cola or McDonald’s. The process of neoliberal globalisation, begun in the 1970s, reconfigured the world and obviously also the capitalist system. Production and marketing became absolutely planetary: the same merchandise can be produced anywhere in the world with the same technology and distributed throughout an expanded world market. Private capital thus takes advantage of the advantages offered by the poorer countries where wages are lower and where it enjoys certain privileges, such as tax exemption, weakness or lack of environmental regulations and little or no trade union organisation of workers. In this way, a company from a rich and developed country leaves its facilities there to settle in some so-called “free zone” of the Third World, lowering production costs but not the final price of the finished product. And this product is no longer marketed only within the frontiers of the producing country, but on a world market. Under this scheme, the loser is the working class of the country from which capital originates. Capital does not lose – on the contrary, it profits even more. Considering this to be the mechanism at play, the United States began to impoverish relatively: its workers became impoverished because, in many cases, they became unemployed. Meanwhile, companies continued to profit monumentally. We have already seen the data of the military industry: more and more wars, therefore, more weapons. And the United States provides the global half of them. So there is no crisis for these mega-corporations. Let’s take as an example what was once the mecca of the automobile – the city of Detroit in the state of Michigan. By 1960, Detroit had three million inhabitants, most of them employed in automotive production. With the arrival of the process of relocation, the large US companies moved to countless locations on five continents around the globe. Detroit’s industrial working class was ruined (today, Detroit is a ghost town, with only 300,000 inhabitants), but the country’s automotive mega-corporations (General Motors, Ford, Chrysler) continued their business. Who became impoverished? The working class. Against this backdrop of impoverishment of the working masses (the voters), Donald Trump’s theatrical discourse during his campaign raised expectations. He spoke – as does every campaign candidate who sells dreams and verbal pyrotechnics – of changing that situation, of bringing the industry that had abandoned American soil back to the homeland. Undoubtedly, those fiery promises achieved their purpose: contrary to all odds, Trump won the election. But the companies did not return … nor will they return! In very good measure, his “hobby horse” for the campaign was fierce xenophobia, with promises of the expulsion of the many “Hispanics who come to steal jobs”. Construction of a wall (of which one-quarter is missing because, in fact, a fence has already been built on the border with Mexico) and the deportation of thousands of Latin Americans without documents had basically a propagandistic effect. The US economy remains very prosperous for capital, but is hardly improving for its workers. The fact is that it cannot improve, because the cycle of capitalist growth of the United States has come and gone. Its consumption far exceeds its production, so the country as a whole (population and State) is living on credit. It is Chinese and Japanese currencies that are keeping Washington’s federal budget afloat, and it is credit cards (with an average debt of 5,000 dollars per citizen) that are maintaining household economies. Who benefits from this? Obviously not the cardholders, the workers, but the banks. As with any theatrical speech by a presidential campaign candidate who sells “beads and baubles”, Donald Trump also said he would not engage in war with Syria, and that he would dampen the ever-burning conflict with Russia, the alleged preamble to a new world war (this time a nuclear war, therefore possibly the last). But, just months after taking office, we see how the industrial-military complex is continuing to decide things. The 59 cruise missiles fired on a military base in Syria or the “mother of all bombs” dropped recently in Afghanistan are proof. No president of the United States – like no president in any capitalist country anywhere on the planet – is the one who finally decides things. Strong powers whisper (or shout) in his ear what he should do. These powers have a specific name: they are those mega-corporations mentioned above. Since the middle of the last century, these mega-corporations have constituted what has been called the industrial-military complex, the main current economic activity of the United States (25 percent of its gross product). In 1997, George Kennan, a key Washington political scientist during the Cold War, said: “Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American military-industrial establishment would have to go on, substantially unchanged, until some other adversary could be invented. Anything else would be an unacceptable shock to the American economy”. The day a president – John F. Kennedy – dared to want to stop the war in Vietnam War, like all responses of these “big bosses”, he received a precise shot in the head. And, of course, the war in Vietnam went ahead. The 60,000 fallen US soldiers do not compare with the profits made by this military-industrial complex. That adversary which must be invented, by the way, does not fail to appear continuously: “Islamic terrorism”, “drug trafficking” or any new demon that may occur in the future (rogue states, maras (gangs), dengue transmitting mosquitoes, as in the Guaraní Aquifer on the triple Argentine-Paraguayan-Brazilian border, the” Castro-Communist dictatorship of Venezuela”, and so on). The military industry, which directly or indirectly employs one in four American workers, will not stop. Trump’s fanciful declarations prior to occupying the White House spoke of “reassurance” in the current undeclared – but real and effective – new Cold War (35,000 dollars a second spent on armaments worldwide). Recent military operations in Syria and Afghanistan show the reality. It is to be hoped that we will never arrive at a new world war with nuclear weapons. In that case, only the cockroaches could tell what follows (if any survive). The capital that leads the world is voracious, but not crazy. It will surely continue to manipulate public opinion, terrorising populations and showing apocalyptic images of a probable atomic confrontation, even if it never reaches the point of pressing the fateful buttons of pandemonium. But the need to “be ready for the hecatomb”, according to the well-oiled capitalist communication industry, means that the Roman maxim “If you want peace, prepare for war” remains valid. And the industrial-military complex continues to make millions. Why would Donald Trump be any different? Perhaps he has a different style, different from the political correctness of his predecessors, but it is already clear how things are after just three months: more of the same! It’s that simple … or pathetic. * Born in Argentina, Marcelo Colussi studied psychology and philosophy and now lives in Guatemala, where he is a university professor and social researcher.

Elon Musk, the visionary who built SpaceX and Tesla, has outlined his latest plan to build a network of high-speed freeways deep underneath Los Angeles, starting from a 500-foot-long experimental tunnel now under construction in Hawthorne. Musk addressed the most glaring potential road blocks, such as the incredibly high cost and low productivity of tunneling, in a 40-minute TED Talk interview Friday at the end of the TED2017 conference in Vancouver titled “The Future You.” “Right now, I think one of the most soul-destroying things is traffic,” Musk said. “It takes away so much of your life. It’s horrible. It’s particularly horrible in L.A. We’re trying to dig a hole under L.A. This is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3-D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion.” The talk came the day after a tunnel-boring machine arrived at SpaceX to dig a hole that will be used for “research and experimental purposes,” said interim City Manager Arnie Shadbehr. “This tunneling will be conducted by excavating a large bore pit almost 20 feet by 150 feet and 13.5-foot diameter,” Shadbehr wrote, in an email, adding that the tunnel itself will measure 500 feet in the SpaceX parking lot. It’s not clear if Musk will go forward with earlier plans to build a pedestrian tunnel for employees beneath Crenshaw Boulevard to link SpaceX’s parking structure with its headquarters building. “If they ever decide to undertake something beyond their private property, it is going to involve a whole slew of various initial and full-blown impact studies within various jurisdictions and geotechnical explorations to select the most feasible and cost-effective alignment,” Shadbehr said. Tunneling through the clutter But Musk said he’s going to bypass underground utilities and pipelines altogether by simply digging deeper tunnels. According to a 3-D simulation of Musk’s vision that he shared in the interview, cars would get deep underground via an elevator. “A couple things that are important in having a 3-D-tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance and exit seamlessly into the fabric of the city,” Musk said. “By having an elevator, sort of a car skate that’s on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance and exits to the network just by using two parking spaces.” Once in the network, vehicles would sit atop skates that would ferry them along a track at 130 mph. “You should be able to get from Westwood to LAX in five or six minutes,” he said. Advertisement Making digging cheaper Still, avoiding underground conflicts is only a piece of the puzzle. Digging is costly and slow. Musk has a plan to reduce the cost of tunneling, just as he reduced the cost of spaceflight. SpaceX rockets can deliver payloads into orbit at a third or fourth the cost charged by The Boeing Co. His tunnel-making business, which he dubbed The Boring Co., won’t work unless he can make tunnels much more cheaply, he said. As an example of the exorbitant costs of tunneling, Musk cited the $2 billion price tag of LA Metro’s Crenshaw/LAX Line extension connecting the Green Line in El Segundo to the Expo Line in South Los Angeles. It will open in 2019 but the tunneling finished earlier this month. “The L.A. subway extension, a 2.5-mile extension, was just completed for $2 billion. This is not the highest utility subway in the world so, yeah, it’s quite difficult to dig tunnels normally,” Musk said. “I think we have to have at least a 10-fold improvement in the cost-per-mile of tunneling.” To get there, he wants to reduce the diameter of single-lane traffic tunnels by more than half, to 12 feet. The second upgrade would be to make it possible for tunnel-boring machines to work constantly. As it is, the machines only work about half the time they’re underground because workers have to stop digging to periodically reinforce tunnel walls, he said. In addition to constant digging, Musk wants to amp up the power of his tunnel borer. “These machines are far from being at their power or thermal limit,” he said. “So you can jack up the power to the machine substantially.” What’s more, he said, “there’s no real limit to how many levels of tunnel you can have (underground). You can go much farther deeper than you can go up (in the air). This is a very important point.” The case for tunnels Tunneling engineers have criticized Musk’s tunneling ambitions as naive and ridiculous. But, in his explanation, his plan isn’t only reasonable, it’s overdue. “We’ve got a pet snail named Gary (at SpaceX). Currently, Gary is capable of going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine,” Musk said. “So, we want to beat Gary. Victory is beating the snail.” In planning mass-transit systems of the future, Musk says underground freeways sound a lot better to him than flying cars. “If something’s flying over your head, and there are a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation,” he said. “You don’t think to yourself: ‘Well I feel better about today.’ You’re thinking, ‘Did they service their hubcaps or is it going to come off and guillotine me.’ ” The Earth absorbs vibrations well, so deep tunneling will be completely unnoticed on the surface. But tunneling is only a small part of Musk’s visions of the future. He only spends “2 or 3 percent” of his time working on tunnels, he said. He’s busy revolutionizing space travel with SpaceX, and expanding his growing electric car and battery storage businesses. “This is basically interns and people doing it part-time,” he said. “We bought some second-hand machinery. It’s kinda puttering along but it’s making good progress.” In July, Tesla is set to release its long-awaited Model 3, an all-electric vehicle with autonomous driving capabilities starting at the comparatively low price of $35,000. Then, in September, a heavy-duty, all-electric semi truck will debut to compete with Toyota’s hydrogen fuel-cell powered truck. Both emit no pollution, but it’s not yet clear which technology is more adaptable. Musk is sure that electric power is the best bet for the energy of the future. His Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada is already mass producing lithium-ion batteries for cars and solar home and business energy storage. He has plans to add four more Gigafactories this year. Meanwhile, he’s also working to build the largest-ever spacecraft, and clear the path to human colonization of Mars. “It’s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live,” Musk said. “If the future doesn’t include being out there among the stars, and being a multiplanet species, I find that incredibly depressing. “I’m not trying to be anyone’s savior. I’m just trying to think about the future and not be sad.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reporter covering Carson, Hawthorne, Hermosa Beach and the environment.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and banks. Mark Lennihan, File AP Photo Business May 01, 2017 11:49 PM Asian shares mostly higher despite soft China factory data By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TOKYO Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

(Photo: Reuters) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Jay Nordlinger May 2, 2017 12:00 AM @jaynordlinger On capitalism, Wikipedia, Trump, Reagan, Obama, golfers, sopranos, and more ‘We are going to come first in all deals,” President Trump tweeted. The thing about deals — many deals, the right kind of deal — is that no one comes “first” or “second” or “third.” A deal works out for all. There is some zero-sum in life. Of course. But there is also mutual benefit. Years ago, someone gave me the “Thank you,” “Thank you” formulation. I don’t know who came up with this formulation. I don’t remember who introduced me to it! But I hope I will not forget it. America is a “Thank you,” “Thank you” society. The double “thank you” is part of capitalism’s nature. You hand over your money to the clerk. He says, “Thank you.” He hands you the purchase. You say, “Thank you.” Everybody’s happy. This is relatively rare in human history, I understand. Much of human history has been: Someone’s gonna get screwed, regardless. Trade deals ought to work out for everybody — ought to be in all parties’ interests. You don’t have to come “first.” You have to get something out of it. Not to be too kumbaya, but everybody is “first.” Steve Mnuchin is working overtime as Treasury secretary, it seems to me. I’ll tell you what I mean. At a recent press conference, he said that the president would not release his tax returns. Then he said, “The president has released plenty of information and, I think, has given more financial disclosure than anybody else.” Huh. Before that, Mnuchin said of Trump, “He’s got perfect genes. He has incredible energy and he’s unbelievably healthy.” Geez! I appreciate appreciation. And I know that Mnuchin is a master of the universe (to borrow Tom Wolfe’s phrase). But this approaches Dear Leader territory … The other day, I was appreciating Wikipedia (for all my gripes with it). A guest on my Q&A podcast was Eric Monkman, one of the quizzing champions of the world (a star of the just-concluded season of University Challenge). He told me that, when people looked back on the early 21st century, they would see Wikipedia as one of its glories. In Turkey, Erdogan has banned Wikipedia. Not for its inaccuracies, surely. For its accuracies. That’s a dictatorial thing to do: ban Wikipedia. On the campaign trail, Trump talked about seizing Iraq’s oil. He did it again, early in his presidency. The defense secretary, James Mattis, went to Iraq. He was asked about seizing that country’s oil. He said that we Americans “have generally paid for our gas and oil, and I’m sure that we will continue to do that.” A little later, the president said that Germany owed us a lot of money: for NATO services rendered over the years. Mattis calmly explained to a Senate committee that this was not how NATO worked. Huh. You can do that, if you’re a cabinet secretary? You can contradict the boss so baldly? Just recently, President Trump said that South Korea would have to pay for THAAD, the missile-defense system we have just put in. Then H. R. McMaster, the national-security adviser, comes along and says, Nope. I’m inclined to credit the president: for letting his men get away with this kind of thing. Or do they have a good cop–bad cop routine going? This administration will make for fascinating studies in the future, I wager. A note on Realpolitik and “idealism”: You can do business with China, because you have to. But you don’t have to heap praise on its No. 1 — the boss of the Communist party. You can do business with Egypt. But you don’t have to heap praise on its strongman. You can do business with the Philippines. But you don’t have to pretend that Duterte is anything but a murderous thug. This ought to be elementary. And America ought to stand for something in the world. In an interview, Trump put me in mind of Thomas L. Friedman. Show you what I mean. Here’s the president: You look at the rules of the Senate, even the rules of the House — but the rules of the Senate and some of the things you have to go through — it’s really a bad thing for the country, in my opinion. They’re archaic rules. And maybe at some point we’re going to have to take those rules on, because, for the good of the nation, things are going to have to be different. Friedman has the concept of “China for a day” — wishing America could be China for a day, ignoring democratic procedures, just rammin’ things home. You remember that Trump criticized Boeing, as a company ripping off the government (and thus the taxpayer). Well, Boeing has published a full-page ad, praising Trump for his magnificent first 100 Days. Okay. But is that sort of thing in a democracy kind of queasy-making? Let me quote from a recent column of mine, please — a “California Journal”: The garbage truck has a mechanical arm, picking up bins designed to go with the arm. A human being is driving the truck. But he seems to be the only one necessary. Is this a good thing, a great technological and human advance? Or is it a bad thing, leading to greater unemployment, narrowing people’s options? I suppose people have debated this kind of thing since the Industrial Revolution, if not before. So, robots will pick fruit. Is this better than illegal aliens? Or other human beings? Economics, like life — I should say “like the rest of life” — can be messy. You and I, being good right-wingers, can call Senator Schumer the “Head Clown.” Or the host of Meet the Press “Sleepy Eyes Todd.” Or the senior senator from Massachusetts “Pocahontas.” But should the president? Should the president engage in that kind of name-calling? At an earlier time, I think, there would have been no argument about this among conservatives. Shortly after he left office, the Gipper went to Japan to collect $2 million in speaking fees. Our media were aghast. Reagan was cashing in on the presidency! Brazenly! I remember what PJB — Patrick J. Buchanan — said in his defense: “This is the Reagans’ retirement fund.” I thought of this when reading about Barack Obama and his $400K for a speech. Is he cashing in on the presidency? Sure. But doesn’t everyone cash in? Bear with me: Didn’t Elvis Presley cash in on his talent? His looks, his voice, his personality — all of it? Apples and oranges! you may say. And I wouldn’t argue with you. But this is a big and complicated subject — people working their advantages. In 2007, Syria was building a nuclear facility. They were doing it with the help of North Korea. Israel went in and destroyed it. Will no one thank Israel? Yes — no one will thank Israel (’cept me). (And you, I bet.) I very much appreciate the formulation of Tom Nichols, the conservative professor and writer (and historic Jeopardy! champion!): “Liberals have to stop overreacting to Trump. Conservatives have to stop underreacting to him.” Reading an obit of Tom Fleming, a marathon runner, I thought of golfers. And singers. And others. There are some golfers who love the senior tour, and play on it till their legs can support them no more. Arnold Palmer was one such. He had been one of the greatest golfers in the world. But he simply wanted to be out there, playing and playing till the last trump. Jack Nicklaus was a little different. He played the senior tour for a bit — mainly to help that tour, I think. He won everything. And then, before he declined further, he quit. I brought this up with Renée Fleming once. (She is a famous soprano.) There are golfers — pro golfers — who will only play for money. The idea of recreational golf, social golf, is distasteful to them. They are pros. Does Renée sing, just for the hell of it? On her days off, does she flit about the house going “la la la”? No, no. Back to Tom Fleming, the marathoner: When he couldn’t win anymore — when he couldn’t compete at the highest level — he quit. “He was intense,” said the great Bill Rodgers, Fleming’s fellow marathoner. “He couldn’t jog. He had to race.” I understand (though don’t expect me to race — or jog).   A word from the National Review Store: To get Digging In: Further Collected Writings of Jay Nordlinger, go here.

It’s endlessly adaptable to human needs and technological trends, unlocking incredible potential for analysis, and helping solve tomorrow’s grand engineering challenges. At least, that’s the theory. In practice, adapting lofty MBSE principles to real-world conditions can be challenging. Over the last fifty years, models have become dramatically more complex, adding more functions, non-linear interactions and emergent properties with every iteration. What’s more, systems failures remind us that for all its promise, MBSE is an inherently human endeavor – imperfect, yet filled with promise. The friction between MBSE theory and practice is one of the core themes explored by MIT’s “Model-Based Systems Engineering: Documentation and Analysis,” a four-week online course led by Dr. Bruce Cameron starting on June 5. “Our aim is to put theoretical ideas alongside real-world examples – from companies like Boeing, GM and GE,” says Cameron, who serves as director of MIT’s System Architecture Lab. “You can see examples of MBSE being used to drive business outcomes across many different fields.” Consider BMW. Optimizing its suspension systems used to mean physically swapping out individual springs, dampers and chassis components, and hoping for the best. But with MBSE, the company was able to create a new, predictive model of its vehicles that virtualized each suspension component – and simulated their effects on ride quality. This allowed for extensive iteration and experimentation without costly early-run manufacturing and time-consuming physical testing. Early-stage MBSE benefits like these are well established: Low-risk exploration of new design ideas, and simpler collaboration based on common understanding. The long-term indicators have been just as encouraging. In many cases, MBSE has not only enabled next-generation traceability, but has become a powerful tool for validation, verification and testing. While benefits like maximizing time efficiency and lowering production costs can be a siren call to aspiring MBSE practitioners, Cameron stresses the importance of critical thinking when using models in real-world situations. “Antoine Vernon, a systems engineer for a large energy company who has completed his certificate, agrees." “I've learned to be more critical of the models I’m using. Sometimes it’s best to say, ‘We do not know and we cannot tell,’ which is a difficult thing to admit as a professional.” The origins of MBSE can be traced back to work done at Bell Telephone Laboratories and the US Department of Defense during the 1940s. As the discipline has evolved, it has been adapted by numerous large organizations. However, many participants in this course find the principles applicable to organizations of any size. “I may not be able to deploy MBSE at the scale of some of the examples seen in the class, but I think by modularizing and reusing parts of larger models, the main concepts can be applied in ways that are very useful,” says recent participant Lydia Lostan, a program manager at a large energy company.

It might seem to be an incredible idea, but if they completely solve the fuel problem, which is one of the biggest expense items in the aviation market, they will be profitable by almost 30%. Wright Electric has potential when we look at the core team. The core team is made up of a group of electric planes researchers working on NASA’s. The design team is made up of experienced people like who have worked on Boeing and Cessna. As a first step according to blog sharings, they will first try the system they developed on Piper Cherokee aircraft. At the same time, they are hoping to provide resources to be able to pass the concept plane to life. After that project, they plan to produce the first commercial (9-seat) planes to fly without jet fuel. According to the BBC, Wright Electric has succeeded in attracting interest from EasyJet, Europe’s popular cheap airline company. EasyJet plans to contribute their own experience with this project, which is compatible with their dream of transporting passengers from London to Paris with a fully-powered airplane over the next 10 years. Electric plane test is not a new development recently. Airbus has set up E-Fan to explore the potential of electric planes and even the first aircraft they produce has crossed the English Channel in 2015. Despite this success, Airbus has developed a hybrid version of E-Fan, both electric and internal combustion engines, because it could have been more sustainable. Wright, depending on how fast the battery industry will move forward over the next few years, they can also advance with a hybrid system. But they do not neglect to mention that airline companies will do anything ethically possible to reduce operating costs. While biological fuels are being tested in the US, there is no reason why different designs and studies are not done for electric aircraft. With such an improvement, both airline companies, indirectly customers and most the environment can benefit of it. The reduction in the use of jet fuel will be really beneficial for the environment.

Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market’s anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41. Online retailer Amazon.com stood out among consumer-focused companies as it picked up $23.44, or 2.5 percent, to $948.43. With investors reassured, they sold bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.32 percent from 2.29 percent. That sent interest rates higher, which allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans. Capital One Financial advanced $1.19, or 1.5 percent, at $81.57 and Citizens Financial rose 56 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.13. Aerospace companies struggled after aircraft parts distributor Wesco Aircraft Holdings gave a weak second-quarter forecast. The company also said its president and CEO retired, and its stock tumbled $2.20, or 18.1 percent, to $9.95. Boeing fell $2.44, or 1.3 percent, to $182.39 and aircraft and helicopter maker Textron gave up 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.13. Industrial companies lagged the rest of the market following a report that output by U.S. factories didn’t grow as much as analysts expected. The Institute for Supply Management said new orders and hiring grew more slowly in April. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 6 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver fell 42 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $16.84 an ounce. Copper rose 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.66 a pound. The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111.44 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0906 from $1.0895. Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for May Day. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6 percent. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey.

The #Minuteman Iii is an ICBM equipped for conveying nuclear bombs. Originally constructed during the 1970s, it started off priced as $7 million. Today, its price tag stands at $40 million. The Air Force upgraded the missile over the years, including its framework systems. The Vandenberg Air Force Base directed the rocket launch in California. It sent the nuclear warhead approximately 4,200 miles to a test location somewhere near the Marshall Islands. Advertisements The U.S., THAAD, and North Korea Colonel John Moss said the dispatch served as a vital demonstration of what #The United States is capable of in their nuclear abilities. Advertisements He mentioned that American missile tests are imperative to approving the viability and availability of the nation’s operational atomic frameworks. A few days ago, the U.S. started introducing a hostile rocket battery in South Korea to safeguard against dangers from North Korea. In a declaration meant for congressional staff, U.S. Pacific Command Admiral Harry Harris addressed this new collaboration and that it entails. The THAAD framework, initially produced by Lockheed Martin, anticipates its operation in South Korea within the next few days. As the world awaits, the U.S. Navy has already sent a strike assembly towards the Korean peninsula via their USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier. American plans for battle amid congressional discussion The Pentagon is the primary source conducting this whole operation. Their move comes after the White House scheduled a Senate briefing expecting to discuss their issues with North Korea next week. The leaders of the conference are as follows: Rex Tillerson, State Secretary James Mattis, Defense Secretary Dan Coats, Director of National Intelligence General Joseph Dunford, executive of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Senator Mitch McConnell requested for Trump’s political cabinet to continuously inform all congressional staff of any updates surrounding this future meeting.. Advertisements He also issued a statement during a White House press conference. He stated that Kim Jong-Un is no longer predictable in how he chooses to escalate certain situations in North Korea. In every aspect, his administration stopped making the same derogatory moves that lured the United States into a transaction that concentrated on concessions. He believes Kim seems willing to risk any objection handed to him by the United Nations by engaging in his nuclear testing programs. North Korea's becoming a severe atomic risk and a unique intercontinental challenge when it comes to Donald Trump. The president pledged to keep North Korea from having the ability to strike America with one of their nuclear rockets. Foreign policy specialists say Kim Jong-Un could have nuclear weapons ready for war in the city of Pyongyang by 2020.

This macro trend is alive and well in travel. Larger travel companies use these models to capitalize on new ideas, markets and technologies that startups pursue. These investments are intended not only to keep close to potential threats to an established business model. There is also a very clear incentive for these companies to be active participants in the industry’s future. Without a stake in potentially disruptive technologies, industry players are either forced to innovate on their own – or face an even-more uncertain future defined exclusively by others. Clearly a commitment to travel startups has become de rigeur in travel. Here’s a detailed look at the ecosystem as it stands today. The GDS: Amadeus and Travelport In May 2015, Amadeus jumped into bed with incubator program Travel Startups to launch Amadeus for Startups. Given that many startups seem to be unfamiliar with the extraordinary complexities of travel, the initiative is primarily focused on education. In announcing the efforts, Amadeus North America’s vice president of online travel said that the effort will align “the technology, investment and academic communities to offer new travel companies a simplified, affordable consulting partnership.” The company is mum in specifics, but claims to have nurtured “dozens of online startup travel and search companies, as well as developers and travel content providers.” Beyond startups, the company also has Amadeus Ventures, which focuses on strategic co-investments in late-stage travel startups. Investments here include Bluesmart, BookingPal, Eva, Yapta, Flyr, and Betterez, as well as successful exits from Cabify (stake sold during subsequent investment rounds) and Olset (purchased by Deem for an undisclosed amount). The investments have slowed somewhat over the past year. Travelport Labs is another approach from the GDS segment. The format of this program is more TechStars-style, with two classes per year and accept up to six teams per class. The Labs program has graduated two classes, with a total of nine graduates so far. Startups accepted into the program will receive a four-month crash course into the world of Travelport, based at the company’s Denver offices. According to the company’s terms, Travelport invests $30,000 in up to ten companies each year, in return for an 8% equity stake. Helping founders and seeing startups learn fast is our jam. https://t.co/MXc9rnRP0i #accelerator #traveltech @raymondcollins3 @wolorewards pic.twitter.com/ZfXZREVGzA — Travelport Labs (@TravelportLabs) April 10, 2017 It makes sense for the primary inventory platforms in travel to get involved at the earlier stages of startups. As early companies make decisions on where to source inventory, the larger entity enjoys a deeper integration with its distribution system. Not to mention the energy and potential future hires that come out of the startup ecosystem. The agencies: Booking.com, Flight Centre and Carlson Wagonlit Booking.com recently announced its first set of startups for its Booster program. Ten businesses will experience a three-week sprint, culminating in a chance to compete for grants of up to 500,000 Euros. These are grants, rather than investments, which makes the program especially unique. The global scope of both the company and the OTA sector has led to a cohort from across the word. Flight Centre looked to its founding story for its incubator, which is named after the first bus: Little Argas. The slogan is to “become a market leader and go global,” which the travel agency promises to offer its chosen startups. The objective is familiar: “Our goal is to work with our partners to nurture new business ideas and fast track travel start-up companies incorporating areas of our DNA. We want to be the destination of choice for a wide range of travel and technology start-ups.” The company partners with current travel startup incubators to help screen, incubate and accelerate startups, which are then plugged into the relevant parts of the group’s experts. The company is actively seeking diversification outside of its core business across a long-term, twenty year horizon. There’s no set amount for the fund, but the company will invest up to $50,000 for 7.5 percent equity. For later stage companies, there’s up to $300,000 for growth and up to $2 million for scaling up. Little Argas made its first investment recently take a stake in an artificial intelligence tools for business travel. While Carlson Wagonlit Travel doesn’t have a standalone incubation process, it has tested the waters as a partner to other organizations supporting travel startups. In 2015, Carlson Wagonlit Travel joined the Paris travel incubator Welcome City Lab as a founding member. A year later the company also inked a partnership with incubator Plug and Play to provide mentorship and support to travel and hospitality related startups. The hotels: Marriott and AccorHotels Hotels are not as active in this space, as there are fewer obvious benefits. There are certainly new technologies that might benefit hotels but there’s not always a clear way to integrate this kind of program into the structure of the hotel business. One exception to this is Marriott. The massive global brand claims to have launched the first hotel innovation program. Called TestBed, the ambitious effort offered startups access to a real-world hotel to test their products. This offered a completely fresh way for a startup to go from product to development, and then use an operational hotel to pilot the technology. There were 150 startups up for consideration, and the two finalists were Dazzle (a voice activated assistant) and Jambo (a location-based professional platform). Another exception is AccorHotels, which captured global headlines with its acquisition of onefinestay for nearly €150 million. This was a capstone purchase, as the brand had several previous investments in accommodation-related startups. The company has also been actively pursuing new strategies, including an investment in digital distribution to move beyond simply its own hotels. Accor has also employed a more internal model for incubating new concepts in hospitality. Outside a hackathon in Russia, the company has focused resources on pushing its internal teams to think like startups, listen to customers, and disrupt its own core business. The result is its new Jo&Joe concept, which will ramp up to 50 units by 2020. By employing the same techniques that startups use, the company hopes to evolve its own business alongside its external investments and acquisitions. The airlines: JetBlue, British Airways, EasyJet and El Al JetBlue has been one of the most active investors in emerging travel and transportation companies. Its venture arm, JetBlue Technology Ventures, invested in a startup called Zunum Aero alongside Boeing. JTV president Bonny Simi explained why the airline made the investment: “We believe that electric propulsion will disrupt the regional airline industry. By investing now, we will literally have a seat at the table to see how this technology evolves.” As a guiding focus, JTV “invest in, incubates and partner with early-stage startups at the intersection of technology, travel and hospitality. JTV has also formed a partnership with Israeli airline El Al on a project called Navigator. The partnership stems from El Al’s own innovation initiative, a centre based in Tel Aviv called Cockpit. Navigator is a four-month accelerator program for startups focused on aviation. According to a joint press release, the program includes access to “strategic partners, initial funding and ongoing close guidance.” Chosen companies will spend three months being mentored in Tel Aviv, followed by one month in Silicon Valley. British Airways is one of the most active legacy airlines in this space, originally launching its UnGrounded Innovation Lab in the Sky back in 2013. More recently, its parent company IAG created a standalone accelerator called Hangar 51. The initial pilot was successful, and the program was repeated again last year. Out of 450 applications, twenty-six startups were selected and four moved on to a ten-week mentorship program with executives. IAG recently announced its investment in two startups as part of the Hangar 51 initiative. The manufacturers: Boeing and Airbus Boeing recently made headlines with its investment in Zunum. The startup is in the early stages of manufacturing an electric-powered regional jet that could make short-haul flying far more economical. The jet is expected to take off starting in 2020. As far as range, the planes can fly up to 700 miles in the earliest configurations. And the planes are small. With only ten to fifty seats, airlines would be able to operate the jets on routes without enough demand for larger regional aircraft.This makes them viable for plugging gaps in regional travel ecosystems. The investment is one of the first for Boeing’s investment arm, HorizonX. Principal Steve Nordlund explains the fund’s goals: “Our charter is to look beyond the horizon. We’re looking at traditional, non-traditional partnerships that help us accelerate innovation and market opportunities.” As far as why he chose to invest in Zunum, Nordlund says: “We want to be close to them to see, number one, if we can be helpful in their success as one of their investors. As well as the innovation that we think they can bring forward.” The company also invested an undisclosed amount in Upskill, a company that provides Google Glass-style technology for assembly workers. Airbus is certainly not out of the race. In 2015, the French firm landed in Silicon Valley with a centre capitalized by a $150 million fund. The A³ group is tasked with building “the future of flight now, by disrupting Airbus Group and its competitors before someone else does”. Cargo and logistics have also seen some interest from airlines, with Lufthansa Cargo participating as an inaugural partner for the Rocketspace Tech Accelerator.

There is more money entering the travel tech ecosystem right now than at any other time. I was at a travel tech conference today in San Francisco and I sent a startup founder to read this post. Funny thing is that we were working on writing up something similar but TNOOZ beat us to the punch. When we launched Travel Startups Incubator in late 2014 there was literally no one funding startups, today there are at least 20 investors dedicated to investing in startups in travel tech at the pre-seed/seed stage many of which you listed here. Kudos to the corporate travel venture arms for stepping in to fund startups in one of the biggest industries in the world. Reply 1 week ago   Mahtab Beheshti Thank you for pointing out this article Matt. The startup you told about is mine: tndnature.com. I’ll be looking at these incubators closely. Reply 10 hrs ago   Russell Winter In my experience, when corporations start venture capital divisions it is the sign of the start of a “bubble.” I liken it to when one’s neighbours start investment clubs. As word spreads, more jump in, scared to miss the boat, and then reality sets in with a crash. I laud innovation, but frankly a lot of companies that corporations are investing in at the moment are marginal at best in my opinion.

Matthew A. Foster/Released) In slides presented to the Army Aviation Association of America's annual summit, attendees got a peek at some of the Block II modifications coming to the CH-47F Chinook heavy lift helicopter. The slides were presented by Brigadier General Thomas Todd, the Program Executive Officer for Army Aviation.  In them, modifications previously known, like new rotor blades and a strengthened airframe were laid out. But other upgrades, like fuel tank modifications, an improved drive train and redesigned flight controls were also revealed. In an April 12 interview, Brigadier General Todd said that the Block II was "specifically designed to return [a] commander's payload to him on the battlefield." On that same day, Brig. Gen. Todd also revealed that the Chinook Block II had passed "Milestone B" in the acquisition process, enabling it to enter the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) phase. It is now a formal program of record. Initial production (or Milestone C) is expected in 2021.  In the slides, Brig. Gen. Todd lays out the following modifications as proposals for the Block II. Electrical systems modification to improve emergency power ARC-321 communications system integration  Fuel system modifications, such as improved information, externally replaceable pumps, composite pods and a new single tank Advanced rotor blades from composite material Drive train upgrades, such as transmission improvements and upgraded rotor shafts Common Avionics Architecture System upgrades Flight control upgrades such as redesigned trim actuators, and a Digital Advanced Flight Control System update Airframe improvements, including a strengthened aft section, pylon and nose section.  When the Chinook Block II entered the EMD phase, Boeing, the aircraft's prime contractor released the following statement, saying "today’s heavy-lift helicopters must handle heavier equipment at higher altitudes and warmer temperatures. We’re working closely with the U.S. Army to design and manufacture upgrades to the Chinook focused on increasing payload, providing commonality across the fleet and creating a foundation for affordable future upgrades. Block II will pave the way for the Chinook to remain operational to support our customer’s needs through 2060."  Once the Block II enters service, older Block I Ch-47F's are expected to be upgraded to the Block II standard. It will provide increased payload, and begin the process of moving to a new engine, known as the Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE).  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily!

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next WATKINS, Colo. -- After an approximately five-year effort, Spaceport Colorado may finally be taking off. An official tells Denver7 the spaceport hopes to get a license from the federal government by the end of the year. Located at Front Range Airport in Watkins, the spaceport would be a place for spacecraft to take off and land.   Currently there are 11 approved sites by the federal government in the U.S. So far, $860,000 has been spent to get a license.  Denver International Airport, the city of Aurora, Adams County, and the Federal Aviation Administration are among those contributing to the funding. The operation could create jobs from a $300 billion industry. Colorado already has a strong space presence from giants like Boeing and Sierra Nevada. “If everything went great for a company like Virgin Galactic, you could see them with a commercial license within the new couple of years, and a couple of years after that, being able to actually operate at a place like Spaceport Colorado,” said director David Ruppel. Such a development is exciting to longtime aviators. “As hokey as it may be, kind of that final frontier, right?” said Brian Eaton, the chief pilot at Front Range Flight School. Enjoy this content?

(Source: CBS 5 News) F-16 Fighting Falcons covered in sealing paint sit in a field along Miami St. at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz., on Thursday, May 21, 2015. (Source: Matt York, AP) The 'Boneyard' at Davis Monthan Air Force Base (Source: Davis-Monthan Air Force base) TUCSON, AZ (CBS5) - The perfectly symmetrical lines of planes stretch out for at least a half mile in all directions. Welcome to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, also known as the "Boneyard" at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. It's home to 4,000 mothballed military aircraft. Fifteen hundred of them are capable of being called back into flight-ready condition if need be. "As the nation's wars rise and fall, we have to have somewhere to either send aircraft out to when they need them, or store them when they don't need as many. This is where all that happens," said Tim Gray, who is the director of AMARG. One of the newest missions for the technicians who work here involves the F-16 Fighting Falcons. They are the front-line fighters of the Air Force, but they were first brought into service in the mid-1970s. They are an aging fleet. Four hundred of them are stored at AMARG, but the Pentagon has ordered Gray to restore 210 F-16s to flying condition. "You can imagine, they've been in storage for 10 to 15 years and it's quite a task to get them out and inspect them and try to get them flying in 84 days," said Gray. The mission will take eight to 10 years to complete. "Many will have some maintenance problems that we will have to get past," said Leroy Sykes, who is the director of the 576th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Squadron. Sykes worked on many of these very planes when he was in the military, and as a civilian employee afterward. So the new mission is bittersweet for him. This is the first step in turning these Fighting Falcons into flying targets. They are set to become drones, to be used to help train new pilots in the fighters that will replace the F-16. "It does get emotional for me. But the end mission is the most important thing and the purpose they will serve for our national defense," said Sykes. From here, the jets will head to Florida, where technicians from Boeing will add the drone packages, which will allow pilots to fly the jets remotely. They will still get about 300 hours more of piloted flight. But once their manned missions are over, they will fly over the ocean somewhere, and become targets for new F-22 or F-35 pilots. RELATED: Luke Air Force Base F-35s drop first weapons (March 16, 2016) "In some ways, it's sad to think they're going to fly and then be shot down. But the thing that's rewarding is to think that they can either go out and have parts picked off of them until they're out in a shredder, or literally go out in a blaze of glory and their last mission could be to train pilots to take on our foreign adversaries," said Gray. But there is one more potential future mission for these jets, and it has an even more heroic ring to it. The Department of Defense is pursuing technology that would allow drones to accompany F-35s into combat. The jet that has been mentioned the most for that mission is the F-16. It's called the Loyal Wingman Initiative, and it could send F-16 drones into combat with the latest generation of piloted fighter jets within just a couple of years.

The QF-4 is the Vietnam-era fighter jet, converted into a remote controlled drone, that Air Force pilots have been using as moving targets for decades. The final QF-4 is set to be retired on December 21, clearing the way for the next generation of drone fighter. "In some ways it's sad to think they're going to fly and be shot down," said Tim Gray, who is the director of the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, located on David Monthan Air Force Base. Gray is referring to the F-16s his maintenance engineers are restoring for flight. It takes roughly three months from mothballs to flightworthiness. From here, they'll head to Florida with a pilot on board. There, the final drone package will be installed at a Boeing facility. The QF-16s, as the drone versions are called, are already flying, but will become live targets in February. Air Force officials say they will provide critical training for F-35 pilots, as the new generation of fighter jets take to the skies. At first, the F-35 pilots will simply shoot dummy missiles at the QF-16s. But once these hi-tech drones reach a certain number of flying hours, the F-35 pilots will fire real missiles and destroy the planes, according to Air Force officials. "It's the most realistic combat training a pilot can get, short of actual combat. They will actually get to go up and shoot a missile off the rail and actually blow the F-16 out of the air," said Gray. Copyright 2016 KPHO (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation). All rights reserved.

U.S. President Donald Trump's threats against Canada have helped send the loonie lower and hampered TSX performance.  (MANDEL NGAN / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Michael Lewis Business Reporter Tues., May 2, 2017 While the fate of an expanding roster of U.S./Canada commercial disputes remains uncertain, Donald Trump’s broadside attack on the trading practices of his northern neighbour is already taking a toll. “The rhetoric/bullying are having a real impact on financial markets,” BMO chief economist Doug Porter said in a report. The president’s triple threats to softwood lumber, the dairy industry and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), he said, helped send the loonie 2 per cent lower to its weakest level in more than a year over the past two weeks — at a time when the currency is normally at a seasonal peak. A decline in global crude prices and a liquidity crisis at alternative mortgage lender Home Capital Group contributed to the dollar’s drop, but Porter said Trump’s “cavalier” treatment of Canada has played a part. And questions about whether the U.S. will remain in NAFTA following presidential tweets threatening to terminate the deal have also hit the country’s main stock index which has struggled to find a footing amid the uncertainty and charged rhetoric. Article Continued Below As well, experts say a claim by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that Canada is “dumping lumber” and “subsidizing mills” — an assertion the prime minister refuted as baseless — amounts to a shot across the bow at Canada and its image as a fair trader and safe haven for global investment. “Words matter. Words matter diplomatically. Words matter with leaders. And I think the words that have been used have been unfortunate, and have not been constructive,” said Bruce Heyman, former U.S. ambassador to Canada, during a discussion at a recent forum organized by the binational Council of the Great Lakes Region. Trump in tweets and speeches has levelled accusations over trade practices that could be the subject of constructive negotiations, said Alan Wolff, senior international trade group counsel at multinational law firm Dentons and a former senior trade negotiator in both Republican and Democratic administrations. Concerns, for example, that Canada’s move to lower prices on ingredients for domestic dairy suppliers constitutes an unfair export barrier are evidently shared by the European Union, which on Monday joined the U.S. in targeting the practice. Montreal’s Bombardier, moreover, faces a lengthy legal battle and the prospect of preliminary duties after U.S. aerospace giant Boeing petitioned Washington for an investigation into CSeries jets’ subsidies and pricing, news that sent Bombardier shares 4 per cent lower in late April. But while lumber, dairy and aerospace disputes are not new, Wolff said Trump’s public excoriation of Ottawa is extraordinary. He also said the tone could add fire to future disputes, particularly if Trump slaps a “buy American” provision on a planned $1-trillion (U.S.) infrastructure program, and if the U.S. fails to abide by rulings on lumber and other files.

Liberal Leader Christy Clark’s proposed ban on U.S. thermal coal from the province’s ports as a retaliation for lumber duties – along with Canada’s patent and IP protections as possible targets for subsequent U.S. actions — and the elements appear in place for escalating, tit-for-tat trade disputes between the North American allies. “When things start to deteriorate, people start scrambling and if this is an every-man-for-themselves kind of a world, then it’s going to be difficult for Canada to navigate these particular waters,” Dan Ciuriak, a consultant and former deputy chief economist at Foreign Affairs and International Trade said at the Great Lakes event. Putting Trump’s bombast aside, however, Wolff said a public renegotiation of NAFTA could be positive for all parties. “Chances are that the negotiations will be long and very detailed. A once in a generation trade negotiation is an opportunity to address the full range of remaining barriers and trade and investment concerns that each of our two countries has with the other. “The U.S. Canadian relationship is strong and positive,” Wolff added. “There is always room for improvement, and the results can be very good for the economies of both countries.” Canadian American Business Council CEO Maryscott Greenwood agreed that now is a good time to update NAFTA, which came into effect in 1994 to create a trade block encompassing Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. She noted that neither dairy nor lumber are covered by the agreement, suggesting that the fact that the protected sectors are the subject of bilateral disputes is not evidence that NAFTA is failing. “We believe that trade and open markets are the cornerstone of the prosperous economy that Canada and the U.S. enjoy,” she said, adding that Trumps’ fiery rhetoric is butting up against “the reality of two very integrated economies.” Read more about: Donald Trump Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

IndustriALL represents 50 million workers in 140 countries. Martinez was elected to serve on the global union federation’s executive committee at last summer’s IndustriALL World Congress. Martinez spoke against NAFTA and the current global trade policy that rewards corporate bad behavior at the expense of working people. “Trade policy in North America is written by corporations and for corporations,” said Martinez. “Trade agreements have been used by company after company to flee union contracts in the U.S. and Canada to countries where basic human rights do not exist.” He told his fellow executive committee members that companies like Boeing are moving work that belonged in North America to countries like China, where fundamental human rights do not exist. Martinez called for IndustriALL to urge all nations to include International Labor Organization Conventions on the right to form a union and engage in collective bargaining in all future trade agreements. He also urged all unions to oppose the investor-to-state dispute mechanism that gives corporations the power to stop governments from regulating them. “We believe in the global labor movement,” said Martinez. “We know that together, in unity and strength, we can build a better, fairer trade model based on justice, not corporate profit.” RELATED ARTICLES Martinez Calls for International Solidarity at IndustriALL Global Union Meeting Read more Honor and Resolve on Workers’ Memorial Day Read more Supporting Astronaut Life on Earth Read more MOST POPULAR NEWS / ARTICLES Boeing Workers in South Carolina Opt Against Union Representation Read more President Trump Should Urge Boeing to Bring Jobs Home, Says Machinists Union President Read more More Than 800 Workers to Join IAM in Seattle Read more MOST RECENT NEWS / ARTICLES Martinez Calls for International Solidarity at IndustriALL Global Union Meeting Read more Honor and Resolve on Workers’ Memorial Day Read more Supporting Astronaut Life on Earth Read more Get IAM MOBILE 4.0 IAM Mobile 4.0 offers more features and functions to read and share information about our union and the important issues we face as working families.

Brandon Nicely and his family look at a menu in a downtown Pápa, Hungary restaurant March 25. Nicely and his family are assigned to the HAW and have been in Hungary for two years. The Strategic Airlift Capability program, a multinational mission, is comprised of 12 countries operating out of Pápa Air Base. The international unit is called the Heavy Airlift Wing, and is the first non-NATO unit of its kind. (U.S. Air Force Photo/Master Sgt. Brian Ferguson)  see less | View Image Page PAPA, HUNGARY 05.02.2017 Story by Bennie J. Davis  Airman Magazine    ✔ ✗ Subscribe 13 Master Sgt. Brandon Nicely has a unique drive to work. Each morning, driving through the gates of the Hungarian Defense Forces Pápa Air Base, Hungary, he takes a trip back in time. Aging Soviet trucks sit behind faded, mangled fences and fighter aircraft and radar sites, reminders of the Cold War, fill the base’s heritage park. “You can feel the history. I literally drive down an old taxiway previously used by MiG fighters and pull up to a new multi-million dollar complex for work,” Nicely said. “Pápa AB is an interesting contrast of the latest in technology and innovation surrounded by a Word War II feel and terrain.” Nicely’s drive isn’t the only unique part of his day, though. So is his job. He’s the superintendent of wing administration for the Heavy Airlift Wing (HAW), which is part of the Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) program – a multinational mission in Hungary that is the first non-NATO unit of its kind – that uses C-17 Globemaster IIIs to take cargo and equipment in support of military efforts throughout Europe and the Middle East. His team of three helps to manage 146 personnel and advise commanders and national representatives of personnel issues, while managing a $26.4 million manning budget. The HAW is the operational organization of the SAC, an agreed 30-year consortium comprised of 12 partner nations — the U.S., Norway, Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden and Hungary — who combined money and resources to purchase three C-17s and then fly, maintain and schedule the aircraft as a team. SAC nations have access to 3,165 annual C-17 flight hours produced by the HAW. How many hours each nation flies is determined by the amount of money they contributed to the program. However, since Hungary is the host nation, each C-17 is registered and flagged there and bears the tail insignia of the SAC home base, HDF Papa Air Base. “There may be one name on the tail, but it represents a mix of nations and shared sense of pride for everyone at the HAW,” Nicely said. This pride is translating into numbers, too. As of 2016, the SAC C-17 fleet has flown over 18,000 hours, over 1,400 missions, delivered over 120 million pounds of cargo and carried over 76,000 passengers since 2009. Being a football fan, Nicely likens the partnership to a professional sports all-star game. “All these different militaries coming together, each nation in different uniforms, working as one team. It’s a really interesting dynamic,” Nicely said. “Each military isn’t here for their own purpose, they are here for the Heavy Airlift Wing mission and they all work as one.” For Nicely, learning the cultures and customs of his teammates is one of the most rewarding parts of the job. He’s had supervisors from Norway and Sweden and coworkers from the Netherlands and Finland. However, everyone in the HAW speaks English; if they all wore the same uniform it would be hard to tell the unit was a multinational one. The HAW consists of the command staff and three squadrons – Command and Control, Heavy Airlift and Logistical Support. The Command and Control Squadron receives operational requirements from the SAC and transforms them into mission tasks. The Heavy Airlift Squadron is the first and only multinational C-17 operations squadron. Flight crews are trained and capable of performing the entire spectrum of air-land and airdrop missions. Each mission strengthens partner-nation co-operation as every crew is a mix of personnel from the participating air forces. “Pilots assigned to the HAS, not including the U.S. Air Force, are generally stationed here for four years and when they leave here they are experienced aircraft commanders,” said Royal Netherlands Air Force Lt. Col. Peer Geelen, the HAW commander. This is accomplished through an intense training program at the HAW and includes a flight training course and simulator time at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. The Logistics Support Squadron supports the loading and unloading of personnel and cargo through the aerial port, maintains the safety of aircrew flight equipment for life support and manages the maintenance supply chain with the Boeing Company, which performs nearly all maintenance on the C-17s. “All three squadrons are located in one building. It reminds me of the interaction and the camaraderie of large Air Force squadrons,” Nicely said. “We work together, play together and we have a lot of fun getting the mission done.” The HAW is housed in the SAC hangar complex, a nearly $40 million state-of-the-art facility completed in 2016. It’s the only dedicated C-17 hangar in Europe and it provides a permanent infrastructure for the HAW and the SAC. For the nearly 50 Airmen stationed at Papa, their living arrangements are as unique as their jobs. Airmen are allowed to take their families with them if they desire, but there is no base support — no on-base housing, no commissary, no base exchange, not even an on base gas station. Airmen and their families are totally dependent on the local economy. Captain LeRoi Edwards and his wife, Casey, didn’t know what to expect when receiving orders to Pápa AB. After “Googling” the air base and town, they learned they would be joining the small population of nearly 32,000. Edwards, the air movements officer and officer in charge of the Aerial Port Squadron, requested a tour in Europe after a short-tour assignment in Korea kept him and his wife apart for a year. “When you turn off the highway you quickly learn this is small town, Hungary,” Edwards said. “You are surrounded by farmland, but the town is pleasantly adequate with amenities. It’s definitely a different way of life.” Casey said after quitting her job and leaving the San Francisco area, the biggest challenge was adjusting to a new pace of life “It’s all about slow meals, slow eating, talking slow and nobody is in a rush,” Casey said. “For me it was a hard switch to stop rushing myself and adjusting to more European lifestyle.” This small-town atmosphere produces a strong sense of community between the Airmen and families stationed at Papa. “It’s nice to have such a welcoming community as my first base as a spouse. Everyone here is inclined to help each other,” Casey said. “When my husband hurt his back my friends were ready to help us out with meals and supplies and anything we needed.” Travel is another perk and being centrally located in heart of Europe has allowed Edwards to see friends stationed around U.S. Air Forces Europe and take weekend trips to Romania, Slovakia, Austria and Croatia. Edwards loves the job and the people he gets to work with at the HAW, too. When asked why the Air Force, with it’s own fleet of C-17s, would commit so heavily to a mission with only three aircraft, he says the answer is simple. “First, the Air Force’s main priority is its people and the personnel assigned to the HAW will never have an opportunity like this anywhere else in the world,” he said. “Refining our leadership capabilities with our 11 partner nations is an experience that is invaluable to everyone here.” He adds, that while these C-17s belong to the U.S. Air Force, they are not assigned to combatant commanders and can be called upon to provide quick relief on a multitude of missions. Edwards also points out that while the Air Force participates in a lot of multinational exercises each year, learning from and working alongside partner nations at Pápa AB is no exercise – it’s life. “The problems we have to solve together here each day are not Band-Aids for a two week exercise, they are bridges to groundwork for the future of our nations,” Edwards said. “Unlike multinational exercises where there are U.S. objectives, at the HAW there are only wing goals and opportunities.” After work, Nicely and his family stroll through the town center of Pápa. The Baroque architecture and towering dual clock steeples of the Saint Stephens Church provide a picturesque backdrop as the sun sets behind them. “It took some time, but I did come to appreciate living here in Pápa,” Nicely said. “I’m going to miss it, but most of all, I’ll miss the people.” He and his family will soon be on their way to their next Air Force adventure, but Nicely hopes opportunities like this one won’t just be a thing of the past.

Privately-owned Liberty House is one of the largest steel and engineering employers in the UK with over 4,500 workers."We are casting a big vote of confidence in the future of British industry," Liberty House Executive Chairman Sanjeev Gupta said. "With the right business model and an innovative approach, the UK steel and engineering sectors can recover and thrive. The government is now pursuing a new post-Brexit industrial strategy and steel must be at the heart of that strategy," he added.For every new steel job, around three or four jobs are created in related sectors. Liberty House's speciality steels unit includes five sites across north England and the west Midlands, and is one of the world's biggest suppliers to the aerospace industry, with customers like Rolls-Royce, Boeing and Airbus.The group, which is considering a partial public listing in London by 2018, said it would explore further downstream investment in engineering firms that use speciality steels in a move that should boost UK manufacturing. Tata Steel, the UK biggest steelmaker with some 8,500 employees, sold its speciality business to Liberty House as part of a drive to restructure its business. It is currently in talks to merge its UK and European steel assets with those of Germany's Thyssenkrupp.($1 = 0.7758 pounds) (Reporting by Maytaal Angel; editing by Susan Thomas) This story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed. #Reuters Published Date: May 02, 2017 10:15 pm | Updated Date: May 02, 2017 10:15 pm Also See U.S. scientists to protest Trump policies at Earth Day rally in Washington | Reuters Thousands turn out for March for Science in U.S. cities | Reuters Hull, Swansea win to lift survival hopes, Boro sink deeper | Reuters March for Science draws big crowds, clever signs across U.S. | Reuters × T20 LEAGUE SCHEDULE Match Date Details 1 May 3 KKR Vs RPS 2 May 4 DD Vs GL 3 May 5 RCB Vs KXIP 4 May 6 SRH Vs RPS 5 May 6 DD Vs MI Full Schedule Top Stories Aadhaar mandatory: Citizens don't have absolute right on their body, privacy argument bogus, govt tells SC Aam Aadmi Party Live: Amid Infighting, PAC Meet Begins at Kejriwal's Residence IPL 2017: Changes in Delhi Daredevils' batting order helps them register a win, finally Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin discuss Syria in effort to de-escalate tensions in war-torn country Market looks overvalued and it’s nearly May: Should we sell and go away?

U.S. President Donald Trump singled Canada out by name last month as he put dairy farmers north of the border on notice that they are in America's fair-trade sights.  (Susan Walsh / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS File Photo)   By Josh WingroveBloomberg Tues., May 2, 2017 OTTAWA—Canada’s export bank is doubling its growth forecast this year, a sign it doesn’t expect U.S. President Donald Trump to upend globalization of trade. Export Development Canada (EDC), in its spring 2017 report Tuesday, forecast the total value of Canadian goods and service exports to rise 6 per cent in 2017 and 5 per cent in 2018, buoyed by energy and aerospace. Shipments of metals and ores are also expected to rise significantly. The federal corporation’s previous report, released last fall, forecast 3 per cent export growth for the current year. The report titled “Globalization at the Brink?” is a nod to the headwinds Canada faces from Trump, amid looming renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and disputes over lumber and dairy rules. However, it concludes strength from the U.S., Europe and in developing markets creates an opening for exporters willing to shrug off the Trump factor. Read more: Canada delivers third-straight monthly trade surplus Article Continued Below Lumber may only be the beginning of Trump’s trade tiffs with Canada What Donald Trump’s anti-Canada rant means: Walkom “The opportunity for our companies is to stay around the table while everyone else is running scared,” Peter Hall, EDC vice-president and chief economist, said in an interview. In the U.S., positive signs include key demographic groups re-entering the labour force as industrial capacity tightens, while growth is catching on, too, in Europe. “We’re not going to counsel Canadian firms to do crazy things, but we’ve had no reason to really depart from the story we’ve been telling,” Hall said. “We are a financial institution saying, ‘look, there are opportunities here.’” EDC also forecasts Canadian gross domestic product to grow 2.4 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2018, above the developed-markets average but trailing U.S. growth in that period. Canada’s expected export growth in 2017 will be driven largely by an 18-per-cent increase in the value of energy exports, in part due to a return to normal volumes after wildfires near Alberta’s oilsands last year, the report said. The 2018 increase is due in large part to aerospace — namely, Bombardier Inc.’s C Series airplane, Hall said. The program has received cash injections from both the Quebec and Canadian governments and is now the subject of an anti-dumping allegation from Boeing Co. Total global GDP is forecast to grow at 3.5 per cent in 2017 and 3.8 per cent in 2018 — strong figures at odds with protectionist political sentiment. GDP growth in emerging markets is projected to reach 5 per cent in 2018, led by India at 7.6 per cent, EDC said. “Ultimately, the dissenting votes are about making the economy great again — and that’s now happening, all on its own,” Hall wrote in the report. Economic data shows growth, jobs and continued expansion are already coming down the pipe despite threats to globalization and trade, the report said. “But if that risk is ultimately unlikely, this could be one of the greatest moments of opportunity in the new millennium.” Read more about: Donald Trump Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

requests $1.46bn sale of P-8A Poseidon aircraft from US The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has notified Congress of a potential $1.46bn foreign military sale of P-8A aircraft to New Zealand. New Zealand seeks to receive up to four P-8A patrol aircraft and associated support. Each aircraft will include commercial engines, tactical open mission software, electro-optical and infrared MX-20HD, AN/AAQ-2(V)1 acoustic system, AN/APY-10 radar, and ALQ-240 electronic support measures. The sale also covers eight multifunctional information distribution system joint tactical radio systems, five Guardian laser transmitter assemblies for the AN/AAQ-24(V)N, five system processors for AN/AAQ-24(V)N, and 30 AN/AAR-54 missile warning sensors for the AN/AAQ-24(V)N. In addition, the sale covers ten LN-251 embedded global positioning systems/inertial navigations systems (EGIs). New Zealand also requested support equipment, operation support systems, maintenance trainer/classrooms, publications, and software, engineering and logistics technical assistance. Alongside this, the country has applied for foreign liaison officer support, contractor engineering technical services, repair and return, transportation and other associated training, support equipment and services. The procurement of these defence articles and services will contribute to New Zealand's maritime surveillance aircraft (MSA) capability, following the retirement of its P-3K maritime patrol aircraft. "Boeing will serve as prime contractor for the sale, strengthening collective defence and enhancing New Zealand’s regional and global allied contributions." Boeing will serve as prime contractor for the sale, strengthening collective defence and enhancing New Zealand’s regional and global allied contributions. New Zealand has procured and operated US-made P-3 MSA for more than 40 years, providing critical capabilities to Nato and coalition maritime operations. The Boeing-built P-8A Poseidon aircraft has been designed for long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The aircraft can also be used for broad-area maritime and littoral operations and is powered by two CFM56-7 engines.

- Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 02 May, 2017, 08:00 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Middle East Homeland Security Market, 2015" report to their offering. The Middle Eastern Homeland Security market will grow at a CAGR of 15.5% to achieve $17.05 billion by 2021, strongly driven by government initiatives to create a smart and secure environment amidst high terrorist activities in the region. The Middle Eastern Homeland Security market registered a revenue of $7.19 billion in 2015. This report defines the Middle Eastern Homeland Security market as comprising three market segments: Monitoring and Surveillance Systems, Restricted Entry Systems and Perimeter Security Solutions. Each segment has unique trends which are expected to drive the market in the identified verticals: Government, O&G and Transportation. This report focuses on the way these segments will grow by 2021, and the opportunities that are available for the companies participating in this space. Despite cuts in military budgets and spending, the governments' focus towards procuring smart and intelligent security solutions to preserve internal security has remained undeterred. Clearly laid out regulations help companies identify the needs of a particular vertical, but the challenge is to provide appealing value additions while keeping the cost factor in mind. In country-wise analysis, Saudi Arabia will have largest market share of 45.9% of the total market. Factors such as being host to several major events such as Dubai Expo 2020 and Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 provide lucrative opportunities which can be utilized effectively with a sound strategic plan. Market revenue in this report was derived from discussions with industry participants, review of company annual reports, secondary sources and information gathered from in-house database. The base year for the analysis is 2015, and the forecast period is 2016 to 2021. Revenue is provided in US dollars. Key Questions This Study Will Answer: - What is the state of the planned investments on Internal Security? - What are the growing trends in the Middle Eastern Homeland Security Market? - What are the trends and growth pattern of identified segments: Monitoring and Surveillance Systems, Restricted Entry Systems and Perimeter Security Solutions? - What opportunities does the market hold for Tier II and Tier III players? - What are the strategies that companies can make use of to exploit the opportunity at hand?

Export Development Canada, in its spring 2017 report Tuesday, forecast the total value of Canadian goods and service exports to rise 6 percent in 2017 and 5 percent in 2018, buoyed by energy and aerospace. Shipments of metals and ores are also expected to rise significantly. The federal corporation’s previous report, released last fall, forecast 3 percent export growth for the current year. The report titled “Globalization at the Brink?” is a nod to the headwinds Canada faces from Trump, amid looming renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and disputes over lumber and dairy rules. However, it concludes strength from the U.S., Europe and in developing markets creates an opening for exporters willing to shrug off the Trump factor. “The opportunity for our companies is to stay around the table while everyone else is running scared,” Peter Hall, EDC vice-president and chief economist, said in an interview. In the U.S., positive signs include key demographic groups re-entering the labor force as industrial capacity tightens, while growth is catching on, too, in Europe. “We’re not going to counsel Canadian firms to do crazy things, but we’ve had no reason to really depart from the story we’ve been telling,” Hall said. “We are a financial institution saying, ‘look, there are opportunities here.’” EDC also forecasts Canadian gross domestic product to grow 2.4 percent this year and 2.2 percent in 2018, above the developed-markets average but trailing U.S. growth in that period. Cash Injections Canada’s expected export growth in 2017 will be driven largely by an 18 percent increase in the value of energy exports, in part due to a return to normal volumes after wildfires near Alberta’s oil sands last year, the report said. The 2018 increase is due in large part to aerospace -- namely, Bombardier Inc.’s C Series airplane, Hall said. The program has received cash injections from both the Quebec and Canadian governments and is now the subject of an anti-dumping allegation from Boeing Co. Total global GDP is forecast to grow at 3.5 percent in 2017 and 3.8 percent in 2018 -- strong figures at odds with protectionist political sentiment. GDP growth in emerging markets is projected to reach 5 percent in 2018, led by India at 7.6 percent, EDC said. “Ultimately, the dissenting votes are about making the economy great again -- and that’s now happening, all on its own,” Hall wrote in the report. Economic data shows growth, jobs and continued expansion are already coming down the pipe -- despite threats to globalization and trade, the report said. “But if that risk is ultimately unlikely, this could be one of the greatest moments of opportunity in the new millennium.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the classified NROL-76 satellite, lifted off at 7.15 a.m. from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, the same pad that supported numerous Apollo and space shuttle launches, the company's live webcast showed. About 10 minutes later, the rocket's first stage landed at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1, just south of the launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Xinhua news agency reported. SpaceX previously landed a first stage booster at Landing Zone 1 three times. It also successfully recovered Falcon 9 first stages from six missions at sea using the company's drone ships. Few details have been released about NROL-76, a satellite designed, built and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office under the Department of Defence. This launch marks the 15-year-old company's first mission for the Pentagon. For years, the market for launching US military payloads was dominated by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. But SpaceX broke the monopoly in 2015, when the US Air Force certified its Falcon 9 rocket to launch national security space missions. Since then, the California-based company has also won two contracts to launch Global Positioning System satellites for the US Air Force.

Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.6 per cent to 19,431.66, helped by a weaker yen, which boosts profits for manufacturers. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 0.9 per cent to 2,224.81. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong edged a fraction of 0.1 per cent lower to 24,606.76 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.3 per cent to 3,144.62. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 fell 0.3 per cent to 5,940.60, while shares were higher in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed similar trends. “The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating,” Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market’s anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 0.2 per cent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 per cent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 per cent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House of Representatives is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 per cent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings,” said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 19 cents to $48.65 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 per cent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 13 cents to $51.39 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 per cent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.99 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0921 from $1.0898.   © Copyright Times Colonist Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

The group, which formally completed its 100 million pound purchase on Tuesday, said it would invest 20 million pounds in the business in the first year, and raise production at its electric arc furnaces to more than 1 million tonnes. The UK steel sector is emerging from a crisis that saw some 5,000 jobs or a fifth of the workforce, axed in 2015/16. Privately-owned Liberty House is one of the largest steel and engineering employers in the UK with over 4,500 workers. “We are casting a big vote of confidence in the future of British industry,” Liberty House Executive Chairman Sanjeev Gupta said. “With the right business model and an innovative approach, the UK steel and engineering sectors can recover and thrive. The government is now pursuing a new post-Brexit industrial strategy and steel must be at the heart of that strategy,” he added. For every new steel job, around three or four jobs are created in related sectors. Liberty House’s speciality steels unit includes five sites across north England and the west Midlands, and is one of the world’s biggest suppliers to the aerospace industry, with customers like Rolls-Royce, Boeing and Airbus. The group, which is considering a partial public listing in London by 2018, said it would explore further downstream investment in engineering firms that use speciality steels in a move that should boost UK manufacturing. Tata Steel, the UK biggest steelmaker with some 8,500 employees, sold its speciality business to Liberty House as part of a drive to restructure its business. It is currently in talks to merge its UK and European steel assets with those of Germany’s Thyssenkrupp. (Reporting by Maytaal Angel; editing by Susan Thomas) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 2 May 2017 | MYT 5:21 PM Singapore Airlines may land unusual net-debt spot as soon as 2018 SINGAPORE: A record plane-buying spree is poised to land Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA) in an unfamiliar territory. South-East Asia’s biggest carrier is expected to turn to a net-debt position as early as 2018 -- for the first time in 13 years -- as the company borrows money and sells bonds to meet capital expenditure needs, analysts say. SIA, which has traditionally limited its debt load, would benefit from raising funds more cheaply through borrowings to improve return ratios and valuations, equity research firms including OCBC Investment Research and Crucial Perspective say. The airline, which has US$53bil of aircraft on order, expanded a medium-term note program by two thirds to US$5bil in April and said it intends to “proactively” take on more debt in future. “I think it’s good for shareholders,” said Desmond Soon, Asia head of investment management at Western Asset Management Co. A company that can borrow cheaply can have higher leverage, leading to an improved return on equity and thus better prospects for stockholders, Singapore-based Soon said. The carrier’s five-year average return on equity -- an indication of how efficient a company is at generating profits -- is below that of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SIA’s net debt may reach about S$660mil (US$472mil) by the end of March 2018, according to a report by Eugene Chua at OCBC Investment Research on Feb. 9. That compares with net cash of about S$3.3bil for the 12 months through March 2016, Bloomberg-compiled data show. A net-debt position occurs when a company’s debt exceeds its cash and equivalents. Shares of the carrier rose 1.1% to S$10.36 as of 9:05 a.m. in Singapore, extending this year’s gains to about 7%. Cathay’s stock has advanced 9.8% in 2017. “Historically there has been lot of criticism SIA's balance sheet is lazy” because of its cash pile, said Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Crucial Perspective, a research firm focused on Asian transport equities. A “more efficient” capital structure will help its return on equity, which has been depressed because of the large cash balance, she said. SIA has the smallest debt-to-equity ratio among 11 major airlines on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index at 10.3%, compared with 126% for Cathay Pacific, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Capital expenditure at SIA will average US$4.3bil annually for the five years through March 2022, based on company figures in an investor presentation in November. The spending will peak in the 12 months beginning April 2018, the year SIA intends to restart the world’s longest nonstop flight using an ultralong-range version of Airbus SE’s A350-900. “Our capital expenditure will be rising as we take advantage of new growth opportunities to better position the SIA Group for the future,” Nick Ionides, a spokesman, said in an email. “These investments will be financed by cash flows generated from operations, as well as by proactively taking on more debt in the coming years.” SIA has 214 planes on order, including 39 long-range aircraft from Boeing Co. with a list price of US$13.8bil. Discounts are customary in the industry for large orders. The Singapore carrier is trading at 3.1 times of enterprise value to trailing 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and rent costs, compared with 8 times for Cathay Pacific, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A lower figure means investors value SIA less than Cathay Pacific. SIA's cost of equity is 6.2%, while its cost of debt is 2.6%, based on the latest available data compiled by Bloomberg. That debt cost is low among Singapore-based corporations, whose average is about 10 percentage points higher, making it “prudent” for SIA to acquire more debt, said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a director at Religare Capital Markets in the city-state. “Debt is cheaper than equity,” Joshua Crabb, head of Asian equities at a unit of Old Mutual Plc, said from Hong Kong. Therefore “optimal gearing structures can add value,” benefiting shareholders, he said. - Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Airlines , Singapore Airlines Related Stories Related Stories SIA may land in unusual net debt position Air France expands Asia links with Singapore Airlines tie-up SIA’s low-cost carrier Scoot spreads wings to Europe SIA extends jet fuel-hedging contracts Singapore Airlines’ budget unit aims for growth via Euro flights You May Be Interested Wall Street closes higher on heavy earnings day; Fed on tap Trading ideas: Ikhmas Jaya, Anzo, Trive Property, Vitrox New Robo advisory is the right way to go Internet abuzz with video of freak storm in Rawang EKA Noodles chairman and group MD resign from the board More young investors entering into Malaysian market Others Also Read Middlesbrough players back Agnew in fight for survival - De Roon High-end iPhone pushes prices up for Apple, even as sales slow Tourism Tax Bill to exclude home and kampung stays Property Related advertisement Latest News BNP Paribas Q1 profit rise powered by trading rebound I-Bhd sure of RM500m revenue by 2018 Cagamas mulls RM11b bond and sukuk this year Tender for KL-Singapore high speed rail asset firm by year end NZ nixes merger of top 2 publishing groups citing concentration of media power Most Viewed in Business EKA Noodles chairman and group MD resign from the board Several banks at 52-week high, ringgit shines More young investors entering into Malaysian market Ringgit extends gains against US$ early Wednesday Sunway gaining investors interests, stable growth across its businesses New Robo advisory is the right way to go Trading volume hits 1b in first hour Wednesday, KLCI climbs Oil price rebounds early Wednesday on US stocks drawdown Apple posts surprise dip in iPhone sales, shares fall Tender for KL-Singapore high speed rail asset firm by year end advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Wednesday, 03 May 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Cartoons Interview First Purchased ATR Planes to Land in Iran in Days News ID: 1395452 Service: Economy May, 02, 2017 - 13:16 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – The first batch of the brand-new turboprops Iran has purchased from ATR aircraft manufacturer will arrive in the country within the next 10 days, Managing Director of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh announced. In an interview with Tasnim, Parvaresh said a second delegation of experts from Iran Air travelled to France on Tuesday to finalize the arrangements for the delivery of the planes purchased from ATR, a joint venture of Airbus and Finmeccanica of Italy. According to the official, Iran is going to take delivery of the first four planes within the next 10 days. Iran Air and ATR spent months negotiating an order for 20 ATR 72-600 aircraft worth $576 million at list prices, with options for another 20. Iran is gradually receiving the passenger planes purchased from Airbus, ATR , and Boeing, following the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a nuclear agreement between Tehran and the Group 5+1 (Russia, China, the US, Britain, France and Germany). Meanwhile, Tehran seeks to take a more active role in the international aviation field. On Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif introduced Parvaresh as the country’s new representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). After the JCPOA took effect in January 2016, Iran accelerated efforts to renovate its aging fleet of passenger planes. During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. Later in June 2016, Iran sealed another deal worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes.

Watch.WATCH What To Read Next {{item.title}} Related Links SpaceX postpones classified US military launch SpaceX wants to recycle more Falcon 9 rockets Elon Musk's SpaceX to send paying tourists around the moonwatch Miami - SpaceX on Monday blasted off a secretive US government satellite, known only as NROL-76, marking the first military launch for the California-based aerospace company headed by billionaire tycoon Elon Musk. The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, soared into the sky atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 07:15 (11:15 GMT). About 10 minutes after launch, the scorched first stage of the rocket came back to Earth and landed upright at Cape Canaveral, marking the fourth successful solid ground landing for SpaceX. "And we have touchdown," a SpaceX commentator said on a live webcast as cheers broke out at mission control. "The first stage has landed back at Landing Zone 1. Another good day for us at SpaceX. A beautiful sight to see." Live video of the launch showed the first and second stages of the rocket separating about two and a half minutes into the flight. The larger portion of the rocket, known as the first stage, made a gentle arc and powered its nitrogen thrusters to guide it back to Earth. After a fiery entry burn, the rocket set itself down steadily in the centre of the 91m circular landing zone. Musk is leading an effort in the rocket industry to re-use costly parts rather than jettison them into the ocean after each launch. SpaceX has already made multiple successful landings - some on land and others on floating ocean platforms, known as drone ships. Secretive payload  The launch was initially planned for Sunday, but was postponed in the last seconds before liftoff due to a sensor issue with the rocket, SpaceX said. The sensor in question was replaced ahead of Monday's attempt. Little was known about the payload, which a SpaceX commentator described only as a "satellite", due to its classified nature. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," an NRO spokesperson told AFP. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force's practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX to was selected to launch NROL-76 "after a competition", said the NRO spokesperson. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. The contract was first announced last year. SpaceX also has a pair of launch contracts coming up for the Air Force to send GPS satellites into orbit. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station, and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year.

(AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi) LONDON (AP) — European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday following a long weekend after Greece reached a deal with creditors that will stave off the country's bankruptcy. Asian shares had struggled earlier following the release of weaker-than-expected China manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.6 percent to 7,247 while the CAC 40 in France added 0.4 percent to 5,290. Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent to 12,466. U.S. shares looked set for a lukewarm start, with Dow and S&P futures both down 0.1 percent. GREECE'S DEAL: Greece and its creditors agreed the country should make another round of pension cuts in 2019 and commit to a budget target when its current bailout program ends next year. The deal will restart bailout loan payments and keep the country from facing default and reigniting a eurozone crisis this summer, officials said Tuesday. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: In other reassuring news, the House of Representatives is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed similar trends. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. ASIA'S DAY: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent to 19,445.70, helped by a weaker yen, which boosts profits for manufacturers. South Korea's Kospi gained 0.7 percent to 2,219.67. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.3 percent to 24,696.13, while the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.71. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.1 percent to 5,950.40, while shares were higher in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 29 cents to $49.13 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 37 to $51.89 a barrel. CURRENCIES: The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.0915 while the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 112.24 yen. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

(Aaron Vincent Elkaim / THE CANADIAN PRESS) Aleksandra Sagan, The Canadian Press Published Tuesday, May 2, 2017 2:15AM EDT Last Updated Tuesday, May 2, 2017 5:05PM EDT Toronto's main stock index moved up on the strength of its health-care sector as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. rose nearly seven per cent. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index advanced 44.02 points to 15,619.65. Valeant (TSX:VRX) was the third best performing stock of the index, rising 6.73 per cent or 89 cents to $14.11 for a second straight day of gains. The day before, the Quebec-based drugmaker's shares jumped 4.51 per cent after it announced it trimmed its hefty debt by an extra US$220 million. Since the first quarter of 2016, Valeant says it has reduced its US$32-billion debt by US$3.6 billion. On Tuesday, CEO Joseph Papa told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting that the gathering marked the first day of a new era for Valeant. He said he remained committed to cutting the company's remaining debt by US$5 billion by next February. The growth from the health-care sector was offset by weakness in the financial and energy sectors. While embattled alternative mortgage lender Home Capital Group Inc. (TSX:HCG) rebounded with a 11.35 per cent or 79 cent jump in shares to $7.75, many other financial institutions -- including some of Canada's biggest banks -- saw their shares slip in worth. Shares in the energy sector were the worst performing, losing on average 0.42 per cent of their worth, as the June crude contract lost $1.18 to US$47.66 per barrel. "I think until that OPEC meeting at the end of the month, we're going to see ebb and flow (in oil prices)," said Colum McKinley, a portfolio manager on the Canadian equities team at CIBC Asset Management. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet in Vienna on May 25 to decide whether or not they will extend their agreement from last November to curb crude production. The loonie continued to move in line with the price of oil, said McKinley. The average value for the Canadian dollar was 72.89 cents US, down 0.32 of a cent from Monday. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 36.43 points to 20,949.89, the S&P 500 index advanced 2.84 points to 2,391.17, and the Nasdaq composite index added 3.77 points to a record-high 6,095.37. Elsewhere in commodities, the June gold contract rose $1.50 to US$1,257.00 an ounce, the June natural gas contract fell two cents to about $3.20 per mmBTU and the July copper contract declined 2.5 cents to roughly US$2.64 a pound.

Asian shares had struggled earlier following the release of weaker-than-expected China manufacturing data. KEEPING SCORE: Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.6 percent to 7,247 while the CAC 40 in France added 0.4 percent to 5,290. Germany’s DAX rose 0.2 percent to 12,466. U.S. shares looked set for a lukewarm start, with Dow and S&P futures both down 0.1 percent. GREECE’S DEAL: Greece and its creditors agreed the country should make another round of pension cuts in 2019 and commit to a budget target when its current bailout program ends next year. The deal will restart bailout loan payments and keep the country from facing default and reigniting a eurozone crisis this summer, officials said Tuesday. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: In other reassuring news, the House of Representatives is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs.

Advertisement ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings,” said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed similar trends. “The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating,” Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. ASIA’S DAY: Japan’s Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent to 19,445.70, helped by a weaker yen, which boosts profits for manufacturers. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.7 percent to 2,219.67. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.3 percent to 24,696.13, while the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.71. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 fell 0.1 percent to 5,950.40, while shares were higher in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 29 cents to $49.13 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 37 to $51.89 a barrel. CURRENCIES: The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.0915 while the dollar rose 0.4 percent to 112.24 yen. Commentary: Is a buyout worth taking?

The estimated cost is $1.46 billion. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale on April 27, 2017. New Zealand has requested the potential sale of up to four (4) P-8A Patrol Aircraft. Each includes: commercial engines, Tactical Open Mission Software (TOMS), Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) MX-20HD, AN/AAQ-2(V)1 Acoustic System, AN/APY-10 Radar, ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures. Also included are eight (8) Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS); five (5) Guardian Laser Transmitter Assemblies (GLTA) for the AN/AAQ-24(V)N; five (5) System Processors for AN/AAQ-24(V)N; thirty (30) AN/AAR-54 Missile Warning Sensors for the AN/AAQ-24(V)N; ten (10) LN-251 with Embedded Global Positioning Systems (GPS)/Inertial Navigations Systems (EGIs); support equipment; operation support systems; maintenance trainer/classrooms; publications; software, engineering, and logistics technical assistance; foreign Liaison officer support, contractor engineering technical services; repair and return; transportation; aircraft ferry; and other associated training, support equipment and services. The total estimated cost is $1.46 billion. This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and national security of the United States by strengthening the security of a Major Non-NATO ally which has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability within the region. New Zealand is a close ally in the region and an important partner on critical foreign policy and defense issues. The Government of New Zealand intends to use these defense articles and services to continue its Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (MSA) capability, following retirement of its P-3K maritime patrol aircraft. The sale will strengthen collective defense and enhance New Zealand’s regional and global allied contributions. New Zealand has procured and operated U.S. produced P-3 MSA for over 40 years, providing critical capabilities to NATO and coalition maritime operations. New Zealand has maintained a close MSA acquisition and sustainment relationship with the U.S. Navy over this period. The proposed sale will allow New Zealand to recapitalize, modernize and sustain its MSA capability for the next 30 years. As a long-time P-3 operator, New Zealand will have no difficulty transitioning its MSA force to the P-8A and absorbing these aircraft into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not alter the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractor will be The Boeing Company, Seattle, WA. Additional contractors include: — Air Cruisers Co LLC — Arnprior Aerospace, Canada — AVOX Zodiac Aerospace — BAE — Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)/EMS — Compass David Clark — DLS/NiaSat, Carlsbad, CA — DRS — Exelis, McLean VA — GC Micro, Petaluma, CA — General Electric, UK — Harris — Joint Electronics — Marin Baker — Northrop Grumman Corp, Falls Church, VA — Pole Zero, Cincinnati, OH — Raytheon, Waltham, MA — Raytheon, UK — Rockwell Collins, Cedar Rapids, IA — Spirit Aero, Wichita, KS — Symmetries Telephonics, Farmingdale, NY — Terma, Arlington, VA — Viking — WESCAM There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will require approximately five (5) contractor representatives to support the program in New Zealand. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded.

Companies Whose Execs Meet With The President Enjoy Major Perks By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 05/01/17 AT 1:32 PM Close Donald Trump’s White House plans to keep its visitor logs hidden from the public eye, and that decision might amount to more than a simple transparency issue, according to a new study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research this week. Using data from the administration of former President Barack Obama stretching from 2009 to 2015, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign linked company leaders’ White House visits to higher prior campaign contributions, rises in their firms’ stock prices, greater regulatory relief and more government contracts. The study, which excluded follow-up visits and meetings of more than 50 participants, also provided a possible insight into why some companies’ share prices sank in the wake of Trump’s surprise election victory last year. “Using the 2016 presidential election as a shock to firms’ political access, we find that firms with access to the Obama administration deliver significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar firms that do not have access,” the authors noted. “Overall, our results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value to corporations.” Of the 2,286 meetings between executives and federal officials included in the study, the most frequent visitors were Honeywell International Chairman and then CEO David Cote, with 30 meetings; General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, with 22; and Roger Altman, founder and former executive chairman of the investment banking firm EverCore Partners, with 21. The study authors could complete their work only because the previous administration granted access to its visitor logs — a tradition Trump’s administration has broken with altogether. So far, Trump has convened White House meetings with executives in the manufacturing, tech, trucking, pharmaceutical, health insurance, retail and banking industries. His business advisory group, chaired by Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO and chairman of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, included the CEOs of General Motors, IBM, PepsiCo, Wal-Mart, Boeing and JPMorgan Chase, among others. Democrats have pushed twin bills in the House and Senate seeking to mandate that Trump disclose who visits not only the White House, but other Trump estates where the former reality TV star meets with diplomats and corporate leaders, such as Trump Tower and the Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago estate — commonly dubbed the “Winter White House.” The nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, along with Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute and the National Security Archive, a non-profit foreign policy research institute, sued the Department of Homeland Security in April over the White House’s failure to disclose visitor records. “We hoped that the Trump administration would follow the precedent of the Obama administration and continue to release visitor logs, but unfortunately they have not,” said CREW’s executive director, Noah Bookbinder, in a press release announcing the April 10 lawsuit. “Given the many issues we have already seen in this White House with conflicts of interest, outside influence and potential ethics violations, transparency is more important than ever, so we had no choice but to sue.” Obama announced in September 2009 after similar litigation that his White House would begin posting visitor logs online.National More Political Capital How Oil And Gas Industry Power Shapes Colorado Politics By David Sirota and Josh Keefe While the state is investigating a deadly explosion at a home that was just a few hundred feet from an aging oil well, Democratic lawmakers struggle to advance any bill opposed by the oil and gas industry.

Most Popular SpaceX By Jay Bennett May 1, 2017 SpaceX is all set to launch a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office this morning. The Falcon 9 is fueled and on the launch pad at Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the launch window opens at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time. The NROL-76 satellite is likely some type of Earth surveillance satellite, but little is known about the classified payload. You can watch a webcast of the launch below. NROL-76 mission patch. NRO Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Today's launch will be the first time that SpaceX lofts a national security payload for the federal government, though the private spaceflight company first received certification to do so back in 2015. The NRO usually opts for United Launch Alliance, a Lockheed Martin-Boeing partnership, when launching spy satellites. This time, however, ULA had trouble competing with SpaceX on the cost of the launch. Related Story 17 Sinister Spy Satellite Logos The NROL-76 launch was originally scheduled for yesterday morning, but SpaceX scrubbed the launch until today due to a sensor malfunction on the first stage of the rocket. You can watch a livestream of the launch below, as well as a first stage landing attempt of the Falcon 9 rocket, but as this is a classified NRO satellite, it is likely that coverage of the ascent itself will be limited.

SpaceX will attempt to deliver a classified payload to orbit and liftoff is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET from Kennedy Space Center. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. launched a sensitive mission for the U.S. military and landed the rocket’s booster on land, marking the company’s fifth successful mission of 2017. A Falcon 9 rocket carrying NROL-76, a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, rumbled aloft about 7:15 a.m. Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a livestream of the mission on SpaceX’s website showed. The launch, originally planned for Sunday, was delayed 24 hours due to a sensor issue. Roughly nine minutes after lifting off, the rocket’s first stage returned to Earth, a feat that SpaceX first accomplished in December 2015. Landing, refurbishing and reusing rockets is key to the company’s vision of making space travel increasingly affordable. More from Bloomberg.com: The Global Growth Hotspots of the Future Are Here “Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good,” CEO Musk said on Twitter. “Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit.” Minutes before the launch, Musk had warned that “winds aloft are unusually high,” calling the conditions “worrying, but not a showstopper.” Security Missions SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket won U.S. Air Force certification for national security space missions in May 2015, breaking a lock long-held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Contracts for military launches include satellites that let troops communicate on battlefields and are estimated to be valued at about $70 billion through 2030. Though SpaceX sees rapid, reusable rockets as the key to driving down launch costs and opening up access to space, the Air Force is still exploring how the certification process will need to be adapted to use pre-flown hardware. SpaceX reflew a previously used rocket booster for the first time in March for commercial satellite customer SES SA. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump Touts Achievements, Savages Media in 100-Day Rally “Unlike commercial satellites, these satellites are not privately insured -- a launch failure means the nation and its warfighters are without capability until a replacement is launched,” James Spellman Jr. of the Air Force Space Command’s Space and Missile Systems Center said in an email. “The certification process needs to properly account for previously flown hardware to launch our national security space systems safely and securely.” SpaceX plans to fly 20 to 24 missions in 2017 for customers that include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and commercial satellite operators.

Southeast Asia’s biggest carrier is expected to turn to a net-debt position as early as 2018 -- for the first time in 13 years -- as the company borrows money and sells bonds to meet capital expenditure needs, analysts say. Singapore Air, which has traditionally limited its debt load, would benefit from raising funds more cheaply through borrowings to improve return ratios and valuations, equity research firms including OCBC Investment Research and Crucial Perspective say. The airline, which has $53 billion of aircraft on order, expanded a medium-term note program by two thirds to $5 billion in April and said it intends to “proactively” take on more debt in future. “I think it’s good for shareholders,” said Desmond Soon, Asia head of investment management at Western Asset Management Co. A company that can borrow cheaply can have higher leverage, leading to an improved return on equity and thus better prospects for stockholders, Singapore-based Soon said. The carrier’s five-year average return on equity -- an indication of how efficient a company is at generating profits -- is below that of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Singapore Air’s net debt may reach about S$660 million ($472 million) by the end of March 2018, according to a report by Eugene Chua at OCBC Investment Research on Feb. 9. That compares with net cash of about S$3.3 billion for the 12 months through March 2016, Bloomberg-compiled data show. A net-debt position occurs when a company’s debt exceeds its cash and equivalents. Shares of the carrier rose 1.1 percent to S$10.36 as of 9:05 a.m. in Singapore, extending this year’s gains to about 7 percent. Cathay’s stock has advanced 9.8 percent in 2017. “Historically there has been lot of criticism Singapore Airlines’ balance sheet is lazy” because of its cash pile, said Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Crucial Perspective, a research firm focused on Asian transport equities. A “more efficient” capital structure will help its return on equity, which has been depressed because of the large cash balance, she said. Singapore Air has the smallest debt-to-equity ratio among 11 major airlines on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index at 10.3 percent, compared with 126 percent for Cathay Pacific, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Capital expenditure at Singapore Air will average $4.3 billion annually for the five years through March 2022, based on company figures in an investor presentation in November. The spending will peak in the 12 months beginning April 2018, the year Singapore Air intends to restart the world’s longest nonstop flight using an ultralong-range version of Airbus SE’s A350-900. “Our capital expenditure will be rising as we take advantage of new growth opportunities to better position the SIA Group for the future,” Nick Ionides, a spokesman, said in an email. “These investments will be financed by cash flows generated from operations, as well as by proactively taking on more debt in the coming years.” Singapore Air has 214 planes on order, including 39 long-range aircraft from Boeing Co. with a list price of $13.8 billion. Discounts are customary in the industry for large orders. The Singapore carrier is trading at 3.1 times of enterprise value to trailing 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and rent costs, compared with 8 times for Cathay Pacific, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A lower figure means investors value Singapore Air less than Cathay Pacific. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Singapore Airlines’ cost of equity is 6.2 percent, while its cost of debt is 2.6 percent, based on the latest available data compiled by Bloomberg. That debt cost is low among Singapore-based corporations, whose average is about 10 percentage points higher, making it “prudent” for Singapore Air to acquire more debt, said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a director at Religare Capital Markets in the city-state. “Debt is cheaper than equity,” Joshua Crabb, head of Asian equities at a unit of Old Mutual Plc, said from Hong Kong. Therefore “optimal gearing structures can add value,” benefiting shareholders, he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Print Story X Print Story World May 2, 2017 Share Advertisement SpaceX makes US mly launch MIAMI: SpaceX on Monday blasted off a secretive US government payload, known only as NROL-76, marking the first military launch for the California-based aerospace company headed by billionaire tycoon Elon Musk. The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, soared into the sky atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 7:15 am (1115 GMT). About 10 minutes after launch, the scorched first stage of the rocket came back to Earth and landed upright at Cape Canaveral, marking the fourth successful solid ground landing for SpaceX. "And we have touchdown," a SpaceX commentator said on the live webcast of the event as cheers broke out at mission control. "The first stage has landed back at Landing Zone 1. Another good day for us at SpaceX. A beautiful sight to see." Live video of the launch showed the first and second stages of the rocket separating about two and a half minutes into the flight. The larger, first stage, made a gentle arc and powered its nitrogen thrusters to guide it back to Earth. The rocket then set itself down, gently and steadily, in the centre of the 300-foot circular landing zone. Musk is leading an effort in the rocket industry to re-use costly parts rather than jettison them into the ocean after each launch. SpaceX has already made multiple successful landings, some on floating platforms -- known as drone ships -- in the ocean. The launch was initially planned for Sunday, but was postponed in the last seconds before liftoff due to a sensor issue with the rocket, SpaceX said. The sensor in question was replaced ahead of Monday’s attempt. Little was known about the payload due to its classified nature. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," a spokeswoman told AFP. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force’s practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Hank Greenberg’s firm lobbying on financial reform By Theodoric Meyer 05/02/17 02:05 PM EDT With David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver HANK GREENBERG’S FIRM REGISTERED TO LOBBY ON FINANCIAL REFORM: C.V. Starr, the insurance and investment firm led by Hank Greenberg, has registered its first lobbyist. Joe Dillon, a former Treasury Department senior adviser in George W. Bush’s administration, registered to lobby for the firm on “issues related to financial regulatory reform.” The registration puts Greenberg, who led the insurance behemoth American International Group for decades before being forced out in 2005, in the position of lobbying to roll back the financial reforms passed partially in response to AIG’s near collapse during the financial crisis. (Greenberg himself recently got an invitation to the White House after meeting with President Donald Trump in Trump Tower during the transition.) Story Continued Below — In an interview, Dillon said he’d be lobbying in support of a bill championed by Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) that would roll back limits on the amount banks can charge merchants in debit-card fees, restrictions that were part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. “We believe that Dodd-Frank was an overreach of significant proportion,” said Dillon, who previously worked for AIG when Greenberg ran it. “We support [efforts by] the House leadership to dial this back and make it more effective.” C.V. Starr also plans to push for the administration to take a more “pragmatic posture with China,” Dillon said. PHRMA LOSES TWO MORE MEMBERS: “The Medicines Company and Avanir Pharmaceuticals have resigned from PhRMA, bringing the number of recent defections to four ahead of the drug lobby's pending revamp of membership rules,” POLITICO’s Sarah Karlin-Smith reports. "PhRMA's board next week is expected to vote on new criteria designed to keep price-gouging companies out of the lobby's ranks. The drug lobby confirmed the latest defections but refused to provide details on why the companies left the organization. Neither drug company returned a request for comment.” — “PhRMA is undertaking the revamp after member company Marathon's decision earlier this year to introduce an $89,000 version of a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug that most U.S. patients were already able to import for a fraction of that price. Marathon has previously come under congressional scrutiny for raising the prices of old medicines by nearly 400 percent. Marathon has since resigned from PhRMA, as has Mallinckrodt. According to a Wall Street Journal report of Mallinckrodt's resignation, changes to the PhRMA bylaws will require members to spend significant funds on research and development of new drugs — a standard that Mallinckrodt may not be able to meet.” Full story.

ZINKE TAPS POLITICAL ALLY FOR INTERIOR POST: “Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke today named the treasurer of his former congressional leadership PAC to a newly created position coordinating the agency's energy policies across its nine bureaus,” POLITICO’s Esther Whieldon reports. “Vincent DeVito, a Boston-based energy lawyer, will be counselor to the secretary for energy policy, where he will be responsible for ensuring all the agencies are on the same page, Zinke said at a Consumer Energy Alliance event in Houston, which was streamed on Facebook.” Full story. — One interesting tidbit: DeVito also served as the lawyer for Patriots for America, a super PAC that attacked Eric Greitens — now Missouri’s governor — last year in the GOP primary. The super PAC may have violated campaign finance law by spending “money on a state-level race without filing reports with Missouri’s campaign finance authorities, which requires faster disclosure for some activities, according to multiple attorneys,” POLITICO reported last year. “It has sent out mailers and has run digital ads bashing Greitens, but none of that activity has been reported to Missouri's Ethics Commission.” The FEC and the Missouri Ethics Commission looked into the super PAC after a Greitens supporter filed a pair complaints, but both agencies dismissed the matter. UNITED, DELTA, AMERICAN HUNTING FOR NEW TOP LOBBYISTS: “The three largest U.S. airlines — including United Airlines — are all looking for a new top lobbyist at a time when their industry is coming under heavy scrutiny for the way it treats passengers,” The Hill’s Megan Wilson reports. Oscar Munoz, United’s chief executive, testified before the House Transportation Committee this morning weeks after the airline was roundly condemned for forcibly kicking a passenger of a flight to Louisville — making it a rough time to represent United in Washington. “‘It’s only intensified the interest and the high stakes of this position,’ one person close to the process said, asking for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record.” Full story. HATCH KEEPS FUNDRAISING: Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who’s said he’ll run for an eighth term next year but has also said he could change his mind, is still fundraising like he’s running. Hatch will headline a breakfast fundraiser with House Speaker Paul Ryan on May 18 at an undisclosed location benefiting the Hatch Victory Committee, according to an invitation. Hatch raised $1.5 million in the first quarter. JOB MOVES: — Celgene has added Erin Polak as senior director for federal government relations and Aaron Fobes as associate director for U.S. public affairs and policy. Polak previously worked for Merck. Fobes was previously press secretary for the Senate Finance Committee. The firm also announced a round of promotions: Greg Chesmore is now vice president for U.S. government relations and policy, Francesca Tedesco is now executive director for public policy, Shawn Sullivan is associate manager for government relations and Peggy Brand is now a senior director on the state government relations team. — Stephen Spaulding is heading to Common Cause as chief of strategy and external relations. He was previously special counsel to Ann Ravel when she served on the FEC. — Steptoe & Johnson has added Brian Egan as a partner in the Washington office. He was previously the top lawyer in the State Department during the last year of the Obama administration. — Paul Rosen, a former chief of staff to former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, has joined Crowell & Moring as a partner in the Los Angeles office. He’ll be a member of the white collar and regulatory enforcement, privacy and cybersecurity and government contracts groups. — William Barry has joined Miller & Chevalier’s litigation department. He was previously a partner at Richards, Kibbe & Orbe. — “The Institute for Energy Research's Daniel Simmons will take up a leading post at the Department of Energy as the acting assistant secretary for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,” POLITICO’s Darius Dixon reports. — “Longtime House Armed Services [Committee] Republican staff director Bob Simmons is leaving the committee and will join aerospace giant Boeing,” POLITICO’s Connor O’Brien reports. “Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) announced Simmons' departure Monday afternoon and said deputy staff director Jenness Simler would fill the role on an interim basis, effectively immediately. Simmons, however, will remain with the committee as an adviser.” NEW JOINT FUNDRAISERS: None NEW PACs: Move America Right (Super PAC) Save California PAC (Super PAC) We Represent (PAC) NEW LOBBYING REGISTRATIONS: None NEW LOBBYING TERMINATIONS: Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP: University of Utah Capital Consultants: Chickasaw Enterprises Fennemore Craig: Coyote Springs Investment LLC Fennemore Craig: Credit Union National Association Heard Assoc, Keith: Institute for Marine Mammal Studies Heard Assoc, Keith: Local Initiatives Support Corporation Heard Assoc, Keith: Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians Heard Assoc, Keith: National Rural Water Association McAllister & Quinn, LLC: Acorda Therapeutics Sidley Austin LLP: Claim Your Health Data Coalition « View Archives Authors: Theodoric Meyer tmeyer@politico.com About The Author Theodoric Meyer covers lobbying for POLITICO and writes the POLITICO Influence newsletter.

Post-Arab-spring Opportunities to Bring in $17.05 Billion - Research and Markets News provided by Research and Markets 02 May, 2017, 13:00 BST Share this article DUBLIN, May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Middle East Homeland Security Market, 2015" report to their offering. The Middle Eastern Homeland Security market will grow at a CAGR of 15.5% to achieve $17.05 billion by 2021, strongly driven by government initiatives to create a smart and secure environment amidst high terrorist activities in the region. The Middle Eastern Homeland Security market registered a revenue of $7.19 billion in 2015. This report defines the Middle Eastern Homeland Security market as comprising three market segments: Monitoring and Surveillance Systems, Restricted Entry Systems and Perimeter Security Solutions. Each segment has unique trends which are expected to drive the market in the identified verticals: Government, O&G and Transportation. This report focuses on the way these segments will grow by 2021, and the opportunities that are available for the companies participating in this space. Despite cuts in military budgets and spending, the governments' focus towards procuring smart and intelligent security solutions to preserve internal security has remained undeterred. Clearly laid out regulations help companies identify the needs of a particular vertical, but the challenge is to provide appealing value additions while keeping the cost factor in mind. In country-wise analysis, Saudi Arabia will have largest market share of 45.9% of the total market. Factors such as being host to several major events such as Dubai Expo 2020 and Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 provide lucrative opportunities which can be utilized effectively with a sound strategic plan. Market revenue in this report was derived from discussions with industry participants, review of company annual reports, secondary sources and information gathered from in-house database. The base year for the analysis is 2015, and the forecast period is 2016 to 2021. Revenue is provided in US dollars. Key Questions This Study Will Answer: - What is the state of the planned investments on Internal Security? - What are the growing trends in the Middle Eastern Homeland Security Market? - What are the trends and growth pattern of identified segments: Monitoring and Surveillance Systems, Restricted Entry Systems and Perimeter Security Solutions? - What opportunities does the market hold for Tier II and Tier III players? - What are the strategies that companies can make use of to exploit the opportunity at hand?

Safwat Mesallam, chairman of the company, said the offers will be checked by mid-July so as to make a decision. These offers include both renting and purchasing aircraft, Mesallam told Al-Borsa. EgyptAir had called on companies specialized in manufacturing and funding the purchase of airplanes to submit their offers so that the airliner could add 33 airplanes to its fleet before 2021, raising the total number of the planes up to 84. The airline seeks to add 27 large-size aircraft and six smaller ones. The preliminary plan targeted 105 planes; this number was modified to 93 and then against to 84, due to the high costs of renting or purchasing resulting from the devaluation of Egyptian pound against the US dollar. EgyptAir recently signed a contract to purchase nine Boeing planes (B737-800 NGs) at costs of $864 million. Mesallam disclosed the budget for the coming fiscal year and the company's intentions to target LE1 billion in profits. The stability of the US dollar rate and operation of flights for Umrah and pilgrimage will help the company achieve profits in the coming fiscal year.   Tweet Printer-friendly versionSend to friend aircraft, airline, airplane, Egypt, EgyptAir, EgyptAir fleet Read also EgyptAir delegation flies to US to receive new Boeing airplane EgyptAir to receive new Boeing aircraft in May                                             Our Recommendations Was the Egyptian student in Germany killed in a racially-charged attack?

The two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the classified NROL-76 satellite, lifted off at 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT) from historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the same pad that supported numerous Apollo and space shuttle launches, the company's live webcast showed. About 10 minutes later, the rocket's first stage landed at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1, just south of the launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX previously landed a first stage booster at Landing Zone 1 three times. It also successfully recovered Falcon 9 first stages from six missions at sea using the company's drone ships. Few details have been released about NROL-76, a satellite designed, built and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office, a member of the U.S. intelligence community of an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. This launch has great symbolic significance for SpaceX, since it's the 15-year-old company's first mission for the Pentagon. For years, the market for launching U.S. military payloads was dominated by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. But SpaceX broke the monopoly in 2015, when the U.S. Air Force certified its Falcon 9 rocket to launch national security space missions. Since then, the California-based company has also won two contracts to launch Global Positioning System satellites for the U.S. Air Force.
