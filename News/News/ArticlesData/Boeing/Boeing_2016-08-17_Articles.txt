Credit: NASA Astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins plan to venture outside the lab complex Friday for a long-awaited spacewalk to attach a new docking mechanism, the first of two that will be used by U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to carry astronauts to and from the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The Boeing-built International Docking Adapter, or IDA, was delivered to the station in July aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship. Williams and Rubins plan to help lock it to the station’s former shuttle docking port at the front of the Harmony module, connecting power and data cables put in place during earlier spacewalks. They also plan to route cables to Harmony’s upper port where a second IDA will be attached in 2018. Until then, Boeing’s CST-100 “Starliner” spacecraft and SpaceX’s piloted Dragon will both use the forward IDA, starting with unpiloted and piloted SpaceX test fights in 2017 followed by similar test flights by Boeing late next year and early 2018. Once the CST-100 and crewed Dragon begin operational flights, routinely carrying crews to and from the station, NASA will have independent access to the orbiting laboratory for the first time since the space shuttle’s last flight in 2011. “Having this capability is really going to help us in general,” said Kenny Todd, NASA space station operations manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. “It gives us redundancy in our launch services, being able to get crews to the space station, and certainly that’s a win for everybody in this partnership. “So we’re very excited to get that milestone checked and get to the point where we can have crews launch from different places around the Earth and servicing the station.” Along with giving NASA and partner astronauts independent access to the space station, the new commercial ferry ships will carry four crew members to the station per flight compared to the three-seat Soyuz. That will allow NASA to boost the station’s crew from six to seven, greatly expanding the time available for research. “If you look today at the way the increments play out, a lot of times we’ll be running a little short on crew time,” Todd said. “That tends to be our pinch point sometimes relative to some of the research we’re doing. So having an extra … crew member is going to be very important for us.” While the Boeing and SpaceX crew ferry ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz for crew transportation, at least one NASA-sponsored astronaut will continue to ride aloft aboard each station-bound Soyuz while a cosmonaut is expected to be on board when each U.S. spacecraft takes off. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships, and its crew, to depart. NASA managers initially hoped to get the first IDA attached last year. But the initial unit, which was to be attached to Harmony’s forward port, was lost in June 2015 when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket suffered a catastrophic launch failure, destroying a station-bound Dragon cargo ship. Boeing is in the process of building a third IDA to replace the lost unit and if all goes well, IDA-3 will be launched and attached to the station in 2018. While a single IDA can handle the expected traffic in the near term, two ports are needed to fully support eventual crew rotations and additional cargo ships. Floating in the station’s Quest airlock module, Williams, commander of Expedition 48, and Rubins, a molecular biologist, plan to switch their spacesuits to battery power around 8:05 a.m. EDT (GMT-4) Friday to officially kick off a planned six-and-a-half-hour excursion. It will be the fourth spacewalk for Williams and the first for Rubins. They will be assisted by Japanese astronaut Takua Onishi, working inside the space station, and astronaut Tom Marshburn, a veteran spacewalker in mission control who will handle communications between the station and flight controllers in Houston. For identification, Williams, call sign EV-1, will be wearing a suit with red stripes and using helmet camera No. 17. Rubins, EV-2, will be using an unmarked suit with helmetcam No. 20. This will be the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the third so far this year and the second staged by NASA. During a NASA spacewalk in January, a small amount of water made its way into astronaut Tim Kopra’s helmet, prompting an early end to the excursion. It was the first significant water-related issue with a NASA spacesuit since a much more serious leak flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano’s helmet in 2013. That leak was caused by contamination that clogged an internal filter in the suit’s cooling system. Kopra’s suit was returned to Earth for a detailed examination and while it operated normally in Earth’s gravity, engineers suspect the minor leakage seen in January may have been caused by subtle issues with the suit’s sublimator, which controls the processing of condensation. For Friday’s spacewalk, Todd said, Williams and Rubins will use different temperature settings to minimize condensate production early in the outing and engineers are confident the suits will work properly. After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting necessary tools and two foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will make their way to the front end of the station where the old shuttle port, pressurized mating adapter No. 2, or PMA-2, is attached to the Harmony module’s forward hatch. The station’s robot arm pulled the IDA from the Dragon cargo ship’s unpressurized trunk section overnight Wednesday and moved it to within about two feet of PMA-2 to await the astronauts. Power and data cables needed by the IDA were routed out to the docking port during three spacewalks dating back to February 2015. Once in position, firmly anchored in foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will attach tethers to the IDA and connect cables providing power to internal heaters, sensors and the latching mechanism that will lock it to PMA-2. The spacewalkers then will help guide the IDA into place so Onishi, using a control panel inside the station, can command the latches to engage, locking the docking mechanism to the end of the PMA. The spacewalkers then will complete work with various jumpers and cables, cover up reflectors once used by approaching shuttle crews to help determine distance and relative velocity and install others designed for use by CST-100 and crew Dragon spacecraft. With the IDA in place, Williams will route ethernet cables needed by a future Russian module while Rubins routes a final set of cables to the top of Harmony where IDA-3 will eventually be attached. She then will assist Williams. If time is available, the spacewalkers will tie down the brake handle on an equipment cart attached to rails on the forward side of the station’s solar power truss and carry out a photo survey of a physics instrument known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Assuming no major problems develop, the astronauts will venture back outside on Sept. 1 to retract an unneeded solar array cooling radiator that was extended in 2012 as part of troubleshooting to locate a coolant leak. They also plan to install an HD television camera on the station’s truss, replace a light and inspect struts associated with a large mechanism that allows outboard solar arrays to rotate. At least two more spacewalks had been planned before the end of the year to install a replacement set of solar array batteries. But launch of the batteries aboard a Japanese HTV cargo ship, originally planned for Sept. 30, is on indefinite hold pending work to fix a leak in the vehicle’s propulsion system. Onishi and astronaut Shane Kimbrough, who is scheduled for launch to the station Sept. 23, originally planned to carry out the battery swap out in October. But that EVA almost certainly will be delayed past Oct. 30 when Onishi, Rubins and Soyuz commander Anatoly Ivanishin are scheduled to return to Earth. As of this writing, it’s not known when the HTV might be ready for launch or when the battery spacewalk might be carried out.

Delta Flight 2845 left Minneapolis/St. Paul with 130 customers Thursday evening and touched down at the Ellsworth Air Force Base instead of its intended destination at the nearby Rapid City Regional Airport. The Associated Press notes “Ellsworth is about 10 miles due north of Rapid City Regional Airport. The two airports have runways that are oriented nearly identically to the compass, from northwest to southeast.” USA TODAY Wrong-airport landings rare, but not unheard of Delta confirmed the incident in a statement, saying “the flight re-departed for Rapid City Thursday night after coordinating with officials.” Delta added in its statement that “the crew has been taken off-duty while an investigation commences by the National Transportation Safety Board. Delta will fully cooperate with that investigation and has already begun an internal review of its own. Safety is always Delta’s top priority.” The carrier said it has contacted Flight 2845 passengers "and offered a gesture of apology for the inconvenience."

While rare, U.S. flights have occasionally landed at the wrong airports before. In fact, a similar incident involving the same airports also occurred in 2004 when a Northwest Airlines A319 also mistakenly landed at Ellsworth. More recently, a Southwest Airlines flight bound for Branson, Mo., mistakenly landed at a much smaller municipal field nearby in January 2014. The Southwest 737 involved in that incident had to brake hard and come to an abrupt stop ahead of a steep drop at the end of that airport's shorter runway. USA TODAY Southwest suspends pilots after landing at wrong airport And in November 2013, a massive Boeing “Dreamlifter” cargo plane landed at the wrong airport near Wichita. The specially modified 747 transport jet ended up at the small Colonel James Jabara Airport in an apparent mistake. The flight, which was arriving from New York JFK, was supposed to fly to the McConnell Air Force Base but instead landed about nine miles away at Jabara. (VIDEO: Boeing jumbo jet takes off after 'oops' landing) Other recent wrong-airport mistakes reported in the United States include: In August 2012: A Silver Airways Saab 340 turbo prop operating as a United Express flight mistakenly landed in Fairmont, W. Va., instead of its intended destination of Clarksburg, W. Va., according to The Aviation Herald. In July 2012: A massive military C-17 cargo plane bound for MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa instead landed by mistake at the tiny Peter O.

CAUGHT ON VIDEO: Giant military plane lands at wrong airport (July 2012) September 2011: A Colgan Air Saab 340 turboprop operating under the Continental Express brand mistakenly landed at Louisiana's Southland Field instead of the scheduled destination of Lake Charles Regional Airport. The Sulphur Daily News labeled the mistake of Flight 3222 as a "freak occurrence." The Associated Press says the mistaken airport is "an airfield that usually sees only cropdusters." June 2004: A Northwest Airbus A319 intending to land at Rapid City, S.D., instead landed about 10 miles away at the Ellsworth Air Force Base. January 2004: A Shuttle America Saab A340 heading for the University Park Airport near State College, Pa., instead landed by mistake at the Mid-State Regional Airport – a tiny general aviation airport in nearby Philipsburg, Pa. The flight originated from Pittsburgh under the US Airways Express brand. AP says it conducted a 2014 search "of government safety data and news reports since the early 1990s and found at least 150 flights in which U.S. commercial passenger and cargo planes have either landed at the wrong airport or started to land and realized their mistake in time."

Kennedy Airport on June 11, 2015.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) Is JetBlue ready to return to Atlanta? That seems to be the case, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The newspaper reports JetBlue has sent the Atlanta airport “a letter of interest … saying it plans to renew service to Atlanta in September 2017.” JetBlue said it would add up to 16 flights a day if it were able to secure two gates at the world’s busiest airport. FULL REPORT: JetBlue plans Atlanta flights in ‘17 (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) “We believe that the Atlanta air market is currently overpriced and suffering from insufficient competition,” Dave Clark, JetBlue’s VP of network planning, is quoted by the Journal-Constitution as writing in the airline’s letter to the airport. JetBlue previously flew to Atlanta in 2003, when it launched nonstop service to its focus city in Long Beach, Calif. The airline soon added a second California route (Oakland), but its stay in Atlanta would be short-lived. The carrier withdrew from Atlanta after just six months, exiting amid a turf war that erupted between Delta and now-defunct AirTran and caught JetBlue in the crossfire. FROM THE ARCHIVES: JetBlue gains on its competition (August 2003) USATODAY USATODAY.com - JetBlue calls it quits in Atlanta Then-upstart AirTran was building its hub in Atlanta, but its expansion provoked a strong response from Atlanta-based Delta when it added nonstop flights between Atlanta and L.A. Delta beefed up its own Atlanta-L.A. schedule to fend off AirTran, going to 13 daily round-trip flights from eight, according to media reports at the time. Fares plummeted amid the intensifying Delta-AirTran turf war. It also put pressure on JetBlue to cut fares on its Atlanta-California, ultimately prompting the airline to pull out. "We just thought it was a little crazy," then-JetBlue CEO David Neeleman said in 2003 about the decision to leave Atlanta amid the intensifying battle between Delta and AirTran. As for a potential return to Atlanta, JetBlue's interest apparently hinges on its ability to gain access to gates that meet its needs. In its letter to the airport, JetBlue says the "common use" gates in Terminal D are “are not satisfactory," according to the Journal-Constitution. Instead, JetBlue says it's seeking "two preferential gates that are suitable for both JetBlue and the airport."

The A350-1000 is the largest variant of the widebody jet, the newest in Airbus’ lineup of commercial passenger aircraft types. The first A350 -- the smaller -900 variant -- entered commercial service for the first time in January 2015. BOOKMARK: Go directly to the Today in the Sky homepage The deal would be worth more than $4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically negotiate substantial discounts on such orders. “The size of this order demonstrates our absolute focus on investing in the future for our customers and our people, and confirms the strength of our business,” Virgin Atlantic CEO Craig Kreeger says in a statement, adding “the A350-1000 plays a pivotal role in our fleet program.” Virgin Atlantic's A350s will initially fly from its hub at London Heathrow in what the carrier calls an effort “to strengthen the trans-Atlantic network on existing business routes.” Virgin Atlantic will later expand A350 service to London Gatwick for leisure-oriented routes to the Caribbean. Virgin Atlantic owner RIchard Branson tells The Wall Street Journal that the new A350-1000s will largely go toward phasing out the airline's aging Boeing 747s. Reuters writes "Kreeger said the airline still had options over six A380 jets and continued to consider that aircraft for its fleet in future," though there's industry observers are skeptical that Virgin Atlantic will ever fly that aircraft. The A350 order was announced Monday during the first day of the Farnborough Airshow near London. The week-long show alternates years with the Paris Airshow and is one of the biggest annual events in the aviation industry.

But industry observers predict 2016 will be a spartan year for the the big blockbuster orders that have come to define previous shows. Another common theme at the airshows has been the rivalry over airline deals between Europe’s Airbus and U.S. jetmaker Boeing. Airbus touted its deal to sell the A350 to Virgin Atlantic, a development that comes less than two years after Virgin Atlantic began flying its first models of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. “This agreement allows Virgin Atlantic to set the standard on its network by being amongst the first airlines into service with the A350-1000, with an Airspace by Airbus cabin, offering superior comfort including industry leading 18" wide seats in‎ economy,” Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier says in a statement. “These modern, efficient A350s will complement Virgin Atlantic’s existing fleet of 10 A330-300s and offer Virgin Atlantic crews the advantage of familiarity with Airbus operating procedures around the network” The 787 is one of Boeing’s direct competitors to the A350. "It is safe to call (the 787) a flagship aircraft for Virgin Atlantic," Kreeger told Today in the Sky in October 2014 as the airline prepared to put its first Dreamliner into service.

And it’s all set to come to a head on Friday, when the U.S. jetmaker celebrates the anniversary its July 15, 1916, founding date at one of the world’s biggest aviation stages – the Farnborough Airshow. The show, which alternates annually with its sister show in Paris, is one of the most important events on the aviation calendar. It draws major players from across the industry, all of whom hope to enjoy some time in the spotlight at the high-profile event. USA TODAY Cool photos from the 2016 Farnborough Airshow USA TODAY Boeing readies high-flying celebration for 100th anniversary So how do rivals feel about the possibility that Boeing’s centennial celebration might suck some of the oxygen out of the proverbial room? Judging by a video from Boeing archrival Airbus, this is one time competitors may be willing to tip their hats. “What would we tell our competitors as they make a big deal about their 100th year in business,” an Airbus employee asks in a video posted by the European manufacturer on Tuesday.  “We at Airbus think the answer is obvious,” another employee continues in the video, before more Airbus workers continue by declaring “there’s one thing” they’d all like to tell Boeing. “Congratulations,” is the answer from a stream of Airbus employees at the end of the video, which includes a “Happy Birthday” salute to Boeing from both Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier and COO chief John Leahy.

The airline also rolled out a new premium economy cabin – called “Premium.” The seats will fly on the Virgin Australia's long-haul Boeing 777-300ER that fly daily between the United States and the Australian cities of Sydney and Brisbane. The new business class cabin was designed by the London-based tangerine agency and includes 37 seats (up from 34). The seats are laid out in a 1-2-1 reverse-herringbone configuration (instead of the previous 2-3-2 layout), which gives every passenger direct aisle access. “We won’t have anybody climbing over customers and falling on top of them during turbulence trying to get out of their seat,” said Virgin Australia Group CEO John Borghetti. The new business-class seats will be installed on all five of the carrier's Boeing 777s by September 2016 (three are already done). They feature multiple work, dining and personal storage spaces and 18-inch high definition touch-screens for in-flight entertainment. Dividers between the two center seats can be raised or lowered for privacy. For sleeping, the 21-inch wide business-class seats convert into fully lie-flat beds that are 28 inches wide and 80 inches long. A touch-screen with specially-designed icons makes it easy for passengers to move and adjust the seats. An attended bar and an associated lounge area between the business-class and premium economy cabins presents what Borghetti called a “wow factor” for all passengers entering the aircraft and a comfortable socializing space for business cabin passengers during the flight. The side console is still accessible during meal service in business class on Virgin Australia's reconfigured Boeing 777-300ER.  (Photo: Harriet Baskas, Special for USA TODAY) “Virgin Australia was really ambitious,” said tangerine’s Chief Creative Officer Matt Round. “They wanted something with a lot of spirit and precise technical-ness to it and we were able to capture some of what they wanted by being creative with the bar space and with the materials and textures on the seats and by playing with light and form.” In addition to the business cabin, Virgin Australia updated the premium economy cabin (“Premium”) on its 777-300ER aircraft. There are now 24 seats, each 19.5 inches wide, with an increased pitch of 41 inches and nine inches of recline. In-flight premium service includes plated meals and a self-serve pantry. Upgrades in the business-class cabin – especially eliminating the middle seats – are important, said Borghetti, because now “the consumer expects it” and airlines that don’t stay current end up having to discount their ticket prices. Virgin Australia, said Borghetti, will likely raise its business class fares a bit in the fall when the retrofitting of all five 777s is completed. Increased interest in travel between the United States and Australia (visitors to Australia from the U.S. were up 10% last year, according to Tourism Australia) has also sparked an uptick in the number of flights offered between the U.S. and Australia, including offerings form Qantas, American and United Airlines, and increased competition for passengers. In addition to introducing its new business class and premium cabins for trans-Pacific routes, Virgin Australia announced on Wednesday that the airline will start adding in-flight Wi-Fi to its Boeing 737-800, Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 aircraft starting next year. Virgin Australia operates 14 flights a week between Australia and Los Angeles. On Wednesday, Virgin Australia alliance partner Delta Air Lines and Los Angeles International Airport announced the approval of an agreement for Delta to relocate from Terminals 5 and 6 to Terminals 2 and 3 sometime between January 2017 and December 2018. As part of Delta’s $1.9 billion upgrade of the two terminals, Virgin Australia will be relocate from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2, possibly by next summer.

The $4.7 million project began last November and added 2,424 “power hubs,” which each feature two standard 120-volt electrical plugs as well as two USB receptacles. In total, 9,696 individual "charging points" were added, according to the airport. BOOKMARK: Go directly to the Today in the Sky homepage USA TODAY United adds two East Coast routes from Denver Denver says the new charging stations “provide nearby power options in virtually every public seating area on the concourses.” “When Denver International Airport opened 21 years ago, few people could have imagined today’s mobile technology and the demand for places to charge those devices,” Denver airport CEO Kim Day says in a statement. “We made this important investment for our passengers, who desire this kind of amenity. At the same time, we have also invested nearly $2.5 million to improve our free public Wi-Fi service – which has been independently verified as being the fastest among any large U.S. airport,” she adds. “Taken together, these new and improved services are keeping DEN’s passengers connected to family, friends and the world while they travel.” United operates a major connecting hub at Denver while both Southwest and Frontier also operate large bases at the airport. Denver International was the USA's sixth-busiest airport in 2015 with more than 54 million passengers using the airport, according to Airports Council International.

Share story By Tony Capaccio Bloomberg News The Air Force won permission from Pentagon officials to sign two production contracts with Boeing for the first 19 KC-46 tankers, deals valued at a combined $2.8 billion. The approval came after a meeting of the Pentagon’s Defense Acquisition Board headed by Frank Kendall, the Defense Department’s top weapons buyer. The decision was announced by the Air Force in an emailed statement. “I commend the team for diligently working through some difficult technical challenges,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in the statement. “The KC-46 program has made significant strides in moving the Air Force toward the modernization needed in our strategic tanker fleet.” The decision on initial, low-rate production had slipped from August 2015 and then from April of this year to resolve technical issues with the tanker’s refueling system. The final hurdle was cleared last month with the successful refueling of an A-10 Warthog that verified Boeing fixed flaws in the boom used for in-air refueling.

Boeing is in line to produce as many as 179 tankers under the $52 billion program. A decision to approve full production — the most lucrative phase — has slipped to March 2018 from September 2017, the Air Force disclosed in March, as a result of cumulative delays in aircraft development from technical issues, such as wiring and the refueling system. The KC-46, built on the air frame of Boeing’s 767 commercial jet, is the first new U.S. tanker since the 1980s. Boeing said in July that it would report a $2.1 billion after-tax accounting charge for the second quarter, primarily because of setbacks involving passenger planes but also due to a $393 million loss stemming from delays on the KC-46.

Domestic flights for national carrier Garuda began operating in the morning from Soekarno-Hatta airport's steel and glass $560 million Terminal 3. Its international flights will shift to the new terminal next month. Other airlines will gradually move their flights to the terminal and the airport company plans to start refurbishing two old terminals, built in 1984 and 1992, later this year. Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, is one of world's fastest growing air travel markets. But many international airlines bypass the capital Jakarta in favor of modern, high-capacity airports at Bangkok, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur for their Southeast Asian stopovers. Passengers wait for their flights on the first day of operation of the new terminal of Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang near Jakarta on Aug. 9, 2016. The Indonesian capital's airport opened its $560 million, steel and glass Terminal 3 Tuesday after years of operating at far above its passenger capacity.  (Photo: Tatan Syuflana, AP) The airport operator and government hopes the new terminal, and a third runway that is under development, will change that. Budi Karya Sumadi, Indonesia's transport minister and former president of the airport company, said "this terminal was built to change the image of the capital Jakarta." Soekarno-Hatta airport will be able to handle 62 million passengers a year once the renovated terminals are fully operational again in early 2018. The airport handled about 54 million passengers last year, making it the 18th busiest in the world, according to Airports Council International. An electric train from the airport to the city is slated for completion in early 2017.

NASA Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins plan to venture outside the lab complex Friday for a long-awaited spacewalk to attach a new docking mechanism, the first of two that will be used by U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to carry astronauts to and from the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The Boeing-built International Docking Adapter, or IDA, was delivered to the station in July aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship. Williams and Rubins plan to help lock it to the station’s former shuttle docking port at the front of the Harmony module, connecting power and data cables put in place during earlier spacewalks. They also plan to route cables to Harmony’s upper port where a second IDA will be attached in 2018. Until then, Boeing’s CST-100 “Starliner” spacecraft and SpaceX’s piloted Dragon will both use the forward IDA, starting with unpiloted and piloted SpaceX test fights in 2017 followed by similar test flights by Boeing late next year and early 2018. Once the CST-100 and crewed Dragon begin operational flights, routinely carrying crews to and from the station, NASA will have independent access to the orbiting laboratory for the first time since the space shuttle’s last flight in 2011. “Having this capability is really going to help us in general,” said Kenny Todd, NASA space station operations manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. “It gives us redundancy in our launch services, being able to get crews to the space station, and certainly that’s a win for everybody in this partnership. “So we’re very excited to get that milestone checked and get to the point where we can have crews launch from different places around the Earth and servicing the station.” Along with giving NASA and partner astronauts independent access to the space station, the new commercial ferry ships will carry four crew members to the station per flight compared to the three-seat Soyuz. That will allow NASA to boost the station’s crew from six to seven, greatly expanding the time available for research. “If you look today at the way the increments play out, a lot of times we’ll be running a little short on crew time,” Todd said. “That tends to be our pinch point sometimes relative to some of the research we’re doing. So having an extra ... crew member is going to be very important for us.” While the Boeing and SpaceX crew ferry ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz for crew transportation, at least one NASA-sponsored astronaut will continue to ride aloft aboard each station-bound Soyuz while a cosmonaut is expected to be on board when each U.S. spacecraft takes off. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships, and its crew, to depart. This graphic shows how the International Docking Adapter (shown in yellow) fits on the front of the space station’s old shuttle docking port, along with the myriad cables that will route power and data to and from the module. NASA NASA managers initially hoped to get the first IDA attached last year. But the initial unit, which was to be attached to Harmony’s forward port, was lost in June 2015 when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket suffered a catastrophic launch failure, destroying a station-bound Dragon cargo ship. Boeing is in the process of building a third IDA to replace the lost unit and if all goes well, IDA-3 will be launched and attached to the station in 2018. While a single IDA can handle the expected traffic in the near term, two ports are needed to fully support eventual crew rotations and additional cargo ships. Floating in the station’s Quest airlock module, Williams, commander of Expedition 48, and Rubins, a molecular biologist, plan to switch their spacesuits to battery power around 8:05 a.m. EDT (GMT-4) Friday to officially kick off a planned six-and-a-half-hour excursion. It will be the fourth spacewalk for Williams and the first for Rubins. They will be assisted by Japanese astronaut Takua Onishi, working inside the space station, and astronaut Tom Marshburn, a veteran spacewalker in mission control who will handle communications between the station and flight controllers in Houston. For identification, Williams, call sign EV-1, will be wearing a suit with red stripes and using helmet camera No. 17. Rubins, EV-2, will be using an unmarked suit with helmetcam No. 20. This will be the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the third so far this year and the second staged by NASA. During a NASA spacewalk in January, a small amount of water made its way into astronaut Tim Kopra’s helmet, prompting an early end to the excursion. It was the first significant water-related issue with a NASA spacesuit since a much more serious leak flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano’s helmet in 2013. That leak was caused by contamination that clogged an internal filter in the suit’s cooling system. Kopra’s suit was returned to Earth for a detailed examination and while it operated normally in Earth’s gravity, engineers suspect the minor leakage seen in January may have been caused by subtle issues with the suit’s sublimator, which controls the processing of condensation. For Friday’s spacewalk, Todd said, Williams and Rubins will use different temperature settings to minimize condensate production early in the outing and engineers are confident the suits will work properly. After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting necessary tools and two foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will make their way to the front end of the station where the old shuttle port, pressurized mating adapter No. 2, or PMA-2, is attached to the Harmony module’s forward hatch. The International Docking Adapter during final preparations before launch in July. NASA The station’s robot arm pulled the IDA from the Dragon cargo ship’s unpressurized trunk section overnight Wednesday and moved it to within about two feet of PMA-2 to await the astronauts. Power and data cables needed by the IDA were routed out to the docking port during three spacewalks dating back to February 2015. Once in position, firmly anchored in foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will attach tethers to the IDA and connect cables providing power to internal heaters, sensors and the latching mechanism that will lock it to PMA-2. The spacewalkers then will help guide the IDA into place so Onishi, using a control panel inside the station, can command the latches to engage, locking the docking mechanism to the end of the PMA. The spacewalkers then will complete work with various jumpers and cables, cover up reflectors once used by approaching shuttle crews to help determine distance and relative velocity and install others designed for use by CST-100 and crew Dragon spacecraft. With the IDA in place, Williams will route ethernet cables needed by a future Russian module while Rubins routes a final set of cables to the top of Harmony where IDA-3 will eventually be attached. She then will assist Williams. If time is available, the spacewalkers will tie down the brake handle on an equipment cart attached to rails on the forward side of the station’s solar power truss and carry out a photo survey of a physics instrument known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Assuming no major problems develop, the astronauts will venture back outside on Sept. 1 to retract an unneeded solar array cooling radiator that was extended in 2012 as part of troubleshooting to locate a coolant leak. They also plan to install an HD television camera on the station’s truss, replace a light and inspect struts associated with a large mechanism that allows outboard solar arrays to rotate. At least two more spacewalks had been planned before the end of the year to install a replacement set of solar array batteries. But launch of the batteries aboard a Japanese HTV cargo ship, originally planned for Sept. 30, is on indefinite hold pending work to fix a leak in the vehicle’s propulsion system. Onishi and astronaut Shane Kimbrough, who is scheduled for launch to the station Sept. 23, originally planned to carry out the battery swap out in October. But that EVA almost certainly will be delayed past Oct. 30 when Onishi, Rubins and Soyuz commander Anatoly Ivanishin are scheduled to return to Earth. As of this writing, it’s not known when the HTV might be ready for launch or when the battery spacewalk might be carried out. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines each have recently announced plans to reduce capacity this winter because of the Brexit vote to leave the European Union. American and its partner British Airways speak regularly about schedules, President Scott Kirby said. But multiple factors contribute to the demand for tickets in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, he said. “I don’t think we’ve said anything about what we’re going to do in the U.K.,” Kirby told stock analysts and reporters on a conference call to discuss second-quarter earnings. “I haven’t said anything.” Revenue on seat-capacityavailable to Europe dropped 6% during April, May and June, compared to a year earlier, Kirby said. A double-digit decline Europe is expected in the third quarter, he added. BOOKMARK: Go directly to the Today in the Sky homepage USA TODAY Will this TSA checkpoint test cut wait times at American's hubs? But he pointed to broader factors for European demand beyond Brexit,saying terror incidents, the overall economy and more competition from rival airlines each contribute to the decline. “We do expect Europe to get worse,” Kirby said. “There’s a lot of things that could be driving it and it’s probably all of the above.” Speaking specifically about the United Kingdom, Kirby noted three major variables from the Brexit vote: currency, direct impact on flights and general confidence in the economy. American Airlines planes parked at Miami International Airport.  (Photo: Alan Diaz, AP) The British pound dropped substantially after the vote, which Kirby said “is a pretty clear negative.” American gets 4% of its revenue in pounds. But Kirby said the direct impact of people flying could actually increase as bankers, consultants and other fly more frequently during the two years or more while sorting out how the exit will work. “The direct impact I think will be positive,” Kirby said. The broader concern is if general confidence in the economy declined because the first budget item that businesses cut is travel, Kirby said. But the U.S. stock market bounced back after two days down from the Brexit vote. “I think for the next few year at least, there is not going to be much impact from Brexit,” Kirby said. “Hard to see any evidence that it’s a big problem.” USA TODAY American adds spending threshold for elite-status qualifying The reaction came after Delta and United officials described currency concerns and capacity reductions this winter from less leisure travel originating in Britain. Delta President Glen Hauenstein said the 12% decline in the currency cost the airline about $40 million in currency exchange. Diminished leisure travel from the U.K. to destinations such as Florida, Las Vegas and New York prompted plans to cut capacity on U.S.-U.K. routes by 2% this winter, he said. Jim Compton, United’s chief revenue officer, said winter flights from Washington Dulles to Manchester would be reduced and flights from Dulles to Heathrow would switch to smaller planes.In addition, United will reduce flights from Newark to Birmingham from six to four per week, he said.

Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) 03 August, 2016 00:00 - - - - print email Comments Boeing's decision to run its aviation analytics applications on the Azure cloud computing software is a big win for Microsoft, which is chasing Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the high-stakes race to sell computing, storage and other infrastructure software over the internet. The aerospace giant based its choice largely on Microsoft’s willingness to help it develop applications to serve its 300 airline customers, which are starved for ways to optimize fuel efficiency and better manage fleets. "The combination of technical acumen and depth, as well as where they're investing and how they're addressing the business customer, really matched up with our objectives," says Andrew Gendreau, director of advanced information solutions at Boeing's digital aviation unit. He tells CIO.com that Microsoft also impressed with its commitment to advancing its Cortana analytics and internet of things suites as well as augmented reality, which could play a big factor modeling aviation modeling. [ Related: Google Glass takes flight at Boeing ] That even a division within a large enterprise would standardize on Azure shows just how far the platform has come in a few years. AWS grabbed an early lead in corporate cloud infrastructure a decade ago as developers began consuming its elastic storage and compute services. With AWS proving reliable and cost-effective, developers sung AWS' praises, boasting that the capability to spin up and shut down servers at will made application development more nimble. AWS soon began attracting larger corporate customers, notably Netflix, Capital One, Pfizer and the CIA. Boeing deal shows Microsoft no longer 'bumbling around' Azure has come on strong under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, whose mobile first, cloud first strategy is resonating with CIOs. Pattonair CIO Brian Long recently told CIO.com that CIOs have noticed how Microsoft has "gotten its act together," entering the mobile and cloud frays after a few years of "bumbling around." Boeing's digital aviation unit chose Azure after using AWS, CenturyLink and other vendors. Gendreau acknowledges that while there are "players that accelerate your business" most cloud providers offer point solutions, which can introduce complexity in Boeing customer's aircraft systems. Conversely, Microsoft is willing to work closely with organizations to understand their business objectives and provide more comprehensive software suites. [ Related: First look: Microsoft Azure Stack hits the ground running ] Greg Jones, Microsoft’s global industry director for travel. Gendreau says Microsoft will help Boeing generate analytics that enable predictive aircraft maintenance, optimize fuel efficiency and fleet management in an industry where margins are razor thin. While airlines globally generate about $700 billion in revenue, they spend about $700 billion in operating costs, Gendreau says. Ensuring access to real-time machine information will assist pilots, mechanics, dispatchers and flight attendants in making flying more efficient. Ideally, this will help airlines sustain profitable growth. "The aircraft are becoming smarter and smarter and the operators are all looking to gain more operational insights into what's happening on the aircraft," says Greg Jones, Microsoft’s global industry director for travel. "This is a true opportunity to look at what transformation can occur within the aviation space." Several smaller organizations, from native cloud companies such as Box to the nearly 200-year-old publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are using Azure. Yet if Microsoft is going to challenge AWS it needs more marquee enterprise customers like Boeing and General Electric, which earlier this month said that its Predix IoT platform would run on Azure. In AWS, Microsoft faces stiff test Ed Anderson, a Gartner analyst who tracks the cloud computing market, says Microsoft’s recent enterprise wins underscores how traditional businesses such as GE and Boeing are adopting progressive computing approaches, including cloud, IoT and machine intelligence. “The fact that Boeing announced this with Microsoft rather than with AWS shows some traction that Microsoft is gaining,” says Anderson. “It’s very important for Microsoft to win deals like this.” AWS played a major role in driving Amazon.com's profitable second quarter Thursday, reporting revenue of $2.87 billion, up 58 percent from the same period in 2015 and the most it ever delivered in one quarter. If AWS keeps up the pace, it will easily exceed the $10 billion run rate CEO Jeff Bezos foreshadowed for 2016. And there's no signs of slippage: Salesforce.com selected AWS as its preferred public cloud infrastructure provider and Kellogg’s, Brooks Brothers, Ferrara Candy Company are all running critical SAP business applications on AWS. Microsoft’s cloud business is on a bit of a tear itself. The company said earlier this month that its fourth-quarter revenue from Azure grew 102 percent, while Azure compute usage doubled year-over-year. Its Intelligent Cloud, which includes server Windows Server and Azure, grew 7 percent to $6.7 billion. More broadly, Microsoft’s commercial cloud business, which includes Azure, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics CRM, achieved a $12 billion run rate, up from $10 billion in its previous quarter. However, Microsoft’s accounting practices – it declines to disclose revenues for Azure alone -- make apples-to-apples comparisons between Azure and AWS impossible. Anderson says that while Microsoft’s enterprise reach goes deep, particularly with businesses that use .NET applications and that have inked enterprise agreements, AWS enjoys the pole position in the public cloud market. As such,Anderson says, Microsoft “must go the extra mile to attract some of these big deals.” Brand Post Predicts 2016 - Algorithms Take Digital Business to the Next Level More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The milestone marks yet another record for ANA as it becomes the world’s first airline to operate 50 787 Dreamliners. “The 787 Dreamliner has played a significant role in opening up new routes into new markets, while also forming the backbone of our long-haul fleet,” said Osamu Shinobe, president and CEO, ANA. “As the launch customer of the 787 Dreamliner family, we are proud to welcome the 50th 787 Dreamliner into our fleet, where it will continue to serve our passengers with the most innovative and memorable flying experience.” As part of efforts to expand its global network, ANA also announced plans to launch new routes from Tokyo, Narita to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in September this year and Mexico City, Mexico in February next year using 787 Dreamliners. ANA became the launch customer of the 787 when it purchased 50 in 2004, and was the first to bring the airplane into service in 2011. The airline operates more than 11 percent of all 787s around the world today and has flown an estimated 125,000 flights with the Dreamliner. “As the launch customer of the 787 and our largest 787 customer, we are honored to celebrate this important milestone with ANA,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “ANA is a valued Boeing customer and has been a vital partner on this program. Today’s event demonstrates the strength of our enduring relationship and we look forward to introducing the 787-10 to ANA in the coming years to complete the entire family of 787 Dreamliners in their fleet.” Already the world’s largest Dreamliner operator, ANA has an additional 33 787s on order, including the longest and newest member of the family, the 787-10. The airline also has 20 777-9 airplanes on order. ANA recently showcased its 50th 787 Dreamliner at the Farnborough International Airshow, performing high-performance demonstration flights for thousands in attendance and wowing millions of fans around the world on the internet. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an all-new, super-efficient family of airplanes that brings the speed and range of big jets to the middle of the market. Boeing designed the 787 family with superior efficiency, allowing airlines to open new routes profitably and fly directly where passengers wish in exceptional comfort. Since entering service in 2011, the 787 has flown more than 109 million passengers on more than 500 routes around the world, including more than 120 new nonstop routes made possible through its efficiency.

Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation (RSC) Energia and the US aircraft manufacturing company Boeing reached an agreement to solve dispute over the Sea Launch project, Energia's General Director Vladimir Solntsev said Thursday. MOSCOW (Sputnik) — In 2015, US District Court for the Central District of California awarded Boeing a multimillion compensation from its former partners under the Sea Launch, including Energia, following the bankruptcy procedure. Energia and its Ukrainian counterpart Yuzhnoe claimed that Boeing had given unwritten assurances to its Sea Launch partners that it would not seek reimbursements. "We have signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing to settle a dispute on 'Sea Launch,' in that context a court in the United States suspended all the activities to collect debts. Before the end of the year we are planning to sign a final agreement with Boeing, which should stipulate conditions of the [dispute's] settlement," Solntsev said, as quoted by the Russian Izvestia newspaper. © Photo: Roscosmos Russian Scientists Developing 3D Bioprinter for Space UseHe added that Energia and Boeing had already evolved a program of long-term cooperation, which included projects of far space exploration. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator – the best possible location for launch – which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-percent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia. ...

BUSINESS Say hello to underwater drones: The Pentagon is looking to extend its robot fighting forces Boeing Echo Voyager Boeing The 51-foot Boeing Echo Voyager is an unmanned undersea vehicle intended to roam the ocean for weeks or months. The 51-foot Boeing Echo Voyager is an unmanned undersea vehicle intended to roam the ocean for weeks or months. (Boeing) Samantha Masunaga This fall, an unusual vessel will begin sea trials off the coast of California. The 51-foot-long Boeing Echo Voyager will have no crew. It will glide underwater for days or weeks, quietly collecting data from the ocean floor to send back to crews on ships or on land. Ever since the start of the war in Afghanistan in 2001, the U.S. military has relied more and more on flying drones to take on dangerous air missions. But increasingly, drones are taking to the sea as well. The U.S. Navy has proposed about $319 million for the development and purchase of underwater drones in the president’s budget for the coming fiscal year. It envisions them stealthily gathering intelligence on opponents, detecting and neutralizing mines, hunting submarines and charting the ocean floor. Last year, the Navy created the first deputy assistant secretary position focused on managing the development of unmanned systems, including underwater, surface and aerial efforts. Recent advances in autonomy, data transmission and miniaturizing computing power coincide with the military’s increased interest in finding ways to integrate unmanned systems into its war planning.

In this video produced by Liquid Robotics, the company shows how its Wave Glider unmanned surface vehicle works. See more videos It’s part of a much broader strategy to leverage artificial intelligence and stay one step ahead of rivals, as the Pentagon did with guided weapons in the 1990s. “As tensions continue to grow with China and Russia, two militaries that have sophisticated and very large navies, there is a growing interest in making use of unmanned technology in the maritime sphere,” said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. “They are scalable, they are dependable, they can operate with a fairly high degree of autonomy,” he said. “All these things would have been useful 30 years ago, but the technology wasn’t quite there.” The potential for naval drones to operate free of human operators was shown earlier this year when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, unveiled its Sea Hunter, a largely autonomous, unmanned anti-submarine vessel. The prototype, 132-foot-long Sea Hunter is designed to sail on its own for up to three months, find a submarine using sonar and other sensors, and trail it while sending location data back to human operators. The vessel completed its first performance trials off San Diego in late July, according to its builder, Reston, Va.-based Leidos. Underwater drones face different challenges than their aerial counterparts. For one, communication is more difficult, making it hard for an autonomous vehicle to report information it might pick up underwater. That hurdle is being worked on by Liquid Robotics, a Sunnyvale firm that makes the Wave Glider. The unmanned vehicle floats on the surface and uses wave and solar power to propel itself and its sensors for up to a year. The surfboard-shaped drone functions as a kind of gateway between underwater acoustic communications and air-based radio transmissions. The vehicle’s sensor computer connects a surface radio modem and antenna with an underwater acoustic modem, allowing information to be transmitted quickly back and forth. How a $2.7 billion blimp system became a 'zombie' programOpen link The same connection can be established with ships, though that can be expensive, or with buoys, which don’t allow for much movement. Other underwater vehicles have towed long antennas, but that is a much slower method of transmitting data, said Graham Hine, senior vice president of global partner development at Liquid Robotics. “We’re thinking it would be the router of the ocean,” he said. “Once you start to network things and then have ubiquitous communications and positioning, things start to get interesting.” The Wave Glider can carry a range of acoustic sensors that listen for vessels on the sea or piece together a picture of the ocean floor. Originally developed by company co-founders Roger Hine and Joseph Rizzi to listen to whale songs, the Wave Glider caught the interest of the Navy, which has worked with the company since 2008, Graham Hine said. Two years ago, the company struck a partnership with Boeing Co. to develop a military version, the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft, or SHARC, that combines the Wave Glider platform with Boeing’s sensor technology. Boeing sees the platform as a potential communication conduit between underwater vehicles and aircraft, ships or satellites. It is working with the Navy’s research lab to develop additional capabilities for SHARC. “Ultimately, it is a more efficient and effective way to do maritime surveillance, we think, in large ocean areas,” said Egan Greenstein, senior director of autonomous maritime systems at Boeing.

President-elect Trump released his first extended remarks since the election in a YouTube video, an Orange County health network is putting doctors in grocery stores, the range and scope of Donald Trump’s business interests are unprecedented, and Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week. But to do a thorough job of surveillance and undersea data collection, drones need to stay submerged for weeks or even months without external help or power.  Boeing experienced this challenge first-hand when it used its Echo Ranger unmanned underwater vehicle for oil and gas surveying. The drone charged up and reported its status at a host ship, but when storms blew in all operations had to stop. Eventually, Boeing stopped using the Ranger for that kind of commercial work. “It was profitable while we were out doing the survey missions,” said Dan Tubbs, deputy director of Sea & Land at Boeing Phantom Works in Huntington Beach. “It was not profitable when it was in port all the time.” In March, Boeing unveiled the 50-ton Echo Voyager, which is designed to carry out months-long surveillance and reconnaissance missions for defense, commercial and scientific customers. Powered by a hybrid electric-battery/marine diesel system, the drone periodically surfaces to snorkel depth to recharge its batteries by raising a mast and running the diesel engines. That’s when the drone also can connect to satellite operations to transmit data to operators. It can send limited communications while submerged, but only to a nearby ship. To bolster its endurance, the Echo Voyager has backup systems. To give it a degree of autonomy, the navigation system incorporates motion and rotation sensors, as well as sonar to avoid obstacles. Autonomous systems have the potential to cut personnel costs, but developing them has proved to be complex and costly. In February, the Navy canceled further production of a remote mine-hunting system developed by Lockheed Martin Corp., cutting down the expected order from 54 to 10 that had already been delivered. The system was to be used in the Navy’s new littoral combat ships, but the autonomous vehicles that towed mine-hunting sensors were unreliable. “The autonomy side of the equation, the research is happening at a very quick pace,” said Holland Michel of Bard College. “But as you see time and time again, it’s very challenging to make unmanned systems that can make intelligent and dependable decisions on their own.” The biggest challenge to the industry’s growth could be its lack of versatility. There are simply more applications for unmanned aerial vehicles than underwater drones, especially in the commercial market, said Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan.  “I think the market will grow steadily, but it won’t be explosive like the unmanned aerial vehicle market,” he said. Eventually, though, the two drone worlds will merge. In May, AeroVironment Inc. of Monrovia announced it had a contract to sell to the Navy its small, Blackwing unmanned aircraft, a single-use drone that shoots out of a tube from submarines or autonomous undersea vehicles. It sends back data, then drops into the water once it’s done. A company spokesman said he could not comment on the size of the contract.  samantha.masunaga@latimes.com For more business news, follow me @smasunaga ALSO Video games in the Olympics?

Turkmenistan received three Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2013 and two Boeing 777-200 LR aircraft in 2014. In April 2015, Turkmenistan decided to purchase three more Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  In addition, Turkmenistan is considering the further acquisition of 50- and 100-seat aircraft for domestic flights. Currently, the Turkmenistan Airlines, in addition to domestic flights, carries out regular flights to dozens of countries. The area of the flights is constantly expanding. Thus, an intergovernmental agreement on flights was initialed between Turkmenistan and Luxembourg. In June 2015, Europe’s largest carrier, Cargolux Airlines International, started cargo flights from Luxembourg to Turkmen city of Turkmenbashi. Cargolux has been also flying to Ashgabat since June 2016. Turkmenistan also had negotiations with Turkey’s Pegasus Airlines on cooperation prospects and opening a Pegasus office in the country. Pegasus will in the near future start flights from Istanbul to Turkmenbashi. Turkmenistan is also constructing a new international airport in Ashgabat, which is designed to become a major transit hub for continental and intercontinental flights. Another international airport is being built in the city of Turkmenabat.

The plane is seen here on the runway outside Boeing's Everett Delivery Center. (Tim Stake photo)KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 19 (Bernama) -- Boeing delivered All Nippon Airways' (ANA) 50th 787 Dreamliner at a ceremony held at Boeing's Everett Delivery Center on Thursday. The milestone marked yet another record for ANA to become the world's first airline to operate 50 787 Dreamliners. "The 787 Dreamliner has played a significant role in opening up new routes into new markets, while also forming the backbone of our long-haul fleet. "As the launch customer of the 787 Dreamliner family, we are proud to welcome the 50th 787 Dreamliner into our fleet, where it will continue to serve our passengers with the most innovative and memorable flying experience," ANA President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Osamu Shinobe said in a statement. As part of efforts to expand its global network, ANA also announced plans to launch new routes from Tokyo in Narita to Phnom Penh in Cambodia in September and to Mexico City, Mexico, in February 2017, using 787 Dreamliners. ANA became the launch customer of the 787 when it purchased 50 aircraft in 2004 and was the first to bring the airplane into service in 2011. The airline currently operates more than 11 per cent of all 787s around the world and has flown an estimated 125,000 flights with the Dreamliner. "As the launch customer of the 787 and our largest 787 customer, we are honoured to celebrate this important milestone with ANA. "ANA is a valued Boeing customer and has been a vital partner on this programme. "This demonstrates the strength of our enduring relationship and we look forward to introducing the 787-10 to ANA in the coming years to complete the entire family of 787 Dreamliners in their fleet," Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner said. Already the world's largest Dreamliner operator, ANA has an additional 33 787s in Boeing's order book, including the longest and newest member of the family, the 787-10. The airline also has 20 777-9 airplanes on order. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an all-new, super-efficient family of airplanes that brings the speed and range of big jets to the middle of the market. -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Petronas Benefits From Blue Ocean Strategy Ahmad Zahid Urges UMNO Members To Close Ranks With Those Outside Party PM Wants Ministries To Prepare Detailed Plans For Budget 2017 Allocations Other News Headlines UGA 2016: Main Focus Is Sosio-economy Of Rakyat, Not Politics- politic Petronas Able To Reduce Costs With Blue Ocean Strategy, Says Chairman- business Malaysian Top Men's Doubles Pairs Advance To Second Round Of Hong Kong Open- sports EPF Ensures Better Retirment Benefits- features Nikki Haley Leads Trump's Pick For US Ambassador To UN: Report- world Most Read News Petronas Benefits From Blue Ocean Strategy Ahmad Zahid Urges UMNO Members To Close Ranks With Those Outside Party Malaysian 'Drug Mule' Serving Sentence Outside Peruvian Prison - Wisma Putra Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

Crew Access Arm Installed for Starliner Missions by Steven Siceloff for KSC News Kennedy Space Center FL (SPX) Aug 18, 2016 The 50-foot-long, 90,000-pound Crew Access Arm is hoisted off the ground to be installed on the Crew Access Tower at SLC-41. Image courtesy NASA and Kim Shiflett. Watch a video on the technology here. For a larger version of this image please go here. The Crew Access Arm for a new generation of spacecraft was lifted into place the morning of Aug. 15 at Space Launch Complex-41 where workers are modifying the launch pad to give astronauts access to Boeing's CST-100 Starliner on launch day. The 50-foot-long, 90,000-pound arm will form a bridge between the newly built Crew Access Tower and the hatch of the spacecraft. Astronauts will walk across the arm to climb inside the Starliner for flight. Poised to begin a mission, the Starliner will sit on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The arm also holds the White Room, an enclosed area big enough for astronauts to make final adjustments to their suits before climbing aboard the spacecraft. Work began around 7:30 a.m. with crews attaching cables to the arm before a crane slowly hoisted itoff the launch pad surface. Another crew of workers was waiting in the tower about 160 feet above the surface as the crane maneuvered one end of the arm into a notch on the tower. They bolted and welded the apparatus to the tower to complete the process. The addition of the arm is the latest in a rapid string of accomplishments for NASA's Commercial Crew Program and its partners. Working independently on separate contracts with NASA's program, Boeing and SpaceX are developing spacecraft and launch systems to take astronauts to the International Space Station. The additional launch capability will allow the resident crew of the station to grow by one, effectively doubling the time astronauts have in orbit to conduct science vital to spaceflight research, as well as investigations into benefits for those on Earth. "You have to stop and celebrate these moments in the craziness of all the things we do," said Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. "It's going to be so cool when our astronauts are walking out across this access arm to get on the spacecraft and go to the space station." The arm and tower have been constructed between Atlas V launches at SLC-41. The arm was built at a construction yard near NASA's Kennedy Space Center and trucked to the launch pad on Aug. 11. The tower was built in segments close to the launch pad and stacked together to form the nearly 200-foot-tall structure. It is the first new crew access structure at the Florida spaceport since the space shuttle's Fixed Service Structures were put in place before Columbia's first flight in 1981. It also is the first new crew access tower at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station since the Apollo Program. "You think about when we started building this 18 months ago and now it's one of the most visible changes to the Cape's horizon since the 1960s," said Chris Ferguson, a former shuttle commander who is now Boeing's deputy program manager for the company's Commercial Crew Program. "It's a fantastic day." The advances reminded some of the early days of human spaceflight when the first generation Atlas rockets put astronauts into orbit. "John Glenn was the first to fly on an Atlas, now our next leap into the future will be to have astronauts launch from here on Atlas V," said Barb Egan, program manager for Commercial Crew for ULA. Earth is not the only place work is underway to prepare for Commercial Crew missions. Astronauts on the International Space Station will perform a spacewalk Friday to install an International Docking Adapter to a station port that will allow visiting spacecraft including those on commercial crew missions to dock with the orbiting laboratory. Carried into orbit during the most recent cargo resupply mission, the IDA will become a doorway for astronauts as they cross from their spacecraft into the station. The adapters are outfitted with a network of sensors and fixtures that work with automated systems to dock the spacecraft to the port.

ISLAMABAD: The Boeing Company has shown interest in the conversion of Pakistan International Airlines' (PIA's) existing 777-300 ERs into the new 787 Dreamliner - an airplane with the right size, unique capabilities, and unmatched passenger experience. The interest was shown in a letter written by Boeing's Commercial Airlines Vice Chairman, President and CEO Ray Conner to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, according to statement issued by the PM's Office on Wednesday. According to reports, driven by the recent race in Pakistan's aviation market particularly after the launch of the Premier Service on Independence Day, the Boeing has shown keen interest in transforming the PIA's operations in order to help restore its profits. The Boeing has had a long relationship with PIA, dating back to the 1960s that continues today with the Boeing 777. The Boeing Company president expressed the views that they see a viable opportunity to convert the PIA's existing 777-300 ERs into the new 787 Dreamliner, which will help PIA expanding its Premium Service into Europe and the heart of Asia The Boeing president urged the prime minister to work with the company to complete the substitution process, enabling PIA to operate the most technologically advanced aircraft in the world. The Boeing is vested in the success of the PIA and assures its fullest support in this regard, Ray Conner reiterated. The prime minister has directed the quarters concerned to consider the proposal within the legal framework in vogue. He said the steps taken by the government for uplifting the national flag carrier have started yielding benefits as well as immense opportunities for reviving the glory of PIA that used to be one of the best airlines in the world. The offer from the leading companies like the Boeing, that has a historical track record, is a testimony to our endeavors in making PIA one of the best airlines in the world, the prime minister said.  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Less than five years after Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA) took delivery of the first 787 Dreamliner, the airline on Wednesday accepted its 50th. While Boeing last week cited “softness” in the widebody-jet market and lowered expectations about near-term demand for the 787, ANA’s milestone allowed the jet maker to celebrate the success of the Dreamliner in passenger service. Hideki Kunugi, senior vice president of ANA Americas, said the airplane’s fuel efficiency — 20 percent better than the 767 it replaced — is today saving the airline about $98 million per year. “The 787 plays a vital role” in the airline’s plans to expand its international network, he said.

The economics of the midsize, long-range jet have allowed ANA to open up long-haul routes not only to giant hubs like New York and Los Angeles but also to mid-size cities. Hence its nonstop flights from Tokyo to Düsseldorf, Germany, and Brussels, as well as Seattle and San Jose, Calif. “Without the Dreamliner, Seattle and San Jose would not be possible,” Kunugi said. To get to this point, ANA suffered through a turbulent early ride. After working closely with Boeing on the design of the airplane, then giving the jet maker its launch order in 2004, ANA got its first delivery in September 2011 — three years and four months late. Just over a year after the jet entered service, a main battery started smoking aboard one of ANA’s planes in flight, and the airline endured with all other 787 operators the grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet for more than three months. But the battery problem was fixed, and Boeing has now delivered 447 Dreamliners to 39 airlines. As of July, more than 108 million passengers have flown on more than 569,000 Dreamliner flights. Opening new routes ANA now flies the 787 on 40 percent of its international routes, and it plans to open more routes to previously unserved destinations. In September, it will introduce the 787 between Tokyo and Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Next February, it will fly the jet nonstop between Tokyo an Mexico City, which on the northbound leg takes more than 14 hours. Kunugi said the opening up of Mexico City “is only possible thanks to the 787, which can operate such long-haul routes with greater comfort and efficiency than any other aircraft.” The airline sees this route as “a first very important step” to expanding connections to Central and South America. Last week, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith — citing the marked lack of orders in the widebody-jet market recently — for the first time publicly admitted that Boeing may not increase the 787 production rate from its current 12 jets per month to the planned 14 per month toward the end of the decade. At the delivery ceremony Wednesday, Boeing’s senior vice president of sales for northeast Asia, Ihssane Mounir, said that despite the general softness in demand, China remains a bright spot that offers hope of buoyant future sales. “China will continue to drive the demand,” he said. “I’m not seeing any signs of weakness whatsoever.” ANA has 33 more Dreamliners on order, including three of the largest model, the 787-10, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018. It anticipates 40 percent growth in revenue from its international routes during the next four years, in an expansion leading up to and preparing for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. The plane delivered to ANA on Wednesday is the 787-9 that Boeing test pilots flew last month in the daily aerial displays at the Farnborough Air Show in England.

As per the original plan, Jet was expected to receive the first of the ten Boeing 787 on order from last quarter of 2017 but now the airline management has pushed back the induction. "At Jet Airways we continuously review our fleet and network strategy. We are currently upgrading capacity on key international routes by deploying the six Boeing 777 aircraft which are returning from lease. A decision on the induction of additional wide body aircraft will be based on the outcome of the review," a Jet Airways spokesperson said in an emailed response. The spokesperson did not state when the airline will start receiving the 787s but a source indicated it is likely to receive them from 2019. A Boeing spokesperson did not immediately respond to the query on the topic. Jet Airways ordered ten Boeing 787 aircraft in 2006. Its original order was for the 787-8 varaint (flown by Air India) but later the airline converted it to the bigger variant (787-9) which has a longer range and higher seat capacity (290 in a standard two class configuration). The 787-9 has a list price of $ 264.6 million. Jet Airways has 116 aircraft including a mix of narrow body 737s, wide bodies Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s and turboprop ATR-42 aircraft. Recently it announced deployment of the Boeing 777 aircraft on Amsterdam, Dubai and Singapore routes following return of leased planes from Etihad. Three A330s are on lease with Turkish Airlines and will return to Jet in 2020. Jet Airways has 75 Boeing 737s Max on order due for delivery in 2018 and currently most of its capacity enhancement has been through improved better utilisation. While rival IndiGo plans to add 24 Airbus A320 aircraft in the current fiscal, Jet Airways has no additional 737 planes entering its service this year. As such its passenger growth is slower than IndiGo and its market share too fell 2.1 percentage points to 19.1 in June on a year on year basis. The airline posted its fifth consecutive profit in Q1 FY 17 but profit fell 44 per cent to Rs 126 crore on a year on year basis as it was impacted by decline in yields. Analysts say Jet Airways' fleet requirements have always been constrained due to its limited long distance international network and the airline has been leasing bulk of its Boeing 777 planes to foreign airlines since 2009. "It would behoove Jet to replace their ageing Boeing 777 fleet with the fuel efficient long range 787-9s before the aircraft lose their market value like the Airbus 330-200s," said Devesh Agarwal, editor of aviation blog Bangalore Aviation.   Aneesh Phadnis Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 7 Indian companies among top 200 carbon clean firms Business Standard Jet Airways defers Boeing 787 induction According to a source, the airline will start receiving the 787s from 2019 Aneesh Phadnis  |  Mumbai  August 18, 2016 Last Updated at 00:40 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com CAPE CANAVERAL AIR FORCE STATION, FL — A new ‘Stairway to Heaven’ which American astronauts will soon stride along as “the last place on Earth” departure point aboard our next generation of human spaceships, was at long last hoisted into place at the ULA Atlas rocket launch pad on Florida’s Space Coast on Monday Aug 15, at an “awesome” media event witnessed by space journalists including Universe Today. “This is awesome,” Chris Ferguson, a former shuttle commander who is now Boeing’s deputy program manager for the company’s Commercial Crew Program told Universe Today in an exclusive interview at the launch pad – after workers finished installing the spanking new Crew Access Arm walkway for astronauts leading to the hatch of Boeing’s Starliner ‘Space Taxi.’ Starliner will ferry crews to and from the International Space Station (ISS) as soon as 2018. “It’s great to see the arm up there,” Ferguson elaborated to Universe Today. “I know it’s probably a small part of the overall access tower. But it’s the most significant part!” “We used to joke about the 195 foot level on the shuttle pad as being ‘the last place on Earth.” “This will now be the new ‘last place on Earth’! So we are pretty charged up about it!” Ferguson gushed. Up close view of Boeing Starliner Crew Access Arm and White Room craned into place at Crew Access Tower at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Space Launch Complex 41 on Aug. 15, 2016. Credit: Dawn Leek Taylor Under hot sunny skies portending the upcoming restoration of America’s ability to once again launch American astronauts from American soil when American rockets ignite, the newly constructed 50-foot-long, 90,000-pound ‘Crew Access Arm and White Room’ was lifted and mated to the newly built ‘Crew Access Tower’ at Space Launch Complex-41 (SLC-41) on Monday morning, Aug. 15. “We talked about how the skyline is changing here and this is one of the more visible changes.” The Boeing CST-100 Starliner crew capsule stacked atop the venerable United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket at pad 41 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida will launch crews to the massive orbiting science outpost continuously soaring some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Space workers, enthusiasts and dreamers alike have been waiting years for this momentous day to happen. And I was thrilled to observe all the action firsthand along with the people who made it happen from NASA, United Launch Alliance, Boeing, the contractors – as well as to experience it with my space media colleagues. “All the elements that we talked about the last few years are now reality,” Ferguson told me. The Crew Access Arm and White Room for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft approaches the notch for mating to the Crew Access Tower at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Space Launch Complex 41 at level 13 on Aug. 15, 2016, as workers observe from upper tower level. Astronauts will walk through the arm to board the Starliner spacecraft stacked atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com Attaching the access arm is vital and visual proof that at long last America means business and that a renaissance in human spaceflight will commence in some 18 months or less when commercially built American crew capsules from Boeing and SpaceX take flight to the heavens above – and a new space era of regular, robust and lower cost space flights begins. It took about an hour for workers to delicately hoist the gleaming grey steel and aluminum white ‘Stairway to Heaven’ by crane into place at the top of the tower – at one of the busiest launch pads in the world! It’s about 130 feet above the pad surface since it’s located at the 13th level of the tower. The install work began at about 7:30 a.m. EDT as we watched a work crew lower a giant grappling hook and attach cables. Then they carefully raised the arm off the launch pad surface by crane. The arm had been trucked to the launch pad on Aug. 11. The tower itself is comprised of segmented tiers that were built in segments just south of the pad. They were stacked on the pad over the past few months – in between launches. Altogether they form a nearly 200-foot-tall steel structure. Another crew stationed in the tower about 160 feet above ground waited as the arm was delicately craned into the designated notch. The workers then spent several more hours methodically bolting and welding the arm to the tower to finish the assembly process. Indeed Monday’s installation of the Crew Access Arm and White Room at pad 41 basically completes the construction of the first new Crew Access Tower at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station since the Apollo moon landing era of the 1960s. “It is the first new crew access structure at the Florida spaceport since the space shuttle’s Fixed Service Structures were put in place before Columbia’s first flight in 1981,” say NASA officials. Overall the steel frame of the massive tower weighs over a million pounds. For perspective, destination ISS now weighs in at about a million pounds in low Earth orbit. Construction of the tower began about 18 months ago. “You think about when we started building this 18 months ago and now it’s one of the most visible changes to the Cape’s horizon since the 1960s,” said Ferguson at Monday’s momentous media event. “It’s a fantastic day.” The White Room is an enclosed area at the end of the Crew Access Arm. It big enough for astronauts to make final adjustments to their suits and is spacious enough for technicians to assist the astronauts climbing aboard the spacecraft and get tucked into their seats in the final hours before liftoff. “You have to stop and celebrate these moments in the craziness of all the things we do,” said Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, at the event. “It’s going to be so cool when our astronauts are walking out across this access arm to get on the spacecraft and go to the space station.” The Crew Access Arm was built by Saur at NASA’s nearby off site facility at Oak Hill. And when Starliner takes flight it will hearken back to the dawn of the Space Age. “John Glenn was the first to fly on an Atlas, now our next leap into the future will be to have astronauts launch from here on Atlas V,” said Barb Egan, program manager for Commercial Crew for ULA.

Credit: Ken Kremer/kenkremer.com The Boeing CST 100 Starliner is one of two private astronaut capsules – along with the SpaceX Crew Dragon – being developed under a CCP commercial partnership contract with NASA to end our sole reliance on Russia for crew launches back and forth to the International Space Station (ISS). The goal of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program since its inception in 2010 is to restore America’s capability to launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil to the ISS, as soon as possible. Furthermore when the Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon become operational the permanent resident ISS crew will grow to 7 – enabling a doubling of science output aboard the science laboratory. This significant growth in research capabilities will invaluably assist NASA in testing technologies and human endurance in its agency wide goal of sending humans on a ‘Journey to Mars’ by the 2030s with the mammoth Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion deep space capsule concurrently under full scale development by the agency. The next key SLS milestone is a trest firing of the RS-25 main engines at NASA Stennis this Thursday, Aug. 18 – watch for my onsite reports! Boeing was awarded a $4.2 Billion contract in September 2014 by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden to complete development and manufacture of the CST-100 Starliner space taxi under the agency’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) program and NASA’s Launch America initiative. Since the retirement of NASA’s space shuttle program in 2011, the US was been 100% dependent on the Russian Soyuz capsule for astronauts rides to the ISS at a cost exceeding $70 million per seat. When will Ferguson actually set foot inside the walkway? “I am hoping to get up there and walk through there in a couple of weeks or so when it’s all strapped in and done. I want to see how they are doing and walk around.” How does the White Room fit around Starliner and keep it climate controlled? “The end of the white room has a part that slides up and down and moves over and slides on top of the spacecraft when it’s in place.” “There is an inflatable seal that forms the final seal to the spacecraft so that you have all the appropriate humidity control and the purge without the Florida atmosphere inside the crew module,” Ferguson replied. Up close, mid-air view of Crew Access Arm and front of White Room during installation.

The Atlas will be augmented with two solid rocket motors on the first stage and a dual engine Centaur upper stage. How confident is Ferguson about meeting the 2018 launch target? “The first crew flight is scheduled for February 2018. I am confident.” Ferguson responded. “And we have a lot of qualification to get through between now and then.

YouTube NASA Johnson By Avery Thompson Aug 17, 2016 Starting in 2017, Boeing and SpaceX will become the first private companies to send NASA astronauts into orbit. When that happens, the International Space Station is going to need a new space parking space. So, on Friday, astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will venture outside the ISS to finish installing a new docking adapter. Installing these adapters is a necessary step in NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which seeks to spur development of commercial crew spacecraft. Since the space shuttle was discontinued in 2011, NASA has had to pay Russia million to take its astronauts to the ISS. The Commercial Crew Program will give NASA cheaper options in crewed spaceflight.

There's more to buying a Dow dividend stock than just focusing on yield. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Aug 17, 2016 at 12:44PM Image source: Getty Images. Dividend investors look to maximize their income, and the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) are a natural starting point for those seeking high-quality companies with solid histories of dividend payments. Below, you'll see the 10 current top-yielding Dow dividend stocks; but the bigger question you need to answer is whether they have the right mix of future growth to go along with their proven track record of dividend success. The 10 highest dividend yields in the Dow Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow as of Aug. 17: Stock Dividend Yield Verizon (NYSE:VZ) 4.4% Chevron (NYSE:CVX) 4.2% Caterpillar 3.7% Pfizer 3.6% IBM 3.6% Cisco Systems 3.6% Boeing (NYSE:BA) 3.6% ExxonMobil 3.5% Coca-Cola 3.3% McDonald's 3.2% Data source: Yahoo! Finance. There are a couple of things you can see at first glance looking at this list. First, the telecom industry has sustained its reputation for paying healthy dividends, with Verizon topping the chart. Even after the replacement of AT&T as a former Dow component, the healthy cash flow that Verizon and its telecom peers produce make the sector a popular one for dividend investors. Some smaller telecoms pay even higher yields, but Verizon has done a good job of balancing its dedication to shareholders against the need to reinvest in building out its wireless network infrastructure to stay ahead of its competition. Verizon has generated impressive double-digit average annual returns for shareholders over the long haul, and its dividend has played a key element in adding to the stock's overall total return. Also, the Dow dividend list is full of stocks that have struggled recently. The most obvious area in turmoil is the energy sector, where crude oil prices have plunged from triple-digit levels a couple of years ago to below $50 per barrel currently. That has created challenges for energy companies like Dow components Chevron and ExxonMobil, and Chevron, in particular, has had to work hard in order to pick up the slack from weak oil and natural gas prices. Still, the company has managed to find lucrative sources for future production, and the healthy dividend has helped give investors greater confidence about Chevron's long-term ability to stay profitable, even if oil prices don't recover fully in the near term. Similarly, Caterpillar has suffered from a poor environment in commodities, and IBM and Cisco are both having to reorient themselves to a mobile-driven world in which PCs play a less-vital role. One industry where growth is flying higher Perhaps the most-surprising entrant on this list is Boeing, which is going through one of the best periods in its history. The commercial aerospace industry has been on fire for several years now, and consolidation among major airlines has helped them find profits that they've used to upgrade their fleets, and make massive orders for new aircraft from Boeing and rival Airbus. Skeptics will point to Boeing's most-recent earnings report, in which the aircraft manufacturer took massive one-time charges that caused it to report a loss for the quarter. Out of a total of $3 billion in pre-tax charges, $1 billion was related to decisions not to try to sell two early production 787 Dreamliner aircraft, while others came from cutting its 747 production projections, and from cost overruns related to its KC-46 Pegasus military tanker aircraft. However, even though earnings guidance for the full year fell because of the charges, Boeing actually expects better operational results than it previously did once you adjust for those charges. Strong margins have helped bolster profitability, and orders for the always-popular 737 model line are offsetting weakness in the wider-body 777 and 787 models. As long as airlines remain profitable -- and they show few signs of losing their profitability in the near future -- then Boeing should be able to capitalize on strong demand from its customers. It's always tempting simply to pick top-yielding stocks without further examination. But looking beyond the yield to examine growth prospects can save you from costly mistakes. Although dividend investors are hoping for further share-price bounces from Chevron, Caterpillar, and other Dow stocks that have seen their businesses affected by recent macroeconomic woes, Boeing has the history of success that has it at the top of its game right now.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 17, 2016 at 10:47AM The Pentagon wants to put a new GPS satellite in space -- and must pick between SpaceX and United Launch Alliance to Get it there. IMAGE SOURCE: Getty Images. Whom would you bet on: David, or Goliath? SpaceX, or Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)? At long last, the U.S. Air Force hopes to put these two contenders -- SpaceX in the role of David, and Boeing and Lockheed's United Launch Alliance wearing Goliath's sandals -- in a head-to-head competition next month. As announced earlier this month, the USAF has just issued a request for proposals to launch its next GPS III communications satellite into orbit. And unlike the last time one of these contracts went up for bid, both SpaceX and ULA are expected to compete. A bit of history Historically, the launching of "national security" payloads -- large, expensive, complex and sensitive satellites crucial to the military's ability to operate globally -- has been the domain of ULA, and for good reason. As the Air Force remarked in its announcement, "under the previous phase 1 strategy, United Launch Alliance (ULA) was the only certified launch provider." (Emphasis added.) That changed in May 2015, however, when the Air Force certified SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle as capable to launch these payloads. This decision opened up contracts for the next nine  GPS III launches to competitive bidding by both ULA and SpaceX. Or at least it should have. In fact, because of a legislative quirk that temporarily restricted ULA's ability to use Russian-made rocket engines on national security launches, ULA declared itself unable to bid on the first GPS III delivery in the series. SpaceX then handily beat out the only other bidder (to this date, still unidentified) on the contract. What's more, it wasn't even a close decision. The Air Force reportedly marveled  at SpaceX's bid of $82.7 million to launch the satellite, a bid that was apparently "40% less" than the Air Force had expected to pay. Once more, with feeling In contrast to the last round, both SpaceX and ULA are expected to bid on GPS III this time. And this sets up a real cage match of a contract showdown. In one corner stands SpaceX, the Wal-Mart of space launch, offering "always low prices" to its customers -- with the added excitement of not knowing if the launch will turn into a spectacular fireball. In the other corner is ULA, which has conducted at least 109 straight space launches without mishap -- and may have hit 110 by the time you read this. (ULA has another launch scheduled for Friday, August 19 ). If SpaceX's challenge is establishing a long record of success in a short period of time, then ULA's Achilles' heel is price. By its own admission, ULA is incapable of launching a satellite into orbit for anything less than $164 million -- twice SpaceX's price. According to the Air Force, it's going to pick a winner while seeking "a balance between mission success/operational needs, and lowering launch costs." But in the end, the choice must still come down to picking ULA for its reliability, or SpaceX for its low price. Inflection point If ULA wins this contest, it will mean price is not dispositive in the Air Force's decision-making -- or at the very least, that the Air Force wants to wait and see SpaceX execute its first GPS contract (launch window: May 2018), before risking a switch from proven provider ULA. On the other hand, if the Air Force goes ahead and picks SpaceX this time, then the situation for ULA starts looking really grim, really fast. This would mean that price is the deciding factor. And if SpaceX starts developing a record of success with Air Force launches, that will remove any valid reason to award future contracts to ULA, unless it can find a way to drastically reduce launch costs. That could force United Launch Alliance out of the military space launch business, and deal a serious blow to the profitability of both Boeing's and Lockheed Martin's space divisions. One way or the other, we should know the answer soon. Both companies' bids are due by Sept. 19, with the Air Force's decision to follow shortly thereafter.

Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Aug 17, 2016 at 8:20AM Image source: Getty Images With literally thousands of options from which to choose, it can be an intimidating task for new investors to sift through all the intriguing businesses our stock market has to offer. But finding the best stocks doesn't have to be daunting. To help get the ball rolling, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to each pick a cheap stock they believe could serve as a starting point for rookie investors to build their portfolios. A bargain biotech for the long haul Todd Campbell: It may be tempting to invest in that speculative biotech with the early-stage game changer, but a better way for new investors to dip their toes into this complex industry is to focus on bellwethers with a been-there-done-that pedigree. Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) record of developing and launching billion-dollar blockbuster medicine is envy-inspiring, and given that sales are roughly $30 billion and the coffers are stuffed with $24.6 billion in cash, there's plenty of financial firepower handy to advance new drugs to market. The company makes its money selling market-share-leading therapies for HIV and hepatitis C, and new medicines in those indications are likely to keep them atop the podium. In the pipeline, the company's got intriguing drugs targeting multibillion-dollar indications, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, an increasingly common cause of liver failure, and rheumatoid arthritis, a multibillion market. What makes Gilead Sciences even more attractive, however, is its price. A slowing in top-line sales growth stemming from a maturing market for hepatitis C has led to investors shunning the stock for faster-growing peers. However, that short-term thinking could be creating a great long-term opportunity for investors. Despite the fact that the company works on a packed pipeline of potential new drugs, investors can buy this stock for only 6.8 times forward earnings. That's incredibly cheap for the industry, and it marks a multiyear low valuation for the company. GILD PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts. A company poised to fly higher Daniel Miller: Being a rookie investor, and there's no shame in that, means you have a lot to learn about the market. That takes time. In my opinion, that means one of your first investments should be in a larger company with competitive advantages, that isn't being displaced by competition any time soon. One company that fits the bill is definitely The Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA). Boeing's competitive advantages are rooted with the commercial aircraft industry itself. It takes a long history of technical knowledge to design, assemble, and certify commercial aircraft. Boeing operates the majority of its business in a highly regulated industry that few newcomers dare to try and break into -- when it comes to commercial aircraft, it's basically Boeing, Airbus, or bust. Another perk for Boeing investors is the company's huge backlog of orders. It takes years to build these aircraft, and when demand is strong, so is the company's revenue visibility. Consider that Boeing has a backlog of over 5,700 commercial aircraft, which is basically five years of revenue. One of Boeing's goals during the near term is to continue ramping up production of its commercial aircraft. Boeing's 737 is a prime example: Its production per month will increase from about 41 planes currently to 52 per month in 2018. On top of it all, Boeing has another catalyst with its defense business. It's been a tough area over the past few years as U.S. defense spending has been slashed, but the bottom of that cycle appears to have arrived, and if government spending returns, Boeing stands to benefit. All in all, Boeing has a well-protected business, a robust backlog, a potential catalyst with its defense business, and it's trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 13, according to Morningstar estimates. With these characteristics, it's a pretty strong candidate to own in a rookie investor portfolio. Focusing on the long term will pay off Steve Symington: I think now is a great time to pick up PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Shares of the digital-payments platform leader plunged last month despite not only turning in stronger-than-expected second-quarter 2016 results, but also raising its full-year outlook. Adjusted revenue jumped 16% year over year (19% at constant currency) during the quarter, to $2.65 billion, and PayPal highlighted the fact it gained market share during the quarter, with total payment volume jumping 29% year over year, to $86 billion -- significantly faster than the overall growth rate of the e-commerce industry. But investors were more concerned with PayPal's simultaneously expanded strategic partnership with Visa, under which PayPal agreed to stop directing its customers to link bank accounts instead of credit cards to its platform. Because Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers are cheaper for PayPal to facilitate than credit card transactions, this could mean PayPal will be facing margin pressures in the near term. But the agreement also gives PayPal access to Visa's tokenization services for in-store PayPal transactions, which will accelerate adoption of PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are accepted. Over the long term, I think the benefits of this deal more than outweigh the near-term drawbacks. And with shares trading at 22 times next year's expected earnings -- a reasonable premium given the company's market-beating growth -- I think any patient, long-term investor would do well to have PayPal as a core position in his or her portfolio.

(File/News 13) By Jerry Hume, Reporter Last Updated: Wednesday, August 17, 2016, 1:18 PM EDT KENNEDY SPACE CENTER --  NASA is preparing the International Space Station for the return of American spaceships this week. International Docking Adapter to be installed at ISS Will ensure SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft can connect to ISS Astronauts will perform spacewalk Friday to install the adapter An International Docking Adapter will be installed at the ISS. That docking adapter will ensure both SpaceX and Boeing spacecraft can connect with the ISS when they launch astronauts from Florida in the next year or so. Ground controllers on Wednesday will use the space station’s robotic Canada-Arm to pull the docking adapter out of the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule. That capsule launched last month from the Space Coast. The robotic arm will position the docking adapter to just three feet away from the space station. Then on Friday, two NASA astronauts will conduct a spacewalk to install the docking adapter to the ISS. “We’re excited to see this tangible change in the space station,” said Steve Stich with NASA Commercial Crew Program. “The space station has been changing the last year for our flights. And now once we have this new door on the front of the space station I think for us it really marks it’s time for us to get our hardware ready to go fly.” NASA has contracted both Boeing and SpaceX to build spacecraft that will carry astronauts to and from the ISS, starting in late 2017 or early 2018. Those astronauts will launch from Florida’s Space Coast. Also on Wednesday, NASA will provide a brief on their next big unmanned mission. They plan to launch a spacecraft that will travel to an asteroid, collect a sample of its minerals, and then return to Earth. That mission will launch September 8, also from the Space Coast.

Advertisement It won't be a leisurely walk in space because both astronauts will be installing a new international docking adapter (IDA) to the International Space Station (ISS) in preparation for the arrival of space taxis in 2017. Private companies are set to create space taxis for NASA's ISS. It will ferry astronauts to and from the ISS. For the Commercial Crew Program, SpaceX is already building a Dragon cargo capsule, also known as the Crew Dragon. Boeing on the other hand is building a new crew capsule by the name of CST-100 Starliner. The spacecraft will carry astronauts to the ISS by 2017, and once there will dock at the IDA. "We started building this 18 months ago, and now it's one of the most visible changes to the Cape's horizon since the 1960s," stated Chris Ferguson, former shuttle commander and Boeing's deputy program manager for the company's Commercial Crew Program. The IDA installation was originally scheduled last summer. Yet, the adapter said to be used was destroyed when Falcon 9's rocket disintegrated during the launch. As for the current installation scheduled this Friday, it is a major milestone for NASA. The agency is confident that the flight will push through by 2018. "The first crew flight is scheduled for February 2018. I am confident," explained Ferguson, adding, "And we have a lot of qualification to get through between now and then. But barring any large unforeseen issues we can make it." Advertisement As for the Commercial Crew Program, the space agency plans to reduce costs in sending astronauts to and from space. In addition, NASA hopes to increase the number of astronauts on the ISS. According to NASA officials, an additional member on the roster would greatly enhance the research conducted at the station.

STUCK IN D.C.? You know what to do: Send tips to iarnsdorf@politico.com. OMNI OR CR? Freedom Partners, Americans for Prosperity and other Koch-tied groups want Republicans to support a continuing resolution that would fund the government into the start of the next administration, reports Morning Consult’s Jon Reid. “Congress should not be making another long-term spending deal with President Obama and Harry Reid,” said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The endgame is a two-year spending bill and an eventual cut to government spending. A HOUSE DIVIDED: Members of the House Freedom Caucus are blaming Speaker Paul Ryan and the House leadership team for Rep. Tim Huelskamp’s landslide loss against political rookie Roger Marshall, faulting Ryan’s refusal to promise to reinstate the Kansas Republican on the Agriculture Committee panel, reports Rachel Bade for POLITICO. “Our leadership created this situation: They kicked him off a committee and then the whole campaign became, ‘Oh, Tim Huelskamp isn’t on the right committee,’” Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said. “Are you kidding me? … He lost counties in western Kansas! That is his base! And he lost counties because of the agriculture issue! This is a problem.” Huelskamp’s defeat has worsened House GOP tensions and sent a message to caucus members that rebelling against GOP leaders could bear a heavy price. TRUMP TURMOIL: — Vin Weber, the Mercury lobbyist and former Republican congressman from Minnesota, called the nomination of Donald Trump “a mistake of historic proportions,” Tyler Page reports for POLITICO. "I won't vote for Trump. I can't imagine I'd remain a Republican if he becomes president," Weber said. Add him to the list with Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman; Sally Bradshaw, a longtime aide to Jeb Bush; and Maria Comella, a former top aide to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. — Republican donors are panicking, BuzzFeed’s Tarini Parti and Rosie Gray report. “I don’t know what he’s doing — trying to commit suicide?” said Stan Hubbard, a Minnesota-based top donor to a pro-Trump super PAC. Hubbard and Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen have tried to mollify other uneasy donors and convince Charles and David Koch to board the Trump train. Other concerned fundraisers include Fred Malek and Dale Dykema. But some don’t seem to be worried like Mica Mosbacher, a former national RNC finance co-chair, who said Trump’s recent controversies won’t affect the campaign's finances.

Get News Alerts Education © 2016 North Jersey Media Group August 18, 2016 Last updated: Thursday, August 18, 2016, 12:31 AM 90-year-old Ramsey pilot still has the 'right stuff' By Marsha Stoltz MANAGING EDITOR |  Ramsey Suburban News RAMSEY — Does a former 19-year-old World War II Navy pilot cadet still have the "right stuff" 71 years later to fly a plane? PHOto courtesy ofJohn Meiman Ramsey resident Joseph Meiman,90, waves before takeoff in a Stearman Trainer. Resident Joseph Meiman, 90, agreed to find out. On Aug. 3 he took off in an open-cockpit two-seater Stearman (Boeing) Primary Trainer like the one he flew during 1945 exercises at Bunker Hill Naval Station in Peru, Ind. "They used the cheapest open cockpit planes for training," Meiman said. "There were no radios. If you wanted to talk to the other person, you used hand signals or spoke down a speaking tube." A tube? "It worked." Minimal instruments Meiman enlisted in the Navy in January 1944 as an apprentice seaman from his hometown of New Orleans, and received the munificent sum of $75 a month. "The regular pay was $50, we got $75 for hazardous duty," he explained. Meiman spent a semester in flight training classes at Tulane University before more advanced training in Maryland and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "We studied aerology, navigation, how to identify planes and ships," Meiman said. He then began flight training at Bunker Hill. "I think Ted Williams and Otto Graham [Cleveland Browns quarterback] also went through that school," Meiman said. "They were looking for men with good eye-hand coordination and there were a lot of athletes. I also think the first President Bush went through training a year and half ahead of me." There were no guns or bombs in the beginner training planes. Meiman said there were "minimum instruments" as they learned how to control the plane, evasive maneuvers, formation flying, flying after dark, and loops or barrel rolls. "There were two kinds of rolls, a slow roll and a snap roll," Meiman said. "If you were doing a list of maneuvers, the dirt on the floor would fly in your face when you went upside down." His six months of flight training came to a premature end with the surrender of the Japanese in August 1945. He never flew in combat, and his flying dream was over. "I went to the local airport where my parents lived in Chicago, but the lessons were $5 an hour and I was earning 40 cents an hour," Meiman said. Instead, he made his career in bookbinding. Mixed emotions The flight was arranged by son John Meiman, who described himself as "child number three" of Joseph’s seven children who moved with their parents to Ramsey in 1962. "I was the one who made the arrangements," said John, now of Ortley Beach. "My dad has always loved planes and flying. As a kid, his heroes were Charles Lindbergh and Wiley Post, and he’d tell us about them when we took turns as kids sitting in the front seat of the car with him when he was driving. It was a tragedy for someone who loved flying that much to go into the service and then never get to fly." John said he had been searching for a Stearman for his father to fly since seeing the biplanes in western Illinois air shows, and finally "stumbled across" one at the Andover Flight Academy. "I called the owner, and he agreed to take my dad up, but said we needed to wait until summer, he would not want to fly in an open cockpit in the winter," John said. Not every member of the Meiman family was equally enthusiastic. "Beforehand I had a few reservations," said son Tom, now of Pittsburgh. who witnessed the flight with his wife Carol Ann. "He’s a remarkable person, but 90 years old is 90 years old. He was going to be flying in an open cockpit. But he knew what to expect and was completely for it." Damian DelGaizo, president of Andover Flight Academy and a Vietnam era pilot, personally set up the flight, arranging additional steps leading onto the wing and into the cockpit to ease his entry. "We got him into the cockpit and as we were belting him in, he said the last time he was in the plane he fit in while wearing a parachute," DelGaizo recalled. "I said I hope you won’t need one today!" Nor was Meiman worried. "I trusted the pilot," Meiman said. Daughter Madeline Rapp, still living in Ramsey, was present as her father "folded that lanky body" into the front seat of the plane wearing his World War II bomber jacket, which "still fit." "The sky was a brilliant blue," Madeline said. "Everything cooperated." Son John said he was particularly touched when his father "reached up without looking" for the handles on the wings that pilots gripped to help manipulate themselves into the tight seating area. "As they were about to take off, Damian yelled to my father that as soon as they got up in the air he would turn over operation of the plane to him," John said. "My sister-in-law let out an audible gasp and the plane took off." Up and away Meiman spent a half hour in the air, reacquainting himself with the stick controls at first before doing a couple turns, the more advanced maneuvers, barrel rolls, and eventually a low-altitude pass over the airfield complete with a dramatic trail of white smoke. "The green hills below made a beautiful sight," said Meiman. "You could see for miles in the clean crisp air." Madeline witnessed his landing "with a grin and a jaunty wave." "He got out of the plane with grace, managed the step ladder, and said, ‘Well, that was something,’" Madeline recalled. Meiman brought his World War II flight log book for DelGaizo to sign. "We owe these veterans a debt we can never repay," DelGaizo said. "It was a terrific day." The family retired to a nearby restaurant for a celebratory lunch. "There is a famous poem about flying, a sonnet by John Magee Jr. in which the last line reads ‘I put out my hand and touched the face of God.’" Meiman said afterward. "That is what it is like when you are close to a cloud in an open-cockpit Stearman."

Power of Pink Provides NASA with Pressure Pictures by Jim Banke for NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate Washington DC (SPX) Aug 18, 2016 An aircraft design that could reduce fuel use, emissions and noise is set up for a test in a wind tunnel at NASA's Ames Research Center in California in which pink-colored pressure-sensitive paint is applied to the vehicle. The pink paint shines when exposed to blue light, glowing brighter or dimmer depending on air pressure in the area. For a larger version of this image please go here. They say you show your true colors when you're under pressure. Turns out the old saying works for models being tested in wind tunnels as well, specifically those coated with a unique Pressure-Sensitive Paint (PSP) that NASA engineers have used for more than 25 years. Today the bright pink paint is helping NASA's aeronautical innovators test new aircraft designs that could cut fuel use in half, pollution by some 75 percent and noise to nearly one-eighth of what it is today. "PSP is great because as long as you can apply paint to the area you want to test, illuminate it with a lamp, and view it with a camera, you can gather data you might not otherwise be able to get," said Nettie Roozeboom, an aerospace engineer with NASA's Ames Research Center in California. Engineers need to know how pressure is distributed across an airplane's surfaces as it moves through the air so they can ensure, among many other critical variables, that they understand the loads the vehicle is experiencing at given wind tunnel conditions. When testing scale models of aircraft designs in wind tunnels, pressure readings are traditionally taken using pressure taps, little plastic tubes that are strung through the model's interior up to the surface through a small hole in key places. "The challenge is you can only install so many of these taps, otherwise your whole model becomes one big pressure tap," Roozeboom said. "And in some models, there just isn't enough room inside the model to accommodate the taps." Case in point: Recent tests of a transonic truss-braced wing aircraft design, part of Boeing's Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research project, involved a model in which some of the parts were too tiny for documenting air pressure any other way than PSP. "The wing struts in particular were very thin, and it was difficult to machine taps where the wing met the fuselage, so PSP really was the ideal solution," Roozeboom said. Power of Pink Here's how PSP works: + A thin coat of the special paint, about one-and-a-half thousandths of an inch thick, is sprayed on to the model that will be tested in the wind tunnel and allowed to dry. + The model is then installed in the wind tunnel, which also is equipped with a series of blue LED lights and a complement of specially equipped black and white cameras to record the test. + With the wind tunnel active, air flows over the model resulting in varying surface pressures. The blue lights excite molecules known as luminophores within the paint causing them to fluoresce, or shine. + At the same time, due to the nature of the paint's chemistry, oxygen molecules quench the luminophores. High-pressure areas have more oxygen, so the pink shines dimmer. Lower pressure areas have less oxygen, so the pink shines brighter. + These differences in how much the paint fluoresces or shines is recorded by the cameras, and the resulting black and white images are analyzed. The intensity of the different shades of gray are converted to a color scale indicating the varying pressure levels. Researchers use PSP as one of many tools to better understand how a new aircraft design might perform. It also can be used to help make other tools, such as the computer modeling tool known as CFD, more accurate. "When you start to marry all these technologies to arrive at the best answer, I think you can walk away knowing more," Roozeboom said. Colorful History It was early in the 20th Century when the idea of correlating the luminescent properties of a coating to varying pressure levels was first developed. By 1935 a German scientist, Hans Kautsky, first deduced that the quenching of luminescence was caused by oxygen. As the concept evolved through the years, it was during the 1960s that a potential use was explored in the field of medicine, with some success realized in using the idea as part of a tool for measuring oxygen content in blood. Much of the work that led to biomedical applications of the concept was located at the University of Washington. It was there that during the 1980s a Boeing researcher turned to further develop an idea for using the concept in aviation, and then successfully demonstrated PSP in a wind tunnel. NASA joined the story not long after, still during the 1980s, when an Ames researcher, Blair McLachlan, was doing some work on fluorescent dyes and was referred to the researchers at the University of Washington. Realizing the tremendous potential value of PSP to NASA's work in both aviation and space, McLachlan began the process of bringing that tool to the agency. Interestingly, a key figure in those efforts turned out to be former astronaut Janet Kavandi, a two-time space shuttle veteran who is now director of NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. Kavandi was a PhD chemistry student at the University of Washington and, while waiting for a flight at the Seattle airport, happened to meet the researchers from her school who were working with NASA on PSP, which led to her joining the embryonic team. By early 1989, Kavandi and others had developed a desirable PSP recipe, essentially creating the first generation of the pink paint used today. They drove down to Ames from Washington with the lighting, cameras and a painted wing segment to try out in a wind tunnel. It worked. Pink Plans Today, NASA uses PSP as a research tool in the wind tunnels at Ames, Glenn Research Center in Ohio, and Langley Research Center in Virginia, and engineers continue to look for ways to make PSP even more effective for testing both aeronautical and space vehicles. Roozeboom said the next big thing for PSP is to perfect a new version of the paint in which the luminophores molecules get excited faster and are less sensitive to temperature - work sponsored by NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate. Known as Unsteady PSP, the paint would reveal changes in pressure at the microsecond level, providing a more detailed look at what is happening on the surface of an aircraft or launch vehicle being subjected to high stress during a high-speed flight or launch. But one thing that is not expected to change is the bright pink color of the specialty paint. That means one thing for Roozeboom, who at Ames is currently the "go to" person for all things PSP, including procuring the Pepto Bismol-colored paint - not available in a hobby store - painting the models and leading the test analysis: "Everything that's pink ends up in my office."

"We're not seeing any softness yet," Ihssane Mounir, Boeing's senior vice president of sales for Northeast Asia, said at a briefing marking the 50th 787 Dreamliner delivered to ANA Holdings Inc, Japan's largest airline. "We're watching it close," Mounir added, since global economic conditions could shift. "But if I just look at the Chinese market as it stands today, I'm not seeing any signs of weakness whatsoever." The comments came after other U.S. industrial companies recently reported weak sales growth in China and suggested the weakness could extend through the end of 2016. Global demand for widebody aircraft has also slowed, raising concerns about sales growth at Boeing and rival Airbus. Boeing said last week it may further cut production of widebody 777 jetliners and not increase output of 787s unless sales improve. A strong exchange rate for Japan's currency has slowed some of China's tourism to Japan, said Hideki Kunugi, ANA's senior vice president for the Americas. But he said ANA's decision to expand its capacity and its network in China is supported by demand. ANA took delivery on Wednesday of a new 787-9, the mid-sized version of Boeing's high-tech, long-haul Dreamliner aircraft. The jet seats 290 passengers in a two-class configuration and carries a list price of $264.6 million, though airlines typically negotiate discounts. ANA is experiencing robust growth in business travel from Japan to Latin America, Kunugi said, adding that it plans to launch a route from Tokyo to Mexico City in February 2017 using the 787 as part of its LatAm strategy. "Our current main target will be Tokyo and Mexico and onward," he said.

Jetstar is understood to be working on repairs to a number of General Electric-made engines in its 787 Dreamliner fleet in order to resolve the problem, which could lead to a loss of oil pressure. The engine problem could trigger a mid-flight engine shutdown, such as the one that forced one of Jetstar’s Dreamliners to divert to the Pacific island on Guam during a flight from Japan to the Gold Coast last week. The Australian understands Jetstar has made repairs to engines on 11 of its 787-8 jets since March, however the airline said that figure was “not correct” but declined to confirm a number. Earlier this year General Electric issued a service bulletin to operators of Dreamliners using the GEnx engine regarding an issue related to the engine’s transfer gearbox. The company recommended Dreamliner operators modify a “dampened radial gearshaft” to prevent “induced resonance failures that have caused approximately eight in-flight engine shutdowns and oil loss events across the world”. Jetstar operates a fleet of 11 twin-engine Boeing 787-8s.Source:News Limited Jetstar confirmed it had been issued General Electric’s service bulletin. “Jetstar has been working closely with GE on the service bulletin,” a spokesman for the airline told The Australian. “We are well progressed on our fleet and will have all aircraft engines completed months ahead of the recommended time frame from GE. “We are continuing our invest­igations into the cause of the engine issue with GE on the aircraft that diverted to Guam.” Service bulletins alert operat­ors to known issues in aircraft components, but their instructions are optional. They are not as serious as airworthiness directives that require airlines to make modifications by a set deadline. The engine issue also affects Dreamliners operated by airlines such as Air Canada, Air India, China Southern, United Airlines and Etihad Airways that fly from Australian airports. General Electric says it continually monitors and analyses the performance of the GEnx ­engine fleet. Passengers were diverted to Guam after their Jetstar flight from Japan’s Narita airport to the Gold Coast after encountered engine problems. Picture: Regi VargheseSource:News Corp Australia “Based on the engine fleet’s service history, we are not aware of operational issues that would hazard the continued safe flight of aircraft powered by these engines,” a spokeswoman told The Australian. “As a relatively new engine in commercial airline service, the GEnx by any statistical measure (dispatch reliability, engine remov­als, in-flight shutdown rates) is exhibiting outstanding reliability powering the 787.” On Sunday, Jetstar flight JQ12, heading from Tokyo’s Narita airport to Gold Coast airport made an emergency landing on Guam after encountering engine problems. In a statement to news.com.au, Jetstar said the flight made the premature landing following a warning light turning on indicating an issue with the oil pressure. The captain shut down one of the two engines “as a precaution” and diverted to the US territory located 2600km south of the Japanese mainland. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is invest­igating the incident.

By Jon Austin Jon Austin PUBLISHED: 12:31, Wed, Aug 17, 2016 | UPDATED: 13:06, Wed, Aug 17, 2016 The fleet of mostly Boeing 737s are based at a private terminal called Gold Coast in Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, but it is reportedly impossible for anyone else to buy tickets for the planes which have just one destination. The white jets with a red band along the side where the windows are have no logos, and military personnel who board them must not discuss the route, it is alleged. For years conspiracy theorists have insisted Area 51 is where evidence of alien visitations of Earth are secretly held away from public view. The top-secret Area 51 military base in the Nevada desert, USA, has intrigued and mystified UFO and alien chasers for years, particularly as the US Government only and reluctantly confirmed its existence in 2013.  The long-held myth is that the US Government is well aware aliens visit Earth in flying saucers, and that sometimes they crash, or the crew are captured.  YouTubeA Janet Airlines flight departs for Area 51 with around 190 staff on board. Related articles GOVERNMENT CHIEF: 'I was shown inside alien UFO at Area 51' Second UFO man dies fuelling claims of 'Men in Black' murder spree Alien conspiracy theorists claim when this happens the spacecraft, damaged or otherwise, are taken there for tests and storage to prevent the public ever finding out.  Ever since the US Air Force revealed in July 1947 that a flying saucer crashed in the desert outside Roswell, New Mexico, before retracting it with a statement that it was a weather balloon, the next day, conspiracy theorists have claimed the authorities are desperate to withhold the truth about aliens from us. The theory is that if we knew for certain there were other races across the universe, it would destroy the concept of religion and make controlling the masses increasingly difficult.  The Roswell myth has expanded over the years to include claims that alien corpses were pulled from the wreckage. Since the discovery of the existence of Area 51, it has been incorporated into the myth. UNICORNAEROSPACE*GETTYLast month Andre Milne, founder of Unicorn Aerospace, confirmed black projects happen at Area 51. Related articles How 'deadly force' used to keep prying eyes from mysterious Area 51 'UFOs' on trucks on A34 spark claims there is a BRITISH AREA 51 Sadly, despite the rumours, I've seen no evidence that we've recovered any extraterrestrial technology. UFO expert Nick Pope The story now being that the wreckage and dead aliens were taken there for tests, storage and experimentation. Alien conspiracy theorists believe the US military regularly intercept flying saucers, which are also taken into Area 51. Claims include that engineering experts are trying to reverse engineer the spacecraft to allow the US Air Force the same capabilities, and that secret tests of such crafts take place over the Nevada desert. According to sources the fleet is dubbed Janet Airlines as this stands for just another non existent terminal, and is operated by AECOM, a private defence contractor for the USAF. The planes are believed to have been taken from the former Western Airlines after it merged with DELTA in 1987. Conspiracy theorists claim Area 51 is "restricted airspace inside restricted airspace" and once the aircraft approach the base their call sign changes from Janet to "bones 58". Nick Pope, a British UFO expert, who investigated UFO phenomena for the MoD, but is now based in the US, said Area 51 is where the USAF designs, builds and tests hi-tech and top-secret military aircraft in so-called black projects. But, he is not convinced by theories that recovered alien technology is stored or experimented on there. He said: "Area 51 exists - it's part of a military testing range in Nevada - and because of the remote and sparsely-populated location, it's where various secret prototype aircraft and drones are developed and test flown. CLASSIFIED: Area 51 Mon, July 25, 2016 The United States Air Force facility, known as Area 51 is a remote area in Nevada. Current purpose of the base is unknown, however conspiracy theorists and media have speculated purposes from UFO spacecraft research to analysing the brain activity of an alien.

"Sadly, despite the rumours, I've seen no evidence that we've recovered any extraterrestrial technology. "Having been name checked in movies like Independence Day, Area 51 has become part of pop culture and the secret is out, so if there ever was alien technology at Area 51, I suspect it's been moved to a location we've never heard of." Earlier this year, it emerged AECOM was hiring for pilots for the secretive planes. The defence contractor listed the post of First Officer based out of Las Vegas on its official careers website. The job required "full background checks" and the "ability to hold a top secret clearance from the US government".   Related articles White House dodges 'alien question' amid demands for answers Were 'Roswell files' destroyed?

However, this isn’t going to be just a walk in the park. The astronauts will be working on installing a new international docking adapter (IDA) to the outside of the ISS. This is a crucial component of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. Image via NASA A major issue with the ISS is it’s relative inaccessibility. It takes a lot of planning, work and resources to send people or equipment up there. For this reason, SpaceX and Boeing have been working on commercial alternatives. These alternatives — so-called space taxis — would be faster and cheaper than existing possibilities. SpaceX is building a crewed version of its Dragon cargo capsule, called Crew Dragon, and Boeing is building a brand-new crew capsule called the CST-100 Starliner, the two being slated to work in 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, in order for these to dock at the station, a new docking module needs to be installed to fit the shuttles and astronauts need to get to work. There is a reason to worry about the spacewalk. This will be the first one since January, and that spacewalk didn’t exactly go swimmingly. Then, NASA astronaut Tim Kopra noticed a small water bubble forming inside his helmet, probably due to an issue with his spacesuit’s sublimator, inducing too much condensation. NASA has already taken steps to fix this issue and hopefully, it  won’t be a problem in the future. Regarding the space operation itself, NASA writes: Advertisement “The two astronauts will venture outside the space station’s Quest airlock to install the first IDA onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2, located on the forward end of the Harmony module. On Wednesday, Aug. 17, ground controllers will use the Canadarm2 robotic arm, and its attached “Dextre” Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, to extract the IDA from the trunk of Dragon, and position it just inches away from PMA-2. There will be no live coverage of the trunk removal and IDA positioning.” In other ISS news, Russia is reportedly planning on reducing its space crew from 3 to 2. The Russian newspaper Izvestia quoted cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who serves as the head of piloted space programs for Russia’s state-run space corporation, Roscosmos. “They’re exploring the option of going down to two crew on the Russian segment,”said ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd, responding to a question from collectSPACE.com editor Robert Pearlman. “We’ll look at it as we do with all these kind of things—we’ll trade it against whatever risk that might put into the program, first and foremost the risk to our crew onboard, and the station itself.” The whole building operation will be streamed by NASA.

Conway G. Gittens reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Facebook swung to higher-than-anticipated quarterly profits and sales. It appears Facebook is getting mobile strategy right. Mobile made up more of total ad revenues than it did the prior quarter. One other metric of note - the monthly average number of users logging on to the social network on their phones jumped 51 percent from the same time last year. The response was bullish - the stock immediately surged above $31 in after-hours trade - a level not breached since February. Turning to manufacturing: Boeing raised its outlook after demand for 787 Dreamliner jets and foreign orders for military aircraft pushed results ahead of the consensus. Ford also boosted full-year guidance. Higher U.S. truck sales, strong demand in China, and a surprise smaller-than-expected loss in Europe drove the automaker to a forecast topping quarter. But Caterpillar slashed its outlook for the year. The problem: a slowdown in the mining industry caused profits to crater by more than 43 percent. That prediction gave investors little reason to buy stocks. The S&P 500 had its first two-day drop in a month. The Nasdaq was basically unchanged. Google is updating its nexus 7 tablet. The latest version is thinner than its predecessor and comes with higher screen resolution. The cut-throat priced tablet hits the market at a time when Apple revealed a 20 percent drop in iPad sales last quarter, and Microsoft recently slashed prices on the Surface because of soft demand. New home sales hit a 5-year high. Meanwhile, President Obama is trying to re-energize his economic agenda - starting with a pledge: U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA (ENGLISH) SAYING: "The only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1276 days of my term to make this country work for working Americans again." Though short on details, The White House is calling on Republicans to work with the President, who wants to spend on education and infrastructure in order to strengthen the economy and bring down unemployment. And speaking of a better economy, a survey of euro zone private businesses showed growth for the first time in two years - that was enough to send European stocks to an eight-week closing high.

In 2014 Boeing and SpaceX were awarded contracts worth some $6.8 billion to develop commercial crew transportation systems for the ISS. SpaceX is building a crewed version of its Dragon cargo capsule, called Crew Dragon, and Boeing is constructing a crew capsule called the CST-100 Starliner. The IDA-2 adapter, the second to be built, will allow new spacecraft to dock with the station, beginning in 2017. Spacecraft using the International Docking Standard, including NASA's Orion capsule, will be able to attach to the ISS. The docking adapter was launched from Cape Canaveral atop a Falcon 9 rocket on July 18 and has remained, until now, inside the Dragon's external trunk section. © Photo: pixabay Lockheed Martin, NASA Ink Deal for SkyFire Infrared Lunar Discovery SatelliteOn Wednesday, the ISS robotic arm will remove the IDA from the Falcon 9 and place it close to the ISS port. On Friday, Williams and Rubins will don their spacesuits and leave the station for a six-and-a-half hour shift, carefully connecting the IDA to its ISS port. In four previous spacewalks, astronauts completed preparatory steps for the upcoming installation, including positioning dozens of meters of power and connectivity cabling for the docking adapter. The two astronauts will be assisted in their spacewalk by Takuya Onishi of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, who will monitor the progress from inside the ISS during the installation. "There's a very coordinated interplay between the external crew outside, Tak on the inside, and the ground doing the commanding," said Zeb Scoville, the spacewalk flight director, during a NASA briefing. The installation process will be aired by NASA TV beginning 6:30 a.m. EST (10:30 GMT). ...

Ten years later, the landscape of humanity’s doorstep into the cosmos has fundamentally changed, thanks to efforts by NASA and American commercial companies. Commercial Orbital Transportation Services: A New Era in Spaceflight At the time of the first Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) award in August 2006, NASA officials envisioned that commercial companies would take over low-Earth orbit transportation services while the agency focuses its research and development resources on deep space exploration. NASA employed a two-phase strategy for developing commercial capabilities to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.  COTS was a demonstration of a commercial partners’ capability, providing NASA an opportunity to assess performance prior to purchasing services.  NASA then awarded Orbital ATK and SpaceX commercial resupply services contracts to each deliver at least 20 metric tons of cargo to the orbiting laboratory on their Dragon and Cygnus spacecraft, respectively. Shortly after its successful ISS demonstration mission under COTS in May 2012, SpaceX quickly provided two critical resupply service missions to the orbiting laboratory under NASA’s follow-on CRS contract. As of August 2016, SpaceX has successfully completed eight flights to the station and delivered over 35,000 pounds of cargo. In addition to allowing NASA to focus on extending humanity’s presence in space, COTS would stimulate efforts within the private sector to develop and operate safe, reliable, and cost-effective commercial space transportation systems. Besides supporting ISS, these commercial capabilities could ultimately benefit the U.S. economy by making domestic launch vehicles more competitive in global markets. In turn, lower launch costs could bolster opportunities for other space markets to grow. Orbital Sciences Corp., now Orbital ATK, was selected as a COTS partner in February 2008, and completed its ISS demonstration mission in the fall of 2013, joining SpaceX as the second company NASA would rely on for cargo delivery services to ISS. Orbital ATK has already delivered over 24,000 pounds of science experiments, hardware and supplies across five missions.  NASA’s Commercial Crew Program took cues from COTS, as well. In September 2014, the agency selected Boeing and SpaceX to build independent systems capable of carrying up to four astronauts at a time plus cargo to the station. Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon—both of which had been developed under Space Act Agreements—were chosen to begin manufacturing for flight tests first without crew and then with people aboard, returning crew launch capability to American soil.   The Next Step As a follow on to the first commercial resupply services contract, NASA awarded three cargo contracts in January 2016 to ensure the critical science, research and technology demonstrations that are informing the agency’s journey to Mars are delivered to the International Space Station from 2019 through 2024. Returning companies Orbital ATK and SpaceX were joined by Sierra Nevada Corporation with each company awarded a minimum of six cargo resupply missions. These new contracts build on NASA’s initial resupply partnerships with American companies and ensure it maintains the capability to resupply the space station from the United States through 2024. Knowledge gained through initial commercial resupply efforts was applied to the new awards, including specific delivery, return and disposal capabilities, as well as an optional accelerated return. Selecting multiple providers assures access to station so crew members can continue to conduct the vital research of the National Lab. Awarding multiple contracts provides more options and reduces risk through a variety of launch options and mission types, providing the station program a robust portfolio of cargo services that will be necessary to maximize the utility of the station. Work on these future missions is already underway. Newcomer Sierra Nevada Corporation successfully completed its first two milestones in July 2016, which included NASA approval of Sierra Nevada’s complete program implementation plan for the design, development, test and evaluation of the Dream Chaser Cargo System. NASA also assessed and fully approved SNC’s detailed approach for getting the Dream Chaser Cargo System to the International Space Station. Returning companies SpaceX and Orbital ATK have also begun their integration with the space station and early milestones for CRS2. The Future Building on the successful legacy of COTS and CRS, NASA has enacted several initiatives to continue partnerships with the commercial space industry. A request for information released in July 2016 sought to understand which unique ISS capabilities can be used to boost commercial activity and foster a self-sustaining marketplace in low-Earth orbit. NASA also announced the selection of six companies to help advance the Journey to Mars by developing ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. And NASA continues to work with the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) to put research from academia, commercial partners, government agencies and more to maximize use of the International Space station for innovation, which can benefit all humankind and inspire a new generation to look to the stars. The International Space Station is a convergence of science, technology and human innovation that enables us to demonstrate new technologies and make research breakthroughs not possible on Earth. The public-private partnerships, now more than a decade old, continue to build a strong commercial space industry, benefitting both NASA and American taxpayers.

The isolated location in the Nevada desert - which has sent UFO and Alien conspiracy theorists' imaginations wild for almost 70 years - is once again at the centre of a new mystery that would baffle even Fox Mulder. Flight Club reports that a new 'airline' called Janet is operating a number of red-striped Boeings based at Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport on a daily basis. The name is the call sign being used when the planes travel in civilian airspace. Others have speculated it is an acronym standing for 'Just Another Non-Existent Terminal'. The so called Extraterrestrial Highway near Area 51 in Nevada regularly attracts conspiracy theorists (Photo: Getty) But investigations have shown it's impossible to buy tickets to travel on Janet. And there's no chatter about it online - so those who aren't sharing what they are up to. But their destination - or departure from - always appears to be the Nevada National Security Site at Area 51, which is so secretive the US only admitted its existence in 2005.

The newly refurbished building will house the Ground Based Training System, as well as the tooling and manufacturing equipment to complete final assembly and flight operations for the T-50A trainer aircraft. The U.S. defense and aerospace giant, teaming up with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), is offering the T-50A for the project, in which it contests a BAE Systems-Northrop Grumman consortium and one combining Boeing and Saab Group, both of which plan to offer clean-sheet designs. "I want all of the enemies of America to understand that we are not looking for a fair fight. My goal is to have the overwhelming capability to deter those that would choose to go to war with us...they will lose and lose quickly. The T-50A is ready now and fits the need of the 21st century of the U.S. Air Force," said U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham. The T-50A is low risk and ready now. It builds on the proven heritage of the T-50 with more than 100 T-50s flying today ― 100,000 flight hours and counting ― and more than 1,000 pilots trained. "From the innovation of our Skunk Works team in Palmdale, Calif. ― who brought this program to life ― to the employees in Greenville ― who will build the T-50A… the brightest minds and the latest technology have been brought together in this facility to provide the U.S. Air Force with a low risk, highly capable aircraft and training solution," said Orlando Carvalho, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Executive Vice President. The T-50A was developed jointly by Lockheed Martin and KAI. The accompanying T-50A Ground-Based Training System features innovative technologies that deliver an immersive, synchronized ground-based training platform. Lockheed Martin completed the initial flight test of its first T-50A configured aircraft on June 2, 2016 and the initial flight of its second T-50A configured aircraft on July 26. ksw@ktimes.com 1.

The blacklist was put in place by a Congress government after Operation Bluestar in 1984 and the Kanishka bombings in 1985. Most nonresident Sikhs affected by this ban are residents in the United States, UK and Canada. BCCL/representative image Operation Bluestar was an Indian Army offensive against Khalistani militants holed up in the iconic Golden Temple of Amritsar. It was ordered by the then prime minister Indira Gandhi. Explosives on board Air India's Kanishka, a Boeing-747 aircraft flying the Montreal-New Delhi route, destroyed the plane while it was over Irish air space killing 329 passengers, most of them Canadian-Indians. Sikh militant groups were investigated for the bombing and there were several arrests in Canada. Officials familiar with the government's decision on removing the blacklist said a committee headed by additional secretary of the home ministry had examined the blacklist, and 212 cases of a total of 324 were removed. BCCL/representative image The remaining cases are being examined and may be removed from the blacklist as well. These officials did not want to be identified. A home ministry spokesperson said he had no comments. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visits to the UK and Canada had seen several representations from Sikh NRI groups asking for reconsideration of the India travel ban. Officials said the proposal to remove the ban was opposed by the Intelligence Bureau. But the PMO intervened, and a committee was set up after which IB was asked to reexamine each case. BCCL/representative image One official explained that many of the blacklisted names were arbitrary. Entire families had been blacklisted on grounds that did not bear up to close scrutiny. The blacklist was never publicly acknowledged. But following several visa denials over the years, Sikh NRI groups started voicing opposition to what they described as systematic discrimination.

According to the U.S. Department of Defense Wednesday, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency(MDA) signed contracts with Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing to redesign the Multi-Object Kill Vehicle(MOKV). The MOKV, which is also used by THAAD interceptors, currently is installed on an interceptor one at a time capable of tracking and destroying a ballistic missile target. However, the MDA plans to revise the designs of missile interceptors so that multiple kill vehicles would be installed at a THAAD interceptor. U.S. media outlets expected that the U.S. will have new kill vehicles by 2020. The U.S. also plans to develop THAAD-ER(extended range) missiles that feature a two-stage booster rocket and thus can fly further than THAAD missiles.  News List 0.7% of Global Population Own Half of World's Wealth 2016-11-23 UN Chief To Think of Ways to Serve County After Finishing Term 2016-11-23 Lockheed Martin Awarded $1.2 Bln Contract to Upgrade S.

United Launch Alliance's Delta IV rocket took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 12:52 a.m. lighting up the night sky on the Space Coast. The rocket carried two Orbital ATK satellites to support space surveillance operations by U.S. Strategic Command. This will be the second launch of the month from Florida's Space Coast, following SpaceX's launch of a Japanese satellite last week. The missions contribute to what has become a busy time for the U.S. space program. On top of private commercial launches, NASA has also been gearing up for a high-profile job that will take its OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft to collect and retrieve a sample from the Bennu asteroid.

Ernest Rutherford first broke the nuclei of atoms at Manchester University in 1917. Our Queen opened the world's first nuclear power plant in 1956 at Calder Hall. Such were the halcyon days of British atomic confidence, before defeatism took hold and free market ideology was pushed to pedantic extremes. Most of Britain's ageing reactors will be phased out over the next decade, leaving a gaping hole in electricity supply. By historic irony the country has drifted into a position where it now depends on an ailing state-owned French company to build its two reactors at Hinkley Point, with help from the Chinese Communist Party. Watch | Aerials show the proposed site for Hinkley Point nuclear plant 00:28 The horrors Hinkley are by now well-known. The European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) is not yet working anywhere. The Olkiluoto plant in Finland is nine years late and three times over budget. EDF's Flamanville project is not faring much better. What is clear is that the costs of 'old nuclear' have spun out of control everywhere in the developed world. It is too expensive to keep trying to refine an inherently dangerous technology dating back 60 years in a Sisyphean attempt to make it less threatening after Chernobyl and Fukushima. Watch | Explained: Fukushima nuclear plant clean-up 03:02 The capital cost of new nuclear plants in Europe and the US has risen from $1,000 per kilowatt in the 1970s to around $5,500 today in real terms. Hinkley will be nearer $8,000. Hence the lapidary term 'negative learning' coined by Yale scientist Arnulf Grubler. The standard light water reactors were solid workhorses in their day - and averted huge releases of CO2 from fossil fuels - but they operate at 100 times atmospheric pressure. They need costly containment structures  to prevent an explosive release of deadly radioactive gases across hundreds of miles.  Ernest Rutherford first 'split the atom' at Manchester University in 1917 This nuclear cost spiral has been happening just as solar and wind costs plummet, and the verdict is in. The nuclear share of global power has dropped to 10.7pc from 17.6pc in 1996. Ten new reactors were built last year, but eight were in China. In Europe they are shutting down. There is an alternative. Research into a radical new wave of safer, cleaner, and cheaper reactors is suddenly reaching critical mass, some are entirely compatible with the intermittency of wind and solar. This is what Theresa May should be looking at as she launches her industrialisation drive and fashions an energy policy fit for the 21st Century. The Washington think tank Third Way has identified fifty advanced reactor projects in North America, including eight based on molten salt fuel, ten on liquid-metal, and some based on fusion designs. Energy capacity increase The US Energy Department has thrown its huge research power behind this push for a "meltdown-free" reactor cheap enough for mass production. It even explored micro modular variants for large jet aircraft at a forum in March, and Boeing has filed a patent to do exactly that with a laser-powered fusion-fission engine. One of the US-backed projects is a "waste annihilating molten salt reactor", which uses up spent nuclear fuel and lethal plutonium residue. As it happens, Britain's start-up company Moltex Energy is working on similar lines, and this country needs the technology even more urgently than the US. "We have the largest plutonium stockpile in the world and we don't know what to do with it," said Stephen Tindale from the Alvin Weinberg Foundation. Moltex founder Ian Scott estimates that his molten salt design can cut costs to almost a quarter of the Hinkley tariff. "We think we can come in at a levelized £29 per megawatt hour," he said. Nuclear reactor construction "That is radically cheaper than gas or coal in Europe. It could have a massive impact on the UK economy and it would be a terrible shame if we lose it," he said. Molten salt reactors were built by the US physicist Alvin Weinberg at the Oak Ridge Laboratories in the 1960s, but were never pursued because the Pentagon wanted the plutonium residue from light water reactors to build nuclear warheads. They dissolve the nuclear fuel in molten salts rather than using dry pellets of uranium. Advocates say a melt-down is impossible, and there can be no chain-reaction along the lines of Fukushima. If the reactor gets too hot, a freeze plug melts and the salts drain off. They cool down and turn solid. The fission process stops automatically. "It is inherently stable. You could break every containment barrier and still not get a leak of cesium or iodine outside the reactor," said Dr Scott. The plants operate at atmospheric pressure so they are much smaller and safer. Bags of radioactive contaminated soil piled up along the coast near the Fukushima nuclear plant The Moltex reactor can run off existing spent nuclear fuel, cleaning up the legacy headaches of old nuclear plants. "We can process nuclear waste very cheaply instead of burying it at enormous cost in steel tanks for 200,000 years underground," he said. The plan is switch to thorium as a "greener" source of fuel once Britain's stockpile of nuclear waste has been consumed. The Moltex design slashes costs by using a convection process that avoids pumping molten salt around the system. This reduces corrosion, the metallurgy barrier has bedevilled molten salt projects. Dr Scott is the former chief scientist of Unilever and his technical advisory board includes Derek Fray at Cambridge, Paul Madden at Oxford, and Tim Abram at Manchester. The design is one of several projects being examined by the UK government in its competition for the best small modular reactor.  "We have done everything entirely without government so far, and frankly we have had much more interest in Canada where we were welcomed with open arms by the regulators," said Dr Scott. Watch | Tour of Chernobyl 30 years after the disaster 03:28 Canada is now the crucible for molten salt reactors. Terrestrial Energy in Toronto is the most advanced such project in the world with an integral molten salt reactor, and is already pre-licensed. "We can bring our reactor to the commercial market in the 2020s," said the chief executive Simon Irish. "Once we put a shovel to the ground we can build it in three to four years. The parts can be manufactured on a mass scale.  We believe we can produce power for 40-50 US dollars per megawatt hour," he said. That is £31 to £38, a third of Hinkley. The reactor core - relatively cheap to make - is simply removed and replaced after seven years. Molten reactors have a double advantage. They operate at 700 degrees centrigade, much hotter than light water reactors. This dry 'high quality heat' is itself valuable. It can drive steam electrolysis, make ammonia fertilizers or polymers,  and can even be turned into methanol for synthetic transport fuels. Mr Irish said his 190 MW design is ideal for a new energy order dominated by renewables. "We can deploy extra power at peak times and pull it back into the troughs, and we can do it within minutes like a natural gas turbine. We tick all the boxes," he said. Old workhorse reactors cannot be switched on and off at will. Nuclear reactors cancelled I do not wish to neglect a flurry of other designs that may have equal promise, nor can I vouch for the technical and cost claims. Specialist readers will delve further, and make their own judgment. What is clear is that nuclear technology is in ferment. In a sense we have rare chance to go back to the drawing board. Britain still has a superb stable of nuclear scientists and talent but no longer faces a fortress of vested interests with horrendous sunk costs. It could leap frog the field. The British state can borrow for 20 years at 1.2 per cent and it should do so with zest to break out of the austerity cage, launching a blast of fiscal stimulus to carry the country through the post-Brexit adjustment while at the same time giving our engineering industries a shot of adrenaline. A gamble on the untested technology of advanced reactors might prove a costly flop but it is hard to see how it could be worse than a blank cheque for an obsolete nuclear model that will bleed us into the 2060s. At least we can take back our energy destiny.

Amateur astronauts could head to the International Space Station in space taxis as early as next year, and NASA is making sure that the structure is able to receive visitors. On Friday, spacewalkers Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will start work on the installation of a new International Docking Adapter on the ISS. This component will allow crew vehicles dispatched by Boeing and SpaceX to safely dock at the station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The SpaceX Dragon space freighter transported the dock to the ISS, which orbits the Earth at an altitude between 205 and 270 miles. The Canadarm2 robot will soon move the component to within inches of its final resting place, at which point Williams and Rubins will be able to complete its installation manually — the process will apparently require a spacewalk lasting six and a half hours. Related: China is developing a hypersonic space plane that makes the Space Shuttle look primitive This is the final stage in a long, arduous process. Previous crew members aboard the ISS have already laid hundreds of feet of power and data cabling to integrate the dock into the station, according to a report from Engadget. Once the Dragon freighter has been relieved of the dock, it will be used to transport gear from the ISS back to Earth. On August 26, it’s set to be grappled by the Canadarm2 robot and then released back toward the planet for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, according to NASA’s blog post detailing the operation. NASA will live-stream the dock installation Friday via its NASA TV service. The broadcast will begin at 6.30 a.m. ET, but the spacewalk won’t get underway until 8.05 a.m. Also watch: Raimond de Hullu’s vision for Oas1s green buildings Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Sgt. Bob Wickley / Reuters The Pentagon has reportedly expressed concern over the price of a yet-to-be developed new silo-based strategic nuclear missile Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Minuteman III missiles currently operated by the US Air Force are about 40 years old. The GBSD program supervised by the US Air Force aims at the development, production and deployment of 400 new ICBMs called to replace the outdated LGM-30G Minuteman III ground based ballistic missiles. America’s largest defense industry giants Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. are all competing to be awarded the new lucrative ICBM contract. However, the meeting of the Pentagon’s Defense Acquisition Board on August 3 exposed a substantial multibillion dollar gap between the estimates presented to the board by Air Force service and Pentagon’s office of independent cost assessment, a defense official familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, citing an unidentified US defense official familiar with the internal debate. ‘Anti-nuclear’ Obama plans to spend $1 trillion on nukes http://t.co/shcE0TrpVPpic.twitter.com/qkodWtE2Vs— RT America (@RT_America) September 22, 2014 According to the Air Force’s moderate 2015 estimates, the development of the new ICBM program would reportedly cost $62.3 billion for all stages combined, including the development and production of related infrastructure, command and control systems and operational commissioning. The Pentagon is well aware that the US has not developed or built new nuclear-capable ICBMs for decades, which implies that unexpected technical issues might emerge. So the military department has reportedly voiced concerns that cost considerations of the GBSD program are incomplete and should be reconsidered. “If there was something that we learned” from the Defense Acquisition Board meeting it is “the magnitude of this type of ICBM work,” Air Force Secretary Deborah James said during a “State of the Air Force” news conference last week. “There is a level of complexity that has to be worked through.” New deterrence: US plans to upgrade its nuclear bombhttps://t.co/6pCQsYXauvpic.twitter.com/T19jSUcQ1T— RT America (@RT_America) August 2, 2016 The US Department of Defense is seemingly reluctant to initiate a program with insufficient funds that would inevitably pose a problem in terms of the need to seek additional funding through Congress of by shifting funds from other Pentagon programs. The debate largely surrounds the methods of calculating the program’s cost, either making it on the basis of old missile development programs of the 1960s, or evaluating the costs according to the latest estimates readied by Pentagon’s cost analysts, Bloomberg’s source said. The Pentagon may reportedly give the green light for the GBSD program, if the Air Force reconciles the differences between their cost estimate and that of independent experts, and expresses readiness to be able to take the program past 2021, taking into consideration various estimates of inflation etc. The Air Force is now considering whether it will be able to back up the ICBM program financially in case extra money is needed, the source told Bloomberg. This means it would have to agree to the higher forecast or put the GBSD program on hold, because the Pentagon is unlikely to allow the Air Force to underfund it. “We’re working that through,” Air Force Secretary said. The Obama administration’s plan to modernize all of the US nuclear weapons arsenal, is expected to cost around $355 billion by 2023. However, critics say this figure could rise to over $1 trillion. The replacement of America’s only remaining silo-based LGM-30G Minuteman III ground based ballistic missiles is long overdue.

Production of Minuteman III missiles was discontinued in 1978. At the time, each missile cost $7,000,000. The existing missiles have been repeatedly upgraded technically and electronically, yet in two years’ time the newest of the remaining 450 Minuteman III missiles will turn 40 years old. Still, the USAF reportedly expects the Minuteman III remain operable until 2030, when all of the existing LGM-30G missiles will be over half-century old.

Manchester Evening News 17/08/2016 By Lucy Roue © Provided by Manchester Evening News As around 40 per cent of adults who download the Pokemon app are older than 25 , it has the potential to cross over into valuable work time. So what can employers do to ensure their staff remain focused at work and are not distracted by this latest craze?

The move follows Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s decision Wednesday to scrap a planned increase in municipal taxes on airline tickets and a relaxation of restrictions on the use of regional airports, in line with EU rules. Ryanair initially planned to base the planes in the U.K. The new Boeing Co. 737s will add 3 million travelers a year on 44 routes serving Rome, Milan and smaller Italian cities. The extra capacity will lift Ryanair’s annual Italian passenger tally to about 35 million next year, the carrier said. Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary credited Italy’s government with taking steps to improve the country’s competitiveness. “All of this growth would have been lost to other EU countries if the municipal tax increase had not been reversed and the airport guidelines had not been redrafted to comply with EU rules,” he said in a statement. Ryanair has said it will move about 50 jets due for delivery this year to markets other than the U.K. to offset the impact of an expected travel slump after the Brexit vote and the drop in the value of the pound. The airline cut prices 10 percent in the latest quarter to try to fill seats, a task that was made more difficult by a string of terror attacks in Europe.

The unmarked white and red Boeing 737s appear like any other at first sight. Lined up at Las Vegas‘ McCarran International Airport, several of the giant jets use their own private terminal. But they are not used by the public and only serve one destination – Area 51. Alamy 4 The mysterious jets are lined up beside a private terminal at the McCarran International Airport near Las Vegas Wikipedia 4 The unmarked 737 jets only fly between the airport and the notoriously secretive Area 51 – where many believe there is evidence of aliens Mysterious smoke billows from Area 51 UFO hotspot Extra terrestrial theorists believe the top-secret military base - hidden away in the Nevada desert - contains the remains of an alien aircraft that crashed in the 1950s. The area was bought up by the US military in 1955 and its existence was only acknowledged for the first time in 2005. It is believed to be the testing site for top-secret cutting-edge military technology. Related stories WHAT THE UFO IS THAT?

Nobody who flies on the planes is allowed to reveal where they are going or what their job is. Operating from a private terminal at the Vegas airport, they only fly to and from Area 51. But an extra-terrestrial expert who used to investigate UFOs for the British Ministry of Defence believes there is little to the rumours. Nick Pope told the Mail: "Area 51 exists - it's part of a military testing range in Nevada - and because of the remote and sparsely-populated location, it's where various secret prototype aircraft and drones are developed and test flown.

"And even Hillary Clinton has said that if she's elected President she'll look into the claims. "Sadly, despite the rumours, I've seen no evidence that we've recovered any extraterrestrial technology. "Having been name-checked in movies like Independence Day, Area 51 has become part of pop culture and the secret is out, so if there ever was alien technology at Area 51, I suspect it's been moved to a location we've never heard of."

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     ISS Crew Will Install A New Commercial Dock For Space Taxis Posted: Aug 17 2016, 7:29am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   This computer rendering depicts a spacewalker performing installation activities for the International Docking Adapter. Credit: NASA Johnson YouTube NASA to Set Up a Brand New Dock on the ISS Soon   NASA's able astronauts are to set up a brand new dock on the ISS soon. In fact, the coming Friday has been chosen as the due date for this mission. After being stuck aboard the ISS for eons, NASA astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams will get a chance to do some radical stretching soon. It will be a six and a half hour long spacewalk that will occur on the upcoming Friday. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock However this will not be for leisure purposes alone. These two astronauts will instead be installing an international docking adaptor (IDA) on the external surface of the ISS.  NASA will present this interesting scenario in the form of a live stream video at 6:30 AM ET. What is called the IDA is a fundamental part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. According to Engadget, many private companies form “space taxis” for NASA which take astronauts to and fro between the earth and the ISS. SpaceX is busy manufacturing the Crew Dragon. As for Boeing, it is tinkering with a CST-100 Starliner. These spacecrafts will relay astronauts between the earth and the ISS in 2017 and 2018.  The IDA reached the ISS on July 20th. It had gotten launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. However, the Dragon capsule was not employed for this purpose at all. It was the Dragon’s trunk which served quite well for this worthy task. The IDA remained within the trunk. It will be taken out on the upcoming Friday and attached with the ISS’s exterior. The astronauts will play a crucial role in the procedure. Also the robotic arm of the ISS will go into action to attach the IDA with the surface. The two astronauts will get a little help from a Japanese astronaut named Takuya Onishi who hails from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. He will assist them from within the ISS.   While this is the fourth spacewalk for Williams, it will be the first for Rubins. During the course of the installation, the two astronauts will be able to rehydrate via a large bag of water, but they won’t eat a thing. NASA is concerned lest this spacewalk go wrong. So all precautionary measures have been taken beforehand. Basically, the IDA was supposed to be sent to the ISS last summer. Yet that didn’t pan out. So today this unfinished business is being brought to reach its denouement.

You should make sure your employees are fully aware of your company’s health and safety policy and ensure that they abide by it at all times whilst at work.” However, it's not all doom and gloom for potential catchers and all round Pokemon addicts as the consultant adds: "Of course you might not want to be a total killjoy so remind your employees that they have lunch breaks during which they are free to hunt Pokemon at their leisure!” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Business Newsletter Follow @MENBusinessDesk Subscribe to our Business newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Bury Employment business all Most Read Most Recent Business NewsAutumn Statement: Chancellor unveils measure to keep 'Britain open for Business' Greater Manchester business leaders have welcomed a ‘cautious but optimistic’ Autumn Statement.

(Liz Martin/The Gazette) B.A. Morelli The Gazette More stories from B.A. Aug 17, 2016 at 5:00 am | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — The story of Major Robert M. Horsky can be told through his planes. The United States Air Force veteran and Cedar Rapids native, who died in the skies over Vietnam in 1965, built model airplanes starting in high school and throughout his 20-year military career. The models capture the history of flight with a definite military focus, particularly the World War II, Korean War and Vietnam eras. “It’s a wide range of flight from the Wright Brothers to the modern day of his era aircraft,” said Jim Douglas, a member of the Alexander Lippish Modeling Club and a volunteer at the Veterans Memorial Building where a new Horsky exhibit is on display. Douglas inventoried the collection and performed repairs before In Flight: The Horsky Collection of Model Airplanes went live in July at the Veterans Memorial Building, 50 Second Avenue Bridge. The collection has 185 models, including about a dozen flown by Horsky, on display on the fourth floor outside the old city council chambers. The free exhibit is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Many may remember the same models being on display at The Eastern Iowa Airport for nearly 50 years until a remodel in 2012. The aviation collection had a short stint at The History Center before the latest move. The exhibit is about more than just the models, though. It chronicles Horsky’s life with additional effects including a service uniform, a timeline, old articles and letters, pictures, plane blueprints, dog tags and his flight log book, which helps tie his life to the models. “It was very emotional the first time I saw it because it was like sitting in a room of his stuff,” said his daughter Jan Wieneke, 51, of Phoenix, who was 11 months old when he died. “It’s an interesting display the way they put everything together with the timeline, and his log. It gives a much better picture then just the planes on display.” Horsky’s modeling hobby started as a student at the old Wilson High School and member of the Civil Air Patrol program, a citizen volunteer initiative to support the military. “Soldiers would study the models the high schoolers were making so they could identify aircrafts,” said Teri Van Dorston, Veterans Memorial assistant director who helped curate the exhibit. The first plane in the collection is a wooden model of a Nakajima E8NI Dave, built likely in the early 1940s, she said. Horsky continued modeling as he moved from base to base around the globe over his 20 years of service, beginning in 1945 until his death. Douglas said he found the models of planes Horsky flew most interesting and some had extra details, such as weather streaks and aluminum panels. A Rockwell International Aero Commander U-4 model included the tailnumber from Horsky’s craft. A Navy version of the Douglas AD6 Sky Raider, which specialized in close ground support missions in Vietnam, a B-29, in which Horsky was lead pilot with a crew of 11, a B-47 Boeing Stratojet with a crew of three and a B-52 are other models in the collection flown by Horsky, Douglas said. The collection features crafts from Japan, Great Britain, Germany and Canada, as well as different styles such as triplanes and biplanes. “These are the planes that made aviation into what it is today,” Douglas said of the collection.

USD 537 million, reflecting an increase of approx. 5.3% compared to the second quarter of the previous year, with a growth of approx. 7.9% in passenger flights. Said increase in revenue from passengers resulted from a significant growth in the number of the Company's passengers and the passenger revenue per kilometer (RPK) that was affected, inter alia, by the timing of Passover, which this year occurred in the second quarter, whereas last year Passover occurred at the beginning of April, thus departures for Passover holiday had already started in the last week of March. On the other hand, revenues were adversely affected by the continued trend of decrease in fight ticket prices as a result of the impact of the drop in oil prices and the intensified competition. In the Cargo Segment, the Company's revenues decreased by approx. 14.6%, mainly as a result of a drop in the yield of Ton-Kilometer and a decline in the amount of Ton-Kilometer flown. Operating Expenses –amounted to approx. USD 414 million, reflecting an increase of approx. 1.4% compared to the second quarter of the previous year, mainly due to an increase in operations, disruptions in staffing flights (which began in October 2015 and continue until the publication of this report) and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses, mostly arising from an increase in the number of the company's aircrafts and a change in the estimated residual value of the 777 aircrafts, as explained in Note 3.B. to the Condensed Financial Statements. The USD 32 million increase in operating expenses) excluding Jet Fuel expenses)  has been offset by the USD 26 million decrease in the Company's jet fuel expenses, as explained below. Jet Fuel Expenses – the Company's jet fuel expenses, including hedging impact, declined by approx. USD 26.3 million (about 21%) compared to the corresponding expenditure of the previous year, as a result of a significant drop in the effective price of jet fuel, offset in part by an increase in the amount of jet fuel consumed due to the growth in the scope of the Company's operations (about 9% growth in flight hours). Selling Expenses – selling expenses increased by approx. 5.8%, mainly as a result of the increase in the revenue turnover compared to the second quarter of the previous year. Other Income, Net – in the reported quarter, the Company recorded other income of approx. USD 1.0 million in respect of capital gain from the sale of a 737-700 aircraft. In the second quarter of the previous year, the Company recorded other expense, net, of approx. USD 4.8 million, in respect of an early retirement plan for the Company's employees. Financing Expenses –financing expenses amounted to approx. USD 4.5 million, compared to approx. USD 3.8 million in the second quarter last year. Said increase mainly resulted from exchange rate differences. Taxes on Income – taxes on income in the reported quarter amounted to approx. USD 12.0 million compared to approx. USD 6.3 million in the second quarter of the previous year. This growth resulted from the increase in profit before taxes on income. Profit for the Period – profit before tax in the reported quarter amounted to approx. USD 47.0 million (profit after tax amounted to approx. 35.0 million, constituting about 6.5% of the turnover), compared to profit before tax of approx. USD 23.6 million in the second quarter of last year (profit after tax stood at approx. USD 17.3 million, about 3.4% of the turnover). Cash flows from operating activities – the Company generated positive cash flows from operating activities of approx. USD 107.2 million, compared to positive cash flows from operating activities of approx. USD 78.9 million in the second quarter of last year. This growth mainly resulted from the increase in profit before taxes in the reported quarter compared to the second quarter of last year, and from the fact that the cash flows from operating activities for the reported period were adversely affected (about USD 15 million) due to a payment for hedging transactions, which was not recognized in profit and loss. Profit and Loss Results for the Six-Month Period Ended on June 30, 2016: Operating Revenues – amounted to approx. USD 934 million, reflecting an increase of approx. 0.4% compared to the first half of the previous year, as passenger flights increased by approx. 2.4% in and cargo revenues decreased by approx. 12.0%. The main trends affecting operating revenues in the first half of 2016, compared to the first half of 2015, are substantially similar to the trends explained in the analysis of the results for the second quarter provided above (except for the timing of Passover Holiday). In addition, the Company's revenues for the six-month period were adversely affected by the erosion of exchange rates of currencies, in which the sales transactions of the Company are made, in relation to the dollar. Operating Expenses –amounted to approx. USD 776 million, reflecting an increase of approx. 0.1% compared to the first half of the previous year, mainly due to an increase in operations, disruptions in staffing flights (which began in October 2015 and continue until the publication of this report) and the need to find alternative solutions in connection therewith, as well as due to an increase in depreciation expenses, mainly arising from an increase in the number of the company's aircrafts and a change in the estimated residual value of the Boeing 777 aircrafts. The USD 62.5 million increase in operating expenses (excluding Jet fuel expenses) has been offset by the USD 62 million decrease in the Company's jet fuel expenses. Financing Expenses –financing expenses, net, totaled approx. USD 9.1 million, compared to approx. USD 11.6 million in the first half of the previous year. Said decrease mainly resulted from early redemption of a loan during the first quarter of 2016, as explained in Note 5.B.2 to the Condensed Financial Statements. Tax Benefit – tax benefit in the reported period amounted to approx. USD 0.2 million, notwithstanding the profit recognized in this period, due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate in the first quarter of 2016, which resulted in the recognition of tax income on the date of the change, in the amount of approx. USD 3.8 million (see also Note 10 to the Condensed Financial Statements). In the corresponding period last year, income tax expenses of approx. USD 0.6 million were recorded. Profit for the Period – profit before taxes on income in the reported period amounted to approx. USD 13.4 million (profit after tax amounted to approx. 13.6 million, constituting about 1.5% of the turnover), compared to profit before taxes on income of approx. USD 1.9 million in the same period last year (profit after tax stood at approx. USD 1.3 million, about 0.1% of the turnover). Balance Sheet Data as of June 30, 2016: Current Assets amounted to approx. USD 525.9 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 131.6 million compared to December 31, 2015. This growth mostly resulted from an increase in cash balances (see cash flow analysis below) and a seasonal increase in the Trade receivables item. Current Liabilities amounted to approx. USD 915.1 million. The growth of about USD 72 million compared to December 31, 2015, mainly resulted from a seasonal increase in Unearned revenues from sale of airline tickets and an increase in Other payables mostly due to an increase in advances from customers, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings and current maturities, and a decrease in the Derivative financial instruments item (see Note 4 to the Condensed Financial Statements). Working Capital – as of June 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of approx. USD 389.2 million compared to a deficit of approx. USD 448.8 million as of December 31, 2015. It shall be noted, that a substantial part of the working capital deficit does not reflect short-term cash flows, as hereinafter explained. The Company's current ratio as of June 30, 2016 rose to approx. 57.5% compared to 46.8% as of December 31, 2015. The working capital of the Company consists of two substantial components, which are included in the Company's Current Liabilities items and are characterized by current business cycle; however, the Company is not required to use cash-flow sources in the short term in order to repay these components: Unearned revenues from the sale of airline tickets and from the Frequent Flyer Club, to be settled by providing future flight services, and liabilities to employees for vacation, which are expected to be paid over several years but classified as a short-term liability in accordance with accounting principles. Furthermore, as specified in Note 5.B.3 to the Condensed Financial Statements, a loan of about USD 30 million, the original maturity date of which is in April 2017, is expected to be settled over a period of 4 years, therefore it will be classified, starting from the financial statements for the third quarter of 2016, as a long-term liabilities. It shall be noted that the working capital is affected, inter alia, by the seasonality of operations and among others, by the timing of the holidays. Non-Current Assets – amounted to approx. USD 1,288.6 million, showing a growth of approx. USD 18.8 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2015, mainly as a result of receiving three 737-900 aircrafts, as provided in Note 3.A to the Condensed Financial Statements, less current depreciation. Non-Current Liabilities - totaled approx. USD 675.2 million, reflecting an increase of approx. USD 48.9 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2015. Said increase resulted mostly from loans obtained to finance the acquisition of three 737-900 aircrafts (see Note 5.B.1 to the Condensed Financial Statements) and an increase in deferred tax liabilities, mainly due to the improvement in the fair value of jet fuel derivatives, which in accounting terms were designated as hedging instruments, as well as due to profit before taxes on income for the period, offset by the decrease in the corporate tax rate. Equity – amounted to approx. USD 224.3 million. The growth of approx. USD 29.5 million compared to equity as of December 31, 2015, mainly resulted from the profit for the period and the impact of the Company's hedging instruments on the equity funds, in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 35.2 million, offset by the impact of liabilities for employee benefits on the equity funds, in a net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 4.7 million. Additionally, the increase in equity was partially offset by a dividend of approx. USD 15 million, which was paid in April this year. About EL AL EL AL Israel Airlines Ltd.

Photo by Reuters/Kham Prolonged layovers between Vietnam and the United States might soon be a thing of the past. National carrier Vietnam Airlines is readying itself to open direct flights to the United States in 2018, its Chief Executive Officer Duong Tri Thanh has said. Vietnam Airlines started making preparations for the route 10 years ago, Thanh was quoted by Vietnam News Agency as saying on Wednesday. He added that the carrier has focused on enhancing the long-haul flying experience for passengers by expanding its fleet with larger airplanes, including Airbus 350 – 900s and Boeing B787 Dreamliners. Vietnamese airlines must meet CAT1 requirements set by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which are specifically for non-stop flights to the U.S. Under the requirements, the air carriers from the assessed state may initiate or continue service to the United States in a normal manner and take part in reciprocal code-share arrangements with U.S. carriers. according to the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam. Vietnamese aviation authorities and Boeing last year signed an agreement in which the U.S. airplane manufacturer pledged, through technical and training assistance, to help Vietnamese aviation officials reach CAT1 standards. Based on CAT1 requirements, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will decide which foreign airlines are allowed to operate direct flights to the U.S. Visitors from the U.S. to Vietnam during the first six months of the year increased 14.5 percent from a year earlier to roughly 300,000, accounting for 6 percent of total international arrivals to the Southeast Asian country in that period.

Area 51 The fleet, nicknamed Janet Airlines, operates from McCarran Airport  None of the planes carry logos and you can't buy a ticket for their service Conspiracy theorists claim Area 51 in Nevada houses UFO technology  By Ted Thornhill for MailOnline Published: 02:42 EST, 17 August 2016 | Updated: 12:48 EST, 17 August 2016 e-mail 2.6k shares 495 View comments A fleet of passenger aircraft is stabled at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport that it's impossible to buy tickets for. They don't carry any company logos – they're plain white with a red band down the side - and anyone who boards one is sworn to secrecy about where they're going and what they do for a living. The reason that the aircraft, mostly Boeing 737s, are so shadowy in nature, is because they serve America's most secret military base, Area 51 in Nevada, which conspiracy theorists claim houses UFO technology. Scroll down for video  At Las Vegas McCarran International Airport is a fleet of passenger aircraft (pictured) it's impossible to buy tickets for - because they fly to the US's secret Area 51 military base They are run by the United States Air Force and operate from a private terminal at McCarran nicknamed Gold Coast, according to Flight Club. The fleet does have a name of sorts – Janet Airlines, because that's the call sign the planes in it use while in civilian airspace. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Conspiracy theorists go nuts over 'UFO' captured on live... The sky's the limit for RAF photographers capturing action... Share this article Share From Las Vegas they fly north-west to a place that has what's widely regarded as the most restricted airspace in the world, the Area 51 base in the Nevada Test and Training Range. In fact, Flight Club calls it 'restricted airspace inside restricted airspace'. It claims that once the Janet aircraft approach this secretive area their call signs change from the likes of 'Janet 210' to 'bones 58'. Once they touch down, the passengers disembark into a facility that's inspired countless books, TV shows and movies, but about which very little is known. The Area 51-bound planes are run by the United States Air Force and operate from a private terminal at McCarran nicknamed Gold Coast (pictured) UFO expert Nick Pope said: 'Area 51 [pictured] exists - it's part of a military testing range in Nevada - and because of the remote and sparsely-populated location, it's where various secret prototype aircraft and drones are developed and test flown' Nick Pope, author of Encounter in Rendlesham Forest and the man who used to investigate UFOs for the British Ministry of Defence, explained to MailOnline Travel that Area 51 is the place where some of America's most hi-tech military hardware is built and tested – but he doubts any of it is extra-terrestrial in origin. He said: 'Area 51 exists - it's part of a military testing range in Nevada - and because of the remote and sparsely-populated location, it's where various secret prototype aircraft and drones are developed and test flown. 'The UFO and conspiracy theory community think it's the place where crashed UFOs are kept and where the US military are trying to back-engineer this alien technology, and even Hillary Clinton has said that if she's elected President she'll look into the claims. 'Sadly, despite the rumours, I've seen no evidence that we've recovered any extraterrestrial technology. 'Having been namechecked in movies like Independence Day, Area 51 has become part of pop culture and the secret is out, so if there ever was alien technology at Area 51, I suspect it's been moved to a location we've never heard of.'

Four U.S. Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling jets bake in the 120+ degree heat, as crews work to prepare them for their next mission on a recent Friday afternoon. That mission is simple: provide gas to fighter jets taking part in one of the most realistic training war games in the world: "Red Flag." The exercise is one of the largest of its kind, spanning several weeks and involving hundreds of assets throughout the Air Force inventory. Soon, the KC-135 Stratotanker takes off. It's loaded with 120,000 pounds of fuel; almost twice as much as a fully loaded Boeing 747. After 40 minutes of transit, the pilots settle the jet into a pre-determined aerial refueling track at 28,000 feet over the desert. The flight pattern winds up being a giant oval, a series of left-hand turns that make it akin to a giant, aerial NASCAR track. Once settled into the pattern, Technical Sgt. and boom operator Jeremy Pratt settles into his station in the rear of the jet. It isn’t long before the first fighters, a pair of F-22 Raptors, call in to top off their tanks. Laying on his stomach in a claustrophobia-inducing pod that barely fit three people, Pratt gazes out the window into the sky and takes hold of a joystick, maneuvering the aircraft's 20-foot long refueling boom into position.

It pulls up slowly behind the jet, gradually filling the window. A careful ballet begins as Pratt orchestrates literally connecting the two jets, now barely a stone’s throw away from one another, with the boom. Once connected, the boom can offload as much as 1,000 gallons of gas per minute to the airplane below. By the time the flight is over, our crew will have dispensed 70,000 pounds of fuel to twelve jets in four hours. That's an unusually high number for such a mission, Pratt says. “It’s sweaty, it’s tough work, and after every flight we’re spent,” said Pratt, adding “I’ve got the best view in the world; I love every day of it.” USA TODAY The 'boneyard': Where airlines send old planes to be scrapped As the KC-135 lumbers through the sky, it creaks and groans in ways commercial airliners don’t. And for good reason: the KC-135 happens to be one of the oldest jets in the Air Force inventory. The first Stratotanker made its inaugural flight back in 1956, during the first Eisenhower administration. Today’s jet is not much younger, having taken to the skies for the first time in 1959. It has, however, received some tender love and care since. Upgrades in the late 1990s and again in the early 2000s removed the navigator position from the flight crew, reducing the required crew to just two pilots and the boom operator. Engines have been retrofitted several times, from the original water-injected Pratt & Whitney turbojets to today's modern high-bypass turbofans.. That hasn't necessarily made it much more pleasant for those aboard. “Being an old jet it has its disadvantages, like no air conditioning,” said Capt. Jesus Beltran. The crew figures the temperature on board regularly exceeds 130 while they’re on the ground in Las Vegas, though it cools down once the airplane takes off. “It’s got a lot of gremlins too,” said Beltran. “Little things that will go wrong here or there.” Today’s flight was no exception. The auto-pilot system opted not to work, leaving Beltran’s co-pilot, Capt. Neil Brinkworth, no choice but to hand-fly the airplane for most of the four hour flight. “Flying the KC-135 is very challenging: it’s a constantly dynamic environment,” said Brinkworth. Still, both pilots love the airplane. USA TODAY World's first 727 makes final flight after 25-year restoration “She’s tried and true; I like it,” said Beltran. Plus, he adds, “there’s something to be said about flying one of the older birds. It’s pretty neat, especially when you’re flying with one of the newer jets like the F-22 Raptor. You’ve got some legacy going on.” Despite its lengthy history, the future is expected to gradually dim for the venerable Stratotanker. Its replacement, the long-in-coming, Boeing-made KC-46 Pegasus is expected to join the fleet as early as next year. Based on the Boeing 767 passenger jet, the KC-46 will feature a number of upgrades over the KC-135, such as the ability to fuel jets via both a boom and a drogue. Most refueling jets today are able to operate only one of the two systems at a time. It will also do away with the otherwise sweet view that boom operators like Pratt enjoy every day. Instead of the tried and true window bay that has reigned for over 60 years, future boom operators will refuel jets via video cameras linking to a screen inside the jet; not unlike an aerial video game. But for the crew, one of the most exciting updates might be something far simpler: reliable air conditioning.

The second of five special reports from RaeLynn Ricarte, managing editor for the Chronicle, who is at Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in San Diego with a group of Northwest educators. SAN DIEGO — Garrett Berg and Hunter Leonard, both 18, remember the chaotic night they arrived at Marine Corps Recruiting Depot San Diego as the most traumatic of the eight weeks they have now spent in training. “That honestly was the worst moment, we just hit the ground running,” recalls Hunter, a native of Richland, Wash. “Everything was 100 percent every time. For the first day and half we didn’t get to sleep.” “That was tough,” said Berg, who hails from Snohomish, Wash. Nathan Dean, 19, thinks that having to wake up at 5 a.m. every morning is toughest, especially with drill instructors rousing everyone out of bed. “It’s a pretty immediate wakeup,” he said. Dean grew up in Issaquah, Wash., and joined the Corps because he wanted to serve his country and knew the Marines had the longest and most intense boot camp — at 13 weeks — of the regular armed forces. “Everything sucks the day you are doing it but then you look back and realize that it was really fun,” he said. Berg joined the Corps because he wasn’t ready for college and felt that life in the military would help him mature and get ready for higher education. “I was not athletic or a fit person but I feel like I’m doing pretty well,” he said of the rigorous training. He and the other men in barracks are getting over the illness called “Recruit Crud” that comes with having people come together from every state west of the Mississippi. “I thought I had pneumonia for a while but I feel good now,” he said. Males east of the Mississippi and all females train at Parris Island, S.C. Recruit training is intended to instill discipline, military bearing, physical fitness and warfighting skills into the new Marine. On the academic side, they are given values-based training to underscore the Marine’s core values: honor and commitment. Each recruit receives 547 hours of instruction in drill, martial arts, water survival, combat care/first aid, academic instruction, rifle marksmanship, field training and close order drill. Administrative time in leadership counseling and mentorship, academic study, meals, religious services, free time, sleep, etc., accounts for 1,586 hours of the recruit’s basic training experience. Leonard decided to be a Marine at a young age and is headed toward infantry school at Camp Pendleton, also in California, when finished with boot camp. “I want to see the world,” he said. “I saw a Marine in a commercial when I was little and I wanted to be that man.” He is excited about the Crucible, the 54-hour exercise and culmination of all the skills taught to recruits that is coming up in a couple of weeks. The thought of 45 miles of forced marches (10 up the mountain known as the Grim Reaper) and only a few hours of sleep and even fewer meals doesn’t daunt him. Leonard wants to earn the Eagle Globe and Anchor insignia that designates him as a Marine. “I think we are going to have so much motivation — it’s the only thing standing between you and the title,” he said. Berg and Dean are also excited about that moment. Berg said boot camp teaches Marines how to work together and builds the camaraderie that will be needed to overcome mental and physical obstacles during the Crucible. “You have to figure out how to live with everyone and how to work with people you don’t know well,” he said of his experience to date. He looks at new Marines who are sporting desert cammies instead of the woodland uniform colors with envy; their last days at MCRD are being spent at a much calmer pace and geared toward the future. “I’m eager to do the Crucible,” he said. “I don’t fear it, I’m just excited to accomplish it.” He will go on to train as an aircraft mechanic, with plans to work at Boeing when he returns to the civilian world. Dean expects to be challenged on every level during the rigorous exercise and to prevail. “We’ll be prepared for it,” he said. His military occupation will be radio operator, one of more than 700 possible jobs offered in 40 fields by the Corps. It has become increasingly difficult to get into the military with the drawdown in forces — gone are the days when troubled teens could be sent to boot camp as a “last resort,” say multiple officers leading the 2016 Educators Workshop involving teachers from across the Northwest. Ninety-five percent of female and males accepted into basic training are high school graduates and the Department of Defense allows only five percent to be dropouts. Any drug experimentation requires a waiver and police involvement must have been at a minimum. Teens (17 is the base age, and they must have parental consent) to adults up to age 28 must have passed a physical exam and military vocational aptitude testing. There are about 187,000 active-duty Marines and another 38,000 reservists. About 37,000 are deployed to more than 37 countries at this time. The Marines receive 10 percent of the defense budget for operations around the globe.

Sections Deseret NewsU.S. & World U.S. & World Director: New Mexico spaceport positioned for next frontier By Susan Montoya Bryan Associated Press Published: Aug. 13, 2016 12:25 p.m. + Leave a comment At what was once a remote desert outpost with spotty cell service and little infrastructure other than the shell of a quarter-billion-dollar futuristic hangar, Christine Anderson has watched the transformation of Spaceport America from her office window. The hangar sits just to the south, its patina metal paneling and glass walls rising from the valley floor. It's Anderson's favorite view. "I always get inspired," she said of being at the spaceport. "It sounds so trite, 'the dawn of the new space age,' but you know it really is. I think it's just going to be amazing what we in our lifetime get to see happening in this industry." Even though commercial flights at Spaceport America have yet to begin, Anderson — executive director of the New Mexico Spaceport Authority — says her job is done as the spaceport stands ready for anchor tenant Virgin Galactic and other companies working in the industry. Anderson announced her resignation this summer. Her last day is next week, and the search is underway for her successor. Anderson told The Associated Press the decision to leave was difficult but noted she initially signed up for only a year. She has served in the position now for more than five years. "I figured, 'This sounds fun. Let's see if I can help out for a year as part of the transition process,'" she said. "Of course, I got so involved and so excited about the job and the commercial space industry that one year led to the next and the next and the next." It hasn't been easy. There were numerous contracts to manage during a rocky construction period. Then there were delays and other setbacks as Virgin Galactic worked to develop and test its spacecraft. Some state legislators called for pulling the plug, adding fuel to criticisms that the project — first initiated by former Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, and British billionaire Richard Branson — was a boondoggle. Anderson was grilled at legislative hearings. She held fast to the idea that the spaceport would be a game changer for New Mexico. "There are naysayers," she said. "I think you just have to maintain the high road with all of that because it's an important project, and with any new thing — this whole spaceport business is new — you just have to have patience." Spaceport Authority board chairman Rick Holdridge praised Anderson after news broke of her resignation. He said she took a collection of contracts that were barely in place and built a fully functional spaceport. "I don't think the people of New Mexico realize what she has done for the state," he said. After beefing up its business plan more than a year ago, the spaceport has attracted new customers and hosted events for the public. The next open house will be in October. Officials also are in discussions with three major aerospace companies interested in using it as a testing ground. Many companies have nondisclosure agreements that prevent spaceport officials from talking about the projects being conducted at the facility, Anderson said. While the names may remain secret, Anderson said the effect on the bottom line is welcome. Spaceport America is on track this year to have three-quarters of its operating budget covered by revenues. Next year, that's projected to be 90 percent. The goal is to have operations paid entirely by lease revenues and other user fees given that the state and taxpayers in southern New Mexico already have contributed about $220 million to construct what is the nation's first purpose-built spaceport. Another six rocket launches are planned over the next six months, and the spaceport is readying to serve as a base for a major project with Boeing and the adjacent White Sands Missile Range as researchers work on a transportation system that can shuttle cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. After starting with little, Anderson said the spaceport is on the right track. "When I got here in 2011, it was a construction site. You couldn't go out there without your hard hat on," she said. "It was tough because it is in the middle of nowhere. We actually had to build a whole city in the middle of nowhere." Stretching across 28 square miles of the Jornada del Norte desert basin north of Las Cruces, the spaceport also benefits from thousands of square miles of restricted air space belonging to the missile range. That remoteness is drawing customers, Anderson said. "They value the privacy and our airspace and our 24-7 security," she said. "This is a competitive industry, and they're doing a lot of aerospace testing that they don't want other people to necessarily keep tabs on." Anderson, who spent 30 years with the U.S. Air Force as a civilian before heading up the spaceport authority, said the one thing she'll miss is being in the front row as the burgeoning industry grows. The tons of files and boxes of notes she has amassed have been handed down to her crew. "I thoroughly believe in the commercial space industry, and I think we've gotten to that place where we can pass the baton," she said. + Leave a comment Like that? Read this.

The country continues to make provocative moves in the South China Sea. The Chinese military recently deployed an advanced surface-to-air missile system to Woody Island, which is also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam, ratcheting up geopolitical tension. Further, China has been credibly linked to an escalation of global cyber-warfare, targeting both private companies and public entities. U.S. Steel has alleged that Chinese government hackers stole plans for developing new steel-making technology. And a report issued by the U.S. House of Representatives’ Science, Space, and Technology Committee in July concluded that Chinese spies hacked into computers at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from 2010 until 2013. Meanwhile, the Middle Kingdom aspires to be the world’s “leading space power.” “Chinese President Xi Jinping recently told the Chinese Air Force to more closely integrate its air and space capabilities. That was then breathlessly communicated and spun by other media outlets as Xi saying he wants China to militarize space — presumably by building a Death Star and staking a territorial claim on the moon.” – Vice News The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASTC) is already at work on a successor to the Space Shuttle. The key to the effort is a hybrid, combined-cycle engine that will allow a “spaceplane” to take off horizontally, rather than vertically, from an airport landing strip and fly straight into orbit. The spaceplane’s takeoff will be powered by turbofan or turbojet engines. At a certain altitude, ramjet propulsion would take over. Then, as speed increases, a scramjet engine with supersonic airflow will take the spaceplane to “near space” – the part of the atmosphere between 20 kilometers and 100 kilometers above sea level. The hybrid spaceplane would use rocket power to push into orbit. One CASTC engineer noted that the spaceplane would facilitate “ease of access to space for untrained persons,” suggesting the potential for space tourism. More ominously, the Chinese military is likely to identify many uses for the combined-cycle engine technology, including international defense efforts. Removing the rocket, the combined cycle engine would be a good fit to power hypersonic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as well as manned aircraft. As Popular Science notes: “Flying in near space at speeds above Mach 5, such aircraft could have global reach, while their speed and high altitude would make them effectively immune to all existing air defense systems.” That’s quite a gauntlet China’s thrown down. So, what’s next, Ridley? That’s the question Chuck Yeager (Sam Shepherd) asked his best friend Jack Ridley (Levon Helm) after Yeager broke Mach 2.0, then spun out, and finally regained control after breaking the canopy of his jet with his head in the 1983 film The Right Stuff. It was perhaps the most poignant expression of Tom Wolfe’s title in action. John F. Kennedy is most often credited with providing the vision that led us into the Space Age with his “We Choose to Go to the Moon” speech on September 12, 1962. But it actually started under his stodgier predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower. And over the course of many decades, the efforts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led to the creation of innovations and inventions that we use every day – the handheld vacuum, light-emitting diode (LED) technology, memory foam, infrared ear thermometers, firefighting gear, baby food, and freeze-dried meals. Okay, maybe those aren’t so awesome or revolutionary… but artificial limbs and the ability to perform more precise heart bypass operations certainly are. And without NASA, we’d have neither. I haven’t even mentioned Tang – the fruit-flavored drink made famous by John Glenn when he became the first American to orbit the Earth on his February 20, 1962 spaceflight. It may seem like NASA is a vestige of the Era of Big Government, that its best days are behind it, and that we no longer have “the right stuff,” but that’s not the case, at all. Indeed, we haven’t given up our interplanetary ambitions. Last week, NASA took another step forward in its plan to visit Mars by the end of the 2030s, as it selected six companies to design prototype deep-space habitats. These six companies will share a $65 million grant to research and develop ground prototypes, as well as perform habitat concept studies, over the next 24 months. According to NASA: “The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality.” Among the chosen are well-known behemoths Boeing Co. (BA) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). The list also includes privately held Sierra Nevada Corp. Founded in 1963, it’s a major contractor for the U.S. military, as well as NASA and private spaceflight companies. Also participating in the project are smaller-fries such as Bigelow Aerospace, founded in 1999 to create a modular set of space habitats for creating or expanding space stations, and NanoRacks, founded in 2009, which develops products and offers services for the commercial utilization of space. NanoRacks is hosting a CubeSat Deployer and equipment for experiments on the International Space Station. The last of the six is Orbital ATK Inc. (OA), a $4.5 billion company formed from the February 9, 2015, merger of Orbital Sciences Corp. and Alliant Techsystems. Through its Flight Systems, Defense Systems, and Space Systems group, Orbital researches, designs, develops, and manufactures rockets, rocket motors, satellites, and spacecraft. The stock has performed extremely well since the merger last year, posting a total return of 16.5% versus 6.2% for the S&P 500. That includes a recent steep selloff last week. In addition to the NASA project, Orbital management announced on August 10 that it would restate fiscal 2015 financial results and delay the announcement of its fiscal 2016 second-quarter earnings report. The stock was hit hard. But an internal investigation revealed that the accounting irregularities that gave rise to the restatement are limited to a single contract among Orbital’s top 30. Management reported that revenue was overstated by $100 million to $150 million and says the accounting error-related forward loss provision will reduce its fiscal 2015 after-tax net income by approximately $250 million to $280 million. The company doesn’t expect the restatement to have a material impact on future operating results, cash balances, or order backlog. The stock is now trading at 17.6 times trailing-12-month earnings, a steep discount to a recent high multiple of 22.5 times. And it’s yielding 1.6% at current levels. This looks like a decent opportunity to pick up a high-quality but beaten-down stock. That’s a pretty good way to look at NASA right now: high quality but beaten down. So the Chinese are going to the moon. Been there, done that. We’re going to Mars. Upticks, Downticks On Thursday, August 11, 2016, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq Composite all hit new highs on the same day, which hasn’t happened since December 31, 1999. The Russell 2000 – the primary gauge of small-cap stocks – lost just 0.6 last week to finish at 1229.82. The German economy, Europe’s biggest, grew 0.4% during the second quarter, slower than during the previous three-month period but faster than economists expected. U.S. retail sales were flat in July after three months of gains, including a 0.8% increase in June. Economists expected an increase of 0.4%. Excluding automobiles, retail sales were down 0.3%, the weakest showing since January. Baltimore’s own Michael Phelps added four more Olympic Gold Medals to his collection, including a win in the 100 meter butterfly over South Africa’s most famous horse’s ass, Chad Le Clos. 401(k) balances have increased very little in the last 10 years.

Cascadia Advocate Offering daily news and analysis from the majestic Evergreen State and beyond, The Advocate is the Northwest Progressive Institute's unconventional perspective on world, national, and local politics. « Did Melania Trump plagiarize from First Lady Michelle Obama’s speech at the 2008 DNC? It’s official: Hillary Clinton has chosen Virginia Senator Tim Kaine as her running mate » Wednesday, July 20th, 2016 More chaos at RNC as Ted Cruz refuses to endorse Donald Trump, gets booed off stage So much for party unity: Republican leaders attempted Wednesday to steer their national convention in a more substantive and unified direction behind GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, but their efforts came up against an eruption of lingering bitterness from the brutal primary campaign season. The capstone of the evening was supposed to be a speech by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the newly named vice-presidential nominee. But the more riveting moment came earlier, when Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) pointedly refused to endorse Trump, who had bested him in the race for the nomination, and urged Republicans to “vote your conscience.” Cruz’s decision not to get behind Trump angered Trump’s loyal delegates, who began loudly booing and shouting at him as he attempted to wrap up his speech. You can see the spectacle for yourself courtesy of C-SPAN (at around the twenty minute mark, Trump’s backers begin to make their displeasure known): Trump himself made his displeasure known by deliberately walking out into the hall just as Cruz was delivering the final lines of his speech, waving to his backers and giving them the thumbs up sign. The networks immediately pivoted away from Cruz to Trump’s planned retributive interruption, and while Cruz could still be heard speaking, viewers were seeing Trump onscreen instead. Trump also belittled Cruz on Twitter. “Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn’t honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!” Trump tweeted. Uh huh. The Clinton campaign, meanwhile, sent out an email neatly summarizing all of Cruz’s denunciations of Trump from earlier this year, saying it’s understandable that Cruz wouldn’t want to make an endorsement. [T]o be fair, would you want to endorse a guy who threatened to “spill the beans” on your wife and accused your dad of maybe killing JFK? No, you’d probably say things like this: Cruz: “Donald, you’re a sniveling coward.” Cruz: “Donald does seem to have an issue with women. Donald doesn’t like strong women.” Cruz: “Donald doesn’t do very well in foreign policy [because] he doesn’t have even a basic modicum of knowledge.” Cruz: “Donald has had a long career of using great wealth and power trying to bully others.” Cruz said Trump was “engaging in demagoguery.” Cruz: “Of course it’s inappropriate to be attacking a federal judge’s race or ethnicity” Cruz: “Donald’s campaign, his entire campaign is built on a lie.” Ouch! The Seattle Times’ Jim Brunner reports that after Cruz’s speech, he had an encounter with Washington State Republican Party Chair Susan Hutchison, who has ingloriously turned into one of Trump’s biggest local boosters: Hutchison ran into Cruz, the former Trump rival for the Republican presidential nomination, near an elevator at the Quicken Loans Arena. She said she told him his speech was “inexcusable” and called him a “traitor to the party.” The encounter was awkward given that Washington’s delegation is stacked with Cruz supporters. It wasn’t all that long ago that Susan Hutchison wanted to lead King County, the state’s largest jurisdiction. Nowadays, though, Hutchison feels contempt for King County — and Seattle in particular — because it’s a Democratic bastion: When state GOP chairman Susan Hutchison announced Washington’s votes for Trump in the traditional roll call of the states Tuesday, she talked about wheat fields, volcanoes and Boeing planes. She didn’t mention the Space Needle, the Seahawks or any other reference to the state’s biggest city. That was no accident, Hutchison told delegates at Wednesday’s breakfast meeting. “I specifically left out Seattle this year,” she said, citing the state’s “massive Democratic votes” year after year. “It’s just time for the people of the rest of the state to recognize how important they are.” Huh? It’s ironic that Hutchison has been engaging in so much Seattle-bashing lately, considering it’s the place she calls home. She and her family live in Laurelhurst, which is one of the more affluent neighborhoods in the city. They evidently like our state’s largest city enough to live there in spite of its progressive politics. Hutchison’s petty, silly diatribes against Seattle are misplaced. Seattle and King County aren’t the reason why Democrats consistently win statewide contests, for they can be outvoted. It’s counties like Snohomish, cities like Bellingham, and coastal communities like Port Townsend or Aberdeen that have delivered Washington for Democratic candidates time and again. King County’s turnout as a whole has actually been known to lag behind the statewide average, especially in midterm and odd numbered years. However, it picks up in presidential years (as does turnout in many swing counties west of the Cascades), driven in part by Democratic get out the vote efforts. Seattle trash talk may feel therapeutic for the militant right wing Republicans who view the city as an obstacle in the way of their schemes to turn Washington into the next Wisconsin, but it’s not going to broaden their party’s appeal. The things Seattelites want are the same things that Washingtonians from every corner of the state want: great public schools, equality for all, safe neighborhoods, broad prosperity, fair taxes, clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and the protection of our wild and majestic places for future generations. Republicans’ past attempts to pit suburban and rural voters against Seattle voters have ended in failure, but they haven’t seem to have learned much of anything from those experiences. Their bitterness is showing. Like what you just read? Or found it thought-provoking? Donate to help NPI continue publishing substantive commentary and analysis here on the Cascadia Advocate.

If we learned anything from 1980 Carter vs Reagan, scare tactics (however real they can be) will only solidify the opposition. We are on very tricky ground.

A “patriot,” by definition, is one who loves and strongly supports or fights for his or her country. Patriotism does not exclusively belong to those who serve in the military or those who recite the pledge, created 116 years after the founding of our republic. There are many more who have served this country bravely that never once donned a uniform or carried a weapon (read President John F. Kennedy’s Profiles in Courage). What most of our super patriot neighbors don’t know about this common civic ceremony is that it was written in 1892 by the socialist Christian minister Francis Bellamy (1855-1931) with the hope that it would bind the open wounds of the American Civil War and unite the nation in a common creed of “liberty and justice for all”— healing a still divided nation.  These same ideals were enunciated in the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson in 1776. The essential words of that founding document give both light and interpretation to the U.S. Constitution’s meaning, which reads, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Note that Jefferson and the rest of the founding fathers avoided the use of the word “God” in this document. The original Pledge of Allegiance written by a Christian minister, avoided making the same mistake, but we now find it inserted into this oft-recited 1952 version, a legacy inherited from the McCarthy Era witch hunts against communists, who by definition were atheists. It seems that once every decade I have to remind readers of this paper and others that the Pledge of Allegiance is not an expression of patriotism demanded by the state, or even legally required for entry into the discourse at our local neighborhood councils, several of which in San Pedro, are now turning the Pledge into a mandatory exercise. It has even been the ceremonial protocol for the opening of every chamber of commerce meeting—as if patriotism was a necessary requirement for engaging in free enterprise in the ever-globalized marketplace. The list accompanying a new report from the Partnership for a New American Economy found some surprising information, Steve Jobs, the famous co-founder of Apple, is a child of an immigrant parent from Syria. Walt Disney was a child of a Canadian immigrant; the founders of Oracle are from Russia and Iran; IBM (Germany); Clorox (Ireland); Boeing (Germany); 3M (Canada); and Home Depot (Russia). Not only do we not demand military service from the founders of this elite group of Fortune 500 corporations, we don’t even require their loyalty in business to this nation. The Pledge is not a requirement of law but has been adopted by custom. Saying the Pledge is reinforced by regimentation in schools and by protocols at some public ceremonies. But when the words are examined they are at best “aspirational” towards liberty and justice and they avoid pledging any loyalty to an underlying creed of this nation as expressed in both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Bill of Rights.  It would be better, as I suggested back in the 1980s, for the Pledge to be updated as follows: A Patriot’s Pledge of Allegiance I pledge allegiance to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights Of the United States of America and to the ideals for which they stand; Among these are the rights of the people to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, with freedom and justice for all. There is no need to mention God or the flag, which is merely a symbol, or that we are indivisible. It goes without saying that we as a nation of people are often divided and take great liberty to express those divisions whenever and wherever we choose. The creed behind the symbol is what we as a nation should be pledging allegiance too, not a piece of cloth. However, it was an exquisite form of irony to see Muslim immigrant, Khizr Khan, father of a U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004, ask Donald Trump if he had ever read the U.S. Constitution. One might ask the same question to those who are now demanding that every meeting of a neighborhood council start with the politically outdated pledge. How many of you have a copy in your coat pocket that you could pull out the next time you are stopped by the authorities? Perhaps reading the Constitution should be a mandatory step for anyone wearing a uniform and elected to office.   Tags: Donald Trump, Francis Bellany, james preston allen, Khizr Khan, patriotic, Pledge of Allegiance, U.S. Constitution, Unpatritotic Related Posts Fig Trees Are Like Democracies → American Fascist: Hope Falls, Apprentice Rises → America Experiences a Stunning Defeat → Election 2016: NO on Measure M → 2 Responses to What it Means to be a Patriot Pingback: What it Means to be a Patriot – Los Angeles Metro Bugle John Barbieri says: August 5, 2016 at 11:00 am This is among the best and most timely of James Preston Allen’s many columns. .Few aspects of American history are as misunderstood as the events and men of Revolutionary War America.

A Russian delegation headed by Alexander Potapov, Deputy Minister of Industry & Trade of the Russian Federation, put forward this proposal before Indian officials of the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion in New Delhi. A statement released by India’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry says, “In the civil Aviation sector, the Russian side declared its readiness to participate in the “Make in India” program in order to develop technological and production capabilities of the Indian side in this field and potential supplies of the jointly produced equipment to third countries.” Russia wants to introduce Sukhoi Superjet 100 (SSJ100) civilian aircraft in India and has a target set to put out at least 50 SSJ100 in the next three to five years. Sukhoi expects to sign a deal this year with Tata Advanced System to manufacture key airplane parts in India. Russia’s proposal to take part in the ‘Make in India’ program comes soon after the announcement of the New Civil Aviation Policy by India which says, “India will provide fiscal and monetary incentives and fast-track clearances to global original equipment manufacturers and their ancillary suppliers. In the event that the cost of Made-in-India aircraft and components work out to be higher than those supplied from their original sources, the government will consider an incentive package to nullify the cost differential.” © AP Photo/ Sergey Ponomarev Russian Company Ready to Supply Fighters for New Indian Aircraft CarrierIndia is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world and is expected to displace the UK as the third largest market by 2026 while Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, a consulting firm, predicts that domestic air traffic of Indian civil aviation market likely to surpass 100 million by 2018 as compared to 81 million in 2015-16. Keeping in mind the growth of the air traffic, Boeing, the US-based aircraft manufacturer, projects a demand for 1,850 new aircraft in India over the next 20 years. Value of this demand will be approximately worth USD 265 billion. However, Ministry of Commerce & Industry itself projected a demand of 800 aircrafts by year 2020. Apart from manufacturing aircraft, there are vast opportunities in Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) as well. According to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, “The MRO business of Indian carriers is around USD 751 million, 90% of which is currently spent outside India – in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, UAE etc.” The Indian government is keen to develop India as an MRO hub in Asia, attracting business from foreign airlines. ...

NASA Selects Six Companies to Develop Prototypes, Concepts for Deep Space Habitats by Staff Writers Washington DC (SPX) Aug 18, 2016 Concept image of the interior of a deep space habitat. Image courtesy NASA. For a larger version of this image please go here. NASA has selected six U.S. companies to help advance the Journey to Mars by developing ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, Appendix A, NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our Journey to Mars. The selected companies are: + Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas + Boeing of Pasadena, Texas + Lockheed Martin of Denver + Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia + Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado + NanoRacks of Webster, Texas "NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we're utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors," said Jason Crusan, director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems. "The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth." The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The contract award amounts are dependent on contract negotiations, and NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that's still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects, such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment using SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles. In addition to U.S. industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable fully operational deep space habitation capability. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. AES is pioneering innovative approaches and public-private partnerships to rapidly develop prototype systems, advance key capabilities, and validate operational concepts for future human missions beyond Earth orbit.

The Ariane 5 has been integrated for the upcoming VA232 launch of the Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 satellites on Wednesday, August 24th from French Guiana. Designated Flight VA232, the mission will be Arianespace’s sixth launch in 2016, and the fourth using a heavy-lift Ariane 5 this year. Its two payloads will be the 57th and 58th satellites launched by Arianespace for Intelsat which continues a relationship that began in 1983 as the US-based operator developed a network to deliver high-quality, cost-effective video and broadband services worldwide. During preparation activity for Flight VA232 in the Spaceport’s Final Assembly Building, Intelsat 36 was installed atop the Ariane 5’s core stages on Friday, positioning the 3,250-kg.-class spacecraft as the mission’s lower passenger. Followed this weekend by the lowering of the launcher’s “composite” consisting of Intelsat 33e, together with Ariane 5’s SYLDA dual-payload deployment system and the protective payload fairing into position over Intelsat 36. Deployed first during the mission to geostationary transfer orbit, Intelsat 33e, which has an estimated liftoff mass of 6,600 kg. is the second satellite in Intelsat’s next-generation high-throughput Intelsat Epic NG series. It joins Intelsat 29e, launched by Arianespace aboard another Ariane 5 in January.   This artist's rendering shows Boeing's Intelsat 33e, the first of the four satellites in the new contract. Built by Boeing using a 702MP spacecraft platform and operating from an orbital slot of 60 deg. East, Intelsat 33e’s Ku- and C-band coverage will meet broadband demand for carrier-grade telecom services, enterprise networks, aeronautical connectivity and certain media services. The satellite’s Ku-band spot beams are to provide broadband services for Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, while a Ku-band wide beam provides broadcast coverage of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Its C-band spot beams will cover high traffic telecommunications centers in Europe, Central Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia; while a C-band wide beam is to deliver coverage over sub-Saharan Africa for data and media services. The Intelsat 36 satellite, built for Intelsat S.A., is designed to provide media and content distribution services in Africa and South Asia. Completing Arianespace’s Flight VA232 at 41 minutes after liftoff will be the separation of Intelsat 36, which is designed to enhance Intelsat’s media neighborhoods serving the South African and Indian Ocean region. Manufactured by SSL (Space Systems/Loral) on a 1300 platform, its Ku-band payload was built to support the MultiChoice direct-to-home service in South Africa. Intelsat 36’s C-band relay capacity provides in-orbit resilience for the company’s video content distribution neighborhood at the orbital slot of 68.5 degrees East – where the satellite will be co-located with Intelsat 20, which was launched by Arianespace in August 2012.

These headlines are in my opinion as a result of the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) decision to withhold its manifesto launch for fear of it being copied by their opponent as suspected to have been done with the free senior high school policy. This article will attempt to explain why these two political parties are withholding their manifestos, the strategy behind it and the options available to both parties from the writer’s perspective. Why withhold your manifesto? In most high literate and information efficient societies, the best ideas that addresses the needs and concerns of the citizenry sells in the political space and this explains why both the NPP and NDC will want to portray themselves as the party with the best policies and programs. It also further explains the posturing where the two dominant players in Ghanaian politics (NPP and NDC) will like to spy on each other on the policies and programs they want to sell out to the electorate before coming out with a policy program or manifesto. Whiles the spying and “wait and see” approach remains, one party will eventually have to take the first step. Putting out its policies and programs in the public domain and risk the possibility of the opposing party copying and colonizing. The NPP in recent history appears to have adopted the first mover strategy and strategically positioned itself as the party with the big ideas that will bring the desired changes we yearn for as a nation. Flagship programs like the Capitation Grants, Free Senior High School and most recently One-District One-Factory are and will be credited to the party. The NDC on the other hand may have opted for the fast second strategy knowingly or unknowingly. They have a strong team that can colonize or repackage policies and programs of their opponents almost simultaneously in a manner that evades detection. This may purely be a tactical strategy by the NDC and does not impugn the absence of creative minds within the NDC. What is “First Mover” Strategy? First mover is a term or business strategy that describes perceived competitive advantage a business or organization obtains by virtue of being the first to bring a specific product or service to the market. Those who opt for this strategy are of the opinion that, being first typically enables a company to establish strong brand recognition and customer loyalty before other entrants to the market arise. This strategy involves significant investment in research and development in new product or service offering and it’s relatively expensive as compared to the fast second strategy. Politically the product or service offering in the context of this strategy is the policies and programs offered by the political parties and who puts it out first. The benefits associated with this strategy however appears to be a myth in the corporate world and by extension the political space as there is considerable research that highlights the weakness of this strategy. Below table shows that coming out with an innovative ideas may not automatically inure to the benefits of the innovator or inventor. Table 1 Unsuccessful Pioneers of Radically New Technologies. Pioneer Technology Year Robert W. Thompson Pneumatic tire 1845 Thomas Saint, Walter Hunt and Others Sewing machine 1790–1851 Stanley brothers, Colonel Automobile 1897–1905 Henry Mill, Xavier, Projean and others Typewriter 1714–1878 Valdemar Poulsen Magnetic tape recorder 1899 Alexander Parkes and Daniel Spills Artificial plastics 1866–69 Juan de la Cierva Helicopter 1930 John Baird and Francis Jenkins Television 1924 Frank Whittle Jet Engine 1930 Transitron, Philco, and Germanium Products Transistor 1952–55 Biologicals DNA synthesizing machine 1981 Source: Francisco-Javier Olleros, “Emerging Industries and the Burnout of Pioneers,” Journal of Product Innovation Management, March 1986, pp. 5–18. I guess most readers will be surprised at the unfamiliarity with the names in the table. You guys were looking out for names like Samsung, Rolls Royce and Boeing right? Those who have been brought up to believe in pioneering and first mover advantages should be having a rethink by now. The failure of this strategy in the business world remains widespread and even more so can serve as a learning tool in the political space. The NPP should therefore know that, bringing out the best ideas, and outdooring it first for the whole world to know how innovative the party is, may not be the best strategy. The NPP’s biggest competitor, the NDC is well resourced and has the capacity to almost simultaneously colonize or repackage those ideas and deliver to a less literate and information inefficient society through their efficient propaganda machinery and reaping the benefits that come with those ideas. What is “Fast Second” Strategy? A fast second strategy differs from a first mover. A first-mover strategy would involve getting into the market quickly and producing your own product or service, hoping that your product emerges dominant design. A second-mover strategy would involve waiting for the dominant player to be completely established and accepted in the market and then producing a me-too product under that standard. A fast-second strategy, however, involves waiting for the dominant design to begin to emerge and then moving in to be part of it, colonize it and make it your own or repackage it. Research has shown that those who time their entry so they appear just when a dominant design/product or service offering is about to emerge or resonate mostly attain unassailable benefits over the innovator (first movers). The political space is no different from the business community in the context of new product/service and the time for which it is offered. Fast second strategy in a low literate society like ours is a much potent option than first mover strategy. What are the options for the NPP? • Highlight the negatives of the ruling party and suggest alternatives whiles you keep your flagship policies to your chest for now. • The campaign mantra that the NPP has no message going into the election because they have not launched their manifesto has minimal consequence since the Ghanaian populace is largely information inefficient and therefore should be ignored by the NPP • Postpone your manifesto launch again and gauge the feedback from the NDC. Any attempt by the NDC to shift their launch again will inure to the benefit of NPP in terms of public opinion. What are the options for the NDC? • Trumpet your achievement more aggressively and proceed to launch your manifesto to dispel the notion that you want copy that of the NPP. • Your propaganda machinery is much stronger and any differentiated alternatives offered by the NPP in their manifesto could be countered strategically. What is the option for the Ghanaians? It’s all about strategy, so read in-between the lines and vote accordingly.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other By sea, land and space – Busy week for SpaceX hardware August 17, 2016 by Chris Bergin As the landed booster from the JCSAT-16 mission sailed into Port Canaveral on Wednesday, the next first stage – set to launch September’s Amos-6 mission – is expected to complete a road trip to Cape Canaveral over the coming days. Meanwhile, robotic assets on the ISS have removed the IDA-2 payload from the trunk of the CRS-9 Dragon on Thursday morning. By Sea: It has only been just over four months since the first booster to be recovered at sea sailed into Port Canaveral on the deck of the Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship (ASDS). That milestone came via the landing of the first stage involved with helping push the CRS-8 Dragon on a path towards the International Space Station. It was only the second time SpaceX had successfully landed a booster, following up on the LZ-1 landing of the OG-2 first stage. Since then, SpaceX has enjoyed more successes, both on land and at sea, with the JCSAT-16 mission showing further refinement to the company’s approach. With JCSAT-16 launched on the more challenging Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) mission – when compared to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) destinations – SpaceX has previously added a three engine landing burn, designed to counter the high velocity of the return. See Also LIVE: F9 JCSAT-16 Launch Updates SpaceX Missions Section L2 SpaceX Section Click here to Join L2 However, for this landing, SpaceX returned to a single engine landing burn, firing the center Merlin 1D engine for a longer duration, citing more control on the approach to the ASDS, but also – and importantly – reducing the stress on the stage during its landing. Utilizing lessons learned from the JCSAT-14 mission, where the landed stage suffered “max damage” from its landing, the single engine landing burn for the JCSAT-16 stage will provide vital data points into how that stage has fared after its return, not least when compared to the JCSAT-14 booster. Heading into Port Canaveral on Wednesday, the booster was offloaded within four hours of arrival, will be safed on the dockside and then transported to the 39A Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) for inspections. The aim will be to eventually prepare it for a future re-flight, which is the next major goal for SpaceX in its ongoing reusability aspirations. Notably, several static fire tests on the “max damage” JCSAT-14 stage at SpaceX’s test center in McGregor are playing a major part in pushing towards that historic milestone, with the potential for a re-flight mission of a returned booster to occur this year. By Land: Meanwhile, SpaceX’s primary missions continue to be lined up for their upcoming launch dates, with the next mission set for September 3 (Window 0300-0500 Eastern). That mission will involve the launch of the Amos-6 satellite, launching from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral. The Amos-6 satellite, built by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), will provide communication services including direct satellite home internet for Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. The booster for this mission was static fired at McGregor, as per the usual process of firing up all nine Merlin 1D engines to validate the health of the stage’s propulsive systems, prior to being removed from the test stand for transportation. Although SpaceX doesn’t publicize its transport schedules, it was expected to be sent on a road trip to the Cape this week. However, there has been a large amount of flooding along the route usually taken by stages in transit, which may delay its arrival at the Cape, although it will still be at the launch site in plenty of time ahead of the latest launch date target, with its static fire now showing on L2 schedules as September 1. By Space: In space, the CRS-9 Dragon is in the latter segment of her berthed mission at the ISS and is looking forward to handing over her trunk payload. See Also LIVE: CRS-9 Berthed Updates EVA-36 UPDATES L2 SpaceX Section Click here to Join L2 After her arrival at the orbital outpost, Expedition 48 crewmembers began to offload the 1,790 kg (3,946 lb) of cargo in the pressurized module. They have since started to reload the vehicle with downmass that will be returned to Earth when Dragon splashes down in the Pacific later this month. However, first up is the removal of the 467-kilogram (1,030 lb) International Docking Adapter 2 (IDA-2), located in the unpressurized trunk section of the spacecraft. The International Docking Adapters are devices designed to convert APAS-95 docking mechanisms – which were used by the Space Shuttle – to the new NASA Docking System (NDS) or Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) standard which is to be used by future US manned vehicles including the Dragon v2, Boeing CST-100 Starliner and Orion. IDA-2 will be affixed to the docking port of Pressurised Mating Adaptor 2 (PMA-2), at the aft end of the Harmony module. Preparations for Wednesday night’s task began with the Mobile Transporter (MT) relocating to Worksite 6. This transition allowed for the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to be in position to translate the Dextre robot towards Dragon’s trunk. Grappling operations began around 11pm UTC – with the adaptor clear of the trunk via ground robotic ops overnight. With the new adapter extracted, it is now being maneuvered to a point about three feet away from its installation point at PMA-2. On Friday, the final task of installation will take place, requiring the assistance of human hands. This will involve a 6.5 hour spacewalk (EVA-36) scheduled to begin Friday at 8:05 am EDT with astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins.

You clog it up, you can give Walmart a heart attack.” Photo: People's World (CC BY-NC 2.0) Where’s our economy headed? This is part two of our interview with Kim Moody, co-founder of this magazine and the author of many books on U.S. labor. Despite the hype about the “gig economy,” Moody argued in Part 1 that the bigger change most workers are experiencing is the rise of the crappy-job economy. On the bright side, he pointed out how just-in-time production has created huge concentrations of workers—and vast potential for organizing. In Part 2, we ask Moody about corporate mergers, the changing demographics of the U.S. workforce, and what it will take to organize the South: Labor Notes: Increased competition between corporations has led to massive mergers. What has been the impact on workers? Kim Moody: It’s in the mid-’90s that this new mergers and acquisitions wave took hold. It was fundamentally different from the big mergers and acquisitions waves of the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s. Those mostly were about conglomeration—companies buying up all different kinds of production, finance, and everything you can get your hands on. Diversification would be another word for it. The mergers of the mid-’90s forward have gone in the opposite direction. More companies are shedding unrelated divisions. For example, General Electric and General Motors used to have huge financial divisions and they dumped those, even though they were moneymakers. All these major industries have seen mergers that are creating bigger employers. In some industries the concentrations are huge. If you look at trucking, UPS is this massive employer that it wasn’t 20 years ago. UPS is in every field of logistics—not just in delivery or even in trucking, but also in air freight. So companies are buying up things that are in their basic core competencies. The structure of ownership has been realigned in a way similar to the first half of the 20th century, when unions, including the CIO, organized these big corporations. This concentration of ownership along industrial lines means that there are more economically rational structures now in which unions can organize. So you would no longer see a situation where the union strikes one division but the company has plenty of unrelated divisions that are still making profits. Right. And when you put that together with the logistics revolution, you begin to get a picture of what I’m calling “the new terrain of class conflict.” We are dealing with production systems, of both goods and services, that are far more tightly integrated than they used to be, and companies that are bigger, more capital-intensive, and more economically rational. So unions should be able to take advantage of the vulnerable points in just-in-time logistics and production to bring some of these new giants to heel. The old idea of industrial unionism might have a new lease on life if—and it is a big if—the unions can take advantage of this situation. My view is that this is going to have to come from the grassroots of the labor movement. Or those who today are not organized, like the people in warehouses. There is a potential that really hasn’t existed in well over half a century. The consolidation of industry and the whole logistics revolution: these things have only come together in the last 10 or 15 years. When workers and unions in these industries—and many of these industries have unions in pieces of them—look at this situation, it’s something they’re not used to yet. It usually takes a generation for the workforce to realize the power that it has, and the points of vulnerability. This was the case when mass production developed in the early 20th century. It took pretty close to a generation before the upheaval of the ‘30s. New Book Secrets of a successful organizer A step-by-step guide to building power on the job. Buy Now. » Another important change has been in the demographics of the working class. Can you talk about what those changes mean? This bears not only on unions but on American politics. An obvious change that has taken place in pretty much the same period—the ’80s up until now—and will continue on is the change in the racial and ethnic composition of the entire population, but particularly concentrated in the working class. For example, if you look at what the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls the “transportation and material moving” occupations in the ’80s, maybe 15 percent of those workers were either African American, Latino, or perhaps Asian. Today it is 40 percent. Workers of color now compose a much bigger proportion of the workforce, much of it due to immigration. The biggest growth, of course, is among Latino workers. Workers of color are now between 30 and 40 percent of union membership. It seems the right is making its own hay out of the changing demographics of the country. This is happening everywhere in the West. It is much easier to blame immigrants for the lack of jobs or housing or crowded schools than it is to figure out how to deal with the powers that be. So a lot of people turn towards these self-defeating ideas that they can solve their problems by closing off borders and sending people back, or by keeping Muslims out. We have the potential to have a phenomenally different kind of labor movement. It is going to be different from anything we have ever seen in the United States, or pretty much anywhere else, for that matter. That is, if we have a multicultural, multiracial labor movement that is larger and is growing and is taking advantage of the new terrain that we just talked about. A common tactic used by business is whipsawing workers against one another, using non-union areas of the country against union-dense areas. I am thinking of Boeing and South Carolina. Boeing got from Washington State the largest subsidy ever given to a company in the United States. And yet they still sent all those jobs to South Carolina, which also provided them with massive subsidies. How much of a hindrance has the inability to organize the South been for labor? The answer is massive. This goes all the way back to the end of the Second World War, and the amount of manufacturing value-added that was produced in the South just grew until the ’80s. The amount produced in the South continues to grow a little, but it has more or less leveled off. I have some ideas why. If you look at the auto parts industry, for example, in the last 10 or 15 years it has dramatically reorganized, one of the most dramatic reorganizations of any industry that I have seen. You have many fewer companies, and those that remain have gotten bigger. The bulk of them are in the Midwest and not in the South. A huge percentage of them are actually in Michigan. Of course, they are nonunion. So I am not saying that the South is not important. You won’t crack manufacturing until the South is unionized. These big corporations do whipsaw. But given the new structure of these industries and the logistics revolution, there is a possibility of counter-whipsawing. Say you have a union drive at a South Carolina plant and you want to cut off production there, to force management to recognize the union. My guess is that you can find suppliers, if they are unionized or can be unionized, whether they are in the South or Midwest, that can strike and close down that plant. Given the rise of these tight new logistics systems, unions can counter-whipsaw by closing down suppliers or even the transport links, and thereby starve management at these Southern plants into submission. That would require the cooperation of many different unions—but they have to begin thinking about that if they are ever going to organize the South.

NASA will live stream the event starting at 6.30am ET. The IDA forms to be an important element of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative in which private companies will come up with space taxis for NASA. The space taxis will be used to take agency’s astronauts to and from the ISS. The docking adapter has reached at the ISS on July 20. The adapter was transported in SpaceX’s Dragon trunk rather than in Dragon capsule. In fact, the IDA is present in the trunk since it has reached at the ISS. On August 17, the ISS’s robotic arm will removed the IDA from the trunk and place it around three feet away from the port and will there until the spacewalk. On Friday, the astronauts will start early to install the IDA. At around 8.05 am ET, Rubins and Williams will leave the ISS and carry out the process of attaching the IDA to its port. Already, preperations have been done to help the installation run smoothly. In earlier spacewalks, astronauts will position all the necessary cables that Rubins and Williams will attach to the docking adapter to give it power and connectivity. Takuya Onishi of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency will be helping both the astronauts. Onishi will be present in the ISS at the time of the spacewalk. He would be managing control panel inside the station that will help connect the IDA to its port. “There’s a very coordinated interplay between the external crew outside, Tak on the outside, and the ground doing the commanding”, affirmed Zeb Scoville, the spacewalk flight director.

The ministry says its jets took off earlier in the day on Wednesday from a base southwest of the Iranian capital, Tehran, to strike targets in the east of Syria. It says they destroyed two command posts and two training camps. Iran on Tuesday allowed Russian warplanes to take off from its territory to bomb targets in Syria, for the first time since Russia launched its operation in the war-torn Arab nation last year.” Story Continued Below — THE FLIGHTS FROM IRAN SIGNAL GROWING RUSSIAN INFLUENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST: Russia’s bombing runs from an Iranian air base are a first for Moscow — and signal growing cooperation between Iran and Russia. Tuesday was the first time a foreign military operated from Iranian soil since at least World War II, according to The New York Times, which has more on the arrangement here: “The arrangement, permanent or not, enables Russia to bring more firepower to the Syrian conflict, and far greater military flexibility. Analysts said the new arrangement could also expand Moscow’s political influence in the Middle East and speed the growing convergence of interests between Moscow and Tehran. From the air base, in Hamadan, northwest Iran, the Russian bombers destroyed ammunition dumps and a variety of targets linked to the Islamic State and other groups that had been used to support militants battling in Aleppo, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement. “Historians and American officials said on Tuesday that the Iranian decision to let Russia base its planes and support operations in Iran — even temporarily — was a historic one. ‘This didn’t even happen under the shah,’ said John Limbert, a former American foreign service officer stationed in Iran, referring to the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from 1941 to 1979.” — MOVE SENDS A MESSAGE TO U.S., writes the AP: “Russia's use of an Iranian air base to bomb targets in Syria sends a message to Washington as it weighs a military partnership with Moscow: Join us or we'll look to your enemies. Tuesday's missions were unprecedented. Iran allowed Russian warplanes to take off from its territory to strike opposition targets in Syria. The move came with little notice to the United States, which has watched helplessly the escalating bloodshed near Aleppo, the country's biggest city, and even offered an alliance with Russia against Islamic State and other extremist fighters as a way to get Syria's government out of the fight.” — WHAT’S PUTIN UP TO IN UKRAINE? Reuters examines Moscow’s latest moves on that front: “Ukraine says it thinks Vladimir Putin is planning a new invasion, and it's not hard to see why: the Russian leader has built up troops on its border and resumed the hostile rhetoric that preceded his annexation of Crimea two years ago. But despite appearances, some experts say Putin is more likely seeking advantage through diplomacy than on the battlefield, at least this time around. “‘It's about sanctions,’ Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a Moscow-based foreign policy think tank close to the Russian Foreign Ministry, told Reuters. ‘It looks like a way of increasing pressure on Western participants of the Minsk peace process,’ he said of a peace deal set up for eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists have battled against government forces.” HAPPY WEDNESDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we’re always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback.

HAPPENING TODAY — TRUMP TO BEGIN RECEIVING INTEL BRIEFINGS, via ABC News: “Certain staffers in the FBI's New York Field Office have been told to expect a special guest tomorrow: Donald Trump. He is scheduled to receive his first classified briefing as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, according to sources notified of the upcoming visit. Trump is planning to take with him New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who has become an outspoken supporter of Trump, a senior campaign official said. “Career staffers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the nation's top intelligence office, will be leading the briefing, which is expected to cover major threats and emerging concerns around the world.” — Trump gets praise from a Republican critic: South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has been one of Trump’s harshest Republican critics, but he offered praise for his terrorism speech on Monday. "The one thing I thought Donald Trump did very well was give a damning indictment, like a prosecutor of Obama’s failed foreign policy," Graham said in a "Kilmeade & Friends" radio interview. "And it is true, whether people want to believe it or not — I believe it — that without Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq and failure to intervene in Syria in a timely way, that there would be no ISIL." — A campaign shakeup: Trump has tapped pollster Kellyanne Conway as campaign manager and Breitbart News Chairman Stephen Bannon as campaign chief executive, our colleagues Matthew Nussbaum and Ken Vogel report. INDUSTRY INTEL — TOP DEFENSE LOBBYISTS PLAN MEETING WITH CLINTON CAMPAIGN, reports our colleague Ellen Mitchell: “The Aerospace Industries Association plans to confer with advisers to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to discuss key defense industry issues, its chief executive said Tuesday. AIA CEO and President David Melcher told POLITICO the association would meet with ‘advisers to the Clinton campaign … sometime soon,’ but offered few other details. Melcher did say the session would be similar to that the leading defense trade association had in June in New York with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. “‘We talked about sequestration and the impact it’s having on the industry. We talked about trade and the need to do a better job for foreign military sales. And we talked about over-regulation that could be and should be reduced, which was a topic that was repeated by many industries,’ Melcher said of the two-hour meeting that reportedly included representatives of Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, among other defense contractors.” WAR REPORT — CONVOY OF ISLAMIC STATE FIGHTERS ALLOWED TO LEAVE MANBIJ, via the AP: “A couple hundred vehicles of Islamic State fighters were allowed to leave the northern Syrian city of Manbij as U.S.-backed forces seized the town in recent days because the militants had civilians with them, according to a U.S. military official. The official said Tuesday that some of the IS fighters may have already made their way into Turkey, but many are still in Syria. “Col. Chris Garver, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting IS, told Pentagon reporters that the decision to let the convoy leave the city was made by commanders of the Syrian Democratic Forces. He said there were civilians in each of the vehicles, and the military wanted to avoid casualties. He added that he doesn't know how many of the civilians may have been in the cars voluntarily, but some were likely hostages.” — WHY MANBIJ COULD BE A MODEL FOR BATTLING ISIL: The Washington Post reports the Pentagon wants the recent U.S.-backed campaign to be a model for future operations in Syria: “U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the campaign publicly, said the Manbij offensive illustrated the value of the small force of U.S. Special Operations troops now on the ground in Syria, as they directed U.S. air strikes and advised Syrian forces during an intense urban fight. “‘Our operating concept has been validated,’ said a senior defense official. ‘Utilizing local forces and our own Special Operations forces, partnered with overwhelming coalition air power, and enough time — the Islamic State really doesn’t have an answer to it.’” TOP DOC — U.S. TROOP AND CONTRACTOR NUMBERS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN: A new report from the Congressional Research Service tracks the levels of U.S. military forces and contractor personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade. The non-partisan research agency breaks down the levels of military personnel as well as Defense Department contractors on a quarterly basis beginning with the final quarter of 2007. The CRS also tracks the number of private security contractors in both countries. The report counts up to 4,087 U.S. troops in Iraq as of July — reflecting a cap that was increased to 4,647 that month — as well as 2,485 Pentagon contractors in Iraq. There were also 8,730 U.S. troops and 28,626 Pentagon contractors in Afghanistan as of March, according to the report. NSA WEBSITE GOES DOWN AMID POSSIBLE CYBER THEFT, reports our colleague Eric Geller: “The National Security Agency’s website was offline for almost a full day until Tuesday evening, in an unexplained outage that began shortly after hackers claimed to have stolen a collection of the agency's prized cyber weapons. It's unknown if the two events are connected. “POLITICO first noticed that the agency’s website wasn’t working at 10:54 p.m. Monday. It came back online around 5 p.m. Tuesday. The outage began a few hours after a mysterious group called the Shadow Brokers claimed to have stolen cyber weapons from the Equation Group, a sophisticated hacking group suspected of being linked to the NSA.” MAKING MOVES — SALAZAR TO LEAD CLINTON TRANSITION TEAM: Former Interior Secretary and Colorado Sen.

News provided by STASH INVEST Aug 17, 2016, 08:00 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Aug. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Stash, one of the fastest-growing new financial services for Millennials, announced today that it has secured $9.25 million in Series A funding to further accelerate user growth and to build out its technology platform. The round was led by Goodwater Capital, which specializes in early-stage consumer technology companies, and Valar Ventures. Entrée Capital also participated in the round. Most Millennials find investing confusing, unrelatable, and intimidating. They simply don't trust Wall Street.  Stash is the solution for the millions of Americans traditionally ignored or taken advantage of by big investing firms. Stash is a community for people who want to start investing and who don't want to rely on a black box service to do it for them. It's a platform to help people take ownership and become confident investors. Brandon Krieg, CEO says, "My co-founder Ed and I left our jobs because we believe everyone should have access to financial opportunity. After a combined 30+ years in the business, we know that Wall Street can be fundamentally unfair to smaller investors and makes it hard for the individual investor to accomplish their goals. We want to create real change - the kind that transforms the financial literacy gap and narrows the vast division of wealth that plagues our country." Stash investors are the real heroes in this story. Soldiers, nurses, Uber drivers, construction workers, and IT professionals alike are taking positive steps for their financial futures. Stash empowers people to declare "I'm an investor", transforming what has typically been stressful and intimidating into something that feels intuitive and simple. Stash investors want to do well and do good. They invest in a way that reflects who they are, building a portfolio of investments that aligns with their interests, beliefs and goals. Stash investors choose from a curated selection of ETFs. They purchase fractional shares, set up Auto-Stash to make recurring investments, and can start doing it all with as little as $5. Investment choices are simple, descriptive, and relatable. For example, users can invest in "Internet Titans" (online technology giants such as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook), "Young Money" (companies that stand to benefit from the increasing purchasing power of the Millennial generation such as LinkedIn, Amazon and Ebay), "Defending America" (aerospace and defense companies such as United Technologies, Boeing, Lockheed Martin), etc. There are no hidden fees, and Stash doesn't charge commissions for buying or selling investments or for transferring money in and out of accounts. There is a transparent subscription fee of $1 per month for accounts under $5000 and 0.25% a year for balances over $5,000. The first three months are free for everyone. Stash entered the investment advisory market late last year to equip people with the knowledge they need to start investing. Since launching on October 14, 2015, Stash has amassed over 150,000 investor accounts and almost 500,000 content subscribers. Stash is igniting a movement of next-generation investors. With the additional funding, they will reach millions of new investors, empowering them to start investing and take control of their financial future. About Stash Stash is on a mission to empower a new generation of investors, giving everyone access to financial opportunity. People can choose where to invest their money, starting with as little as $5, and receive ongoing guidance from the Stash Advisor. Based in New York City, Stash started in February 2015 by Wall Street veterans Brandon Krieg and Ed Robinson. Stash is a Registered Investment Adviser. For more information, visit StashInvest.com.

Budget Aviation Holdings also aims to raise the proportion of connected flights between its short-haul Tiger Airways and medium-to-long-haul Scoot brands from a single-digit percentage, its chief executive, Lee Lik Hsin, told Reuters today. “We do expect this (connectivity) to grow, and when I say grow I actually mean multiple fold,” Lee said. “The ingredients for being able to operate to Europe, we think we now have them — aircraft and connectivity.” Budget Aviation was created this year after parent Singapore Airlines took Tiger private and paired it with Scoot. Scoot announced its first Europe-bound flight yesterday. Regular flights between Singapore and Athens begin next year, bringing Scoot into competition with full-service Gulf carriers which have been increasing market share on Asia-Europe routes. Lee said he aimed to add more European routes, but did not elaborate on destinations or time frame. Airlines have been benefiting from a drop in oil prices as well as a travel boom in South-east Asia which has spurred many regional carriers to order several hundred aircraft from Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. “There is room for growth,” Lee said. “The overall travel market will continue to grow and the overall budget travel market will continue to grow.” Budget Aviation has nine Boeing 787 planes on order for Scoot, and 39 new-generation Airbus A320s for Tiger. Lee said his firm would for now continue to use only those two types of aircraft. Scoot and Tiger operate under separate licences but share an organisational structure for some functions and cost-saving via economies of scale. Bringing the two under the same brand or licence would involve regulatory, commercial and other considerations, of which an internal review would be necessary before making any commitment to change, Lee said. “Of course, we will not exclude any possibilities,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Mavcom: 69pc of air travellers in Malaysia unaware of rights Now, faster border checks for regular Malaysian visitors to the UK Actress Gwyneth Paltrow launches new travel app Obama writes travel essay for 'Lonely Planet' Embark on a 'Gilmore Girls' getaway in the real-life Stars Hollow Malindo Air drops new air fare promo starting from RM69 Check out National Geographic Traveler’s must-go destinations in 2017 Pokemon installations, activities launched at Changi Airport Langkawi International Airport to get expanded capacity Now, faster border checks for regular Malaysian visitors to the UK Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Despite AirAsia, Lion Air, top investor sees gap for ‘truly low-cost’ airlines in Asia Budget airlines set to soar in South-east Asia’s open skies World’s ‘biggest’ budget airline alliance takes off in Asia-Pacific Singapore Airlines turns to new jet to lure premium-paying flyers Norwegian to fly New York to Paris nonstop with fares from US$175 Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Robert "Bud" Duthie says he has the solution. Duthie has created a system using UVA and UVB rays that can purify water by removing organics and inorganics. Duthie said his technology can cleanse up to 50 gallons of water per minute. By Mike Ferguson The Ledger LAKE WALES — The state of Florida has a problem with toxic algae. Robert "Bud" Duthie says he has the solution. Duthie has created a system using UVA and UVB rays that can purify water by removing organics and inorganics. Duthie said his technology can cleanse up to 50 gallons of water per minute. “The researchers have found nothing in comparison,” Duthie, 70, said. “Florida has one of the biggest opportunities for it. In microseconds, we could kill blue-green algae. I've done (polychlorinated biphenyl) and phenol. Blue-green algae are nothing compared to those.” Toxic forms of blue-green algae found in the state's waterways have closed beaches on the Treasure Coast and infected large bodies of water in the Everglades as well as Lake Okeechobee, the nation's second largest lake. There have been reports of fish dying and people getting sick as a result of the toxic algae. “With the population growing the way it is, we have a real issue with water quality,” said Jim Vaughan, president of Lake Wales-based Texas Aquatic Harvesting, which works to clean up lakes. “Our lakes are filling up with mud and muck because they don't flush like they used to.” Duthie's patented product called the HellCat, which he produces through his company Synergena International in Orlando, can be scaled larger to run continuously through major lakes using a tractor trailer as the docking station. At least, so he thinks. Right now, Duthie has a travel device called the H-cat that could be used by missionaries, campers or local government emergency service organizations. The Micro HellCat is a middle-sized system. “It's as simple as this,” Duthie said. “I can make bigger tubes and we can run it through the lakes.” Duthie gave a demonstration recently at American Legion Post 71 All Veterans Center in Lake Wales, which Vaughan saw. He applauds Duthie's efforts. “We've got to come up with something to clean this water,” he said. “I would love for this to work. There's a possibility it could work if they develop more volume. Right now, it appears to be too small of a scale.” Duthie, a Buffalo native who now lives in Ocala and an engineer by trade, has master's degrees in education, mathematics and computer science. Duthie first started experimenting with light waves as a purification tool in 1984 while working with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. There he developed technology that could sterilize surgical steel in 10 seconds, rather than the previous 20 minutes, and could be used in the operating room. In the latter part of the 1990s, Duthie used nano-photonic technology to remove pulp from fruit juice. In 2001, his technology was used to combat Anthrax. Duthie was hired by Boeing in 2004 to construct water purification systems. “We blew the doors off anyone doing anything with water,” Duthie said. “The microbiologists at the University of Buffalo were literally blown away.” “He's had several demonstrations that really seem to clean up the water,” said Scott Wallen, a research chemist and technician at Florida Polytechnic University in Lakeland. “We need to start taking specific species of algae, so we can quantify it. This definitely kills the organisms.” Duthie said he was set to receive a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Navy for the H-Cat, but once the military branch saw the technology, it was shrugged off as conventional ultraviolet technology. “He's using a variety of wave lengths, not just the standard UVC,” Wallen said. “That's the most important thing about this.” According to a test run at the State University of New York at Buffalo, Duthie's technology was able to kill every bit of E. Coli from a half inch sample of water in seven seconds. In that same time frame, conventional ultraviolet rays killed less than 5 percent. Duthie said he had been working with Florida Poly to obtain a $50,000 grant from the Hinkley Center in Tallahassee, but was turned down because the university is not yet accredited. The end game for Duthie is producing large scale units to be used for purifying waterways internationally. Duthie said he sees Polk County as a perfect area to do the manufacturing because it has, and is in close proximity to, so many lakes. He said his company could employ between 250 and 500 people locally and as many as 5,000 internationally. “I don't need highly skilled labor because we'd have a lot of assembly jobs,” Duthie said. “We have the capabilities of going into other industries and we could grow this.” For this to happen, Duthie said, he needs a contract. He sees the federal government as the perfect partner since his technology could service the water bodies internationally. Duthie said he's been in contact with the state, but thinks finger-pointing and party politics are circumventing any real progress. “I think it's a great way to make an immediate impact on small ponds and things of that nature,” Wallen said. “If anyone says they have the solution, I'm always very cautious, but I'm very optimistic about this. It could be a useful tool and I'm hoping there are people out there interested in pursuing it.” — Mike Ferguson can be reached at Mike.Ferguson@theledger.com or863-401-6981.

During a Thursday press conference, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development Bill Hill suggested that the space agency hopes to hand over the keys of the International Space Station to a commercial owner, Digital Trends can confirm. The move is expected to take place within the next decade, with the “mid-2020s” serving as a goal. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit,” said Hill, speaking as part of a NASA panel discussing the upcoming “Journey to Mars” mission. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit.” Related: Friday’s dock installation will allow International Space Station to receive visitors Another NASA employee told Digital Trends that the transfer of the ISS to commercial companies is already well underway, and the influx in commercial launches to the ISS ought to reduce NASA’s overall involvement in this particular project. The decision isn’t particularly surprising as the American government has only set aside funds for the ISS to remain in orbit through 2024 — at least, on the federal government’s dime. President Barack Obama has already extended ISS operations: The deorbiting date was initially set for 2016. The extra time was deemed necessary for NASA to better prepare for its next big goal, a trip to the Red Planet. At the press conference, NASA didn’t mention any possible buyers, though both Boeing and SpaceX seem like likely contenders. After all, both companies are slated to make trips of their own to the ISS, serving as shuttles for astronauts looking to go between Earth and their outer space home. SpaceX also has grand plans of its own to make its way to Mars. Also watch: Raimond de Hullu’s vision for Oas1s green buildings Please enable Javascript to watch this video

What else can you say about a minor league baseball stadium? At least, watching a rerun of “Bull Durham” would be cheaper and probably more fun. It is not clear how a minor league baseball stadium improves the lives of San Antonians, much less the sports landscape here. A minor league stadium does not address poverty, education or income inequality. It doesn’t improve roads. It doesn’t bring another major league team to the market. It is affordable entertainment and a likely tool for development downtown, spurring apartments. But there’s no shortage of affordable minor league sports in this town, and development is humming on the edges of downtown. But these concerns aside, how can anyone support the concept of a minor league baseball stadium without more details? For starters, that would mean releasing Centro San Antonio’s baseball study. On this topic, Pat DiGiovanni, Centro’s president and CEO, has been a bit like “Bull Durham’s” Ebby Calvin “Nuke” LaLoosh’s performance on the mound: wildly inconsistent. Paging Kevin Costner! Most Popular 1 Donald Trump called son of slain SAPD Det. Benjamin Marconi,... 2 Exclusive: Accused cop killer Otis McKane married in San... 3 35-point monster whitetail buck shot by hunter near San... When I first requested the study from Centro, DiGiovanni refused to release it. But he also suggested requesting the study from the city of San Antonio. I did, but then Centro fought the release of the study, appealing to the attorney general’s office. At some point, though, DiGiovanni had second thoughts because he told Express-News City Hall reporter Josh Baugh that Centro would release the study, but with some exceptions that would be redacted. That sounded possibly satisfactory — kinda like the stadium idea — but it never happened. Instead, DiGiovanni sent an email saying Centro would coordinate with the city on any future release. In his defense, it is Centro’s study — paid with private dollars. But let’s not forget, the public will have some role in this stadium. In a letter to the Attorney General’s Office arguing against the release of the study, Centro’s attorney, James P. Plummer, listed many of the reasons I think this information should be public. To begin with, as Plummer’s letter says, when the study was commissioned, “It was clear that any new stadium would require governmental funds be spent as an incentive to the team to locate downtown.” Exactly! Public money is probably going to be invested in this decision. Plummer also says, “Centro still intends to utilize the information in the Study to obtain a role regarding the new stadium location to ensure that it maximizes the benefits to downtown and Centro’s Constituents.” As Centro should. Its nonprofit mission is to improve and advocate for downtown. But the public interest in the baseball stadium is citywide. What might be best for Centro and downtown might not be best for the overall community. That’s one of Plummer’s concerns about releasing the study. He warns that “Disclosure of the Requested Information could also benefit a competitor who might not want the stadium located downtown.” Is this a bad thing? For Centro, yes. But if there is a better location for taxpayers, including no location, that’s good, right? And since Mayor Ivy Taylor has been clear she wants the stadium downtown, is it even a realistic concern? Finally, Plummer writes, “The study is an evaluation and it points out the strengths and weaknesses of various locations. Forcing Centro to disclose weaknesses identified in the Requested Information clearly puts Centro at a substantial competitive disadvantage.” But shouldn’t the public know about potential “weaknesses” before writing a big check? What’s unfortunate is Centro has a pretty good chance of keeping its study out of sight. That’s because in 2015, the Texas Supreme Court broke with years of precedent and found that private entities contracting with the public could keep certain details secret due to perceived competition. That’s why Plummer is citing Centro’s so-called “competitive” concerns. The Supreme Court ruling, which was over releasing lease details between Boeing and the Port Authority of San Antonio, is like the Green Monster for public information. At the time, Joe Larsen, an attorney who serves on the board of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, told the Texas Tribune, “It’s one of the worst rulings to ever come out of the Texas Supreme Court.” In that same article, Bill Cobb, formerly with the attorney general’s office, said, “I think it’s going to prevent a lot of information from being released.” Secrecy might get an ideal stadium built downtown, but it’s a terrible way to build a fan base. jbrodesky@express-news.net Developing Stories Court clears 'San Antonio Four' on all charges Ex-TX coach convicted of killing pregnant wife granted new trial Man's body pulled from under train on I-10 SAPD: 30-year-old shot while walking in Govt.

It’s understood the email was sent after a worker played the game whilst on site at the wing-making factory in Flintshire. Last month the Bristol Post reported employees at the Airbus site in Filton were “bemused” as dozens of Pokemon fans started flocking to the high security site to play Pokemon Go.

Australia's Jetstar Dreamliner fleets have major engine issues: media Source: Xinhua   2016-08-18 10:22:45 Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo SYDNEY, Aug. 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Jetstar Dreamliner fleets are flying with a known engine problem that can trigger mid-flight shutdowns and other catastrophic consequences. NewsCorp reported on Thursday that Jetstar fleets have been experiencing engine issues, leading to a loss of oil pressure, since March this year. It is believed that almost half of the Jetstar's Dreamliner fleets come with engine problems. So far repairs have been made to 11 of its 24 General Electric-made GEnx engines, the report said. However, the repair figures were disputed by a Jetstar spokesman who declined to elaborate further. "A service bulletin issued early this year by General Electric to operators of Dreamliner's fitted with the GEnx engine said the issue related to a problem with the 'transfer gearbox'," added the report. Xinhua had recently reported of Jetstar demanding an explanation from GE after a near-new engine had to be shut down during a mid-air flight from Tokyo to Gold Coast. The GEnx model engine fitted on a Boeing 787 had to be shut down after a warning light appeared indicating oil pressure problems on a flight earlier this month, prompting it to be diverted to Guam.

Last week the Russian newspaper Izvestia quoted Sergei Krikalev, director of manned programs at Roscosmos, saying that the agency had approached NASA about reducing its standard ISS crew count from three to two. Russia has had three astronauts on rotation in the ISS since 2010, but apparently that will be changing. Krikalev said that delays in building the Russian Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM), the nodal unit (a structural join), and the scientific and power module – let alone lofting them into orbit – meant there was no need for three local astronauts on station. Cutting one would save money and allow Russia to auction off the place to space tourists. In a press conference on Monday, Kenneth Todd, NASA's operations integration manager for the ISS, confirmed negotiations over the redundancy had begun, the Planetary Society reports. "They're exploring the option of going down to two crew on the Russian segment," he said. "We'll look at it as we do with all these kind of things – we'll trade it against whatever risk that might put into the program, first and foremost the risk to our crew onboard, and the station itself. From there, we start looking at the options and see what we can do as a partnership to either accommodate it or help them realize why that's a bad thing." Russia's MLM was due to have been sent into orbit back in 2007, but delays in building the hardware and launch delays mean that the earliest it will be sent up is now 2017. The other two modules have suffered similar problems and may be delayed to 2019 or later. At the heart of the Roscosmos decision is a funding double-whammy. Falling oil prices, as well as sanctions, have hurt the Russian economy and the space agency has had its budget slashed to a tenth of that of its Yankee counterpart. To make life more difficult, the Russians can no longer bank on getting cash from NASA for astronaut delivery past 2017. SpaceX should be ready to start sending crew to the ISS by then and Boeing is planning flights by 2018, so the $80m per launch Roscosmos was getting will no longer be coming in. "One thing that we certainly always keep in the back of our mind is that our Russian partners are committed to the program at least through 2024," said Todd. "There's no doubt they're keeping that in mind as they work through whatever challenges they have within their system." ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 15 Comments More from The Register NASA opens ISS to private sector modules The plan is to to build wider experience useful for Izzy's successor 17 Comments SpaceX Dragon capsule lands in Pacific carrying 12 moustronauts NASA to watch Musketeer relatives carefully 44 Comments Taxi for NASA!
