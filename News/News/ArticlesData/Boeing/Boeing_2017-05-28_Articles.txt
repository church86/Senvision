The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing (BA) 737 and Airbus (EADSF) A320. By Jon Ostrower SEATTLE (CNNMoney) -- Russia's first large airliner since the fall of the Soviet Union made its maiden flight Sunday. The Irkut MC-21 is designed to compete with the most popular airliners in the world, the single-aisle Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The prototype took flight Sunday morning from the Irkutsk Aviation Plant airfield in Siberia, about 2,600 miles west of Moscow. During the 30-minute flight, the plane reached an altitude of 1,000 meters (roughly 3,300 feet). Oleg Kononenko, the flight's lead test pilot, reported that the aircraft operated normally. The MC-21's maiden flight was notably shorter than that of its Chinese competitor and other similar aircraft, which have typically flown for an hour or longer and at a higher altitude. The flight comes ahead of the Paris Air Show, which starts June 18. Irkut hasn't yet said whether the jet will be ready in time to make its international debut at the event. The Russian aircraft's debut is the latest in a series of aviation firsts in 2017. The unusually busy year has featured a parade of maiden flights by new models from airplane makers around the world. China's new challenge to Boeing and Airbus, the Comac C919, made its first flight on May 5. But while Russia is pushing the MC-21 with airlines around the world as a way to increase its non-military aerospace exports, Comac has shown less interest in selling the C919 overseas. Russia's commercial aerospace industry has struggled over the past quarter century to regain the strength it had during the Soviet era. Through projects backed by President Vladimir Putin, it has sought to shed its reputation for advanced, but unreliable, passenger aircraft. The country last week formalized a partnership with China to made a long-range twin-aisle airliner to compete with Boeing and Airbus. The MC-21 is expected to start flying passengers in 2019 after it completes testing. Russian airline Aeroflot will be the first to fly the new jetliner. The state-run carrier has relied heavily on Airbus and Boeing jets as part of its modernization, but Russian policy has encouraged the introduction of homegrown models, like the MC-21. Irkut says the MC-21, which seats 163 passengers in two classes, will be 12% to 15% less expensive to operate than its Western counterparts. The manufacturer has taken 175 orders for the jet, which has a range of about 3,500 nautical miles or 6,400 kilometers. Irkut is an arm of the Russian state-owned aerospace conglomerate United Aircraft Corporation, which supplies the country's airborne military hardware. Like the Chinese C919, the MC-21 has used many Western aerospace suppliers. The jet took the sky on Sunday powered by two U.S.-made Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, which are also used by Airbus, Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer. Russia is developing a new engine of its own for the MC-21. While the Russian aerospace industry has lagged U.S. and European companies, Airbus and Boeing are closely watching the new jet's progress. The MC-21 is packed with advanced carbon fiber technology and flight controls that haven't yet made their way to Boeing and Airbus aircraft.

Canales lashes out over killed bill By PAUL COBLER | Special To The Herald Brownsville Herald AUSTIN — McAllen’s payment to Enrique Iglesias for a 2015 holiday performance may never become public information, and state Rep. Terry Canales is not happy about it. On Wednesday night, Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, removed House Bill 349, Canales’ bill, from the Texas Senate’s Local and Consent Calendar. This effectively killed the bill by preventing it from being read on the Senate floor before the end of the legislative session next Monday. “He did it because it’s a chink in the armor and takes a piece of the Boeing ruling away,” Canales said. “They don’t want the sweater to unravel, and he wants to keep the public in the dark.” The bill reversed a very narrow portion of the Texas Supreme Court’s Boeing Ruling, which was cited when the City of McAllen refused to disclose the price tag for the Iglesias concert. If the bill had passed, it would have wiped out the contract between McAllen and Iglesias, forcing the city to disclose the payment. In a personal privilege speech on the House floor, Canales, D-Edinburg, ripped into Schwertner for his decision to kill HB 349, calling him a “villain” who “dwells in the shadows of corporate greed.” Prior to the speech, Canales approached Schwertner on the Senate floor, poked him in the shoulder and said next session he would block every piece of legislation Schwertner authored that was sent to the House. Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, who was carrying HB 349 in the Senate, said Schwertner told him he removed the bill from the calendar as retribution for Canales calling a point of order on one of his bills, Senate Bill 11. A point of order is a request to the House Parliamentarian to review that the bill is not breaking any House rules, but commonly can be used as a legislative delay tactic. “ Sometimes, at this point in the session, people get overly emotional and retaliate,” Hinojosa said. “I was not notified he was going to pull the bill from the calendar, which is usually the protocol here. I was disappointed Sen. Schwertner didn’t notify me, because I could have talked to him and probably persuaded him not to do that.” Canales said he believes Schwertner killed the bill because of its intention to expand government transparency in Texas. “(Schwertner) says the bill was killed because of a point of order, but no point of order was ever sustained on one of his bills,” Canales said. “The reason for him to kill the bill was protecting corporate industry.” Schwertner did not respond to a request for comment. The death of HB 349 leaves no legislation supporting open government in Texas left standing, according to Kelley Shannon, the executive director of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. “Legislators should definitely not be playing games with open government,” Shannon said. “It’s a basic right of the people of Texas to know how their government operates and to know how their government uses their taxpayer dollars. When they play games with open-government, they are playing games with the voters of Texas.” In his personal privilege speech, Canales called on legislators to do better when it comes to open-government legislation. “If you don’t have the spine to stand for transparency, you don’t have the right to stand for Texas,” Canales said in his speech. “To my understanding, Sen. Schwertner is an orthopedic surgeon, which I find ironic because he doesn’t have a spine.”  Discuss Print Posted in Valley on Sunday, May 28, 2017 10:38 pm.

Based in Adelaide, the office will create around 250 new highly skilled technical and advanced research positions as it undertakes programs spanning C3I, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and advanced experimentation and prototyping. ‘These skilled roles will offer significant sustainable employment opportunities to young South Australian graduates, with the added benefit of creating jobs with defence contractors and significant numbers of indirect jobs,’ says Jay Weatheril, Premier of South Australia, in a Boeing media release. Boeing Defence Australia employs more than 2,000 employees at 14 locations throughout Australia and three international sites. In South Australia, its support programs include the E-7A Wedgetail, P-8A Poseidon and Collins Class submarine. ‘Boeing Defence Australia is committed to building local capability in South Australia,’ says Darren Edwards, Boeing Defence Australia vice president and managing director. ‘One way we are doing this is by investing A$500,000 over five years in the Techstars Adelaide global accelerator program to support South Australia’s entrepreneurial startups. ‘We also know that partnerships with higher education institutions are critical for preparing today’s students with tomorrow’s skills for defence industry capability and advancing innovation. To that end, this year we have invested A$7,000 with the 2017 Defence Honours Scholarship Program and look forward to expanding our education partnerships with South Australian universities.’ Boeing’s presence in Australia is its largest outside the US. The company has been in Australia for more than 90 years and has invested more than A$1 billion in its Australian operations over that time. It employs more than 3,000 people in 27 locations across Australia.

DARPA  Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More By JUSTIN BACHMAN | Bloomberg | Published: May 28, 2017 In the future, military dominance will depend partly on how fast you can fly and how quickly you can get into space. That's one of the guiding principles behind an advanced Pentagon project to build a spacecraft able to launch smaller payloads into low-earth orbit on short notice, and at lower cost. Boeing Co.'s XS-1 (Experimental Spaceplane), which the company dubs "Phantom Express," got a green light this week by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. The XS-1 is designed to quickly lift satellites as heavy as 3,000 pounds into orbit for $5 million or less, launching from the ground, deploying a small upper-stage module, and then landing like a traditional airplane-the key to reuse and lower operating expense. Darpa also has a separate program aimed at launching 100-pound satellites for less than $1 million per launch, using conventional aircraft. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," Jess Spoonable, a Darpa program manager, said in a May 24 statement. The Phantom Express will be powered with an Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. AR-22 engine, a newer version of the main engine trio that served on NASA's Space Shuttle. Boeing will design and build the aircraft through 2019, including 10 engine ground firings over 10 days, followed by 12-15 flight tests in 2020. A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the project's cost. Beyond the military's desire for a spaceplane, such a craft would likely carry immense appeal for commercial companies, many of which are planning to launch constellations of small satellites. These companies don't need the weight capability, or large expense, associated with traditional payload launches sold by United Launch Alliance, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp. joint venture, Arianespace, or Elon Musk's SpaceX. The XS-1 is also envisioned as a means to further engineering work on advanced airframe designs capable of hypersonic flight, generally five to 10 times above Mach 1, the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 767 miles-per-hour). Historically, these designs have been challenged due to the intense friction and heat generated by higher Mach speeds. Beyond a quick pop into space, a craft with hypersonic speed offers the Pentagon a new capability-an aircraft deployable anywhere in the world in less than three hours. "When most people think about hypersonic aircraft, many believe they would have to be large, expensive, and exotic," Lockheed Martin says. "It's time we change that perception." One way the defense contractor is trying to do that is with the next generation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the Cold War-era speed demon able to fly at Mach 3, which provided critical reconnaissance for the Air Force until the late 1990s, when it was retired. The SR-71 still holds numerous speed and altitude records. The new Lockheed Skunk Works project, called the SR-72, is a proposal envisioning an unmanned aircraft that cruises at Mach 6 - roughly twice as fast as the 2,300-mile-per-hour SR-71 - meaning "an adversary would have no time to react or hide," Lockheed Martin says in its promotional materials. A Skunk Works spokeswoman declined to comment on hypersonic projects. The SR-72 could be operational by 2030, for less than $1 billion, according to the company, which has been touting the aircraft for several years. Boeing has previously experimented with hypersonic flight with its X-51 WaveRider, a small scramjet platform, dropped from a B-52 bomber, which flew its last test mission in 2013 over the Pacific. The X-51 topped Mach 5, or about 4,000 mph. In the 1960s, NASA experimented with the manned X-15, a high-altitude, hypersonic flight program to inform future space missions. In 1967, the X-15 achieved a record Mach 6.7 (4,520 mph) at more than 102,000 feet. DARPA has selected The Boeing Company to complete advanced design work for the Agency’s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule. A Boeing logo on one of the firm's 737 Max 9 jets. Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

Known as the XS-1, the goal of the spaceplane is to get costs down to $5 million per launch, as well as flying at least 10 times per year. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today’s frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager in a press release. WHO'S IN CHARGE OF OUTER SPACE?   Sponable added that DARPA is "very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight.” Below is a concept video of the plane: Boeing, which beat out Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems to build the XS-1, should be able to get the craft up to speeds of Mach 10 and "deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit." The second portion of the design process runs through 2019, when the design will be finalized and a propulsion system will be tested for flights. The third phase includes 12 to 15 test flights, scheduled for 2020, as well as having 10 flights on 10 consecutive days. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Advertisement Trending in Tech Tech Q&A: Protect your business against ransomware Mother of Uber CEO killed in California boat accident 7 Facebook tips for power users Rocket Lab electron booster falls short in debut test launch How did dinosaurs evolve into birds?

(File Photo) The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has approved the registration of three formal cases pertaining to the affairs of the civil aviation ministry under the previous Congress-led government. The First Information Reports (FIRs) relate to the purchase of 50 Boeing aircraft for the erstwhile Air India, the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, and handing over of lucrative international airline routes to private airlines, a source in the CBI told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity. The cases come on the heels of the CBI raiding former finance minister P Chidamabram’s son Karti. The FIRs do not mention any public official by name but are built around a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submitted to Parliament in 2011 and a subsequent report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Both reports pointed out glaring gaps in the acquisition process, which experts believe led to the national air carrier bleeding financially. In January 2017, the Supreme Court had also asked the CBI to complete the probe on the same matter by June while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the Boeing purchase. “The Supreme Court had asked the Attorney General to look into the allegations in a time-bound manner. We examined the evidence and decided to register three separate cases. We will finish the investigation soon,” said a senior CBI official privy to the development. According to the CBI official who spoke to HT, the CBI director sanctioned the registration of a case on Saturday after it remained under the scanner since 2014. The other two cases—the merger and surrendering of routes—are part of a larger probe into the mismanagement of the national air carrier whose losses increased from Rs 63 crore to over Rs 7,000 crore in the 10-year period between 2004 and 2014 coinciding with the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance rule. The FIR only mentions “unnamed official of civil aviation ministry”. The auditor, which covered the 2002-2010 period in its review, had said in its 121-page report that Air India was forced to buy aircraft from Boeing in a hurry. It also detailed events that led to the company’s ambitious $11-billion purchase on a paltry equity base of $34 million. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment. Former civil aviation minister Praful Patel told HT: “I am not aware of this. But if it is indeed true, I am happy. They should investigate and the truth must come out.” The first two decisions—purchase of aircraft and the merger—were decided by an empowered group of ministers headed by P Chidambaram, the then finance minister, and Pranab Mukherjee, the then external affairs minister. Patel was part of the group as civil aviation minister. The CAG report, however, pinned the responsibility on Patel’s ministry, “The erstwhile Air India was advised to revisit its proposal by “the aviation ministry” into expanding its requirement of aircraft. Whilst their earlier proposal for 28 aircraft had taken two years to prepare and submit, the revised long-term fleet for 50 aircraft plan was completed in four months,” the auditor had said. more from india Nitish Kumar’s aim is to tame Lalu Yadav, not align with BJP May 28, 2017 23:58 IST How Assam’s Black Widow group used government money to fuel an insurgency May 28, 2017 23:47 IST Not a Drop to Waste- A Water Day Infographic Partnered Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Notice to Boeing Photo: TASS Russia completed the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of Boeing and Airbus. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation (IRKT.MM) and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) (UNAC.MM) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called “a significant event”. The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the later MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had “firm orders” for 175 planes. America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometers, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. “I’m sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft,” he said.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus . Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule. A Boeing logo on one of the firm's 737 Max 9 jets. Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the "Saturday Night Fever" heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia's national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. "It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS)," Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. "The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again," Travolta said. "I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia." HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia's east coast. "We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it," De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. "When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we've been in detailed discussions and negotiations since." Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Right now it’s only a press release and a few concept images, but it looks like this is an air-launched system kind of like a Tristar/Pegasus, only much higher and completely unmanned. It’s a ton and a half to low earth orbit, with a goal of 10 flights in 10 days. Up in Albany? There’s a new hacker con happening in a few weeks. Anycon is a hacking, infosec, and cyber security conference happening June 16 & 17th in Albany, NY. The organizers of this con ([Chris], and his company Leet Cybersecurity) are loosely modeling this con after Derbycon. [Dave Kennedy] of TrustedSec will be attending as the keynote speaker. GOOD NEWS! [Casey Neistat] is under investigation by the FAA. [Casey Neistat] is the YouTuber that flies drones right in the middle of the Hudson River corridor, and is a menace to general aviation around NYC. This is neat. The Supplyframe Design Lab is the Hackaday Mothership right in the middle of Pasadena where we host our designers in residence, host a few meetups, and slowly fill every cubic inch of space with either dust or tools. The Design Lab just won a design award. You can check out the ‘design’ part of the Design Lab here, but keep in mind it will never be that clean ever again. Here’s an interesting Twitter to follow. Alitronik is a curator of the weird and wonderful cheap crap that can be found on AliExpress. Need an Altera Cyclone dev board? Here you go. A desk-mountable OLED inspection microscope? Done. A seven dollar Tesla coil? Dude, you can totally fit this inside a hat. [Drygol] had a nice old Commodore C16 with a broken TED chip. A shame, really. He did what anyone would do: put a C64 motherboard in the case for a fancy stealth upgrade. Is the great crowdfunded 3D printer boom over? Some would say that ship sailed after dozens of 3D printer crowdfunding projects failed to deliver, or delivered very low-quality machines. These people were wrong. This Polaroid-branded 3D printing pen might not get funding. A year ago, this project would have been funded on day one. There would have been writeups in The Verge on how Polaroid is turning the corner after decades of wasted opportunities. Now, the Crowdfunded 3D printer boom is finally over. The Hackaday crew was at the Bay Area Maker Faire last weekend and holy crap did we have a blast. Everyone came to the meetup on Saturday except for the fire marshall. The secret OSHPark bringahack on Sunday was even more impressive. We also saw a Donkey Car capable of driving around a track autonomously, but the team behind it didn’t have their work up on the Internet at the time.

Do you even have a valid point? The included chart you post shows it is legal. Sounds more to me like you are a jealous piece of crap and have already lost. Report comment Reply Silis says: May 28, 2017 at 5:45 pm The links shows that light aircraft are actively using the area, therefore making flying quad copters there a dangerous thing. Although we should note that it does not matter what argument you make, as calling someone a ‘jealous piece of crap’ disqualifies you from a discussion instantly.

And they are suddenly hit by all kinds of problems on locations that they can use. All thanks to drones causing problems. They have been flying for 30 years, and now all of a sudden legislation is making a huge mess for them. All thanks to these quad-copters, and the noise they bring. Report comment Reply Biomed says: May 28, 2017 at 11:35 pm I assume you are referencing Neistat. Risk of an incident is non-zero, hence that no incident has happened yet is entirely moot, all we have to do is wait, he’s using airspace that is rich with potential incidents. Even if you never get your feet off the ground, the ground is where a disaster ends up, and a major city is a crowded place. Want that on your head? Complaining to “Dude” is the wrong place… it’s Neistat that’s taken possession of the risk that threatens to end with much more strict regulations imposed on us. If you wish to dispute still… simply prove the risk is actually zero. Report comment Reply daid303 says: May 28, 2017 at 11:12 pm That 3D printer pen looks sketchy at best.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Race to Send Small Rockets Into Orbit Has Begun The pace of global rocket launches could accelerate by 50% or more in just a few years' time. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 28, 2017 at 10:13AM On Thursday, May 25, 2017, Rocket Lab made history. (Again.) Blasting off from Launch Complex 1 on the Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand at 4:20 p.m. local time, Rocket Lab's experimental "Electron" small rocket came within inches (or, more accurately, a few miles per hour) of achieving orbital speed -- the first "orbital-class" small rocket ever to launch from ground to space and reach such heights (both figurative and literal). Comprising two stages topped by a payload fairing, Electron is a disposable rocket (as opposed to SpaceX's much larger Falcon 9 reusable rockets, for example). But it's a much different kind of a rocket from the gigantic but also disposable Atlas V and Delta IV rockets that Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) launch through their United Launch Alliance endeavor. Whereas those rockets primarily loft multi-ton government-owned satellites into orbit, Rocket Lab's 56-foot tall Electron is designed to serve the fast-growing market for small satellite launches. Its total payload capacity: 330 pounds. If this Electron rocket looks small, that's because it is small. Image source: Rocket Lab. Dropping the price of spaceflight back to Earth Rocket Lab's prices are also a bit different from what launch customers have been accustomed to paying. Whereas ULA charges about $350 million for a launch aboard the Boeing-designed Delta IV, and a bit less than half that for a ride on the Lockheed Martin-designed Atlas V, Rocket Lab plans to charge just $6.5 million for Electron. As explained on its website, Electron can carry a single large payload into orbit, or pack itself full of much smaller microsatellites -- launching for as little as $77,000 per sat -- on "ridesharing" missions. In Q4 2017, for example, Rocket Lab has a cubesat mission planned which will carry: four small "1U" cubesats into orbit at $77,000 a pop, plus ... ten 3U cubesats (three times the size of a 1U, and more than three times the cost at $240,000 each) ... four even larger 6U cubesats costing $480,000 each ... and a pair of 12U cubesats, each priced at $960,000. That's 20 satellites in all. But if you want a ride on this rocket, you'd better act fast. The Q4 mission is already 90% booked -- and all missions launching sooner are already 100% full. A new way to launch a new wave of satellites With rocket prices so much below their usual levels, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck predicts his Electrons will soon be sending a whole host of small satellites into orbit, providing Earthlings with "improved weather reporting, Internet from space, natural disaster prediction, up-to-date maritime data as well as search and rescue services," he said in the latest press release. Before that can happen, Rocket Lab will need to conduct at least two more test flights (the next one will take place probably in "a couple of months," says Beck). Once it's worked the final kinks out of its design, though, Rocket Lab plans to launch about one rocket per week -- more than 50 launches per year. (And it's licensed by New Zealand to launch as often as 120 times per year.) To put those numbers in context, says Beck, "there were 22 launches last year from the United States, and 82 internationally." In other words, Rocket Lab could soon single-handedly expand the global space market by nearly 50%. Competition in the wings Not that Rocket Lab will be acting single-handedly, of course. For one thing, Rocket Lab has financial backing from none other than Lockheed Martin itself. For another, while Rocket Lab looks likely to become the first small rocket company to reach orbit, it's not the only company trying to get there. Running neck and neck with Rocket Lab in this race is Tucson, Arizona-based Vector Space Systems, which earlier this month conducted a test flight of its own Vector-R rocket. That one only went up about a mile, but it performed as expected, and Vector is planning another launch from Georgia's new Camden Spaceport this summer. At the same time, Virgin Orbit is making progress with its air-launched satellite delivery system, dubbed LauncherOne. If everything works out as planned, this time next year it's entirely possible we will see not one, but two or even three privately owned small satellite launchers rising up to challenge Boeing's and Lockheed Martin's dominance in spaceflight.

The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus.   Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly.   "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying.   Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity.   A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air.   Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.   President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event".   The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters.   Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes.   America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs.   Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft.   With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions.   State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s.

Updated 8 hours ago In the future, military dominance will depend partly on how fast you can fly and how quickly you can get into space. That's one of the guiding principles behind an advanced Pentagon project to build a spacecraft able to launch smaller payloads into low-earth orbit on short notice, and at lower cost. Boeing Co.'s XS-1 (Experimental Spaceplane), which the company dubs “Phantom Express,” got a green light this week by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa. The XS-1 is designed to quickly lift satellites as heavy as 3,000 pounds into orbit for $5 million or less, launching from the ground, deploying a small upper-stage module, and then landing like a traditional airplane-the key to reuse and lower operating expense. Darpa also has a separate program aimed at launching 100-pound satellites for less than $1 million per launch, using conventional aircraft. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” Jess Spoonable, a Darpa program manager, said in a statement. “When most people think about hypersonic aircraft, many believe they would have to be large, expensive, and exotic.” The Phantom Express will be powered with an Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. AR-22 engine, a newer version of the main engine trio that served on NASA's Space Shuttle. Boeing will design and build the aircraft through 2019, including 10 engine ground firings over 10 days, followed by 12-15 flight tests in 2020. A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the project's cost. Beyond the military's desire for a spaceplane, such a craft would likely carry immense appeal for commercial companies, many of which are planning to launch constellations of small satellites. These companies don't need the weight capability, or large expense, associated with traditional payload launches sold by United Launch Alliance, the Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp. joint venture, Arianespace, or Elon Musk's SpaceX. The XS-1 is also envisioned as a means to further engineering work on advanced airframe designs capable of hypersonic flight, generally five to 10 times above Mach 1, the speed of sound at sea level (approximately 767 mph). Historically, these designs have been challenged due to the intense friction and heat generated by higher Mach speeds. Beyond a quick pop into space, a craft with hypersonic speed offers the Pentagon a new capability-an aircraft deployable anywhere in the world in less than three hours. “When most people think about hypersonic aircraft, many believe they would have to be large, expensive, and exotic,” Lockheed Martin says. “It's time we change that perception.” One way the defense contractor is trying to do that is with the next generation of the SR-71 Blackbird, the Cold War-era speed demon able to fly at Mach 3, which provided critical reconnaissance for the Air Force until the late 1990s, when it was retired. The SR-71 still holds numerous speed and altitude records. The new Lockheed Skunk Works project, called the SR-72, is a proposal envisioning an unmanned aircraft that cruises at Mach 6 — roughly twice as fast as the 2,300-mile-per-hour SR-71 — meaning “an adversary would have no time to react or hide,” Lockheed Martin says in its promotional materials. A Skunk Works spokeswoman declined to comment on hypersonic projects. The SR-72 could be operational by 2030, for less than $1 billion, according to the company, which has been touting the aircraft for several years. Boeing has previously experimented with hypersonic flight with its X-51 WaveRider, a small scramjet platform, dropped from a B-52 bomber, which flew its last test mission in 2013 over the Pacific. The X-51 topped Mach 5, or about 4,000 mph. In the 1960s, NASA experimented with the manned X-15, a high-altitude, hypersonic flight program to inform future space missions. In 1967, the X-15 achieved a record Mach 6.7 (4,520 mph) at more than 102,000 feet. More Nation/World Counting on student loan forgiveness?

Courtesy of PR Department of Irkut Corporation/Handout via REUTERS 2/2 By Gleb Stolyarov and Jack Stubbs | MOSCOW MOSCOW Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation (IRKT.MM) and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) (UNAC.MM) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.

Elmer Haight, 97, moved to heaven on May 18, 2017, while at home with his wife at his side. He was born December 7, 1919, to Elmer S. and Zetta (Dayley) Haight in Seattle, WA. Elmer started school in a little one-room rural school near Bend, OR. His family came to Wenatchee, WA, in August, 1928, to work in the fruit industry. For the next eight years they were migratory fruit workers, going from Wenatchee, after the apple harvest in the fall, to California, working their way back north until spring and the cherry harvest. They managed to save enough during the depression years to buy 200 acres of bare land on Stemilt Hill in 1936. In a few years, they were able to plant 30 acres of cherries. Elmer’s brother, Bruce, joined the local Navy Reserve unit and was called to active duty in 1940. In June of 1944, he and his flying crew disappeared, in their Navy PBY Catalina airplane, somewhere in the Alaska area. Elmer worked at Boeing Aircraft in Seattle from September, 1941 to April, 1942. He enlisted in the Army Air Corps Aviator Cadet program in June, 1942, and was called to active duty in December of that year. He was eliminated from the Cadet program after physical examinations, and was then sent to a new base in Marfa, TX, where he remained for two years. He was then moved around for a year, being discharged at Camp Beale, CA, in February, 1946. In August, 1947, he began working at the Grange Supply in Wenatchee, remaining there until July, 1956. He sold real estate for a year, then was employed by California Chemical Company at their office and plant in Wenatchee. He came to know the Lord Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior through a blind date (later his wife) and her family and the people organizing Faith Lutheran Church in East Wenatchee in 1955. Elmer married Dorothy Battermann on November 2, 1952. They were blessed with four children. In 1962, Elmer felt the call to serve his Lord as a pastor. He and Dorothy took their four young children and enrolled in Concordia Theological Seminary in Springfield, IL, in September, 1964. Elmer was ordained as a pastor in the LCMS Lutheran Church in September, 1968, and called to Vernal, UT, and Rangely, CO, where he served until moving to Othello, WA, in 1978. He retired from full-time service on January 1, 1985, and for the next 12 years served vacant churches in Utah and in the Wenatchee, Yakima and Okanogan valleys. After retiring again, he limited his time to helping on Sundays at some of the Central Washington LCMS Lutheran churches. Elmer is survived by his wife, Dorothy; two daughters: Terrisa (Mike Hibbett) of Wenatchee, WA, and Diane (Kevin Eilmes) of Yakima, WA; two sons: Robert E. Haight (Babette) of Peyton, CO, and Douglas Haight of Shoreline, WA; and four grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents, Elmer and Zetta Haight; and his brother, Bruce. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that contributions be made to Faith Lutheran Church Stained Glass Fund. Arrangements are assisted by Telford’s Chapel of the Valley in East Wenatchee. “IF GOD BRINGS YOU TO IT, HE WILL BRING YOU THROUGH IT.” Questions about commenting?

Courtesy of PR Department of Irkut Corporation/Handout via REUTERS 2/2 By Gleb Stolyarov and Jack Stubbs | MOSCOW MOSCOW Russia carried out the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation (IRKT.MM) and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) (UNAC.MM) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 meters and traveling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA). Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot (AFLT.MM) last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. FIRM ORDERS President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defense conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said.

According to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Putin called Irkut Corporation President and Chief Designer of Yakovlev Design Bureau Oleg Demchenko and congratulated him, as well as the team of the enterprise and all employees of the industry on this significant event. The overall volume of sales of Russia's new MC-21 passenger plane is expected to amount to 1,000 pieces till 2037, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said Sunday. "The fulfillment of the declared technical and economic characteristics, the creation of an effective modern system of integrated logistic support and after-sales service, and the formation of profitable financial sales models will allow the total volume of MC-21 deliveries to exceed 1,000 pieces in the period until 2037," Manturov was quoted as saying in the ministry's press release. The project will continue to receive systematic support for the promotion on potential markets, Manturov added. Manufacturers According to Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), the duration of the first MC-21 flight was 30 minutes at the altitude of 3,280 feet and at the speed of 186 miles per hour. "The flight plan included checking of in-flight stability and controllability, and also the controllability of the power plant. According to the program, during the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning. This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft," the UAC said in a press release. UAC President Yuri Slyusar said that the MC-21 aircraft was created in wide and active cooperation of Irkut with other UAC enterprises. "This is an important stage in the formation of the new UAC industrial model. According to our estimates, the global demand in the MC-21 segment will be about 15,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years. I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," Slyusar said as quoted in the UAC press release. High Export Potential Russia's state corporation Rostec, which is the integrator of numerous systems of the aircraft, considers that the export potential of MC-21 is big. "We have become the first and the largest customer to procure MC-21 aircraft, and we have signed a firm contract on 85 planes. Our subsidiary Aviacapital-Service has already signed an agreement to purchase 50 MC-21 aircraft for Aeroflot. Moreover, we consider that the export potential of the new jet is great, primarily among dynamically developing aviation markets — Southeast Asia, Latin America, India, the Middle East," Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov said. According to Chemezov, the creation of MC-21 is one of the key milestones, achieved by Russia's civil aircraft construction industry in the 21st century. Russia's state development bank Vnesheconombank (VEB) Chairman Sergei Gorkov said Sunday that the bank had invested $90 million in the creation of the first copy of the MC-21 aircraft. "Part of this money will serve as the prepayment for the next planes," Gorkov said in a press release published on VEB's website. According to Gorkov, VEB's subsidiary VEB-leasing has ordered 30 MC-21 planes. ...

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# 3 years of Modi govt Manchester terror attack Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News World News Russia squares up to Boeing, Airbus with maiden jet flight Shares0 Sun, 28 May 2017-08:45pm , Reuters Russia completed the maiden flight of its new MS-21 medium-range passenger plane on Sunday, its first post-Soviet foray into production of a mainline commercial aircraft which it hopes will rival those of its Western competitors. In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut General Director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the later MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15 percent cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve 15 percent operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot, Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC President Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

"The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big U.S. carriers such as Delta and United.

Laura Thomson and Sam Sciortino's dream Greek island wedding was due to take place on Sunday on idyllic Santorini, but due to IT problems British Airways faced over the weekend , their guests were stuck at the airport. The couple, from Woking, Surrey, flew out to the island earlier in the week but their family were forced to wait 13 hours on Saturday to catch a flight without their luggage, containing wedding suits and bridesmaid dresses. Writing on Facebook , heartbroken Laura said: "Well what can I say... I am just a shell of myself right now, my head is vacant, we are absolutely shattered. Thanks to all the suppliers out here we have managed to swap dates, without too much loss. "I have been in tears with our dream of how it should of been slowly fading away, knowing I can't share the day with my family the way I imagined, my sister in law and nieces no longer able to be bridesmaids, my brother no longer with his suit". Luckily the couple have managed to rearrange so they can wed on Monday, but the stress of re-planning the wedding at short notice has been exhausting, they said.

"I'm so sorry they have been through such hell at terminal 5 and all the worry and fear. "I just hope you all can enjoy Monday once it finally arrives and hopefully the topic of conversation on our special day isn't BA." The bride-to-be told the BBC she felt "so let down" by British Airways. The family have made it to the island but without their luggage (Photo: Facebook / Laura Thomson) She said: "We've been planning our big day for two years only to be forced to rush around and change everything to take place a day later. "My brother is one of the groomsmen, and my nieces and sister-in-law are my bridesmaids, so naturally I wanted them to share the day with us. "They booked with British Airways because they thought it was a reliable company. We feel so let down." British Airways says it is aiming to resume most flights by today after the crippling global IT crash . Luckily the wedding can go ahead but the couple had to change the date (Photo: Facebook / Laura Thomson) Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now The airline said its engineers were "continuing to work hard" to restore services hopes to operate a "near normal schedule" at Gatwick and the "majority" of flights from Heathrow.

At Gatwick we're running a near-full operation, although some flights maybe subject to delays. "At Heathrow we plan to fly all of our long-haul services but the knock-on effects of yesterday's disruption will lead to delays. "I know this has been a horrible time for customers. Some of you have missed holidays, some of you have been stranded on an aircraft and some of you have been separated from your bags. On behalf of everyone at BA I want to apologise that you've had to go through these trying experiences." Thousands of passengers were left stranded after scores of planes were grounded by the major systems failure believed to have been caused by a power supply issue.

BA initially cancelled all flights before 6pm on Saturday but later announced that planes would be grounded for the rest of the day and warned passengers not to go to the airports.

A BA spokesman previously said: "We are continuing to work hard to restore all of our IT systems and are aiming to operating a near normal schedule at Gatwick and the majority of services from Heathrow on Sunday. "We are extremely sorry for the huge disruption caused to customers throughout Saturday and understand how frustrating their experiences will have been.

The test is set for Tuesday, according to the announcement by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Reuters reported Saturday. Advertisement An interceptor from California’s Vandenburg Air Force Base will be used to neutralize an ICBM-like target over the Pacific Ocean, according to the Missile Defense Agency. There are 36 such bases in California and Alaska. If successful, it will be the first time the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system has been used to intercept an ICBM. In the past, the system, managed by Boeing, has been used to intercept other types of missiles. The test is being carried out because North Korea is continuing its drive toward developing an ICBM capable of reaching the continental United States. Last Tuesday, the head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Vincent Stewart, said at a Senate hearing that Pyongyang is still “years away” from being able to master such a goal, but that if left unchecked North Korea would nevertheless indeed be able to obtain a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching United States territory. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised the test of a new anti-aircraft guided weapon system on Sunday, according to a statement by the nation’s KCNA news agency. “Kim Jong Un … watched the test of a new type of anti-aircraft guided weapon system organized by the Academy of National Defense Science,” the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said in its release Sunday. “This weapon system, whose operation capability has been thoroughly verified, should be mass-produced to deploy all over the country … so as to completely spoil the enemy’s wild dream to command the air, boasting of air supremacy and weapon almighty,” the statement continued. Kim Jong Un was accompanied by Ri Pyong Chol, a former top air force general; Kim Jong Sik, a veteran rocket scientist; and Jang Chang Ha, the head of the Academy of National Defense Science, a weapons development and procurement center. Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman has warned that Israel could find itself in the line of fire between the United States and North Korea if the two engage in a military confrontation. North Korea has also continued to collaborate with Iran on weapons and nuclear technology, while Iran meanwhile continues to arm its proxy terrorist groups in the Middle East, all of which have vowed to annihilate the State of Israel, as has Iran itself.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Major Tech & Industrial Companies Race to Acquire AI Startups as the AI Revolution Draws Nigh | Main | Former Apple Creative Director who left to work at Huawei is now starting her own Company called 'Abalone' » May 28, 2017 Sharp's Future U.S. Plant will make Smartphone Displays in Addition to Specialized Displays for Boeing and Beyond   Yesterday Sharp's President and CEO Tai Jeng-wu confirmed that his company is in fact planning to build a factory in the U.S. that will make small displays. Tai told a small group of reporters at a Foxconn-owned shopping mall in Taipei that "These panels will not only be used on smartphones. It is possible they will be used in aeronautics as Boeing now uses Sharp's panels in its aircraft. Our panels can service governments and the defense sector, too   The Nikkei further reports that Tai did not say whether the panels would be offered to Apple, a key customer for both Sharp and its parent company, Hon Hai Precision Industry, better known as Foxconn Technology Group.   Further, Tai said Sharp have not decided on a location for the facility, though he wants construction to begin as soon as possible.   Tai's comments come one month after he and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou met U.S. President Donald Trump.   Further, Tai confirmed that Sharp, together with Foxconn, might inject more than 800 billion yen (US$7.2 billion) into new projects in the U.S.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz Why Russia and China Fear America's P-8 Poseidon Submarine Killer Sebastien Roblin May 28, 2017 TweetShareShare There is a decent chance you have already flown on one of the U.S. Navy’s key new aircraft—or rather, the 737 airliner it is based on. The P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol plane may not be as sexy as an F-35 stealth fighter, but in some ways it is far closer to the forefront of international flashpoints in the Pacific Ocean. Maritime patrol planes are essential for tracking the movement of ships and especially submarines across vast oceanic waters—and potentially sinking them in the event of hostilities. Hunting submarines from the air, however, is an airpower-intensive job that requires numerous airframes spending thousands of flight hours flying long-distance patrol patterns over the ocean. Since 1962, the U.S. Navy has operated the P-3 Orion patrol plane, based on the four-engine L-88 Electra airliner. The turboprop-powered aircraft could spend a dozen hours flying low over the ocean to drop sonar buoys, scan the water for metallic hulls of submarines with its Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) and potentially launch torpedoes. After fifty-five years of able service, however, the P-3s have accumulated thousands of service hours and their hulls are growing fatigued. In 2004 the U.S. Navy selected the jet-powered Boeing P-8 Poseidon to succeed the aging P-3. Development proceeded relatively smoothly, in part due to the use of a preexisting airframe and the decision to phase in the P-8’s advanced systems in a series of increments rather than delivering them all at once. This led the P-8 unit costs to actually come in under budget, at $150 million per aircraft. The P-8 is based on the 737-800ERX short-to-medium-range airliner. It typically has a flight crew of three and boosts stronger power generators for its onboard electronics. The Poseidon reportedly offers a much smoother ride than the Orion, thanks to its broader-swept wings and flight computers. Orion crews were often nauseated by the strong turbulence their low-altitude flight operations required. While the P-8 does have a strengthened hull to operate at low altitude—though at reduced fuel efficiency compared to the P-3—it’s designed to perform most of its operation from high altitude, where the thinner atmosphere allows for greater fuel efficiency and a better vantage for some of its sensors. A Poseidon can loiter overhead at speeds as low as two hundred miles per hour, and can stay on station for extended times due to its in-flight refueling capability. However, with a maximum speed of 564 miles per hour, it can also dash two hundred miles per hour faster than the P-3 aircraft it is replacing. The Poseidon’s primary payload is its diverse array of sensors. These include an APY-10 multi-mode synthetic aperture radar, which not only can track the position of ships over hundreds of miles away, but possesses a high-resolution mode which can spot submarine periscopes poking above the waves and even identify different classes of ships. An MX-20 electro-optical/infrared turret provides a shorter-range search option, while an ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measure (ESM) derived from a system onboard the EA-18G Growler functions as an electromagnetic sensor, particularly useful in tracking the positions of radar emitters. A recent addition is the Advanced Airborne Sensor, a dual-sided AESA radar that can offer 360-degree scanning on targets on land or coastal areas, and which has potential applications as a jamming or even cyberwarfare platform. A number of key systems on the P-8 are designed to track submerged submarines. A rotary launcher system in the rear of the P-8 can dispense sonar buoys into the water. A recent upgrade allows P-8s to employ new Multistatic Active Coherent buoys that generate multiple sonar pulses over time, allowing for greater endurance and search range. The P-8 also has its own acoustic sensor, and even a new hydrocarbon sensor that can “sniff” for fuel vapor from submarines. However, the P-8 lacks the tail-mounted MAD sensor of the P-3 Orion, useful for detecting the metallic hulls of submarines while flying at low altitude. Various reasons have been offered for its removal: the MAD weighed too much at 3,500 pounds, it did not fit with the high-altitude search profile of the P-8, or the new sensors on the P-8 rendered it unnecessary. However, the U.S. Navy is reportedly developing a variant of the an air launched drone, called the High-Altitude Unmanned Targeting Air System, which can carry a MAD sensor and transmit its findings back up to the P-8. Five operator stations on the port side of the plane carry multifunction displays that can be configured to display whatever sensors and controls are most useful under the circumstances. The P-8’s computers are designed to fuse the data into a single coherent picture for the operators—and can then “push” that data to friendly ships and airplanes. This is a capability the U.S. Air Force has been struggling to integrate into its new E-3G radar planes. The P-3 is also designed to be especially compatible with Navy RQ-4N drones. In the event of hostilities, the Poseidon can carry five missiles, depth charges or torpedoes in a rotary launcher in the rear hull, and six more on underwing racks. While the P-3 had to fly low to deploy its torpedoes, the P-8 can use a special High Altitude Air Launch Accessory to transform its Mark 54 324-millimeter lightweight torpedoes into GPS-guided glide bombs that can be dropped from altitudes as high as thirty thousand feet. These shed their wings upon hitting the water and hone in on targets using onboard sonar. Poseidons can also carry Harpoon AGM-184H/K antiship missiles with a range of 150 miles.

EVERETT — Kevin Beavers’ title defense at the Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament didn’t get off to the start he was hoping for. But he more than made up for it as the round progressed. The two-time defending champion grabbed the first-round lead by shooting a 2-under par 70 Saturday at Legion Memorial Golf Course on the first day of the Snohomish County Amateur. Beavers was sitting at 4-over after four holes, but seven birdies over the final 14 holes gave him a two-shot lead over a crowd of players tied for second at even-par 72. “The first four holes were very ugly,” said Beavers, a 33-year-old Boeing engineer from Seattle. “But I ended up bringing it back.” The second round is Sunday at Harbour Pointe Golf Club in Mukilteo. The final round is Monday at Snohomish Golf Course. Beavers has known nothing but success at the County Am. He won the tournament each of the past two years, the only times he’s entered. But he found himself dealing with adversity early on as he struggled with mechanical issues in his swing. Yet he got himself back on track by making three birdies before making the turn. “It was sort of just kicking myself in the backside,” Beavers said about the source of his turnaround. “It was just never giving up. If I go out and shoot 85, so be it, but I’m going to try to at least shoot a good number. I’m working on some things in my swing, and when you’re coming out here and people expect you to play well because you‘ve done well in this event in the past, I was a little nervous on the first few holes. Then I just kind of put all that aside and was able to kind of calm myself back down.” Putting played a large role in the turnaround. “I putted really well today, I made a lot of putts,” Beavers said. “But I also hit a lot of good shots. I was 4-over after four and the three birdies I had on the front side were all kick-ins, they were all within four feet, so that helps. I made a few coming in on 15, 17 and 18 that were about 10-15 feet each. I didn’t make any bombs, but I made the ones that if you set up to it and like the look, you can make them.” The opening-round 70 puts Beavers in position to become just the second player to ever win three straight County Ams. The only other to accomplish the feat was Bob Burton from 1973-75. There was a logjam for second place, with six players shooting even-par 72. That included all three members of the Western Washington University men’s team — Chris Hatch, Cody Roth and Ethan Casto — who were last-minute additions to the tournament. Western qualified for the NCAA Division II men’s golf championships in Kissimmee, Florida, and ideally the trio would have been playing Friday. However, the Vikings didn’t qualify for the final eight in the team competition, meaning their tournament ended Thursday, thus freeing them up for playing at the County Am. “I called them from Dallas (during an airport stopover) and was like, ‘Hey, do you have room, think we can squeeze in there?’” Hatch said. “They were like, ‘Yeah, if you can get three guys to make it a threesome,’ and it worked out perfectly.” The group at even par also included 16-year-old Alvin Kwak, a sophomore at Kamiak High School who’s coming off finishing tied for 10th at the 4A state boys golf tournament earlier this week; Jacob Rohde, who finished tied for second at the County Am last year; and Ty Cannon. “I played really well today,” said Kwak, last year’s junior champion. “I was struggling out there, but I was able to keep calm, which is something I developed today. So it’s a new skill.” Said Rohde: “I had a lot of really good chances that I just didn’t capitalize on. The greens weren’t as good as I was expecting them to be, so it was really kind of rough to be aggressive with your putts because you didn’t know which way it was going to go. I think I could have been four or five shots better if I just could have trusted where the ball was going to go on the green.” Alex Stamey, seeking to become the first six-time winner of the County Am, sits three strokes off the pace after shooting a 73. He and David Hansen were tied for eighth. 2017 Snohomish County Amateur Saturday at Legion Memorial GC Flight 1 (+4.0 to 4.9) Gross scores, Par 72 (6,627 yards) Kevin Beavers, HP 70 Alvin Kwak, EGCC 72 Chris Hatch, HP 72 Cody Roth, HP 72 Ethan Casto, Sno 72 Jacob Rohde, LM 72 Ty Cannon, LM 72 Alex Stamey, EGCC 73 David Hansen, PGD 73 Chris Bae, LM 74 Sean Fitzpatrick, PGD 74 Stephen Lee, SR 74 Mick Stocker, EGCC 75 TJ Lewis, LM 75 Jerry Slind, Sno 76 Kale Reynolds, SR 76 Rowan Foxley, EGCC 76 Andrew Martin, EGCC 77 Connor Bayha, SR 77 Lance Kilbride, HP 77 Mark Strickland, HP 77 Michael Burlison, Sno 77 Tyler Spalti, EGCC 77 Andrew Kaemingk, Glen 78 Jason Calamaro, LM 78 Dominic VanDaveer, Sno 79 Patrick Boag, EGCC 79 Todd Tibke, Sno 79 Duane Diede, EGCC 80 Jordan Brajcich, MC 80 Drew Preston, Ced 81 Josef Koznek, LM 81 Ace Younggren, EF 82 Alex Raynor, BC 82 Ben Thacker, LM 82 Ken Harris, SR 82 Mark White, HP 83 Chris Giesker, WH 84 Mark Johnson, Jor 84 Tyler Stocker, EGCC 87 Matthew Kornegay, HP 90 Austin Duffy, LM WD Flight 2 (5.0 to 8.9) Net scores, Par 72 (6,111 yards) Brian Wimer, LM 66 Dan Frost, Jor 66 Martin Seguin, WH 68 Steve Laue, Lynn 68 Ethan Merritt, Sno 69 Nick Rothrock, Glen 69 Steve Maldonado, WH 69 Larry Montgomery, LM 71 Andrew Kephart, WH 72 Doug Barlow, EF 72 Eric Haechrel, Sno 72 Harrison Jewell, SR 72 Ian Johnson, WH 73 Nick Dammann, Sno 73 Ben Headland, LM 74 Brett Engstrom, WH 74 James Iazeolla, EGCC 75 Mike Nikolas, LM 77 Brandon Dale, WH 78 Steven Howell, Sno 78 Josh O’Connor, BC 86 Scott Chambard, SR DNF Flight 3 (9.0 to 19.0) Net scores, Par 72 (6,111 yards) Darrell Stubblefield, Sno 68 Christian Kim, EGCC 70 Paul Lill, LM 70 Silas Puetz, HP 70 Brendan Doheny, WH 71 Jerry Wabey, Jor 71 James McGuire, WH 72 Van Luu, LM 72 Greg Guest, WH 73 Bob Wallin, BC 75 David Forhan, LM 75 Jerry Browning, LM 75 Stephen Reed, Jor 76 Tom Desmarais, LM 78 Roman Catli, HP 79 Tom Douglas, EGCC 80 Floyd Gale, Sno 81 Key: BC—Battle Creek; EF—Echo Falls; EGCC—Everett Golf & Country Club; Glen—Gleneagle; HP—Harbour Pointe; Jor—Jorgensen; LM—Legion Memorial; Lynn—Lynnwood; MC—Mill Creek Golf & Country Club; PGD—Pro Golf Discount (Lynnwood); Sno—Snohomish; SR—SuperRange; WH—Walter Hall   Most Read Angry client goes ballistic, trashes social services office EVERETT — A homeless man is facing a possible felony charge for… May 27th, 2017 by Scott North Arlington mayor honors faith-based group that helps homeless ARLINGTON — The 79-year-old woman wore her best.

Ms Thao, 46, became Vietnam's first self-made woman billionaire, as well as the only Southeast Asian representative, according to the world's self-made women billionaires list released by Forbes magazine. (EPA photo) - + HANOI -- VietJet Aviation Joint Stock Co is in talks to become the first company in Vietnam to list its shares on a stock exchange overseas as the carrier, which controls more than 40% of the domestic airline market, seeks more funds after plans for billions of dollars in aircraft purchases. “We’ve been approached by some foreign stock exchanges including London, Hong Kong and Singapore, which expressed their interest in our stock,” Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, VietJet’s founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview in Hanoi on Sunday. Ms Thao said she will meet exchange officials in New York later this week. The plan for the 41 trillion-dong (US$1.8 billion) low-cost carrier comes amid the government’s easing of rules to allow more foreign investment in one of the fastest-growing aviation markets. Hanoi-based VietJet, known for a marketing stunt featuring bikini-clad service crew, received shareholder approval in April to boost its foreign ownership limit to 49% from 30%. “Listing overseas on big markets will help increase our access to more fund sources, boost the trading of our stock and expand the list of our investors,” said Ms Thao, a self-made billionaire. “We don’t want to hide our hope to become the first Vietnamese company to list shares overseas.” Shares of VietJet have surged about 50% since they started trading in Ho Chi Minh City three months ago, compared with a gain of 6.5% in the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index. The overseas listing plan would make VietJet the first Vietnamese company to officially trade overseas, according to Tran Anh Dao, deputy chief executive of the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd does not comment on individual companies, a spokeswoman said in an email. Singapore Exchange Ltd did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. VietJet, which began operating six years ago, has 136 foreign investors who own 26% of the company, Ms Thao, 46, said in April. She owns more than 60% of the airline directly and through holding companies and other entities, according to filings. The increase in foreign ownership will need to be approved by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc because aviation is considered a restricted industry, with the limit currently capped at 30%. The airline has filed paperwork requesting the increase, Ms Thao said. Raising the limit isn’t aimed at attracting a strategic investor, although the company is open to one, she said. “We always wanted to be the pioneer,” Ms Thao said. “We want to increase our stock value and to boost the ability to mobilise capital with more participation of investors.” Ms Thao made her first million dollars at age 21 selling fax machines and latex rubber. Almost a quarter of a century later, the executive became Southeast Asia’s first self-made woman billionaire with the listing of VietJet. Ms Thao engages in round-the-clock negotiations with plane and engine makers by herself, surviving on as little as three hours of sleep a night, said VietJet Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh. In May last year, she sealed an $11.3 billion deal with Boeing to buy 100 737 Max 200 aircraft just in time to have it announced during then-president Barack Obama’s visit to Vietnam. The carrier agreed to buy 30 A320neos valued at $3.6 billion at list price in 2015, adding to an order for as many as 100 Airbus planes a year earlier. Higher Profit The budget airline forecasts profit will rise 36% this year from 2.5 trillion dong in 2016. VietJet expects to serve 17 million passengers this year, after carrying about 15 million travellers in 2016. Its biggest competitor is Vietnam Airlines. The national carrier owns 70% of low-cost operator Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation JSC, with Qantas Airways Ltd. holding the remaining 30%. Vietnam Airlines also owns Vietnam Air Services Co., known as Vasco. VietJet and Vietnam Airlines each have a 42% share of the domestic aviation, said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation. VietJet’s share could rise to 50% within three years, he said in April. “Vietnamese aviation is growing at a high rate,” Ms Thao said. “When we open the door wider for foreign investors and create more opportunities for them, it also means we increase the chance for the local aviation industry and domestic stock market to expand and integrate faster into international aviation markets.” TAGS VietJet Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao Vietnam RECOMMENDED STORIES United Airlines boss: 'This never will happen again' Pivotal Vietnam balances US and China US delivers 6 patrol boats to Vietnam coast guard Vietnam Politburo member removed over 'serious mistakes' Vietnam puts pork on menus as farmers face glut, low prices Vietnam arrests anti-polluter activist Vietnam Bank to sell majority stake to foreign investor Crowded Suvarnabhumi to get even more hectic Poll: Majority would vote for Prayut as next PM Most Viewed 74,099 Bangkok streets paralysed 64,668 Police: Bomb at hospital wounds ... 56,935 Sex traffickers took hundreds from ... 48,579 Prawit being treated in hospital in ... 44,241 Iconic Harley-Davidson is building ...

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation and its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 km an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing and Airbus. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts says both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. “The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing,” test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Russia has fought hard to shake its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. — Reuters Related ← Previous Why nuclear plants could become the next ‘fossil’ fuel UK defence minister denies report of divisions Next → You May Also Like South Korea complains to WTO over China response to THAAD 20/03/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on South Korea complains to WTO over China response to THAAD S Korean liberal wins party primary, poised to become president 03/04/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on S Korean liberal wins party primary, poised to become president Portrait of queen with Prince Charles released for her 90th birthday 18/12/2016 Oman Observer Comments Off on Portrait of queen with Prince Charles released for her 90th birthday Latest News Turbat in Pakistan records 53.5°C on Sunday 29/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Turbat in Pakistan records 53.5°C on Sunday HM greetings to Georgia President 28/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on HM greetings to Georgia President Take cover as next 3 days to be hotter 28/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on Take cover as next 3 days to be hotter Oman to source veggies from Jordan, Egypt 28/05/2017 Kabeer Yousuf Comments Off on Oman to source veggies from Jordan, Egypt More foreign colleges included to pursue higher education 28/05/2017 Mai Al Abri Comments Off on More foreign colleges included to pursue higher education US weighs banning laptops on all flights 28/05/2017 Oman Observer Comments Off on US weighs banning laptops on all flights Facebook Instagram Load More...

(Kevin Clark / The Herald) Defending champ leads going into final round of County Am Nick Patterson Sun May 28th, 2017 6:51pm Sports You must sign in or register to continue reading content. MUKILTEO — Kevin Beavers remains in the pole position to win his third straight Snohomish County Amateur golf tournament. However, Ethan Casto is making sure Beavers has to earn it. Beavers, the two-time defending champion, shot a 3-under-par 69 Sunday at Harbour Pointe Golf Club to remain in the lead after two rounds of the Snohomish County Amateur at 5-under. But Casto had the low score of the day, shooting a blistering 4-under-par 68, and trails Beavers by a single stroke going into Monday’s final round. “I played pretty well,” Casto, a Snohomish native who turned 20 Saturday, said. “I kept it in play all day, which was good, and then just made a couple putts.” Casto, a freshman at Western Washington University, was one of three members of the Vikings team to sign up for the tournament at the last minute. Western played at the NCAA Division II men’s golf championships earlier this week, and had things gone to plan, Casto wouldn’t have entered the County Am as the Vikings would have been competing for a national title Friday in Kissimmee, Florida. But Western didn’t make the final eight, meaning Casto was able to make it back in time for Saturday’s opening round at Legion Memorial Golf Course, where he shot an even-par 72. Casto, who’s playing in his first County Am, followed that up Sunday by setting a pace at Harbour Pointe no one else was able to match. Playing in the day’s first group, Casto registered five birdies and just a single bogey in what he described as a consistent performance. His birdie at the 513-yard, par-5 18th hole — where he just missed the green in two — was what gave him the day’s low round. “Yesterday I felt like I played terrible,” Casto said. “Today I felt like I played really well. I think this golf course is harder than Legion, so the score is a lot better.” Casto could have an insider’s advantage Monday. Snohomish Golf Course, the site of the final round, is his home course. But Casto may need all the home-course advantage he can muster to overcome Beavers, who’s taken quite a liking to the County Am. Beavers, a 33-year-old Boeing engineer from Seattle, won the tournament the only two previous times he entered, and he has a chance to become just the second player ever to win three straight County Ams, joining Bob Burton from 1973-75. Sunday was just another good day at the office for Beavers. Beavers, who came into the day with a two-stroke lead after shooting a 2-under 70 at Legion Memorial, made six birdies en route to his 69. It was a birdie at 18 that gave Beavers the lead heading into the final round. “Today I was conservative the majority of the day, but I felt like my course management was exceptional today,” Beavers said. “Yesterday it was more like you can hit it and find it and hit it again. This golf course won’t let you do that so much, you’ve got to hit the fairways. Even if you have a 7-iron into the green, it’s better doing that from the fairway than taking your chances with the driver. So I think I played well today, I really did.” For the second straight day Beavers had to overcome some early adversity. He double-bogeyed the fifth hole and bogeyed the sixth. But he bounced back with a birdie on seven to get his round back on course. He was 4-under over his final 12 holes. “It kind of got me back into things,” Beavers said of the seventh hole. “I actually made a long putt there, about 30 feet. It was just like, ‘Phew, all right, let’s keep going.’” Alvin Kwak shot a 2-under 70, putting him at 2-under for the tournament and alone in third place. The 16-year-old Mukilteo resident and sophomore at Kamiak High School will round out Monday’s final threesome, which is scheduled to tee off at 10:54 a.m. “I played really well,” said Kwak, who finished with six birdies and four bogeys. “I wasn’t putting as well as yesterday, so I could have gone a lot lower. But still I can’t complain about 70.” Chris Hatch of Mukilteo, Casto’s Western teammate, and Jacob Rohde of Everett were the only other players under par for the tournament. Both shot 71s Sunday and are tied for fourth at 1-under.   The first grouping of the day putt Sunday morning during the second round of the Snohomish County Amateur Golf Tournament on May 28, 2017.

It was being too clever by half. First things first: Donald Trump didn’t reveal the location of U.S. nuclear-powered attack submarines in his phone call with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Trump comes off as a braggart and bully in the transcript, but what he said about submarines is far less interesting than our reaction to it. It’s clear that whatever signal Trump was trying to send got fouled up. But that shouldn’t make us angry about the Trump administration’s clumsiness. It should make us wary about the overconfidence of all policymakers who think they can use the deployment of military forces to signal resolve to adversaries and allies without getting the rest of us killed. Trump did say a fair number of awful and stupid things to Duterte. He told him that his campaign of extrajudicial executions was working (it isn’t) and that North Korea’s missiles are crashing (they aren’t). But on the subject of submarines, Trump is blameless. Here is what he said in reference to North Korea: We have a lot of firepower over there. We have two submarines — the best in the world. We have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all. It is entirely unclear where Trump thinks “over there” is, but in recent days U.S. Pacific Command had announced two port calls for nuclear-powered submarines, one in South Korea and another in Japan.

Three someones, actually. “We never talk about subs!” three anonymous officials told Nancy Youssef of BuzzFeed News. Oh, you don’t? Then maybe someone should tell the Navy — because it blabbers on and on about submarines. Contrary to the exclamations of the three anonymous officials, the Navy releases this kind of information all the time. Submarine Force Pacific even has a webpage on which it publicizes submarine port calls, including the two Trump referenced, as a matter of routine. I counted 20 announced port calls in Japan and South Korea alone in 2016 — plus additional calls in Singapore and Australia, among other locales. Last I checked, 20 a year is more than “never.” This is not surprising. Forward-deployed military forces, like a doomsday device, don’t provide much deterrence if you keep them secret. And, frankly, how secret is a 6,000-ton nuclear-powered submarine sidling up dockside and unleashing more than a hundred sailors on port call? (Like how I kept that G-rated?) Some of the reaction to Trump’s alleged indiscretion is a product of partisanship run amok — a kind of lefty version of the asinine “Hillary revealed nuclear launch procedures!” nonsense that sent Republicans into spasms of stupidity. But it’s important to remember that some of the reaction is probably also by design. Even before anyone knew about Trump’s phone call, U.S. Pacific Command was tweeting pictures and giving interviews about the submarines, explicitly stating that such port visits “demonstrate [the Navy’s] commitment to our regional allies.” Trump may have been showing off or hoping Duterte would pass the message along to Kim Jong Un. Either way, Trump wanted a reaction. Just not quite the one he got. Still, the reaction to Trump’s comments reveals a broader gullibility about how we collectively respond to the government’s public messaging about military deployments. As someone who studies nuclear weapons — and is deeply skeptical about using military forces to send messages to adversaries — the reaction to this nuclear submarine story is a cautionary tale. After all, ship deployments are planned long in advance, and these two submarines are probably no exception. The Navy keeps a schedule for deployments that takes into account crew rotations, needs for maintenance, and so on. While there is flexibility within that schedule, port calls at places like Busan and Sasebo aren’t usually a spur of the moment event. The U.S. military is conducting an enormous number of military exercises and operations around the world at any given moment. Instead of dramatically changing carefully planned schedules to chase one crisis or another, someone (more often than not, the Joint Information Operations Warfare Center in San Antonio) looks at the list of exercises, ponders the global situation, and decides how to “frame” existing deployments and exercises in terms of current events to send the right signal to adversaries and allies. And reporters eat it up. This year, the United States conducted a long-planned Minuteman III launch out of Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The headlines — “U.S. Test Fires Boeing’s $40M Missile in Message to North Korea” — predictably framed the test as a message to Kim Jong Un. Every reporter with whom I spoke about that event started by asking that same question. I responded by pointing out that Minuteman launches are scheduled 3-5 years in advance — long before the current crisis began — and the planning for a launch can take a year. But this time, they overdid it. The United States conducted a second Minuteman test a few days later, and, for whatever reason, the Air Force didn’t like the idea that two intercontinental ballistic missiles had been tested in a single week as a warning to North Korea. Officials dutifully explained to reporters that it was a coincidence that the two tests were so close to each other — the first test had long planned, while the other had been delayed from the fall due to a wildfire. None of which changed the headlines spurred by the initial “framing” of the initial launch. But that raises the question of why the public hasn’t learned its lesson. Why do we consistently fall for spin? The answer is that human beings have a bad habit of inferring causation from correlation. And so a missile test planned months ago can be sold as a response to events from last week, even though that is patently absurd. Similarly, the regular series of port calls by U.S. submarines in South Korea and Japan can be explained as an extraordinary response to a crisis. The funny thing is, there just isn’t much reason to think that these signals make much of a strategic difference beyond winning mostly friendly headlines. Defense experts, policymakers, and military officials are all confident that they can message like this effectively to deter adversaries and reassure allies. But I think the misreading of Trump’s remarks suggests that they aren’t nearly as good at messaging as they think. This is the second time that the Trump administration has clumsily tried to use naval forces to send a message to Kim Jong Un. And, like the public messaging about a change to the deployment of the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, it was a fiasco. The Barack Obama administration wasn’t much better. It fell in love with bomber overflights. In 2013, the Pentagon flew two B-2 bombers to South Korea. It was so pleased with this signal that it did a B-52 flight in January 2016. And then a B-1 in September. The Defense Department was doing so many bomber flights that South Korea proposed a permanent rotation of bombers and other assets. There was another bomber overflight in May — not that anyone noticed. It’s not surprising that these signals have little effect. The academic literature on signaling is too complicated to fairly represent in a few paragraphs, but a basic point is that fundamental capabilities and interests tend to matter more to crisis outcomes than bluffing. To the extent that signals matter, they need to be costly to the one sending them. And my own observation is that the best stories told by practitioners about great moments in the history of nuclear signaling usually turn out to be based on fairly tendentious interpretations of historical events. It would be nice to subject policymakers to the same data-driven scrutiny that has suggested that other traditional by-the-gut actors, like baseball managers or campaign gurus, tend to overstate their own impact on events. There is no reason to think the Trump administration is any more adroit at using military deployments to send signals than more competent White Houses. Which raises a thought — how about we stop trying to signal with forces and use words instead? We have diplomats, led by a secretary of state who I have been assured is still alive. So rather than pointing to a submarine, missile, or bomber, how about we simply say what we mean?

RwandAir launches its first direct flight to Europe The airline will fly to London three times a week and is expected to boost tourism and trade between the UK and Rwanda. FAMAGUSTA GAZETTE CYPRUS� Rwanda's national airline RwandAir has launched first direct commercial flight to Gatwick International Airport, London's second busiest airport. The airline's flight took off from Kigali International Airport on Friday afternoon en route to Gatwick International Airport, adding it to its network of 22 destinations worldwide. The new route will be operated by recently acquired brand new Airbus A330 aircraft that boasts of in-flight connectivity. The airline will fly to London three times a week and is expected to boost tourism and trade between the UK and Rwanda. Speaking to reporters shortly after launching London flight destination, the airline's deputy chief executive officer in charge of corporate affairs, Yvonne Manzi Makolo said that the airline has embarked on expanding its wings to far destinations in order to serve a large clientele of travellers to visit Rwanda. "It's great step for our country, because it will bring us closer to our trade partners and sources of tourists. Rwanda will be making a big impact as a must-visit country," she added. Last year, the airline acquired its first A330-200 and A330-300 Airbus planes, boosting its fleet to 11 aircraft and capacity to compete globally. It is also scheduled to take delivery of another brand new Boeing before end of May. This direct seamless long-haul flight is an important milestone towards improving trade relations between Rwanda, the European continent. RwandAir carried more than 650,000 passengers last year and projects to transport over three million in the next five years. The Rwanda aviation industry which has become one of the largest and most profitable airlines in East Africa has continued to spread wings across Africa and beyond. The airline has been growing at an average of 20 percent in the last six years and is currently positioning itself as the most efficient and reliable airline in the region, according to figures from the Rwanda's ministry of infrastructure. The airline has 11 aircraft and expects delivery of the 12th, a Boeing 737-800, in May. � (Xinhua) Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

Quora Contributor Newsweek 27 May 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Quora Questions are part of a partnership between Newsweek and Quora, through which we'll be posting relevant and interesting answers from Quora contributors throughout the week. Read more about the partnership here. Answer from Nicolas Nelson, advocate for human space development: Will we have landed on Mars in the coming 50 years? Trending: Donald Trump's Twitter Has Been Unusually Quiet, But Will It Last? It depends on five distinct entities that could lead the way and accomplish that goal. Each one has lots of supporters and certainly a number of detractors and resistance to overcome. The first three are government agencies: NASA, CNSA (Chinese National Space Agency), and ESA (European Space Agency). Fifty years is a long time: long enough for any of these slow-moving but highly capable agencies, each with human spaceflight capability (well, ESA is working on it, but it's only a matter of time now, and you're offering fifty years) to scale up to a human mission to Mars. They might even cooperate with one another or with other space agencies (Roscosmos is not going to take the lead but is an obviously strong partner; ISRO a less obvious but highly desirable one; there are plenty of others). nasa mars magnetic shield radiationMore The planet Mars is shown May 12, 2016, in this NASA Hubble Space Telescope when it was 50 million miles from Earth. NASA/Handout via Reuters Don't miss: Two Men Killed Trying to Stop Anti-Muslim Rant on Oregon Train The next two are private firms, SpaceX and Blue Origin, inspired and driven by their visionary owners/leaders Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Either of these firms could send a human mission to Mars long before any space agency can, if they want to do so and are not constrained by finances. Jeff Bezos has lots more money than Elon Musk, but Bezos is content to play the slow-and-steady turtle when folks talk of a “race” to Mars. His focus is on cislunar space development first, then Mars when the cislunar infrastructure is in place, at least to some degree. Elon Musk burns with a passion to colonize Mars (yay!) but he also isn't concerned with any sort of “race” to Mars. He'd be delighted to see others get to Mars first, and has openly said so, if only “others” would hurry up and get busy. But he faces financial constraints that slow down his R&D and rocket building efforts. Musk doesn't seem too concerned with cislunar space infrastructure, his plans are more similar to a Martin Marietta “Mars Direct” style of mission, pushing very quickly past “explore and do science” missions into full-steam settlement mode. But he's taking financial risks to do so, risks that may not pan out. If Tesla or the Gigafactory or the Boring Company flop badly, any one of them could pull all the others down, including SpaceX. The fate of rapid Mars exploration and colonization might rest on whether Tesla’s new trucks sell well in 2018! (Okay, maybe not quite that delicate a financial position, but you get the idea.) Most popular: As President Trump Returns to U.S., Efforts to Counter Russia Probe Fallout Intensify So: fifty years from now, Elon Musk will have sent humans to Mars or died/gone bankrupt in the attempt. If all goes well for SpaceX, they will have a crew of humans on the Red Planet in just ten or twelve years… but there's a lot that can delay this. Fifty years from now, if Elon has failed somehow, Jeff Bezos will have sent humans to Mars, but only recently, and all in good time. Thirty or forty years is about right, I imagine. Fifty years from now, a NASA/Boeing human mission may have visited Mars two or three times over a span of six years, left flags and footprints, taken a ton or two of geologic samples, and declared it all a success and gone home to Earth, all depending entirely on the notoriously fickle will of the American Congress and constantly-changing presidential administrations. Can this happen? Oh certainly. Is it likely? Certainly not. Read More Same goes for the ESA and the CNSA: assuming a sustained political will, and diplomatic success in both foreign policy and scientific cooperation, there's no reason either of them (plus any partner they recruit, optionally) could not send a human mission or two to Mars. But so many factors conspire against it, the likelihood is low, in the current geopolitical climate. Just one serious war or threat of imminent war could derail it for another fifty years.
