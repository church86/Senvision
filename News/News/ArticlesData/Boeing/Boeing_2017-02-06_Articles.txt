Bean, Carrier, Boeing and Ford, what U.S. company will be next to get an individual shout-out, threat or thrashing from President Trump? It looks like the billionaire businessman will keep using his “bully pulpit” to hector and hail individual companies as he did before taking office. Given this trend, concerns are mounting about crony capitalism in the Trump era. Shell-shocked corporate executives are weighing how they should respond. In this climate we offer a proven, new model for the Trump administration and for business leaders to consider. ADVERTISEMENT Companies need a level playing field to compete in a dynamic, growth-oriented capitalist system, in order to focus on participating in the marketplace, not in the political arena or with political money. Crony capitalism, a number of economists believe, can distort the marketplace and bring harmful uncertainty to companies. And there’s an association between government-induced risk and companies increasing their political donations, according to academic research.   When Trump urges millions of Twitter followers to “Buy L.L. Bean” products in the wake of an L.L. Bean board member’s political contributions, when he calls out a single company with threats, or when he meets personally with executives seeking a merger of their companies, doesn’t it create an incentive for businesses to ingratiate themselves with his team? It’s notable that Trump-targeted Boeing pledged $1 million to his inauguration. President Trump made “draining the swamp” a centerpiece of his campaign, yet in his inaugural address, he said nothing about campaign finance reform. A growing number of America’s leading companies are choosing transparency for their political spending, and they apply board oversight, too. Will he endorse this voluntary effort and avert deepening the swamp? If corporate leaders haven’t adopted transparency policies yet, will they do so and strike a blow against crony capitalism? Transparency mitigates risks and reassures shareholders that the companies they invest in are well-run. It can protect against political donations that might trigger a backlash in our fiercely divided political climate. Finally, an oversight policy helps companies shield against politicians’ shakedowns: a company can simply cite its policy and just say no. These aren’t abstract concerns. They’re concrete. The presidential election cycle in 2016 broke political spending records, nearing $7 billion, up from $6.3 billion in the 2012 cycle. Driving much of the record costs were outside groups, including “dark money” groups not required to disclose their donors. These groups have offered attractive conduits for corporate check writers wanting to remain anonymous. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, spent almost $30 million on influencing 2016 House and Senate races, while not identifying the donors. Overall, political dark money was projected to reach at least $132 million in 2016. And while it’s not possible to calculate the sum spent by corporations on politics in 2016, a sense of scale is available from another arena―in the states―where more and more companies are turning for action. In the 2014 election cycle, business interests spent $1.1 billion on state candidates and committees. By comparison, in the same period labor groups spent $215 million and ideological or single-issue groups, $137 million. Numerous companies already have chosen to lift the veil on their spending to influence elections. When a recent nonpartisan report examined the S&P 500, it found that 305 companies were disclosing some or all of their political payments. One hundred and eleven companies had policies requiring board oversight of political spending. And 143 firms had placed some level of restriction on their political spending. It’s not enough to condemn our existing campaign finance system as “broken,” as Trump has done. We supported a proposal for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to require disclosure of corporate spending on politics, but that proposal is six feet under now. Transparency and accountability policies for corporations that open their checkbooks to influence elections are gaining mainstream support from U.S. businesses, but there’s still a long way to go. For a new anti-regulatory president and for businesses that haven’t signed up, what could be smarter than endorsing an idea that’s pro-growth, pro-democracy and voluntary too? Bruce F. Freed is president of the Center for Political Accountability and an advisory board member of Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research at the Wharton School. He spent a decade on Capitol Hill serving lawmakers in both the Senate and the House. Charles E.M. Kolb is treasurer and a board member of the Center for Political Accountability.

Composite beams for the Dreamliners are manufactured by TAL Manufacturing Solutions, a Tata enterprise in Nagpur. The 5,000 th floor beam was shipped out recently You may not know it yet, but critical components of international aircraft are made in India, writes Ashwini Phadnis India’s attempt to make a commercial aircraft for the global market might not have met with much success so far but this does not mean that the journey is over. On the contrary, the picture that is emerging is very promising. The work done by Indian companies, someexclusively by them, is a big factor in making both Boeing and Airbus aircraft fly. While the full aircraft may not be manufactured in India, both Boeing and Airbus aircraft have critical parts being manufactured here. Take for instance Dynamatic Technologies, which is the sole supplier for flat track beams for Airbus A-320 and A-330 aircraft. These beams are manufactured in India and dispatched to Europe where they are fitted into the assembly lines and then delivered to customers. Talking to BusinessLine, Srinivasan Dwarakanath, Managing Director, Airbus India, pointed out that this was a big deal as Dynamatic is a single source supplier. “When you qualify someone as a single source it is not enough that they have the necessary skills, (it is) important (to ensure) that the logistics are taken care of, important that the material is supplied to them every step of the way and they need to be taken care of so that they actually deliver. This is important because we commit to the customer and the customer sells tickets to you and me. So if they cannot deliver you can see the impact,” Dwarakanath said. He added that all Airbus aircraft coming out of its assembly line were partly made in India or had something made in India. “If you look at the Airbus 320, 330 or the long-range aircraft that we make like 350 or 380, there are either assemblies or different parts which are made in India,” he said. Engineering, manufacturing and customer support are the three broad areas, apart from R&D, where Airbus focuses its energies in India. Airbus’ rival Boeing too is not far behind. In fact, its aircraft have a ‘Made in India’ tag. Pratyush Kumar, President, Boeing India, told BusinessLine that if one is to take the number of products from India in an entire aircraft it will probably be small but the jobs done by Indian companies are very important.Software coding too “In some areas they (Indian companies) have done pretty well. For example, like software in avionics (a lot of the) embedded stuff is coming from India. Three million lines of code for the Boeing 787 were written in India. So the software for the flight control system was written in India. This is basically the system that controls the flight of an aircraft or the avionics,” he explained. Pointing out that an aircraft is a highly engineered product, Kumar added that India, with its deep and broad capabilities in engineering and a very competitive wage structure, is well positioned to be a significant part of the global chain of aerospace and aviation. One of the biggest success stories for Boeing in India has been composite beams, which are considered the spine of the aircraft on which its internal stress is carried. These are manufactured for the Boeing 787 Dreamliners by TAL Manufacturing Solutions, a Tata enterprise in Nagpur. The 5,000th floor beam of this stress bearing critical component involving very high tech and skilled manufacturing was shipped out recently. “For the beam, India is one of the two production centres in the world. The other one is in California. At this time, we are seeing better quality from India,” Kumar said. Both Boeing and Airbus tied up with suppliers in India decades ago. Airbus’ industrial cooperation with India began in the 1980s when an agreement was reached with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to manufacture forward passenger doors for the A-320 aircraft. Boeing started procuring the forward doors for the 757 in the mid to late 1990s and in 1991, HAL became the single-source producer of Boeing 757 over-wing exit doors.Stronger partnerships The partnerships have been strengthened over the years. Today Airbus has about 45 suppliers which it has developed over the last 10 years. “If you look at Asia, India is the number one country when it comes to engineering services for Airbus,” says Dwarkanath. However, the momentum has picked up even more recently, thanks largely to the ‘Make in India’ campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “After the launch of ‘Make in India’, Boeing has doubled its sourcing from India,” Kumar says. Its sourcing from company and Tier I (direct) suppliers has doubled in recent years and stands at about half a billion dollars, Kumar added. Airbus’ Dwarakanath points out that in 2015 Airbus’s sourcing from India was a little over $500 million. “We do expect future growth in our supply chain in India and we continue to look at opportunities to collaborate with Indian industry, based on companies’ competitiveness as well as the requirements for our airplane production,” Kumar said.

 Trump's 'America First' policies are catapulting Boeing into dangerous territory Benjamin Zhang Feb. 4, 2017, 9:19 AM 40,044 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner.Boeing For a company like Boeing, President Donald Trump’s "America First" policies, which represent a sharp departure for the US, threaten the way the corporation does business. Take its 787 Dreamliner. It’s a flying symbol of an interconnected world economy, one with a network of global suppliers that would be hard to unravel with government policies, and a global group of customers waiting to buy the plans. The Dreamliner is like the United Nations of planes: Its wings and batteries come from Japan. Its wing tips come from South Korea. India is the source of its floor beams. The front fuselage is made in the USA and Japan. The center fuselage and horizontal stabilizers are from Italy. Landing gear and doors? France. Cargo access doors are built in Sweden. The wing/body fairings, which cover gaps on the body, are from Canada. The movable trailing edge of the wings are from Canada, except when they’re from the US or Australia. Thrust reversers come from Mexico. Its engines come from either General Electric in the US or Rolls-Royce in the UK. What's made where.Skye Gould/BI Graphics After all that, the components travel around the world before arriving at one of Boeing's factories in Washington or South Carolina, where they’re assembled into finished planes. Then, they’re delivered to more than 60 airlines worldwide. The Trump administration’s foreign policy and stances on trade and defense could have significant effects on how multinational companies do business. While a company such as Boeing supports a massive manufacturing presence in the US, it has cultivated a broad network of international partners that have invested decades and billions of dollars into relationships with Boeing. These partners have deep ties to their local governments and business communities, but the new administration’s hardline stance on globalization threatens those bonds. And for Boeing, it could give its main rival, Airbus, a serious leg up. NAFTA and the war on trade As the Trump White House dials up the tough talk on trade, there are few companies as potentially affected by policies and changes as Boeing. This is especially true for the nondefense half of its business, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, which makes the Dreamliner. First, take the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), that pact between the US, Canada, and Mexico that for more than two decades has created a free market in the region. While controversial leading up to its inception, the furor over NAFTA died down in recent years — until being reignited by Trump, who has vowed to renegotiate or even scrap the agreement. A Boeing Dreamliner flies over Washington, DC.Boeing Now with NAFTA's future in doubt, and Trump's plan to build a multibillion-dollar wall on the Mexican border — paid for with a 20% tax on Mexican imports — Boeing could suffer. First, there are those thrust reversers built in Mexico; they would instantly become a lot more expensive. There are customers at stake. Mexico's flag carrier, AeroMexico, flies an all-Boeing fleet, while its two local rivals, Interjet and Volaris, are loyal customers of Airbus, the European giant. If Mexico retaliates against US tariffs by instituting its own border tax for goods coming into the country, Boeing planes could become a lot more expensive and lead AeroMexico to choose Airbus over Boeing. "A 20% tax on the planes is huge and basically makes any Boeing product uneconomical for Mexican customers." Vinay Bhaskara, a senior business analyst at Airways, told Business Insider. "Boeing either becomes unprofitable in that market or they simply can’t sell outside of the US." For every Boeing plane, Airbus has an equivalent competitor. If you’re thinking about buying a Boeing 737, you’re also looking at the Airbus A320, for instance. They’re generally priced similarly too. "If Trump's policies damage Boeing, Airbus would be the big beneficiary," Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at aviation-consulting firm Teal Group, told Business Insider. China and the Middle East Boeing believes China could buy as much as $1 trillion worth of commercial airplanes over the next 20 years. There’s a lot of demand there for widebody jets like the 787 Dreamliner. A China Southern Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner.Flickr/byeangel But Trump’s policies and rhetoric toward China could put that at risk. Trump has accused China of playing games with its currency, to the detriment of US business. He’s openly challenged the One China Policy that's maintained the fragile peace between China and Taiwan. He’s criticized China for its artificial islands in the South China Sea. None of this pleases the people who hold the trillion-dollar market’s purse strings — the Chinese government and its massive state-owned airlines. "China is easily the biggest area of concern for Boeing," Aboulafia said. "China is very big, and they account for 20% to 25% of Boeing’s output right now." Two other countries planning to buy a lot of Boeing airplanes are Iran and Iraq. The Iraqi government has 18 Boeing 737-800s on order as well as 10 787-8 Dreamliners. In total, it’s worth about $3.7 billion. The Boeing 787 production line in Washington state.Boeing Boeing is also trying to complete a deal with Iranian leaders for an 80-plane order. That could be worth $16 billion, though likely less at negotiated prices. But now Trump is president. His executive order, which temporarily bans immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries, includes Iran and Iraq, which responded with similar measures. The Trump administration put Iran "on notice" after the country tested a ballistic missile, and relations between the nations, tenuous but improving since the nuclear deal, appear to be worsening. Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 As with with China, these deals are at risk if the Persian Gulf governments feel aggrieved by the new administration’s policies. Made in America Trump rode into office on a populist platform promising to reinvigorate American manufacturing. As a candidate and as president, he’s used his own bully pulpit, and Twitter account, to shame companies like Carrier that plan to move jobs to other countries. But for Boeing, with that international supply chain, switching many of its internationally sourced components for aircraft such as the 787 to a new US supplier is "basically impossible," said Aboulafia. That's because, unlike traditional supplier networks, many of Boeing's suppliers are full partners that have invested their own money in the development of the 787’s parts with the idea that they would make money off their investment throughout the life of the program. I think he thinks this is kind of like importing cement for casinos, where you can just switch your source for the cement. "I think he thinks this is kind of like importing cement for casinos, where you can just switch your source for the cement," Aboulafia said. "Trump may have the idea that they can shift sources, but the airplane industry doesn’t work that way." "Contracts tend to run the life of the program rather than we feel like buying from X one year and Y the next year," he added. Take the Dreamliner’s Japanese-built wings as an example. If Boeing were willing and able to disentangle itself from that complex international supplier relationship, Aboulafia said it would require reimbursing the Japanese and other companies that invested in the development and production of wings. Instead of being paid over the lifetime of the 787 program — about 30 years — Boeing would have to fully pay back the supplier to the tune of billions of dollars. Then Boeing would have to find an American company willing to invest in creating alternatives as there are no US companies producing equivalent parts. Tweet Force One The current Boeing VC-25A that serves as Air Force One.AP A few weeks after Election Day, Trump sent a tweet that had a single target: Boeing. "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Trump wrote. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Boeing, blindsided by the tweet, was forced to quickly issue a statement noting that it’s only "under contract" for $170 million to determine the capabilities of the new plane. But the fact that companies can unexpectedly come into the president’s crosshairs, often with no warning, is the new reality for those doing business in the US. And these tweets and statements can influence a company’s perception among the public — and apply pressure to change how they run their businesses. Thanks, Trump? Trump in 1985 with an artist's concept of "Television City," a project that would have been built on the West Side of Manhattan, New York. It never happened.Marty Lederhandler/AP That’s not to say that the new administration is all bad news for Boeing and other multinationals. "Most of the good Trump can do for Boeing comes from what's generically good for corporate America," Bhaskara said. The Trump administration plans cuts to corporate tax rates, and there’s talk of making it easier to repatriate the money that companies like Boeing earn abroad. And the president could come to Boeing’s aid in its battle with Airbus, which has long enjoyed subsidies from European governments. Boeing contends that’s an unfair advantage, and the matter is being litigated at the World Trade Organization. "If there are specific things Trump can achieve in terms of reducing European subsidies to Airbus, then I would think that helps Boeing compete a little bit," Simon Lester, a Cato Institute trade-policy analyst, told Business Insider. It is customary for presidents to help push for sales of major US industrial products while on foreign visits. In fact, President Barack Obama once remarked that he deserved to a gold watch from the company because he's constantly selling Boeing products. If he so chooses, Trump, the consummate salesman, could be Boeing’s best marketing tool.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 February 2017 by Military News Heroux-Devtek Reports Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Results LONGUEUIL, QUEBEC — (Marketwired) — 02/07/17 — Heroux-Devtek Inc. (TSX: HRX), (“Heroux-Devtek” or the “Corporation”), a leading international manufacturer of aerospace products, today reported its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 ended December 31, 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are in Canadian dollars. “Our ability to ramp-up production and deliveries of complete landing gear systems for the Boeing 777 aircraft was a key factor in Heroux-Devtek’s third-quarter sales increase. We are also very pleased to have obtained customer approval for one of the three main surface treatment processes at our Strongsville, Ohio facility which will allow us to perform this key value-added activity internally. As anticipated, certain excess costs pending the completion of the approval phase and normal costs related to the production ramp-up had a negative impact on profitability,” said Gilles Labbe, President and CEO of Heroux-Devtek. “During the quarter, Heroux-Devtek was awarded three contracts that highlight its status as one of the world’s leading landing gear designers and manufacturers. These contracts on important programs such as the Embraer KC-390 multi-mission transport aircraft, the BAE Systems Hawk advanced jet trainer and the Saab Gripen E fighter are a testament of our solid relationships with leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as well as our global reach,” added Mr. Labbe. However, as some OEMs have announced reductions to their production rates for certain aircraft programs, including the Boeing 777, Heroux-Devtek will have to adjust its workforce by approximately 90 employees by the end of calendar 2017 throughout its offices and plants. The Corporation expects a related non-recurring charge of approximately $4.8 million to be accounted for, mainly in the last quarter of fiscal 2017. “In response to evolving market conditions, Heroux-Devtek is acting diligently by adjusting its workforce, while remaining in close contact with its customers to monitor the situation. We regret the consequences of this decision on affected employees and their families and we will take equitable measures to provide them with all the support they deserve,” said Mr. Labbe.

 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS Consolidated sales reached $98.5 million, compared with $96.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This increase reflects higher sales to the defence aerospace markets, as detailed below, while year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies had a positive impact of $1.7 million on third-quarter sales. Commercial sales were $50.7 million, versus $50.8 million last year. This stability reflects the ongoing production ramp-up related to the long-term agreement to supply The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) with complete landing gear systems for the Boeing 777 and 777X aircraft, as well as favourable currency fluctuations, offset by lower customer requirements for certain business jet and large commercial aircraft programs. Defence sales rose from $45.8 million to $47.7 million. This increase is essentially attributable to higher new and spare part requirements from civil customers, notably for the F-35 program, as well as favourable currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower engineering sales following the completion of certain development phases. Gross profit was $15.0 million, or 15.3% of sales, versus $18.1 million, or 18.7% of sales, last year. The decrease is mainly due to a higher under-absorption of costs, including excess processing and finishing costs related to the Boeing 777 program. These costs are expected to normalize upon completion of the customer qualification and approval of Heroux-Devtek’s surface treatment processes. To a lesser extent, normal learning curve costs associated with the initial production ramp-up of the Boeing 777 contract and certain costs related to completing the integration of repair and overhaul facilities in the U.K. also impacted profitability. These factors were partially offset by favourable year-over-year currency fluctuations equivalent to 2.9% of sales. EBITDA reached $13.9 million, or 14.1% of sales, compared with $15.7 million, or 16.2% of sales, a year ago as a result of lower gross profit, partially offset by a reduction in selling and administrative expenses reflecting the year-over-year variations in the currency translation of net monetary items. Net income reached $8.2 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding non-recurring items net of taxes, adjusted net income was $6.0 million, or $0.17 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, versus $7.0 million, or $0.19 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This year’s adjusted net income excluded an after-tax amount of $2.2 million related to a non-cash gain resulting from the update of the estimated repayment schedule for certain government authorities loans, taking into account revised assumptions mainly related to sales forecasts made following reduced production rates announced by OEMs. NINE-MONTH RESULTS For the first nine months of fiscal 2017, consolidated sales reached $285.7 million, versus $289.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies increased sales by $6.8 million. Commercial sales reached $150.0 million, versus $152.2 million a year ago, while defence sales totalled $135.6 million, compared with $137.1 million last year. Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 amounted to $47.2 million, equivalent to 16.5% of sales, compared with $52.1 million, or 18.0% of sales, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA reached $42.3 million, or 14.8% of sales, versus $43.4 million, or 15.0% of sales, a year earlier. Net income was $22.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, compared with $17.6 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income stood at $17.3 million, or $0.48 per share, versus $18.6 million, or $0.52 per share, last year. FINANCIAL POSITION As at December 31, 2016, Heroux-Devtek’s balance sheet remained healthy with cash and cash equivalents of $18.9 million, while total long-term debt was $138.7 million, including the current portion, but excluding net deferred financing costs. Long-term debt includes $56.4 million drawn against the Corporation’s authorized Credit Facility of $200.0 million. As a result of a solid free cash flow generation, the net debt position was $119.9 million as at December 31, 2016, down from $130.4 million three months earlier. The net-debt-to equity ratio stood at 0.35:1 as at December 31, 2016, versus 0.39:1 three months earlier. UPDATE ON B-777 AND B-777X CONTRACT During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, Heroux-Devtek continued the ongoing production ramp-up of complete landing gear systems for this program. It also received customer approval for one of the three main surface treatment processes required under this contract in order to produce the most critical components internally. Customer qualification and approval is progressing for the remainder of the surface treatment processes. Management expects this phase to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In the meantime, the Corporation continues to utilize its supply chain in order to meet the customer’s delivery schedule, which is negatively impacting the expected margin of the first units delivered. SALES GUIDANCE Since the end of the previous quarter, aircraft OEMs have announced reduced production rates for certain programs, including the Boeing 777. As a result of these changes in assumptions related to forecasted sales, management: 

--  Now expects relatively stable sales in fiscal 2017, when compared to
    fiscal 2016;

--  Forecasts a low single-digit decrease in sales for the fiscal year
    ending March 31, 2018, when compared to expected sales for fiscal 2017;

--  Following a transition year in fiscal 2018, Heroux-Devtek expects sales
    to grow progressively to reach between $480 million and $520 million in
    fiscal 2021.

 Please see “Forward-Looking Statements” below and the Guidance section in the Corporation’s MD&A for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, for further details regarding the material assumptions underlying the foregoing guidance. OUTLOOK In the large commercial aircraft sector, Boeing and Airbus are proceeding with production rate adjustments ahead of introducing certain more fuel efficient aircraft variants on several leading programs through calendar 2019. Their backlogs remain strong despite a reduction in new firm orders in calendar 2016 versus the previous year. In the defence aerospace market, the new U.S. administration may bring a shift in priorities, the impact of which on defence spending is uncertain at this time. The Corporation’s U.K. operations provide a more geographically diversified defence portfolio, which reduces its relative exposure to the U.S. market. The balance between new component manufacturing and aftermarket products and services in the Corporation’s defence portfolio and its leading program content also promote more stability. As at December 31, 2016, Heroux-Devtek’s funded (firm orders) backlog stood at $424 million, versus $437 million three months earlier. “For the short-term, our priority is to finalize the customer approval process for our surface treatment activities. Given the progress accomplished to this day, we expect to finalize this important phase early in the new fiscal year. We also remain focussed on ramping up production and meeting delivery schedules for the Boeing 777 contract. As for the longer term, our integrated world-class capabilities, ability to carry out large-scale mandates, operating flexibility and solid financial position will allow Heroux-Devtek to capture additional opportunities to further expand its reach in its niche market,” concluded Mr. Labbe.

Close share panel Image copyright PA Image caption In May the government awarded US firm Boeing a contract to build 50 Apache helicopters US firm Boeing says its plans for a new UK base will not threaten jobs at Leonardo Helicopters in Yeovil, despite concerns by Lord Ashdown and others. The government recently gave Boeing permission to build a new factory in Boscombe Down, creating 1,000 jobs. Boeing spokesman Nick Whitney said: "It is not our intention to move any work to Boscombe Down that is currently carried out in Yeovil." Concerns remain after Boeing won a contract to build 50 Apaches last year. 'Bad faith' The BBC understands that managers at Leonardo Helicopters are privately very concerned, as are Unite, the trade union, and Paddy Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrat Yeovil MP. Boeing has said the new "centre of excellence" which will be built on Ministry of Defence-owned land will be used to maintain and repair its military planes and helicopters. Mr Whitney said: "Our aim of fixed-wing business growth is going to be centred on Boscombe Down, and that doesn't affect the rotary wing activity in Yeovil." A sought-after contract to build 50 Apache helicopters for the MoD was won by Boeing in May, in what was seen as a huge blow to Leonardo. Instead the Yeovil-based firm was awarded the maintenance side of the contract. Lord Ashdown said: "Here they are encouraging Boeing to seriously damage the viability of Yeovil's capacity to continue to produce helicopters and maintain them and at the same time, undermine the government's own deal with Leonardo in a way which will at the very least, in my view, cause Leonardo to shout very angrily 'bad faith'." Unite spokesman Heathcliffe Pettifer said: "We know that Leonardo lost the 50 Apache helicopters to Boeing. There are no packages of work in respect of that for the Yeovil site. "But we were promised that there would be service and maintenance contracts and with the announcement of the centre of excellence at Boscombe Down, that looks to be up in the air now." Analysis by Clinton Rogers, BBC Somerset There's no doubt the confusion the Boeing announcement has caused is unsettling for workers in Yeovil. Boeing's cause wasn't helped by a leaked document which implied its new base at Boscombe Down would be a European centre for maintenance of military planes and helicopters. Now, in what some see as a "backtracking" from its original position, Boeing are saying it is not "their intention" to move any work to Boscombe Down which is currently done in Yeovil. But that stops short of a guarantee - so understandably the workers and the unions at Leonardo are nervous. The government, too, has moved to reassure people that it is committed to maintaining a UK helicopter industry. But the big question is, what will happen in the long term when the US giant has a foothold here? How will that impact on an aviation industry with a long and proud history in Somerset?

Credit: NanoRacks A commercial airlock built in partnership by NanoRacks and Boeing will be connected to the International Space Station in 2019, the companies announced Monday, after the proposed project won preliminary approval from NASA managers. NanoRacks plans to deploy small commercial satellites and CubeSats from the airlock, reducing the workload currently occupying time on the smaller equipment airlock inside the Japanese Kibo laboratory module. Only half of the Kibo airlock’s capacity is allocated to NASA and commercial clients — the rest goes to Japan. “This partnership is an important step in the commercial transition we’ll see on the ISS in coming years,” said Mark Mulqueen, Boeing’s ISS program manager. “Utilizing a commercial airlock to keep up with the demand of deployment will significantly streamline our process.” NanoRacks has arranged for the launch of more than 375 payloads to the space station since 2009, including more than 100 CubeSats released from a deployer mounted on the end of the Japanese robotic arm outside Kibo for commercial customers, universities and NASA. Houston-based NanoRacks also has an external platform outside Kibo, where scientists can test sensors, electronics and other equipment in the harsh environment of space. The privately-funded commercial airlock will launch inside the unpressurized trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo craft, then attach to a port on the station’s Tranquility module with the Canadian-built robotic arm. Another commercial module is already to connected to Tranquility. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, or BEAM, launched to the station in April 2016 under a NASA-funded contract. Developed and built by Bigelow Aerospace, the soft-sided module expanded to full size in late May after bolted on to the Tranquility module. BEAM is on a two-year demonstration to test the performance of an expandable module in space, but Bigelow and NASA are in discussions to extend the module’s presence on the station longer. NASA and NanoRacks signed a Space Act Agreement for the airlock project last year. The space agency announced Monday that it has committed to install the airlock on the station once NanoRacks completes pre-agreed financial and technical milestones outlined in the agreement. “We want to utilize the space station to expose the commercial sector to new and novel uses of space, ultimately creating a new economy in low Earth orbit for scientific research, technology development and human and cargo transportation,” said Sam Scimemi, director of the ISS division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “We hope this new airlock will allow a diverse community to experiment and develop opportunities in space for the commercial sector.” The new airlock will triple the number of small satellites that can be deployed in a single cycle, according to Boeing.

Credit: NanoRacks Astronauts inside the station will also be able to assemble payloads from components delivered to the complex in bags, then put them through the NanoRacks airlock, which can handle larger packages than the sizes supported by the current Kibo passageway. Boeing is providing the passive common berthing mechanism, a connecting ring to install the new port on the Tranquility module, plus unspecified engineering services required for developing and manufacturing of the airlock, according to NanoRacks. “We are very pleased to have Boeing joining with us to develop the airlock module,” said Jeffrey Manber, CEO of NanoRacks. “This is a huge step for NASA and the U.S. space program, to leverage the commercial marketplace for low Earth orbit, on Space Station and beyond, and NanoRacks is proud to be taking the lead in this prestigious venture.” Boeing is also NASA’s lead contractor for the entire space station, providing engineering support for all of the lab’s U.S. modules. NanoRacks said the airlock could be detached from the ISS and placed on another platform in orbit. “The NanoRacks airlock module is the next logical step in the successful line of NanoRacks’ commercial payload facilities,” said Brock Howe, head of the airlock project at NanoRacks. “This airlock module will provide a broad range of capabilities to our payload customers and expand greatly on the commercial utilization of the station — and I look forward to leading the team at NanoRacks on this next venture.” The airlock module will be assembled and tested by NanoRacks, which is also responsible for the design, safety, operations, quality assurance, mockups and crew training, the company said in a statement. ATA Engineering of San Diego will lead structural and thermal analysis and testing services for the airlock project. Email the author. Follow Stephen Clark on Twitter: @StephenClark1.

In this artist’s conception, NanoRacks’ airlock module is the knobby-looking hardware attached to a port on the International Space Station’s Tranquility module. (NanoRacks Illustration) NASA has accepted a plan from a private venture called NanoRacks to provide the International Space Station with an air lock that would serve as its first commercial portal. The plan could serve as the model for the eventual development of entire space stations backed by the private sector. The NanoRacks Airlock Module is to be developed in cooperation with Boeing and could be fitted to the station’s Tranquility module by as early as 2019, NASA and Houston-based NanoRacks said today in a pair of announcements. For years, NanoRacks has been working on logistics with NASA and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, or CASIS, which manages non-NASA payloads for the space station. Scores of miniaturized satellites have been deployed into orbit through an air lock on the station’s Japanese-built Kibo module with the aid of NanoRacks’ deployer. The new air lock would let NanoRacks and its partners expand its commercial satellite deployment operation, and provide new opportunities for NASA as well as commercial ventures. “We want to utilize the space station to expose the commercial sector to new and novel uses of space, ultimately creating a new economy in low-Earth orbit for scientific research, technology development and human and cargo transportation,” Sam Scimemi, director of the ISS Division at NASA Headquarters, said in today’s announcement. “We hope this new airlock will allow a diverse community to experiment and develop opportunities in space for the commercial sector.” Once NanoRacks has complied with the steps outlined in a Space Act Agreement reached with NASA last year, the space agency will give the official go-ahead for installation. Today, NanoRacks announced a side agreement that gives Boeing the task of fabricating and installing a critical component of the air lock, the Passive Common Berthing Mechanism. The PCBM hardware is the standard interface for connecting space station modules. “We are very pleased to have Boeing joining with us to develop the Airlock Module,” NanoRacks CEO Jeffrey Manber said. “This is a huge step for NASA and the U.S. space program, to leverage the commercial marketplace for low-Earth orbit, on space station and beyond, and NanoRacks is proud to be taking the lead in this prestigious venture.” NanoRacks said San Diego-based ATA Engineering will be in charge of structural and thermal analysis, testing services and support of the air lock. The Airlock Module is designed to be detached at a future time if desired. During last summer’s New Space conference in Seattle, Manber said it could serve as one of the initial building blocks for a commercial space station. “That air lock can leave the station at the proper time – four, five, six years from now – and attach to a commercial piece of real estate,” Manber said at the Seattle meeting. Other space ventures are pursuing a similar model, starting with commercial components for the space station that could be repurposed or refined for different orbital platforms. For example, Bigelow Aerospace provided an inflatable module for testing on the space station last year under the terms of a $17.8 million contract with NASA. A larger module could serve as the first piece of a commercial space station testbed that Bigelow is developing in cooperation with United Launch Alliance. Yet another private venture, Axiom Space, is working on a commercial orbital module that could be temporarily attached to the space station, and then detached to become the foundation for a private-sector outpost in orbit. NanoRacks’ Manber is no stranger to space commercialization: In the late 1990s, he was the CEO of MirCorp, a company that struck a deal with the Russians for commercial orbital activities during the final days of the Mir space station. For a time, MirCorp worked with NBC and “Survivor” producer Mark Burnett on a reality-TV space show tentatively titled “Destination Mir,” but when Mir flamed out in 2001, so did the TV project.           Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

(Boeing Photo) As tensions with Iran increase under President Donald Trump, the future of Boeing’s $8 billion deal with Iran Air lingers in limbo. New sanctions imposed by the Trump administration on Friday don’t directly impact the pending sale, but they do represent the White House’s shift away from the Iran nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions and allowed Boeing’s negotiations to move ahead under President Barack Obama. Boeing announced the sale of 80 aircraft to Iran Air in December, saying it coordinated closely with the U.S. government to ensure the agreement went through.The total list price of the planes is $16.6 billion, but Iran said the actual price came to about half that amount. In the news release announcing the sale, Boeing spoke to Trump’s concerns about jobs. The company said the agreement would “support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs directly associated with production and delivery of the 777-300ERs and nearly 100,000 U.S. jobs in the U.S. aerospace value stream for the full course of deliveries.” The jobs angle doesn’t seem to have done much to protect the deal, however. Analysts say it’s unlikely to go through. “I just regard them [Boeing] as doomed, the deal is doomed,” said aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group. “This administration seems to want sanctions back in place and tensions renewed, and that’s not a recipe for a jetliner deal being done.”   Iran Air has historically operated Boeing planes, including this 747-200 jet. (Press TV Photo) Boeing has remained quiet on recent actions Trump has taken against Iran, including blocking immigration from the country under an executive order aimed at securing U.S. borders. While companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Expedia filed briefs in support of Washington state’s challenge to the immigration ban, Boeing has refused to comment. When asked whether the most recently announced financial sanctions could affect the Iran Air deal, a Boeing spokesman said the company will proceed with sale arrangements under its current license from the U.S. Treasury Department. “Should we receive new guidance from the Treasury Department, we will act accordingly,” spokesman Tim Neale said in an email. Among the issues yet to be resolved are the financial arrangements for the purchase, and the prospect of future congressional action. House Republicans have already introduced legislation that could raise new hurdles for the sale. Assuming that all the hurdles can be overcome, the first Boeing jets would be delivered next year. Meanwhile, Boeing’s European archrival, Airbus, last month delivered the first of 100 jets to Iran Air under the terms of a separate multibillion-dollar agreement. Aboulafia speculated that Boeing’s business priorities may be a factor behind the company’s reluctance to comment on the president’s recent actions. “They fight their battles carefully, and probably their highest priority right now is doing what they can do with China,” Aboulafia said. President Trump has proposed a 45 percent tariff on imports from China, which some fear could start a trade war. Boeing is the largest exporter in the U.S. and would probably be among the companies hurt the most in such a fight. In a September report, the company estimated that China will need 6,810 new planes worth $1.025 trillion over the next 20 years, which would make China its largest commercial airplane customer. China has threatened to shift contracts to Airbus in the event of a trade war.. Boeing remained mum on Trump’s tariff threats during his candidacy, but did promote trade relations with China in the September report. “The company is recognized as an industry leader in supporting a strong and robust U.S.-China trade relationship and remains committed to demonstrating the value of bilateral trade and advocating its continued growth,” the report said.

"The 11 Boeing 737s are older planes and will be used for temporary basis till the induction of Boeing 737 Max," said a Jet Airways source aware of the development. It is pertinent to note that Boeing 737 Max will mainly come as replacement for the existing leased aircraft which will be returned on the expiry of their lease. However, a Jet Airways spokesperson refused to comment on the story, calling it speculative. The airline, at present, has a fleet of 114 aircraft which includes a mix of wide-body Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s, narrow-body 737s and ATRs. It has 75 Boeing 737s Max on order which are due for delivery in 2018. Also, the airline is said to have deferred the induction of Boeing 787 aircraft which was scheduled to get delivered by the end of 2017. Jet Airways claims that it does not want to rush into expensive asset purchase game but would rather develop market by way of leasing aircraft, code-shares and strategic partnerships. The airline, in order to back its strategy, said that its code-share traffic has surged from 650,000 passengers in FY14 to 1.22 million in FY15. Gaurang Shetty, whole time director of Jet Airways, during an interaction last year with DNA Money had said, "It's not that only if you place large plane orders that you are expanding. We keep scanning for all kind of opportunities like leasing of planes to increase our capacity. End of the day, it's the bottom-line which matters." According to aviation experts, Jet Airways's market share has declined from over 21% earlier to just under 18% in 2016. The standalone profit declined 70% year on year in the third quarter on account of higher operational and other costs combined with increased competition. Jet Airways's rivals, on the other hand, have not only placed large orders, but also want the planes inducted in reasonable number over a period of decade to capture the market share. For example, low-frills airline IndiGo expects to add 18 aircraft to its fleet of 118 by the end of this fiscal year. The airline has placed an order for 430 fuel-efficient A320neo aircraft. Similarly, GoAir had doubled its A320neo order when it ordered 72 additional aircraft as part of its expansion plan. GoAir has plans to start international operations by early next year when it gets a total of 20 aircraft in its fleet. SpiceJet last month announced purchasing 205 aircraft from Boeing for Rs 1.5 lakh crore in order to increase its fleet fivefold.

With that, Providence appears to have emerged as the winner in a race among New England airports for the base. Norwegian already flies from numerous U.S. destinations. Last year, however, the airline announced plans to start flying from two smaller Northeast airports sometime in 2017, part of an effort open two U.S. bases to house pilots for its new Boeing 737 MAX jets. Those jets are scheduled to begin arriving to the carrier by mid-2017. The new bases are expected to bring multiple European routes to each of those airports. One of those airports – Stewart International in Newburgh, N.Y., about 70 miles from Midtown Manhattan – had already been confirmed by Norwegian. A second Norwegian 737 base was to be selected closer to Boston, with Providence, Hartford, Conn., and Portsmouth, N.H., under consideration by the carrier.

Norwegian CEO Bjørn Kjos may have first tipped his hand on which city it would be in a Thursday interview with The Seattle Times. In discussing the carrier’s plans for 2017, Kjos told the Times of Norwegian’s intent to use its new 737s to fly “thin” trans-Atlantic routes with moderate demand from new bases in Newburgh and Providence. Now, with Norwegian confirming to Today in the Sky that Providence is the choice for the second 737 base, it remains to be seen whether Norwegian will still consider bringing Europe routes to either of the other airports. While Lindström confirmed Providence would get a 737 base, he did not rule out the possibility that Norwegian could also add additional trans-Atlantic service from either Hartford or Portsmouth. USA TODAY $69 fares to Europe: Coming soon to two small Northeast airports? Whenever the flights do come to Newburgh and Providence, Norwegian has promised fares as low as $69 one way on multiple routes across the Atlantic. Newburgh and the second 737 base city are expected to land routes to destinations in Ireland, England, Scotland and – possibly – Scandinavia. Newburgh’s airport, now run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that also runs New York City’s three primary airports (LaGuardia, JFK and Newark), has long been touted as a potential reliever facility for the New York City metro area. Despite that, its flight schedule has remained relatively modest during the past decade. The airport currently has just five regularly scheduled routes on four airlines: American (flights to Philadelphia), Delta (to Detroit), JetBlue (to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando) and Allegiant (to St. Petersburg, Fla.). USA TODAY It's official: Hartford is back on the trans-Atlantic route map Providence's T.F. Green Airport has a more robust schedule, though it’s still considerably less than what’s offered 60 miles to the north at New England’s busiest air hub: Boston’s Logan International Airport. Providence has secured some on-again, off-again routes to Europe in recent years, but landing a Norwegian pilot base – and the new routes it would bring – would be a significant boost for an airport in a region where the vast majority of the international routes operate from Boston. Hartford’s Bradley International Airport, which sits about 110 miles from central Boston and about 125 from Midtown Manhattan. It has a healthy flight schedule for the size of the region it serves, but international flights have been harder to come by. Hartford scored a victory in landing flights to Dublin on Irish carrier Aer Lingus, but that service – which began just this past September – is the first trans-Atlantic route there in eight years.

With that, Providence appears to have emerged as the winner in a race among New England airports for the base. Norwegian already flies from numerous U.S. destinations. Last year, however, the airline announced plans to start flying from two smaller Northeast airports sometime in 2017, part of an effort open two U.S. bases to house pilots for its new Boeing 737 MAX jets. Those jets are scheduled to begin arriving to the carrier by mid-2017. The new bases are expected to bring multiple European routes to each of those airports. One of those airports – Stewart International in Newburgh, N.Y., about 70 miles from Midtown Manhattan – had already been confirmed by Norwegian. A second Norwegian 737 base was to be selected closer to Boston, with Providence, Hartford, Conn., and Portsmouth, N.H., under consideration by the carrier.

Norwegian CEO Bjørn Kjos may have first tipped his hand on which city it would be in a Thursday interview with The Seattle Times. In discussing the carrier’s plans for 2017, Kjos told the Times of Norwegian’s intent to use its new 737s to fly “thin” trans-Atlantic routes with moderate demand from new bases in Newburgh and Providence. Now, with Norwegian confirming to Today in the Sky that Providence is the choice for the second 737 base, it remains to be seen whether Norwegian will still consider bringing Europe routes to either of the other airports. While Lindström confirmed Providence would get a 737 base, he did not rule out the possibility that Norwegian could also add additional trans-Atlantic service from either Hartford or Portsmouth. USA TODAY $69 fares to Europe: Coming soon to two small Northeast airports? Whenever the flights do come to Newburgh and Providence, Norwegian has promised fares as low as $69 one way on multiple routes across the Atlantic. Newburgh and the second 737 base city are expected to land routes to destinations in Ireland, England, Scotland and – possibly – Scandinavia. Newburgh’s airport, now run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that also runs New York City’s three primary airports (LaGuardia, JFK and Newark), has long been touted as a potential reliever facility for the New York City metro area. Despite that, its flight schedule has remained relatively modest during the past decade. The airport currently has just five regularly scheduled routes on four airlines: American (flights to Philadelphia), Delta (to Detroit), JetBlue (to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando) and Allegiant (to St. Petersburg, Fla.). USA TODAY It's official: Hartford is back on the trans-Atlantic route map Providence's T.F. Green Airport has a more robust schedule, though it’s still considerably less than what’s offered 60 miles to the north at New England’s busiest air hub: Boston’s Logan International Airport. Providence has secured some on-again, off-again routes to Europe in recent years, but landing a Norwegian pilot base – and the new routes it would bring – would be a significant boost for an airport in a region where the vast majority of the international routes operate from Boston. Hartford’s Bradley International Airport, which sits about 110 miles from central Boston and about 125 from Midtown Manhattan. It has a healthy flight schedule for the size of the region it serves, but international flights have been harder to come by. Hartford scored a victory in landing flights to Dublin on Irish carrier Aer Lingus, but that service – which began just this past September – is the first trans-Atlantic route there in eight years.

(Symbol: BA), Global Payments Inc (Symbol: GPN), and Alliance Holdings Group LP (Symbol: AHGP) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Boeing Co. will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.42 on 3/3/17, Global Payments Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.01 on 2/24/17, and Alliance Holdings Group LP will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.55 on 2/17/17. As a percentage of BA’s recent stock price of $163.26, this dividend works out to approximately 0.87%, so look for shares of Boeing Co. to trade 0.87% lower – all else being equal – when BA shares open for trading on 2/8/17. Similarly, investors should look for GPN to open 0.01% lower in price and for AHGP to open 1.79% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for BA, GPN, and AHGP, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. Boeing Co. (Symbol: BA) : Global Payments Inc (Symbol: GPN) : Alliance Holdings Group LP (Symbol: AHGP) : In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 3.48% for Boeing Co. , 0.05% for Global Payments Inc, and 7.17% for Alliance Holdings Group LP. In Monday trading, Boeing Co. shares are currently up about 0.5%, Global Payments Inc shares are off about 0.5%, and Alliance Holdings Group LP shares are up about 0.8% on the day.

Webster-based NanoRacks has teamed up with Boeing to build and install the first commercial airlock module on the International Space Station. NanoRacks, Boeing to develop space station airlock 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Webster-based NanoRacks announced Monday that it will partner with Boeing to build and install the first commercial airlock on the International Space Station. "This partnership is an important step in the commercial transition we'll see on the ISS in coming years," Mark Mulqueen, Boeing International Space Station program manager, said in a news release. "Utilizing a commercial airlock to keep up with the demand of deployment will significantly streamline our process." RELATED: Webster company's NanoRacks project could be a giant leap In May 2016, NanoRacks and NASA signed a Space Act Agreement in order to install a private airlock module onboard the International Space Station.  Boeing will fabricate and install the airlock's passive common berthing mechanism, which is used to connect most pressurized modules of the space station and is the most critical piece of hardware for the airlock. Boeing will also provide engineering services required for developing and manufacturing the airlock. The in-house team at NanoRacks will oversee the project management, mechanical and avionics design engineering, safety, operations, quality assurance, mockups and crew training, and the final assembly, integration and testing of the airlock. The estimated launch is in 2019.  Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.

When Boeing installed the world's largest autoclave at their new 777X Composite Wing Center they looked to Air Products to supply their nitrogen. Anthony SalamoneContact ReporterOf The Morning Call Air Products says it is spreading its wings with Boeing TREXLERTOWN — Air Products said Monday it is supplying nitrogen for one of Boeing's largest aircraft endeavors. The Trexlertown industrial gases company recently installed its advanced nitrogen system at Boeing's 777X Composite Wing Center in Everett, Wash. The nitrogen system will supply the world's biggest autoclave. An autoclave is a heated container used for chemical reactions and other processes that incorporate high pressures and temperatures. Air Products' work will create an inert atmosphere and rapid pressure required to form and cure the jet wings. At 235 feet, the wingspan will be the largest composite span in Boeing's commercial fleet, a company spokeswoman said. Paul Householder, a vice president of Air Products' Americas division, said in a news release the company is thrilled to be playing a part in building the world's largest composite wings. The project represents the third major autoclave project Air Products has completed with Boeing in the last three years, he said. In Trexlertown, Air Products spokeswoman Debbie Bauer said that while the Boeing contract will not create new jobs locally, it will contribute to sales. Bauer also said Air Products' headquarters has provided support in engineering, procurement, project administration and other aspects of the Boeing project.

(Air Products/CONTRIBUTED PHOTO) Air Products is supplying nitrogen from its plant in Puyallup, Wash., about 60 miles south of Everett. The company has 28 employees in the state, Bauer said. Bauer declined to disclose financial or other terms of the contract, citing competitive reasons. It has been supplying gases to the aerospace industry for more than 50 years. Boeing spokeswoman Karen Crabtree also said the company does not routinely disclose financial terms with contractors. Boeing calls the 777X, a new series of its aircraft family, the largest, most efficient twin-engine jet in the world. The two planes in the 777X family, 777-8 and 777-9 will seat anywhere from 350 to 425 passengers, Boeing said. The plane is scheduled for 2020 delivery.

And it's for cargo, not crew (sorry). Eric Berger - Feb 6, 2017 6:50 pm UTC reader comments 68 Share this story The Nanoracks airlock is shown conceptually, attached to the Tranquility node. Nanoracks Another view of the Tranquility node and its cupola (and future airlock). A wider view. Nanoracks This is a 3D printed version of the airlock. Nanoracks Another view. Nanoracks Oh no, it's Spock! In this case, the figurine gives an accurate impression of the size. Nanoracks NASA has given a small, Houston-based company the green light to move ahead with development of a private airlock that will be attached to the International Space Station. The large, half-cylinder-shaped airlock, about two meters in diameter and 1.8 meters long, would become the first permanent commercial addition to the orbiting laboratory. Ars first reported development of the commercial airlock a year ago, but now the company, Nanoracks, has made substantial progress toward flying the device in 2019. In addition to approval from NASA, the company has reached an agreement with Boeing to manufacture and install a “berthing mechanism” that connects pressurized modules of the space station. Further ReadingTo boost commercial activity, NASA may add private airlock to ISS Boeing’s investment in the $15 million project is significant, as the aerospace giant already holds the primary contract to operate and maintain the station for NASA. As part of the agreement, Boeing will not only assist with integrating the airlock into the station, it will also help develop a customer base to use the airlock. “We’re delighted to have put together an All-American team for this project,” Jeff Manber, chief executive of Nanoracks, told Ars. “For us, it’s a meaningful expression of support.” Open for business The symbolism of a commercial doorway on the space station is important for NASA. The agency has made no secret of its desire for commercial companies to step up and use the space station as a test bed for everything from basic research to testing new modes of space exploration. NASA has said it intends to move on from low-Earth orbit into deep space within the next decade. The new airlock will expand the capacity of private companies to experiment outside the station. At present, there is only one equipment airlock on board the station, inside Japan’s Kibo module. The Japanese airlock is fairly small, large enough to only accommodate items about the size of a miniature refrigerator. Although it opens 10 times a year, five of those openings are allocated to the Japanese space agency, JAXA, with the other five going to NASA and its commercial partners. Further ReadingNASA official warns private sector: We’re moving on from low-Earth orbit Nanoracks’ airlock would be about five times larger in terms of capacity. It will likely be located on a port in the space station’s Tranquility module. The airlock would connect the berthing mechanism and then be pressurized. After pressurization, the hatch could be opened and the airlock configured for various tasks. For commercial opportunities, Nanoracks has a small satellite launcher, and it is also designing a “haybale” system to launch as many as 192 cubesats at a time. After the airlock is configured for a particular deploy, it would be depressurized and sealed. Then a station robotic arm could grab it, move it away from the vehicle, and deploy its payloads. NASA support Adding an airlock to the Tranquility module, which already has Bigelow’s expandable module attached to it, would give NASA a bonafide commercial presence on the station. While astronauts test the human-rated Bigelow habitation module, they’ll also be working with a commercial airlock that could one day be transferred to a private station. Meanwhile, private spacecraft developed by SpaceX, Orbital ATK, Boeing, and eventually Sierra Nevada will deliver supplies and crew. (The airlock would be carried to the station aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft.) Further ReadingAfter six months in orbit, that space inflatable habitat is holding up well With this activity, NASA will have supported a nice mix of large, traditional aerospace companies as well as new space upstarts like SpaceX and Nanoracks. While it remains far from clear that private companies such as Axiom Space or others will succeed in developing private space station independent of NASA, the space agency deserves credit for fostering an environment where commercial companies can find out what succeeds—and what does not—in low Earth orbit.

File/Staff top story Grapevine: Much ado about dues at Boeing's North Charleston operations Feb 6, 2017 (…) +2  Stacks of diapers and children's clothing are part of a display at Boeing Co.'s 787 Dreamliner plant in North Charleston to illustrate to workers the annual cost of joining the International Association of Machinists union. File/Provided Much ado about dues at Boeing South Carolina  A display designed to illustrate how much money Boeing Co. employees might have to pay in annual union dues has drawn protests from the International Association of Machinists. The display, set up in a break room at Boeing's 787 Dreamliner plant in North Charleston, includes stacks of diapers and various children's outfits under a banner stating: "The goods on display would cost your family $800." That is the amount the IAM says Boeing workers would pay in annual dues if they vote next month to join the union. Mike Evans, the IAM's lead local organizer, said he has heard from several Boeing workers who were "insulted" by the display. "Boeing's over-the-top tactics are falling flat with their employees," Evans said. "Stunts like this show that it's more important than ever that Boeing South Carolina workers get union representation." Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Merida said the company is "committed to ensuring our teammates understand the facts in this campaign, including what the IAM will cost them every year ..." Merida said the $800 in estimated annual dues is "real money that matters to our teammates and their families," and the displayed items will be donated to the Lowcountry Orphan Relief Fund regardless of the outcome of the vote next week. The IAM's Facebook page includes a photo of the display with a post asking: "This is the high road?" It's a reference to Boeing executive Joan Robinson-Berry's promise that the aerospace giant will take the high road during the IAM's organizing campaign. (See page E3 for her views about the union vote.) Merida said that is exactly what the company is doing. "Facts and data and charitable giving hardly seem like the low road," she said. "We’re used to the IAM trying to deflect from reality with name calling when they don’t like the facts." About 3,000 production workers at Boeing's North Charleston businesses will decide Feb. 15 whether they want to be represented by organized labor. Both sides now are waging campaigns through their websites, social media and advertisements in an attempt to sway workers' views. Voting will take place at several conference rooms throughout Boeing's facilities, with all shifts given a chance to participate. The side that receives at least one more vote than the opposition will win the election. The IAM is the nation's largest aerospace union, representing about 600,000 workers at companies like Lockheed Martin, General Electric and United Technologies. The union represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 U.S. locations. Museum move +3  Buy Now The staff of the International African American Museum, which is led by Michael Moore (above), is changing offices. File/Dave Munday/Staff Organizers of the planned International African American Museum seem to have a knack for finding historically significant sites. The museum itself will be built near the Maritime Center on Concord Street, on a spot where slaves were brought into America. Meanwhile, the staff is setting up new offices directly across Calhoun Street from Emanuel AME Church, where nine black worshipers were shot to death in June 2015. The museum site was picked deliberately. The new office location near Mother Emanuel, though poignant, came about simply because the city offered a great deal. The museum's board, which includes Mayor John Tecklenburg, is renting the city-owned house at 113 Calhoun for $100 a year, plus utilities. Staffers had been based in a small office at 25 Calhoun St., near the S.C. Aquarium. They started moving to their temporary digs about a month ago. The Sustainability Institute renovated the property with grant money in 2000 and had used it to demonstrate energy-efficient building techniques. Michael Moore, museum president, expects to raise $19 million and break ground by the end of the year. The opening is scheduled for late 2019. By then, staffers will move to their permanent offices on the top floor of the museum, according to architect Harry Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners of New York City. He expects the city’s Board of Architectural Review to review plans for final approval early next month. Symphony stream Think Spotify, but for the symphony. That’s an idea being floated this year by the Charleston Symphony Orchestra. The group is launching a $5-a-month service where music fans can stream 50 or so past concerts. Jennifer Metts, its marketing director, says the audio membership plan is unique for a mid-sized symphony, though larger organizations have started similar programs. Last year, the symphony experimented with a live video stream of a concert, and Metts said it intends to stream another performance this year. Making its audio archives available online is similarly meant to make its music more accessible – and it was a less costly endeavor, Metts says. The audio streaming initiative is connected to another push to drum up interest in the symphony. The new CSOGo program charges members $35 a month, giving them the option to walk into any concert – and get access to the archive. +2  Buy Now The cable-stringing tower at the Nexans site in Berkeley County is said to be the tallest manmade structure in South Carolina.

NASA wants to launch the new airlock on a commercial resupply mission in 2019, and plans to put it on a port of the ISS’s Tranquility module. Airlocks allow astronauts to leave the space station without depressurizing it, and can also allow spacecraft to dock. “We want to utilize the space station to expose the commercial sector to new and novel uses of space, ultimately creating a new economy in low-Earth orbit for scientific research, technology development and human and cargo transportation,” Sam Scimemi, the director of NASA’s ISS division, said in a press statement. “We hope this new airlock will allow a diverse community to experiment and develop opportunities in space for the commercial sector.” U.S. plans to return to Earth’s orbit are entirely dependent on private companies, some of which are scheduled to launch by the end of this year. Astronauts began installing adapters that allowed commercial spacecraft to dock with the ISS last August to give NASA less expensive options to resupply the station. NASA wants private companies like Boeing, Blue Origin and SpaceX to be the space agency’s “taxi service” to carry crews to the International Space Station (ISS). Once this service is established, the agency will refocus on long range deep space exploration. The U.S. space agency’s Commercial Crew Program is intended to pay these companies to ferry astronauts up to the ISS, ultimately ending the U.S.’s  sole reliance on Russia for transporting American astronauts to and from the station. NASA will remain dependent on  Russian rockets to ship astronauts to the ISS until the agency’s long list of stringent safety and reliability requirements for humans on private missions is met. Boeing and SpaceX are both competing to be the first private company to send humans to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX has a human test flight planned for October 2017, while Boeing has a flight scheduled for May 2018. The last U.S. Space Shuttle to the ISS launched in 2011, but NASA still can’t put men into space without Russian cooperation due to President Barack Obama’s cuts to the agency’s exploration and spaceflight capability. SpaceX has already successfully resupplied the ISS seven times, but one SpaceX resupply mission in June of 2015 resulted in an explosion and a total loss of the spacecraft. The private company Orbital Sciences is also under contract with the space agency to resupply the ISS, but has also had failures. SpaceX and Russian company NPO Energomash are locked in a struggle to supply rocket engines to the U.S. military. Currently, the U.S. pays Russia more than $70 million per astronaut sent to the ISS. Russia has repeatedly threatened to block America access to the $150 billion ISS in response to U.S. sanctions even though the U.S. paid for 84 percent of the cost of building the station.

(Boeing) Tweet Take its 787 Dreamliner. It’s a flying symbol of an interconnected world economy, one with a network of global suppliers that would be hard to unravel with government policies, and a global group of customers waiting to buy the plans. The Dreamliner is like the United Nations of planes: Its wings and batteries come from Japan. Its wing tips come from South Korea. India is the source of its floor beams. The front fuselage is made in the USA and Japan. The center fuselage and horizontal stabilizers are from Italy. Landing gear and doors? France. Cargo access doors are built in Sweden. The wing/body fairings, which cover gaps on the body, are from Canada. The movable trailing edge of the wings are from Canada, except when they’re from the US or Australia. Thrust reversers come from Mexico. Its engines come from either General Electric in the US or Rolls-Royce in the UK. play What's made where. (Skye Gould/BI Graphics) After all that, the components travel around the world before arriving at one of Boeing's factories in Washington or South Carolina, where they’re assembled into finished planes. Then, they’re delivered to more than 60 airlines worldwide. The Trump administration’s foreign policy and stances on trade and defense could have significant effects on how multinational companies do business. While a company such as Boeing supports a massive manufacturing presence in the US, it has cultivated a broad network of international partners that have invested decades and billions of dollars into relationships with Boeing. These partners have deep ties to their local governments and business communities, but the new administration’s hardline stance on globalization threatens those bonds. And for Boeing, it could give its main rival, Airbus, a serious leg up. NAFTA and the war on trade As the Trump White House dials up the tough talk on trade, there are few companies as potentially affected by policies and changes as Boeing. This is especially true for the nondefense half of its business, Boeing Commercial Airplanes, which makes the Dreamliner. First, take the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), that pact between the US, Canada, and Mexico that for more than two decades has created a free market in the region. While controversial leading up to its inception, the furor over NAFTA died down in recent years — until being reignited by Trump, who has vowed to renegotiate or even scrap the agreement. play A Boeing Dreamliner flies over Washington, DC. (Boeing) Now with NAFTA's future in doubt, and Trump's plan to build a multibillion-dollar wall on the Mexican border — paid for with a 20% tax on Mexican imports — Boeing could suffer. First, there are those thrust reversers built in Mexico; they would instantly become a lot more expensive. There are customers at stake. Mexico's flag carrier, AeroMexico, flies an all-Boeing fleet, while its two local rivals, Interjet and Volaris, are loyal customers of Airbus, the European giant. If Mexico retaliates against US tariffs by instituting its own border tax for goods coming into the country, Boeing planes could become a lot more expensive and lead AeroMexico to choose Airbus over Boeing. "A 20% tax on the planes is huge and basically makes any Boeing product uneconomical for Mexican customers." Vinay Bhaskara, a senior business analyst at Airways, told Business Insider. "Boeing either becomes unprofitable in that market or they simply can’t sell outside of the US." For every Boeing plane, Airbus has an equivalent competitor. If you’re thinking about buying a Boeing 737, you’re also looking at the Airbus A320, for instance. They’re generally priced similarly too. "If Trump's policies damage Boeing, Airbus would be the big beneficiary," Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at aviation-consulting firm Teal Group, told Business Insider. China and the Middle East Boeing believes China could buy as much as $1 trillion worth of commercial airplanes over the next 20 years. There’s a lot of demand there for widebody jets like the 787 Dreamliner. play A China Southern Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. (Flickr/byeangel) But Trump’s policies and rhetoric toward China could put that at risk. Trump has accused China of playing games with its currency, to the detriment of US business. He’s openly challenged the One China Policy that's maintained the fragile peace between China and Taiwan. He’s criticized China for its artificial islands in the South China Sea. None of this pleases the people who hold the trillion-dollar market’s purse strings — the Chinese government and its massive state-owned airlines. "China is easily the biggest area of concern for Boeing," Aboulafia said. "China is very big, and they account for 20% to 25% of Boeing’s output right now." Two other countries planning to buy a lot of Boeing airplanes are Iran and Iraq. The Iraqi government has 18 Boeing 737-800s on order as well as 10 787-8 Dreamliners. In total, it’s worth about $3.7 billion. play The Boeing 787 production line in Washington state. (Boeing) Boeing is also trying to complete a deal with Iranian leaders for an 80-plane order. That could be worth $16 billion, though likely less at negotiated prices. But now Trump is president. His executive order, which temporarily bans immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries, includes Iran and Iraq, which responded with similar measures. The Trump administration put Iran "on notice" after the country tested a ballistic missile, and relations between the nations, tenuous but improving since the nuclear deal, appear to be worsening. As with with China, these deals are at risk if the Persian Gulf governments feel aggrieved by the new administration’s policies. Made in America Trump rode into office on a populist platform promising to reinvigorate American manufacturing. As a candidate and as president, he’s used his own bully pulpit, and Twitter account, to shame companies like Carrier that plan to move jobs to other countries. But for Boeing, with that international supply chain, switching many of its internationally sourced components for aircraft such as the 787 to a new US supplier is "basically impossible," said Aboulafia. That's because, unlike traditional supplier networks, many of Boeing's suppliers are full partners that have invested their own money in the development of the 787’s parts with the idea that they would make money off their investment throughout the life of the program. I think he thinks this is kind of like importing cement for casinos, where you can just switch your source for the cement. "I think he thinks this is kind of like importing cement for casinos, where you can just switch your source for the cement," Aboulafia said. "Trump may have the idea that they can shift sources, but the airplane industry doesn’t work that way." "Contracts tend to run the life of the program rather than we feel like buying from X one year and Y the next year," he added. Take the Dreamliner’s Japanese-built wings as an example. If Boeing were willing and able to disentangle itself from that complex international supplier relationship, Aboulafia said it would require reimbursing the Japanese and other companies that invested in the development and production of wings. Instead of being paid over the lifetime of the 787 program — about 30 years — Boeing would have to fully pay back the supplier to the tune of billions of dollars. Then Boeing would have to find an American company willing to invest in creating alternatives as there are no US companies producing equivalent parts. Tweet Force One play The current Boeing VC-25A that serves as Air Force One. (AP) A few weeks after Election Day, Trump sent a tweet that had a single target: Boeing. "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Trump wrote. Boeing, blindsided by the tweet, was forced to quickly issue a statement noting that it’s only "under contract" for $170 million to determine the capabilities of the new plane. But the fact that companies can unexpectedly come into the president’s crosshairs, often with no warning, is the new reality for those doing business in the US. And these tweets and statements can influence a company’s perception among the public — and apply pressure to change how they run their businesses. Thanks, Trump? play Trump in 1985 with an artist's concept of "Television City," a project that would have been built on the West Side of Manhattan, New York. It never happened. (Marty Lederhandler/AP) That’s not to say that the new administration is all bad news for Boeing and other multinationals. "Most of the good Trump can do for Boeing comes from what's generically good for corporate America," Bhaskara said. The Trump administration plans cuts to corporate tax rates, and there’s talk of making it easier to repatriate the money that companies like Boeing earn abroad. And the president could come to Boeing’s aid in its battle with Airbus, which has long enjoyed subsidies from European governments. Boeing contends that’s an unfair advantage, and the matter is being litigated at the World Trade Organization. "If there are specific things Trump can achieve in terms of reducing European subsidies to Airbus, then I would think that helps Boeing compete a little bit," Simon Lester, a Cato Institute trade-policy analyst, told Business Insider. It is customary for presidents to help push for sales of major US industrial products while on foreign visits. In fact, President Barack Obama once remarked that he deserved to a gold watch from the company because he's constantly selling Boeing products. If he so chooses, Trump, the consummate salesman, could be Boeing’s best marketing tool.

The International Space Station is getting its first commercial airlock, planned for 2019 Posted Feb 6, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Rock Band VR arrives on Oculus Rift March 23, pre-orders now open The International Space Station will get a first commercially funded airlock, created by supplier NanoRacks in partnership with Boeing, with a planned launch and integration timeframe of 2019. The commercial airlock is designed to support deployment of small payloads, including so-called CubeSats (which are small, cost-effective satellites) from the ISS, a practice which has become increasingly popular among commercial space companies. NASA has always articulated a strong desire to open up the ISS to more low-Earth commerce, with hopes of increasingly privatizing the sustained operation to open up alternate funding sources for ongoing space-based research and scientific pursuits. The airlock will help support that, both via station-based satellite launches, and by allowing commercial payloads to be delivered to the ISS via commercial space transport operators including Boeing and SpaceX. This stage of development involves NASA accepting the proposal NanoRacks has created, using an independent partnership with Boeing to begin development of its airlock. The airlock production will have to go through a series of phases as outlined by an agreement signed by NASA and NanoRacks as a preliminary step ahead of development late last year, and then if all goes according to plan the intent is to launch the airlock on an ISS resupply mission currently slated for 2019. Boeing will fabricate the pressurization connection hardware for the airlock, and the whole array is designed to be modular and reusable, in case the ISS is replaced with another commercial orbiting platform in the future and NanoRacks would like to attach its module to that station instead. Low-Earth orbit could become an increasingly lucrative place to operate for private companies, and funding and owning a key piece of the puzzle for missions in that part of space like an airlock is a good way to grab some early real estate in this emerging market. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase The Boeing Company Founded 1916 Overview The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures and sells fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, rockets and satellites and provides leasing and product support services.

The C919 narrow-body jet is expected to ‘realise its blue-sky flight dream’ in the first six months of 2017, the People's Daily newspaper reported, with the installation of onboard systems almost completed. The plane, produced by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), was originally scheduled to make its debut journey in 2015, but the date was repeatedly pushed back as it underwent additional testing and certification. For China, the aircraft represents at least eight years of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce the country's reliance on European plane maker Airbus and Boeing of the United States and compete directly against them for market share. The first C919 rolled off the assembly line in November 2015 after workers spent more than a year putting together the single-aisle aircraft, which can seat 168 passengers. It is hoped the plane will take market share in the lucrative segment from the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. In November COMAC said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers. China is one of the Western manufacturers' key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The country's airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. Boeing's expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing $1 trillion. To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms, even as Beijing hopes to oust them with homegrown aircraft. Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers. Boeing last year announced plans to open a facility with COMAC to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said. COMAC has also developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ21, which took to the skies in its first commercial flight last June. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

In a bid to challenge foreign giants Airbus and Boeing - owned by France and America respectively - China is expected to finally 'realise its blue-sky flight dream' with its single-aisle C919 jet. The People's Daily newspaper has revealed that the 168 seater aircraft was moved to a test flight centre on December 25, 2016 with the installation of onboard systems almost complete. China's first-ever passenger jet built on home soil is set to take flight this month, it has been announced There have reportedly been 570 orders for the jet with Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines tipped as one of the first to receive the new model.  COMAC is yet to release the price tag of the jet, but a previous report by China National Radio in June predicted that C919 was likely to be priced at £32 million (US$50 million), which was up to 30 per cent cheaper than a Boeing 737 or an Airbus 320.

Video footage showed the cockpit was fully equipped and, according to the reporter, its piloting system was more similar to Airbus planes. The cabin remained largely empty and was padded with a layer of cotton insulation. Four large boxes have been installed in the cabin for collecting data during test flights. The first C919 passenger jet is rolled out at the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd Many people are seen celebrating at the revealing of the C919 passenger jet plane in Shanghai today An industry source said the plane's maiden flight is scheduled for February but no exact date has been confirmed. Following its initial outing, test flights will be conducted for about three years before being put into commercial use. The C919 has a standard flight range of 2,532 miles (4,075 kilometres), which means the aircraft can fly non-stop from Shanghai to Kuala Lumpur or from New York City to Los Angeles.  The plane, produced by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), was originally scheduled to make its debut journey in 2015, but the date was repeatedly pushed back as it underwent additional testing and certification. For China, the aircraft represents at least eight years of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce the country's reliance on European plane maker Airbus and Boeing of the United States and compete directly against them for market share. A CCTV presenter showed the interior of C919 during the unveiling ceremony(left). The pilots gear stick inside the cockpit of first C919 cockpit (right) The first C919 rolled off the assembly line in November 2015 after workers spent more than a year putting together the narrow-body aircraft. It is hoped the plane will take market share in the lucrative segment from the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320.  In November COMAC said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers. China is one of the Western manufacturers' key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The country's airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. Retired Chinese hurdler Liu Xiang takes a selfie in front of China's first self-developed large passenger jetliner A worker directs the people taking the plane out of the hub ready for its unveiling in front of thousands Boeing's expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing $1 trillion. To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms, even as Beijing hopes to oust them with homegrown aircraft. Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market.  It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers. Boeing last year announced plans to open a facility with COMAC to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said. COMAC has also developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ21, which took to the skies in its first commercial flight last June.  Read more: C919 expected to experience maiden flight in early 2017 - People's Daily Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 26 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

Boeing's agreement to sell 80 passenger jets to Iran may not be directly impacted by new U.S. sanctions on Tehran but the deal still could unravel, according to analysts. President Donald Trump's administration on Friday imposed new sanctions on Iran after a ballistic missile test by the Islamic republic. The U.S. claims the missile test was a violation of a United Nations resolution. "The Trump administration is absolutely determined to ratchet up tensions and the Iranians will of course, being hardliners there, want to do the same," said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based industry consultancy Teal Group. In December, Boeing announced an agreement for Iran Air, the country's flag carrier, to buy 50 of its narrow-body 737 passenger jets and 30 of the wide-body 777 aircraft. The aircraft manufacturer valued at the deal at $16.6 billon, based on list prices for the planes. Industry observers suggest Tehran could pull out of the Boeing deal if tensions continue to worsen. Besides the new sanctions, Trump's travel ban against Iran and six other majority-Muslim countries also drew criticism from Tehran and vows of retaliation. Besides the airplane sale, the Boeing deal involves aircraft maintenance services as well as ongoing support with spare parts on the jets. "It's a risk, but not something that will overwhelm [Boeing]," said Moody's analyst Russell Solomon, who covers the aerospace and defense industry. "They do have a tremendous amount of operating and financial flexibility because of strength of the balance sheet, a strong liquidity profile and a very significant order book." At the end of 2016, Boeing's backlog stood at $473 billion with more than 5,700 commercial airplane orders. Boeing led Airbus in commercial airplane deliveries last year, 748 aircraft compared with 688 for Airbus. On Friday, a Boeing spokesman said the Chicago-based company was still operating under the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control license, which provided federal authorization for the plane sale during the Obama administration. "Should we receive new guidance from the Treasury Department, we will act accordingly," the Boeing official added. According to the Moody's analyst, the economics of the Iran deal were "far less compelling than they are for Boeing on average when it conducts business with airline carriers." He explained that some of the orders were for older plane models while the current generation planes are considered potentially more lucrative and desirable. Moreover, Boeing "can afford to give a bigger discount [on the current generation planes] to keep the production line humming along," he added. The new set of sanctions imposed Friday by the Trump administration targets individuals and entities that provide support to Iran's ballistic missile program and to the country's Revolution Guard Corp's Quds Force. Iran claims the missiles were not intended to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads and for defensive purposes so they were not in violation of any U.N. resolution. Iran's leadership dug in its heels Saturday, conducting new military exercises to test missile and radar systems "to deal with hypothetical enemy's aerial attacks" on sensitive sites, Iran's Tasnim news agency reported. The same outlet also reported Monday that Iran unveiled a new guided rocket and assault weapons to show off what it called Iran's "self-sufficiency in arms production." The first airplanes under the Boeing deal are scheduled for delivery in 2018. Last month, France's Airbus delivered its first passenger jet to Iran Air under a separate commercial aircraft contract that includes wide-body A380s, the world's largest passenger jet. Iran's aging fleet of passenger jets is among the oldest in the world due to commercial and financial sanctions that were in place for decades. The average age of Iran Air's planes now exceeds 20 years and Tehran and been looking to Airbus, Boeing and other airplane manufacturers to modernize its fleet. Iran's Fars news agency reported Saturday that another Western airplane manufacturer, French-Italian aircraft company ATR, was preparing to sell turboprop short-haul airplanes to Iran. Talks were scheduled Sunday. Analysts say financing airplanes to Iran remains risky business too. That is partly due to Iran not being a signatory country to the Cape Town Treaty, which provides legal remedies for default in financing agreements as well as the repossession of capital goods such as aircraft. "Boeing will probably have to backstop a lot of that [financing] on its own," said Solomon. That said, he believes Boeing may only go so far without having third-party financiers. Indeed, Airbus is believed to have provided backstop financing for as many as six passenger jets to Iran but is relying on third-party financiers for the rest.

Under the agreement, Boeing and the Air Force will support military and civilian uses for the GPS block IIA and IIF satellites for the next five years. Boeing has also been contracted to develop next-generation GPS platforms. "This agreement continues Boeing's strong legacy of GPS innovation and mission support," Boeing's Dan Hart said in a press release. "We are focused on delivering reliable, affordable and resilient GPS capability now and for generations to come." The GPS Block IIF includes 12 satellites supporting civilian and military navigation capabilities. The spacecraft are designed to improve upon their predecessors by providing increased jamming resistance and new broadcasting signals. In a statement announcing the new agreement with the Air Force, Boeing noted the company's GPS satellites have a combined 550 years of on-orbit operation. The aerospace contractor delivered its 50th satellite to the Air Force in May 2016.

That's an option now at Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI), where the only gym at a U.S. airport past security opened this week with plans to open 20 more at airports by 2020. It's the latest example of how fitness and health trends have started showing up at airports. Yoga rooms and walking tracks have opened at airports around North America over the past few years, and healthier food options are also easier to find in airports now. You can even get a kombucha to wash down a salad made with locally sourced produce. The ROAM Fitness gym at BWI includes an attendant who monitors guests' flights and will alert them if there's a delay. There's even free luggage storage, options for renting workout clothes and shoes, and showers. Fees range from $40 a day to $175 a month. The concept was initially envisioned for international travelers and others with long layovers, but research revealed that many other travelers wanted to squeeze in a workout before or after landing. "A lot of people coming from the West Coast taking red-eye flights are going straight to their business meeting but they land at 6:30 in the morning. They can't check into their hotel yet ... so it just gives them the opportunity to clean up before they head to that meeting," said ROAM Fitness CEO Cynthia Sandall. Roughly 4,000 travelers a month use GoodLife Fitness' gym at Toronto airport, a 33% increase from when it opened in 2014, the company said.

The airport at Las Vegas had a gym that closed. Christopher Berger, who chairs the American College of Sports Medicine task force on healthy air travel, says the gyms' success may depend on the destination. He thinks they may be best suited for hubs with long layovers. "You take someplace like (Chicago) O'Hare, Minneapolis, Portland, Seattle ... I think you've got a real chance of selling it," he said. San Francisco airport's yoga room has been so successful that a second one opened in 2014. Airport officials say it's used daily. After a few downward dogs, yogis can also order a green juice or curry bowl at The Plant Cafe where everything is made with local and organic ingredients. There's also Napa Farms Market, Joe & the Juice and new vending machines offering organic, gluten-free and sugar-free snacks. Other amenities in the pipeline as major airports look to become destinations in their own right include movie theaters, more fine dining and better shopping, says Lorraine Sileo, a senior vice president with the travel market research firm Phocuswright. But fitness and wellness offerings may be especially appealing to travelers getting on or off cramped planes.

Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport has a 1.4 mile walking path. Philadelphia's airport had a temporary program where passengers could cycle on stationary bikes while waiting for their flights. Baltimore Washington International also offers bike rentals and a 12.5-mile trail just outside the airport. While airports still sell plenty of greasy fast food, many airport eateries also now feature local, organic ingredients and vegan and gluten-free options. Icebox Cafe at Miami International Airport, which uses locally sourced food, reported above-average sales of $3.1 million last fiscal year. Other examples of vendors bringing healthier fare to airports include Nature's Table in Atlanta and Orlando, Elephants Delicatessen at Portland International Airport in Oregon, and French Meadow Bakery, in four airports including Minneapolis and Salt Lake City. Ann Gentry, founder of the popular vegan eatery Real Food Daily, has an airport location in addition to two others in the Los Angeles area. "I knew it was going to be a hit because in our (two other restaurants) people were coming in getting bags of food for the plane, so we were very accustomed to packing up food for the plane," she said. But not everyone who patronizes Real Food Daily at the airport location realizes it's vegan. Some order a spicy lentil burger and bring it back complaining they didn't know it wouldn't have meat. On the flip side, some travelers say they enjoyed her airport grub so much they sought out the restaurant while in town.

The C919 narrow-body jet is expected to “realise its blue-sky flight dream” in the first six months of 2017, the People’s Daily newspaper reported, with the installation of onboard systems almost completed. The plane, produced by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), was originally scheduled to make its debut journey in 2015, but the date was repeatedly pushed back as it underwent additional testing and certification. For China, the aircraft represents at least eight years of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce the country’s reliance on European plane maker Airbus and Boeing of the United States and compete directly against them for market share. The first C919 rolled off the assembly line in November 2015 after workers spent more than a year putting together the single-aisle aircraft, which can seat 168 passengers. It is hoped the plane will take market share in the lucrative segment from the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. In November COMAC said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers. China is one of the Western manufacturers’ key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The country’s airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth US$945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. Boeing’s expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing US$1 trillion. To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms, even as Beijing hopes to oust them with home-grown aircraft. Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers. Boeing last year announced plans to open a facility with COMAC to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said. COMAC has also developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ21, which took to the skies in its first commercial flight last June. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Chinese planemaker chases Xi’s dream to challenge Airbus, Boeing Chinese lessor orders ARJ-21 jets in US$2.3b deal Made in China passenger plane completed China buys 300 Boeing jets, signs pact for aircraft plant, says Xinhua China regional jet gets green light to conduct domestic flights Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Force's (USAF) GPS satellites that are currently in orbit. Under the agreed terms, the company will support the GPS IIA and IIF satellites for the next five years. Boeing Government Satellite Systems vice-president Dan Hart said: “This agreement continues Boeing’s strong legacy of GPS innovation and mission support. "This constellation of orbiting satellites provides navigation data to military and civilian users throughout the world." “We are focused on delivering reliable, affordable and resilient GPS capability now and for generations to come.” The USAF's GPS constellation is designed and operated as a 24-satellite system, comprising six orbital planes, with a minimum of four satellites per plane. This constellation of orbiting satellites provides navigation data to military and civilian users throughout the world. The USAF launches the satellites from the Evolved Expendable Launch vehicle into nearly 11,000-mile circular orbits. The satellites transmit signals on two different L-band frequencies, while circling the earth. The 24-hour navigation services provided by the GPS include three-dimensional location information, velocity and precise time; continuous real-time information and passive all-weather operations. The GPS IIF satellites provide improved signals for enhanced precise global positioning, navigation and timing services in support of both the warfighter and the growing civilian needs. These satellites use advanced atomic clocks to provide improved navigational accuracy. The longer design life and a third operational civil signal makes IIF suitable for commercial aviation and safety-of-life applications.

The plane, produced by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), was originally scheduled to make its debut journey in 2015, but the date was repeatedly pushed back as it underwent additional testing and certification. China's first big passenger plane, the C919, a narrow-body jet which can seat 168 passengers, goes on display at a facility in commercial hub in Shanghai on November 2, 2015 For China, the aircraft represents at least eight years of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce the country's reliance on European plane maker Airbus and Boeing of the United States and compete directly against them for market share. The first C919 rolled off the assembly line in November 2015 after workers spent more than a year putting together the single-aisle aircraft, which can seat 168 passengers. It is hoped the plane will take market share in the lucrative segment from the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. In November COMAC said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers. China is one of the Western manufacturers' key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The country's airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast. Boeing's expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing $1 trillion. To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms, even as Beijing hopes to oust them with homegrown aircraft. Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers. Boeing last year announced plans to open a facility with COMAC to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said. COMAC has also developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ21, which took to the skies in its first commercial flight last June.

Provided/Boeing Co. top story Q&A with Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina By David Wren dwren@postandcourier.com David Wren Feb 5, 2017 (…) Joan Robinson-Berry is vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina, which builds the 787 Dreamliner at its North Charleston campus. Provided/Boeing Co. It's been a busy year for Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina. A Los Angeles native with an engineering background, Robinson-Berry took over the aerospace giant's 787 Dreamliner program last June - just as it was increasing production to a dozen planes per month, split between the North Charleston and Everett, Wash., sites. She currently is overseeing final assembly of Boeing's first 787-10, the largest member of the Dreamliner family and the only one that will be built exclusively in North Charleston. And in December, Robinson-Berry cut the ribbon on a new paint hangar, making North Charleston a true start-to-finish campus for Dreamliner production. In the midst of it all, she is leading Boeing's local efforts to thwart a campaign by the International Association of Machinists. The union filed a petition last month and an election will be held on Feb. 15 in which production workers at Boeing's North Charleston facilities will decide whether they want to be represented by organized labor. Robinson-Berry has worked in union shops before, with Boeing's facilities on the West Coast. She prefers being able to interact directly with employees, saying a union gets in the way of a productive relationship. Robinson-Berry recently took time to answer questions about Boeing South Carolina's accomplishments and the upcoming union vote. Q: Less than a year into the job here in North Charleston and you are faced with a union vote in addition to the day-to-day operations of Boeing South Carolina’s varied facilities and the lifestyle change from West Coast to East Coast. How has the transition been for you personally these past few months? A: It’s been wonderful. Charleston is a community like no other, and the people of Boeing South Carolina have been very warm and welcoming. There’s a real sense of family here and you can feel that the minute you step foot on campus. What is most exciting is to see the transformation of Boeing South Carolina in person. I started working with the team in North Charleston years ago when the factory was first being built, and since then, our team has achieved some absolutely incredible accomplishments. It is really exciting to be a part of such a talented and hard-working team, and I could not be more proud to be here. The warm weather and sunshine is a nice benefit too. Q: Your predecessor here, Beverly Wyse, came from a family where both parents were members of labor unions. Has your family - or have you personally - had any experience with labor unions and, if so, how would you describe those experiences? A: I’ve worked in union and non-union shops. I’ve seen firsthand the divisiveness that a union can create. And the difference between that and the team spirit here at Boeing South Carolina, the level of engagement and the innovation that occurs is astounding. What we have at Boeing South Carolina – the teamwork, the flexibility – is special and we don’t want to see that change. Q: You have mentioned in the past that while Boeing workers have union representation at many sites, the North Charleston campus is unique and workers here don’t need intermediaries between themselves and management. Can you give some examples of how the North Charleston campus is unique compared to other Boeing sites? A: Despite the IAM’s attempt to shut this site down and their insults to this workforce, we have proven that this team is up to any challenge. We have come through the steepest learning curve in the history of our industry and our performance earned us the right to be the sole builder of the 787-10. Only at Boeing South Carolina do we have mechanics and engineers working side by side to come up with innovative solutions through our EDGE program. In 2016 alone, this site created more than 650 invention disclosures – more than any other Boeing site. That’s the result of our manufacturing teammates partnering with engineers directly on the shop floor to jointly develop new approaches and creating new solutions that are being seen as best practices across Boeing. That kind of cooperation on the floor doesn’t generally exist in a union shop. These are just two broad examples. Our teammates each have personal, compelling stories about what makes this place so special. I’ll tell you this, the spirit of teamwork here is very real. Q: The last time the IAM filed a petition here, in 2015, emotions on the production floor sometimes became heated between those who supported organized labor and those who opposed it. Have you noticed any of that this time around? What types of things are you hearing from employees as you walk the production floor and visit the different facilities? A: The IAM is a divisive force and they just don’t understand our environment here because it’s very different from how they operate. When I walk the shop floor – and I do every day – I see the pride and skill of this team. The team is working hard to delight our customers and meet our commitments. We’re continuing to achieve record production times even as the IAM tries to distract us. They’re trying to paint a picture of a workplace that quite frankly doesn’t exist here. Q: The IAM has accused Boeing of spreading misinformation about the union to its employees, a charge the company denies. Do you think the union has been totally honest with the workers who will be voting on representation in a couple of weeks? If not, what are some examples? Is the union making promises to workers here that it won’t be able to keep? A: First and foremost, I don’t accept the IAM’s claims that we are spreading misinformation. We want our teammates to have the facts and are doing everything we can to get those facts to them. In terms of misinformation from the IAM there are plenty of examples, but one of their most blatant false claims is that strikes rarely happen. There has been at least one IAM unit on strike every day since their 2015 petition here. That’s not a rare event. It is also a fact that over the years, the IAM has called 21 strikes against Boeing. Strikes that lasted an average of 66 days. That means employees went more than nine weeks without a paycheck. No work, no pay – hurting not just employees but their families, local businesses and the community as a whole. They’re also making promises to our teammates – over-the-top things about significantly higher wages, better benefits, changes to working conditions – knowing full well that they can’t guarantee anything. Another fact they don’t like to discuss is that collective bargaining opens up all current wage and benefits to the give and take of the negotiations process. The reality is that things can stay the same; they can go up; or they can go down. Our teammates who used to work for Vought remember very well that collective bargaining can result in a reduction in benefits. Q: Are there any concerns that Boeing’s current cost-cutting in the commercial planes division, including voluntary layoffs for some engineers, will impact the Feb. 15 vote and why? A: We believe that our teammates understand the pressure to be competitive in this industry to ensure our long-term success. We also believe they are aware that given the sheer volume of union jobs subject to layoffs in the past decade, a union cannot guarantee their job security. Q: What is the impact of a shorter timeframe for an election? In 2015, Boeing had more than a month to get its message across to workers and counter any union claims. This time around it’s a little more than three weeks. Do you think that works in Boeing’s favor or the union’s and why? A: We’ve done everything we can to share our message and to present the facts our teammates need over the course of the three-week campaign. And, when the union has provided our teammates with inaccuracies, we’ve been able to provide facts and data with outside sources to set the record straight. Q: Would union representation affect Boeing’s future operations here? Would we see operations moving elsewhere or would expansions that we might have seen not take place? A: I don’t have a crystal ball and it’s not productive to speculate. I know our best opportunity to win more work is for us to be competitive and our best opportunity to be competitive is to remain flexible and union free. Q: Why is organized labor wrong for Boeing South Carolina? A: We’ve built something truly special here, and the IAM hasn’t done one single thing to contribute to that success. Indeed the IAM has taken every opportunity to limit our growth and success – from trying to shut us down to doing everything it can to keep Boeing from providing jobs in any state other than Washington. Now they want a piece of our success – in the form of money out of our teammates’ pockets. It’s distasteful at best. At Boeing South Carolina, we are proud of our people who power our innovations and successes. We all wear our pride on our sleeves, literally – everything that we do together is “Made with Pride in South Carolina.” You can feel that here, each and every day. We’re going to protect what we’ve built together and focus on our future. We don’t need a union in order to do that.

Close share panel Image copyright Welsh Government Image caption SPC will be sharing a factory in Maerdy, Rhondda and creating 40 jobs More than 250 new jobs are being created in south Wales, the first in a series of announcements this week. The jobs at four firms include 100 at BT's call centre in Swansea and 50 posts at a healthcare firm in Crumlin. They come just days after Wales failed to secure a large defence investment from Boeing UK for a centre of excellence and up to 1,500 jobs. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said it was "disappointing" Cardiff Airport missed out on Boeing's hub. The 256 new jobs involve: BT: Creating 100 jobs in Swansea by expanding its customer service contact centre and taking a new floor at BT Tower Siltbuster: Creating 66 new jobs in Monmouth in a £4.3m expansion of its portable water treatment business. BBI Group: Creating 50 jobs and safeguarding 360 jobs at diagnostics and healthcare company's new HQ in Crumlin, Caerphilly County, centralising operations from Blaenavon, Cardiff and Dundee in a £8.5m investment. SPC: Wiltshire-based rubber firm creating 40 new jobs in Maerdy, Rhondda after taking over two rubber compound production lines from Avon Engineered Rubber. One moved to Wiltshire and another line was due to move to Barcelona but that is now staying in south Wales with new investment in the factory, which SPC will share with Avon. It is the first in a series of job announcements being made this week by Mr Skates. He said it was an indication of the "hard work going on behind the scenes" by the Welsh Government. Mr Skates said: "It's particularly important to recognise that every part of Wales needs to benefit from economic growth so I'm keen to announce through this themed week, job creation packages in every area of the country." Media captionKirsty Young of BBI Group says the investment would enable the firm to expand BBI Group began in 1986 as a Cardiff University spin-out company and now has a £60m turnover. It produces enzymes and assays for use in diagnostics for a wide range of diseases. SPC operations director Paul Hallas said its new facility was "the latest phase of our expansion plans for the growing business". What they produce is sold across the world to firms which make diagnostic kits for anything from hospital blood tests, to home kits for people with diabetes. It is a growing sector and one company they supply make 6bn diagnostics strips a year. The company took over a site in Blaenavon which has been operating since 1974 and some of the staff have been there for more than 30 years. They are skilled jobs, many have science degrees and all are paid above average for Wales. The news comes as it emerged Wales had failed to secure a large investment from Boeing UK. Instead, the US aerospace giant confirmed to BBC Wales that the jobs and investment are going to Wiltshire and that a site at Cardiff Airport came second. Aerospace is an industry which the Welsh Government has called a priority sector. There are already 160 aerospace companies in Wales employing 23,000 people, many of whom will earn wages above average. "We got down to the final two," said Mr Skates. "We're in a strong position should opportunities emerge from Boeing. However, the fact we reached that point demonstrates we're ahead of most of the competition in most of the sectors." He said the Ministry of Defence presence in that area was an attraction to Boeing, and Wales had beaten off a huge number of investment areas across Britain to get close to winning the deal. Many more people are working in Wales than recent years and Welsh unemployment levels have been below the UK average for many months. The ONS figures published in January show there were 24,000 more people working in Wales than a year earlier but 18,000 fewer than the previous three months. Clearly it is good news for the extra individuals who are now in work and good for the wider economy that unemployment in Wales is now below the UK rate. The weakness in the Welsh economy is low productivity and low wages. Click to see content: ashewales_feb17 The most recent official Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings figures from ONS for April 2016 show middle income workers (median earnings) in Wales earn £492.40 a week compared with £538.70 for the UK as a whole. That is the second lowest average earnings of all the 12 nations and regions of the UK. Mr Skates said it was about focusing on priority jobs and sectors such as financial and professional services - which were bringing "incredible results" - and advanced manufacturing. He told BBC Wales he also wants people, once in work, to develop their skill levels to "rise up the escalator of economic activity" to become more prosperous.

Ajai Shukla reports. After declaring that the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft was not suitable for operations from aircraft carriers, the Indian Navy has declared its interest in buying 'approximately 57' multi-role carrier-borne fighters for deck operations. The navy's request for information, RFI, posted on the Web on January 25, does not specify whether it wants a single-engine or a twin-engine fighter. However, the expansive role capability spelt out biases the selection towards a medium-to-heavy, twin-engine fighter. 'The MRCBF are intended as day and night capable, all weather multi-role deck based combat aircraft which can be used for air defence, air-to-surface operations, buddy refuelling, reconnaissance, electronic warfare missions etc from Indian Navy aircraft carriers,' states the RFI. The RFI specifies that in its operational configuration, the MRCBF would carry four 'beyond visual range' missiles, two 'all-aspect air-to-air missiles' and a gun. The RFI asks whether the MRCBF is capable of both STOBAR (short take off but arrested recovery) as well as CATOBAR (catapult take off but arrested recovery) aircraft carriers. The navy's two current carriers -- INS Vikramaditya, which is in service; and INS Vikrant, which is being built at Cochin Shipyard Ltd -- are both STOBAR vessels. INS Vishal, which would probably be commissioned around 2030, will probably be a CATOBAR carrier. Theoretically, in the fray are six contemporary fighters. Three are twin-engine: Dassault's marine Rafale, called the Rafale M; Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet; and the Russian MiG-29K/KUB. Another three -- Lockheed Martin's F-35B and F-35C; and Swedish company Saab's Sea Gripen -- are single engine fighters. The navy has already bought 45 MiG-29K/KUB for its two current carriers and, given the problems with that fighter, will not buy more. The Rafale M and the Super Hornet are designed for CATOBAR operations, but Boeing officials say computer simulations confirm that the Super Hornet is capable of short take offs from a ski-jump. "Boeing has completed extensive analysis and done some testing on the F/A-18's compatibility with Indian carriers. We have assessed that the Super Hornet is capable of launching off a ski-jump carrier and could be operated from Indian carriers," says Pratyush Kumar, head of Boeing India. Meanwhile, development delays could rule out the two F-35 variants -- the vertical take off and landing F-35B and the catapult launched F-35C. However, Saab officials, speaking off the record, confirm emphatically that they will offer the Sea Gripen. "We have done detailed feasibility studies that encounter no problem in evolving the Gripen E into a carrier-borne fighter." Effectively, that places Saab's and Boeing's aircraft in pole position for the MRCBF. Both fighters are also in contention to be built in India to meet the IAF's requirements. The contours of the race will become clearer on May 24, when original equipment manufacturers must submit responses. Significantly, the new RFI asks OEMs whether they are willing to manufacture their fighter in India. Given the timelines for delivery -- with the first fighters to be delivered within three years of contract signature and all 57 delivered within another three years -- the OEMs will find it challenging to establish production in India with an acceptable degree of indigenisation. "We can establish an assembly facility in India within 18 to 24 months, with about 10 to 15 per cent indigenisation of the fighter. But it would take four years to get 30 per cent indigenisation, and at least seven years to indigenise 45 to 50 per cent of the fighter," says a senior official from one of the OEMs that received the RFI.

The Montreal-based aerospace company, which makes landing gear for Boeing, Airbus and other aircraft manufacturers, said Tuesday the job cuts would be throughout its offices and plants but didn't provide any other details. Héroux-Devtek operates plants in Cambridge and Kitchener. It opened a plant on Boxwood Drive that makes landing gear systems for Boeing B-777 and B-777X jets in June 2015. Its plant on Highland Road West makes medium to large-size landing gear components. At the time the Cambridge plant was opening, the company said it employed 250 people in Ontario, most of them in Waterloo Region. According to regulatory documents filed last year, Héroux-Devtek employed about 1,400 people in Canada and the United States. Its head office is in Longueuil, Que., a suburb of Montreal. "In response to evolving market conditions, Héroux-Devtek is acting diligently by adjusting its workforce, while remaining in close contact with its customers to monitor the situation," chief executive Gilles Labbé said in a news release. "We regret the consequences of this decision on affected employees and their families and we will take equitable measures to provide them with all the support they deserve," he said. The announcement about the job cuts was included with Héroux-Devtek's third-quarter financial results. The company estimated the workforce reduction will result in a $4.8-million expense to be recorded in the company's 2017 fiscal fourth quarter, which ends March 31. In its third quarter ended Dec. 31, Héroux-Devtek had $98.5 million of sales, up from $96.6 million a year earlier. Net income rose to $8.2 million, or 23 cents per share, from $7 million, or 19 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, Héroux-Devtek earned $6 million, or 17 cents per share, in the third quarter, down from $7.0 million, or 19 cents per share.

02112017Sat                                            English-French IranFocus Home Iran Iran (General) Nuclear Human Rights Women Intelligence Reports Terrorism Exclusive Reports Life in Iran Nuclear Iran & Neighbours Iraq Afghanistan Syria Economy Tehran Grapevine Opinion Iran in the World Press Editorial Op-Ed Multimedia Blog Boeing deal with Iran could soon unravel Details Economy 07 February 2017 Print Email Twitter Iran Focus London, 7 Feb - Late last year, Boeing announced a deal to sell 80 passenger jets to Iran, which had many Regime sceptics up in arms. The Iranian Regime uses passenger planes to transfer illegal shipments of weapons to terror cells in the middle east and move military personnel covertly into other countries; so the idea of doing that with American-made planes was terrifying for the US government. Unfortunately, this deal was not been affected by either the extension of the Iran Sanctions Act signed by Barack Obama shortly before he left office or the recent expansion signed by Donald Trump last week, following Iran’s missile test. However, it could still unravel. Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based industry consultancy Teal Group, said: "The Drumpf administration is absolutely determined to ratchet up tensions and the Iranians will, of course, being hardliners there, want to do the same." If tensions continue to rise, Iran may well pull out of the Boeing deal themselves, according to industry observers. The deal is not only the sale of planes but also maintenance of them. Moody's analyst Russell Solomon, who covers the aerospace and defence industry, said: "It's a risk, but not something that will overwhelm [Boeing]. They do have a tremendous amount of operating and financial flexibility because of strength of the balance sheet, a strong liquidity profile and a very significant order book." On Friday, a Boeing spokesman said that the deal had received federal authorization from the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, but is that changed, Boeing would "act accordingly”. Their first plane shipment is due for 2018, so there is still time for the deal to collapse.   Search search Two prisoners were hanged in Sarpol-e Zahab (western Iran) Iran: ُHorrible scene of a family trapped in a car, swallowed by flood in Sistan & Baluchestan Iran: Tehran's Iconic High-Rise (Plasco Building) Collapsed Due to Fire More than 1,500 retired teachers held a protest gathering in front of Iran Regime's parliament Iran: Execution of four young men in public in Qeshm- 23 November The untold story of the 1988 Massacre in Iran Reyhaneh Jabbari's will Her voice recording from inside prison Public execution in Kazerun, Iran - August 11, 2016 blog Censorship Kills: Remembering Sattar Behesthi The New Orientalism: Iran as a Political Commodit...

Abbas Akhundi made the remarks in response to claims made by Western media on possibility of cancellation or suspension of Iran’s agreements with Boeing and Airbus in view of the recent orders issued by the US president, Mehr News Agency reported. The Iranian official deemed it improbable that Trump’s recent stances could affect aircraft purchase deals with the two giant manufacturers. Meanwhile, CNN has stated that a bill was introduced in Congress that could curtail the jetliner deals between Airbus and Boeing and Iran. CNN has also reported that even though America’s recent sanctions against Iran do not cover the agreement with Boeing over purchase of 89 passenger jets, the odds are high for the deal to be cancelled. Iran Air recently took delivery of the first of 100 jets it has ordered from Airbus while the first of 80 aircraft from Boeing are scheduled to arrive in 2018.     KeyWords Boeing Airbus Iran   Related News : Iran says final deals ‘close’ with Airbus, Boeing Official: Iran expects US export licenses for aircraft by Sept.-end Iran eyeing big buys from Boeing, Airbus Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News FM disapproves anti-Kuwaiti picture in Feb. 11 rallies Iran hopes ECO summit in Pakistan will further enhance cooperation US will fully implement JCPOA: EU’s Mogherini NAM deplores US coercive measures against Iran Iran says Daesh elements arrested in vicinity of capital Iranians celebrate 38th anniversary of Islamic Revolution Iran’s Ezzatolahi joins Russian Anzhi Makhachkala Iran defeated by Japan in international basketball friendly Iran’s Jamshidiyan wins omnium cycling silver in Asian meet Iran’s Abadan to host Greco-Roman World Cup 2017 Most Visited ‘Frustrated’ Trump’s insistence on Muslim ban ‘unconstitutional’: Analyst CIA honors Saudi crown prince with 'George Tenet Medal' Trump says he’s considering ‘brand new order’ on immigration www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1255 sec

The Montreal-based aerospace company, which makes landing gear for Boeing, Airbus and other aircraft manufacturers, said Tuesday the job cuts would be throughout its offices and plants but didn't provide any other details. Héroux-Devtek operates plants in Cambridge and Kitchener. It opened a plant on Boxwood Drive that makes landing gear systems for Boeing B-777 and B-777X jets in June 2015. Its plant on Highland Road West makes medium to large-size landing gear components. At the time the Cambridge plant was opening, the company said it employed 250 people in Ontario, most of them in Waterloo Region. According to regulatory documents filed last year, Héroux-Devtek employed about 1,400 people in Canada and the United States. Its head office is in Longueuil, Que., a suburb of Montreal. "In response to evolving market conditions, Héroux-Devtek is acting diligently by adjusting its workforce, while remaining in close contact with its customers to monitor the situation," chief executive Gilles Labbé said in a news release. "We regret the consequences of this decision on affected employees and their families and we will take equitable measures to provide them with all the support they deserve," he said. The announcement about the job cuts was included with Héroux-Devtek's third-quarter financial results. The company estimated the workforce reduction will result in a $4.8-million expense to be recorded in the company's 2017 fiscal fourth quarter, which ends March 31. In its third quarter ended Dec. 31, Héroux-Devtek had $98.5 million of sales, up from $96.6 million a year earlier. Net income rose to $8.2 million, or 23 cents per share, from $7 million, or 19 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, Héroux-Devtek earned $6 million, or 17 cents per share, in the third quarter, down from $7.0 million, or 19 cents per share.

The contract covers three of the radars, and follows the kingdom's recent commissioning of F-15SA fighter jets in January. The planes feature updated avionics, active electronically scanned array, or AESA, radars, and ASM-135 missiles. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, work on the contract will take place in Forest, Miss., and is expected to be complete by March 2017. The contract is comprised entirely of foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at the Robins Air Force Base in Georgia is listed as the contracting activity. The F-15SA is the Saudi variant of the Boeing-made F-15, a twin-engine tactical fighter initially developed for air supremacy missions. Currently, the plane is also fitted with ground attack capabilities. Additional operators of the aircraft include Israel, Japan, Britain, Germany and the United States.

programme. Airforce-technology.com wraps-up the key headlines from January, 2017. Boeing receives $2.1bn LRIP contract for KC-46A tanker aircraft Boeing secured a $2.1bn contract to supply components for the third low-rate initial production (LRIP) lot of KC-46A Pegasus tanker aircraft. Awarded by the US Air Force (USAF), the contract covers the production and supply of 15 KC-46A tanker aircraft, spare engines and wing air refuelling pod kits. USAF KC-46 System programme manager colonel John Newberry said: "Placing an order for another 15 aircraft is another important milestone for the KC-46 programme. "I know the warfighter is excited about bringing this next generation capability into the inventory." VSE to support USAF's $11.4bn CFT programme VSE Corporation received a contract to support the US Air Force (USAF) Contract Field Teams (CFT) programme that has a maximum value of $11.4bn. The programme has been designed to provide rapid deployment and long-term support services for the maintenance, repair, and modernisation of aircraft, vehicles, weapons systems, and other equipment in order to support the US Government’s war readiness needs. The indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (ID / IQ) contract is one of seven full and open prime contracts awarded to support the CFT programme. USAF announces new policies on dress and appearance The US Air Force (USAF) amended the existing tattoo policy in order to pave the way for talented and capable members to join the service. The new policies on dress and appearance are a result of a review conducted by the air force last year. The air force has eliminated the 25% tattoo rule, which means service members can now have tattoos completely covering the chest, back, arms and legs. CAE wins $762m training services contracts from RCAF and US Army CAE received two training services contracts totalling C$1bn ($762m) from the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and the US Army. Under the contract with RCAF, CAE will continue to train pilots from Nato member countries in Canada until 2023. As part of the Nato Flying Training in Canada (NFTC) programme, CAE provides ground-school classroom and simulator training and supports the live flying training of military pilots in Moose Jaw and Cold Lake. USAF B-2 bombers receive refuelling support for anti-ISIS mission in Libya The US Air Force's (USAF) KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender tanker aircraft provided aerial refuelling support to B-2 Spirit bombers, which were carrying out an airstrike against ISIS in Libya. Two B-2 Spirit bombers, from the 509th Bomb Wing, dropped 500lb GPS-guided bombs on the camps on 18 January. The camps housed ISIS militants, who were being trained to attack the US and allied interests in North Africa and Europe. Japan launches first X-band defence communication satellite Japan reportedly launched its first military communications satellite, Kirameki-2, in an effort to modernise the Self Defence Forces' communication network. The X-band satellite was successfully launched from a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' H-IIA rocket at the Tanegashima Space Center on 24 January. The new satellite is anticipated to support the Japanese military by boosting its emergency response capabilities, according to media sources. USAF launches third SBIRS GEO Flight 3 satellite aboard Atlas V rocket The US Air Force (USAF) successfully launched the third space-based infrared system (SBIRS) geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellite from a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The Lockheed Martin-built SBIRS GEO Flight 3 satellite, equipped with scanning and staring sensors, was launched on 20 January to support the USAF with early missile warning and defence. The satellite started responding to commands, approximately 37 minutes after lift-off, Lockheed stated. Israeli Air Force receives Arrow-III anti-ballistic missile The Israeli Air Force reportedly taken delivery of an operational Arrow-III anti-ballistic missile defence system. The Arrow-III interceptor, a part of the Arrow weapon system (AWS), was jointly developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and US-based Boeing. The AWS air defence system has been designed to detect, track, intercept and destroy incoming tactical ballistic missiles carrying a range of warheads, IAI said in a statement. Nigerian Air Force air strike kills 52 people A Nigerian Air Force fighter jet mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country, killing at least 52 people and injuring 120 others.

پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Sat 11 February 2017 × Economy Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion Akhundi: Contracts with Boeing, Airbus still in force News ID: 3899925 - Tue 7 February 2017 - 15:12 Economy TEHRAN, Feb. 07 (MNA) – Iran’s Roads Minister Akhundi has rejected the possibility that Donald Trump’s recent stances could lead to cancellation or suspension of Iran’s aircraft purchase contracts. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of 2nd Iran ITS Congress underway in Tehran, Iran’s Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Ahmad Akhundi made the remarks in response to claims made by Western media on possibility of cancellation or suspension of Iran’s agreements with Boeing and Airbus in view of the recent orders issued by the US president. The Iranian official deemed it improbable that Trump’s recent stances could affect aircraft purchase deals with the two giant manufacturers. Meanwhile, CNN has stated that a bill was introduced in Congress that could curtail the jetliner deals between Airbus and Boeing and Iran. CNN has also reported that even though America’s recent sanctions against Iran do not cover the agreement with Boeing over purchase of 89 passenger jets, the odds are high for the deal to be cancelled. Iran Air recently took delivery of the first of 100 jets it has ordered from Airbus while the first of 80 aircraft from Boeing are scheduled to arrive in 2018. The 2nd Iran ITS Congress is being held by Iran Road Maintenance & Transportation Organization with cooperation of Iranian Inc. for Contemporary International Conferences & Fairs (IICIC) on February 7-8, 2017 in Tehran-Iran.

Trump, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and Air Force Secretary Nominee Dr. Heather Wilson are actively seeking ways to lower the $4 billion budget for replacing Air Force One: The President's 747 flying command post. Wright Williams & Kelly, Inc.'s (WWK) aerospace and defense team identified concepts and pathways to save the Trump Administration $2 billion without compromises to the core mission or lowering core capabilities. Compared to the Pentagon's existing $4 billion sole source, no bid proposal, WWK's alternatives are based on aircraft available from Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Northrop Grumman, Embraer, etc. that have less technical risk and can be delivered sooner than Boeing's 747-8s expected in 2023. Off-the-shelf defense and commercial options considered by WWK's team increase Air Force One's survivability while improving POTUS wartime ability to command and control America's forces and nuclear arsenal. Utilization of network centric and stealth technologies developed by manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, BAE Systems, Harris, General Dynamics, and L3 will enhance resilience and survivability to anticipated mid-21st century requirements. A more economical Air Force One will meet the needs of allies like Japan, Germany, U.K., Australia, and Canada with limited budgets and create opportunities for additional export sales while lowering costs further for the Trump Administration. WWK's team has over 100 years of experience in aerospace, defense, high technology manufacturing, and COTS strategies, as well as modeling and simulation for cost reduction and productivity improvements. The team's publications have appeared in the USAF Air & Space Power Journal, The National Interest, Real Clear Defense, Second Line of Defense (SLDINFO.com), IEEE, Photovoltaics International, Future Fab International, Semiconductor International and many others.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Aerospace blog Boeing CEO pledges more profit, even though orders are down Dan Catchpole Tue Feb 7th, 2017 5:17am Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — In the next few years, the Boeing Co. faces headwinds: Airplane orders are down, revenue has dropped from its former cash-cow 777 program, and it’s introducing several new airplanes. That’s plenty to handle for any corporation. Company leaders have made the challenges ahead much harder to solve by pledging to significantly increase profits and shareholder payouts. A growing number of industry analysts say something has to give. Boeing CEO and Chairman Dennis Muilenburg has said his goal is to get the operating profit margins to “mid-teen” percentages by the end of the decade. That is about double the 7.6 percent rate the company has averaged over the past six years. The company will get there, Muilenburg and Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith say, by continuing to cut costs, bringing in more cash from the 787 program, cranking up 737 production, expanding services for operating airplanes and putting the KC-46 tanker into full production, among other plans. “So it’s a very real target, a very serious target, but we also acknowledge the fact that it’s going to require a lot of hard work,” Muilenburg told investment analysts and reporters during a conference call last fall. There is growing skepticism from industry observers that Boeing can deliver on the boardroom’s promises. “I’m not sure how they get there,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, a consulting firm in the Washington, D.C., area. Company leaders may be forced to walk back their promises to shareholders in the next year or two, he said. Commercial airplane orders have dropped after a decade-long spending spree that pushed annual tallies to record highs. Boeing and rival Airbus both have seen new orders drop to less than half of what they were just a few years ago. Orders are expected to remain low for the next few years. Boeing delivered 748 commercial jetliners in 2016. Company leaders say they expect to deliver more than 900 a year by the end of the decade, as Boeing cranks out more 737s and 787s. Airbus has similar plans to boost output. Increasing production is critical. The 737 program brings in huge amounts of cash to the company because it makes so many of the single-aisle airplanes, which compete with Airbus’ A320 family. Boeing soon will start delivering the latest version of the 1960s-era airplane: the 737 MAX. Company leaders expect the MAX, which promises better performance for airlines, to be a big earner. The company plans to take 737 production to dizzying speeds — from 42 a month now to 57 a month in 2019. Boeing also plans to turn out 14 of the 787s a month — up from 12 now. However, Dreamliner orders have dropped to a trickle. And last year, company leaders said they might hold 787 output at the current rate. The company steadily is whittling down the cost to make one of the advanced technology airplanes. It shaved another $6 million to $7 million off the cost of each airplane in late 2016, based on the latest quarterly earnings report. After eight years in production, the airplane is finally bringing in cash. However, the benefit to Boeing’s balance sheet is a garden hose, not a fire hose. Some analysts expect 787 production to drop before the decade is out, meaning it might never deliver a big boost to the bottom line. Airlines don’t need as many twin-aisle aircraft as Boeing and Airbus plan to make in the next few years, said David Strauss, an analyst at UBS, in a research note to investors in October. To bring supply in line with demand, Boeing needs to drop 787 production to eight a month in coming years. Likewise, Airbus needs to trim output, he said. Boeing is drastically cutting back production of the 777 as it develops a successor, the 777X. The 777 previously had been a profit-maker. Some analysts — and even some suppliers — are questioning if there is enough demand to drive up single-aisle production rates. “There are an awful lot of airplanes getting built,” and plans to build more, said Sam Pearlstein, an analyst with Wells Fargo, in an interview with The Daily Herald. “Is there enough traffic growth to support the ramp up in (737) production?” Boeing’s defense unit can pick up some wins — such as better earnings from the KC-46 tanker program or an uptick in fighter sales — but there do not appear to be any huge paydays on the horizon. Boeing’s new unit — Boeing Global Services — will enable the company to be more competitive in the growing market by providing services to airplanes already flying. But it is unlikely that it can generate a flood of profit in the next few years, Aboulafia said. Meanwhile, investors expect Boeing to deliver on the promises, and Muilenburg has proven to be more focused on shareholders than analysts initially expected. The company has kept up the pace of buying back shares since he took over in 2015. Delivering on Muilenburg’s promises might fall on suppliers. “Clearly cost-cutting is an ongoing focus” for the company, said Ken Herbert, an investment analyst with Canaccord Genuity. The company’s initiative to cut supplier costs, Partnering for Success, which requires 15 percent price cuts to contracts, is just getting started, Muilenburg said in a conference call last month. The program has “made some good initial strides,” he said. However, “there is much more still ahead of us, and that’s what drives our expectation that we are headed toward those mid-teen double-digit margins towards the end of the decade,” increasing cash each year, he said.

Finance Search How companies should respond to TrumpAAP – Tue, Feb 7, 2017 1:01 PM AEDT In a meeting with automakers on the fourth day of his presidency, Donald Trump appeared eager to co-operate with executives. That tone was in stark contrast to his tweets and pre-presidential news conference, where he targeted some businesses for attack and embraced others. Trump assailed the pharmaceutical industry at his January 11 news conference, saying drug companies "are getting away with murder." Key drug stocks immediately plummeted. The following day, Trump tweeted that Americans should "Buy L.L. Bean," after thanking an L.L. Bean board and family member for her political support. With his tweet, he put an iconic Yankee company in the crosshairs of a polarised national discourse. Whether Trump has been testing messages to use as president or launching a regular practice, he has used his own "bully pulpit" to put some businesses on notice and to commend others. This approach is raising questions about what some economists call "crony capitalism" and also about quid-pro-quo politics, and it's shaking up company executives who might otherwise be optimistic about pledges of economic growth. US corporate leaders from Carrier (HVAC manufacturing) to Boeing (aircraft manufacturing) and Ford (auto manufacturing) have been among those targeted by Trump as he presses his job growth agenda. On January 11, the nine top pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 by market cap lost a staggering $24.6 billion in 20 minutes during Trump's press conference, according to one analysis. Trump said the drug companies charge the government too much for medicines. The following day Trump tweeted about L.L. Bean, which an anti-Trump group called Grab Your Wallet had added to its list of companies targeted for boycotting. An L.L. Bean official quickly reminded inquiring news media that the company makes "no political endorsements or contributions," despite the fact that board member Linda Bean donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported Trump. A dynamic, growth-oriented capitalist system requires a level playing field in which companies focus on how best to compete in the marketplace, not in the political arena or with political money. A number of economists believe crony capitalism brings harmful uncertainty to US companies. And there is academic research suggesting an association between government-induced risk and companies' increased political donations. How, then, would US companies respond to a new president's bully pulpit? When he urges millions of Twitter followers to buy a company's products in the wake of its board member's political contributions, will business leaders see it as a quid-pro-quo endorsement? Or will they listen instead to the skeptical Trump who boasted on the campaign trail of giving money to politicians to get them to "do whatever the hell you want them to do," while calling the existing campaign finance system "broken"? These aren't idle questions, given what we're seeing in company contributions to the Trump inauguration. According to news reports, Trump-target Boeing pledged $1 million. Chevron, which has a deep stake in the incoming administration's energy and regulatory policies, gave $500,000. And AT&T, which is seeking to merge with Time Warner, has acknowledged that it contributed. It's too early to tell what factors the new president and new Congress will take into account in making decisions about businesses. In the meantime, in the interest of promoting economic growth along with their own protection, businesses can take concrete steps to protect themselves, shareholders and our democracy. Being transparent about when they give political money and adopting clear policies for this spending are two of the most significant safeguards companies can adopt at a time when one of Citizens United's central promises has not been fulfilled. In his Citizens United opinion for the court's majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy unshackled companies to engage in almost unfettered political spending while asserting that modern technology has the potential to make "disclosures rapid and informative." The latter promise has not been met. In large part due to Citizens United and other court rulings, the US election cycle in 2016 broke spending records. Driving much of the record costs were outside groups not formally connected to either political party, including organizations not required under US law to disclose their donors. These latter groups' secretive political funds often are called "dark money." Because these organisations may keep their donors anonymous, they are particularly attractive to like-thinking corporations and others who want to keep their donations under the radar. The US Chamber of Commerce, for example, a powerful business trade association, is allowed under US law to keep the sources of its political spending hidden. It spent almost $30 million on influencing 2016 House and Senate races. So-called "social welfare" groups run ads about hot issues, sometimes attacking candidates, and they are also permitted to hide donor identities. All told, political dark money was projected to add up to at least $132 million in 2016. Unfortunately, the promise of broad, effective disclosure that the Supreme Court embraced in Citizens United still seems remote. It is impossible to measure the total largesse of rivers of corporate political giving intended to influence elections. It is possible, however, by looking at disclosed spending, to get a sense of scale of corporate political engagement at another level: in the states, where more and more companies are turning for action. In the 2014 election cycle, business interests spent $1.1 billion on state candidates and committees. By comparison, in the same period labor groups spent $215 million and ideological or single-issue groups spent $137 million. When companies are transparent about their political contributions, they can protect against payments that might cause a backlash in our fiercely divided political climate, or an ill-considered payment that can damage their reputation. A clear policy on political spending can protect them against public or private pressure from a political candidate, allowing them to cite company policy in order to say "no." These steps are getting mainstream traction from companies acting on their own. According to a recent nonpartisan report examining the S&P 500, 305 of these companies were disclosing some or all of their political payments. One hundred and eleven had policies requiring board oversight of political spending. And 143 had placed some level of restriction on their political spending. It looks like Trump will continue to use his bully pulpit to shame and blame companies, and concerns about crony capitalism will keep growing. If this happens, companies can protect themselves and their integrity by following guidance from Business Roundtable, which encourages company boards to oversee political spending and consider adopting a policy on disclosure. It's modest advice, but it may help companies in the eye of Trump's next storm. Bruce F. Freed is president of the Centre for Political Accountability. Charles E.M. Kolb is a member of the CPA board.

Field AUCKLAND, New Zealand (May 15, 1998 - Agence France-Presse)---Unique islands which led to Charles Darwin theorizing on evolution, the Galapagos group, will be the first land down-range from a new commercial sea-launched rocket launching system which will begin firing in October. Backers say there is a 4.3 in one million chance of debris from a wayward rocket hitting any of the islands. They say there is a three in 1,000 chance of rockets failing over South America and if so debris would "impact a very small area... relative to the vast ecological regimes found along the equator in South America." Sea Launch Limited Partnership (SLLP), a Cayman Island registered venture involving Boeing Commercial Space Company and companies from Russia, Ukraine and Norway, will launch satellites from a converted oil drilling platform in international waters on the Equator at longitude 154 West, 340 kilometers (210 miles) south-east of Kiritimati Atoll in Kiribati. Galapagos is 6,800 kilometers (4,216 miles) due east. The first of 18 launches is due in October. The launches have to be licensed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Agency's (FAA) Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which is required to get an Environmental Assessment (EA). The EA, prepared by Boeing and the FAA, said the launchings would not affect the quality of the human environment and recommends no further environmental reporting action is required. The determination can be appealed by May 22. The EA gives no consideration to the satellite packages carried on the Zenit-3SL rockets. Darwin, aboard HMS Beagle visited Galapagos in 1835. It was the fact that each island had slightly different mockingbirds and finches that led Darwin to evolution. Each island's Galapagos tortoises are different too, although Darwin appeared not to notice at the time. SLLP says they could have moved further west but commercial considerations required they be no more than 12 days sailing away from their home base in California. Firing from the equator allows SLLP to maximize the effect of the Earth's rotation and to use less fuel in maneuvering geostationary satellites into orbit. But the EA hints at concern over the Galapagos because the company is proposing to slightly deviate the rocket flight path off the equator so that it misses the main part of the island group in the event of upper stage failure. "Deviation around the Galapagos would be possible due to the high degree of Zenit-3SL in-flight maneuverability." SLLP said in the event of failure a few dozen objects up to 22 kilograms (48 pounds) would survive to hit the Earth. Wolf and Darwin islands in the group would have an "approximately 4.3 in one million" chance of being hit. "Harm to either island would occur if the debris directly strikes an individual or if a habitat is damaged from debris landing on fragile materials," the EA says. "Recovery from damage caused by debris impacts could take several years to re-establish the damaged habitat in such an arid terrain.... "The risk of debris falling on these two islands, therefore, is remote, and the risk of harm to resident populations or habitat even less. The greatest harm would be caused by debris falling onto a vulnerable area, but is unlikely given the sparse distribution of woody or grassy habitat on these small and arid lands." Thus the Galapagos were no longer an "area of concern" for SLLP. SLLP says during launches both stages and the fairings would "flutter to the sea surface" where they would eventually sink. "Once settled, the debris would become part of the habitat, offering a new substrate and a protective residence in the benthic ecosystem." Michael J.

Nordstrom stopped selling Ivanka Trump's fashion. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Toyota, meanwhile, suffered through the discomfort of being on the receiving end of Trump Twitter tirades. The Trump era is a perilous new landscape for corporate America. Companies are feeling political pressure like never before, squeezed on one side by consumers who are boycotting products with any ties to the administration and on the other by the outspoken, social media-loving president. For most companies, the decision to get political used to be made after long, careful deliberations among a company's leader, public relations team, lawyers and lobbyists. Now, in an increasingly divided America, companies may have no choice but to move quickly. “You have to understand your customers in real time because political ramifications are happening instantly,” said Matt Friedman, a crisis communications adviser based near Detroit who has worked with public and private companies. “Each business now has to look at where their customer fits into the political divide and how their company values align to what the president is doing on a day-to-day basis.” The predicament for companies was on display ahead of Trump's first White House meeting Friday with his business forum, a group that includes General Motors CEO Mary Barra, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and a dozen others. The night before, Uber's Travis Kalanick told his employees he'd decided to quit the council because his presence on it was being “misinterpreted” as an endorsement of the president. “I spent a lot of time thinking about this and mapping it to our values,” Kalanick told employees in an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Disney CEO Bob Iger didn't attend either; instead, he was at a company board meeting in California. A seat on a high-profile White House council, no matter the political party in power, has previously been a can't-pass-up sign of prestige. It's a direct way for a company to express opinions to the president — far less fraught than trying to gain access through lobbying or donating money. Trump said he intends to take advice from the council, which he said would meet regularly to discuss policies. Trump said he'd be seeking guidance on his plans to roll back the financial services legislation known as the Dodd-Frank bill from Dimon. “There's nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie,” he said Friday. But an audience with this president, at least at this stage, brings with it customer complications. No doubt weighing into Kalanick's decision to give up that influence was the boycott the ride-sharing company, popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, had been experiencing all week. That campaign went viral on social media Saturday night when people perceived Uber as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to Trump's executive order suspending the country's refugee program. It didn't let up even after Uber publicly condemned Trump's executive order and contributed to relief groups. Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the “Grab Your Wallet” social media effort to encourage boycotts of companies tied to Trump, said she would only be satisfied when Kalanick resigned from the presidential forum, saying: “This is not a ‘seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment.” Grab Your Wallet claimed another victory Thursday night when Nordstrom announced it had stopped selling first daughter Ivanka Trump's fashion line. The company cited the brand's performance. The department store was one of Grab Your Wallet's first targets. Neiman Marcus also appears to have stopped selling her jewelry. “Companies have been late to the game with realizing how much ire it can create to associate with a person like Donald,” Coulter said. While the anti-Trump boycotters cheered Nordstrom, angry Trump supporters deluged the company with angry messages on Twitter — some saying they were now prepared to begin their own boycott. Nordstrom spent the night responding to hundreds of them, with messages like: “We're so sorry to disappoint you. It's not a political decision for us.” Maine-based retailer L.L. Bean faced the flip side of that. Linda Bean, one of many family members involved in the company, gave money to a pro-Trump super PAC during the campaign, prompting Grab Your Wallet to call for a boycott, which in turn prompted Trump to weigh in with a bit of social-media marketing. “Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L. Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L. Bean,” Trump tweeted last month, a few weeks before taking office. When they make a move that could be perceived as a knock on the president, companies like Nordstrom must calculate not only the financial impact of angering Trump supporters but also the possibility that Trump himself could take notice — spiraling the crisis to another level. Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys Inc., said CEOs are especially vulnerable now because technology allows people to protest and vent their anger without organizing a march ­— or even leaving their home. Among those who can weigh in with a few finger taps: the leader of the free world. “The direct communication from the president of the United States, with attacks on specific brands and specific people, is not something we've ever seen before,” he said. Just how much this new, perilous environment for CEOs will actually affect business in the long term is difficult to know. Shares of Lockheed fell sharply after the president tweeted in December that the cost of its F-35 fighter jets was “out of control,” then fell again after he complained about the military contractor at a news conference the next month.

Successfully applying to the Air Force gap-year program, the Wodonga-born pilot progressed to flight schools in Tamworth and Perth before earning his wings at the end of 2011. When not back at home with family and friends, Flight Lieutenant Collier flies missions with Adelaide’s Number 10 Squadron in the 27.9 tonne Lockheed AP-3C Orions, which have been used in the Australian Defence Force since 1978. In Flt Lt Collier’s career, he has flown the plane in maritime and surveillance operations in Hawaii, New Zealand, Philippines and, recently, for the last time, in Malaysia. The Air Force has scheduled the aircraft for final decommissioning in 2019 to be replaced by Boeing P-8A Poseidons which Flt Lt Collier said were basically a 737 rebuilt for military purposes. “The difference mainly is the P-3 Orion is a straight wing turboprop aircraft... and you're going from that to a 737 lookalike … so from rudimentary automation to lots of automation,” he said. 1996 ADF video about the AP-3C Orion “I’m going to miss the P-3 … it’s a pilot’s plane, it’s one of the last aircrafts left in the Air Force all up to the pilot. “Operating P-3s for the last four years does create a soft spot, it’s sad to say goodbye to the old friend but exciting to move onto the new aircraft.” The P-3s have a 100-feet minimum operating height which Flt Lt Collier said made it exciting when cruising over the ocean on a 45-degree angle bank. The new 62.7 tonne planes will be restricted to a height of 200 feet. Flt Lt Collier said he was a member of one of the first two crews which would travel to Jacksonville, Florida, to train in the new P-8s next month. SUN SETS ON P-3: An Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion takes off at Royal Malaysian Air Force Base Butterworth during an exercise last month. “It will be a steep learning curve,” he said. “When you walk away from what you know it’s going to be exciting but challenging at the same time.” The pilot said he was also interested in seeing how US forces operated. The trip will go for six months with the crews expected to come back and operate the P-8s out of RAAF Base Edinburgh.

China Southern to lease five 787-9s from Air Lease Corp. Feb 6, 2017 Aaron Karp EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Related Media Gallery: This Week in Pictures-Jan. 30-Feb. 3, 2017 Advertisement Guangzhou-based China Southern Airlines has agreed to lease five Boeing 787-9s from Air Lease Corp. (ALC), the Los Angeles-based lessor said. The aircraft will be powered by GE Aviation GEnx engines. Deliveries of the leased 787-9s to China Southern will start in the 2019 first quarter. The airline will receive three of the 787-9s in 2019 and two in 2020, according to ALC. China Southern currently operates 10 787-8s. It announced in a Shanghai Stock Exchange filing in October 2016 that it was ordering 12 787-9s, but these orders are not yet listed by Boeing. Those deliveries are slated to start in 2018. It is not clear whether the five ALC 787-9s are considered part of those 12 787-9s or are in addition to them. ALC has ordered 46 787s and has so far taken delivery of three, all GEnx-powered 787-9s, according to Boeing. The lessor still has 17 787-9 orders unfilled, including 11 designated to be powered by GEnx engines, according to Boeing.

A new data visualization tool takes a square-mile snapshot of any city and converts it into a simple graphic diagram that can be easily compared to anywhere else. "[It] lets you get a city’s or neighborhood’s walking, driving, or biking network with a single line of Python code," says Geoff Boeing, a PhD student at the University of California-Berkeley who created the tool in order to study urban street networks more easily. Looking at a square-mile section of the street grid—a form inspired by Allan Jacobs's hand-drawn maps in a book called Great Streets—can help researchers quickly understand a city's shape, configuration, and a little about its history. "It tells you how the city is connected — or disconnected," says Boeing. "You can also see the design paradigm and planning decisions that went into the layout of the urban form (in planned cities) or how the city's urban fabric evolved in older self-organized cities. How is the city oriented to walking versus driving?" In the case of suburban Irvine, you can also see how little is going on. "You can also see how much dense, lively space in a place like Rome or Osaka (and all that rich history and activity!) could fit into just a couple of blocks of suburban business park in a place like Irvine, California," he says. For anyone who wants to make maps themselves, Boeing links to his code in a blog post.

That’s what two security researchers are warning, after finding a Mac-based malware that may be an attempt by Iranian hackers to target the U.S. defense industry. The malware, called MacDownloader, was found on a website impersonating the U.S. aerospace company United Technologies, according to a report from Claudio Guarnieri and Collin Anderson, who are researching Iranian cyberespionage threats. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] The fake site was previously used in a spear-phishing email attack to spread Windows malware and is believed to be maintained by Iranian hackers, the researchers claimed. Visitors to the site are greeted with a page about free programs and courses for employees of the U.S. defense companies Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing. The malware itself can be downloaded from an Adobe Flash installer for a video embedded in the site. The website will provide either Windows or Mac-based malware, depending on the detected operating system. Iran Threats A screenshot of the fake site.  The MacDownloader malware was designed to profile the victim's computer, and then steal credentials by generating fake system login boxes and harvesting them from Apple's password management system, Keychain. However, the malware is of shoddy quality and is "potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer," the researchers said. For instance, once the malware is installed, it will generate a fake Adobe Flash Player dialog box, only to then announce that adware was discovered on the computer and that it will attempt to clean it up. "These dialogues are also rife with basic typos and grammatical errors, indicating that the developer paid little attention to quality control," the researchers said. In addition, the malware failed to run a script to download additional malicious coding onto the infected Mac.   But despite the shoddy quality, the malware still managed to evade detection on VirusTotal, which aggregates antivirus scanning engines. The researchers found other circumstantial evidence that the malware is linked to Iran. An exposed server that the MacDownloader agent uploaded showed wireless networks called "Jok3r" and "mb_1986." Both of these names have ties to previous Iranian hacking groups, including one known as Flying Kitten, which is suspected of targeting U.S. defense contractors and political dissidents. In an email, Anderson said a colleague also observed MacDownloader targeting a human rights activist. The danger is that many human rights supporters, especially in Iran, are dependent on Apple devices, the researchers said. "While this [malware] is neither sophisticated nor full-featured, its sudden appearance is concerning given the popularity of Apple computers," they wrote in their report. Mac malware is fairly rare, according to security researchers. That's because hackers tend to attack Windows-based devices, because of their popularity. However, Mac-based malware is still popping up here and there. Last month, researchers found another kind designed to spy on biomedical research centers. A separate Mac-based Trojan was found months earlier, targeting the aerospace industry.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

(Photo: Land Rover) 5 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE As Washington considers a tax on imports, an auto industry study suggests the policy would deliver the sharpest blow to Tata Motors Ltd.’s Jaguar Land Rover while giving a leg up to Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. In what it calls a “thought exercise,” industry researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates that most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars — more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case — to recoup higher costs incurred under the House Republican-proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baumsaid by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of its factory in Sterling Heights to build light-duty pickups there instead of Mexico, and to add medium- and heavy-duty truck output at the plant, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said. 5 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2jZBpt4 TOP VIDEOS Mike Ilitch: 'I fell in love with Midwestern friendliness' 2:40 Microsoft moving to Detroit 3:49 Walking the floor at the NAIAS Charity Preview 1:00 Biden admires Detroit, 'an iconic city' 2:15 Chinese automaker GAC reveals three new vehicles 1:57 Mercedes-Benz introduces new cars 2:48 Infiniti introduces QX50 concept 1:19 2018 Honda Odyssey introduced 0:54 Nissan introduces Vmotion 2.0 concept, Rogue Sport SUV 1:25 2017 North American Car and Truck of the Year awards 2:03

Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said he could support a hike at the Federal Open Market Committee’s next two-day meeting in March. “I think March is on the table. I would never take a meeting off the table,” Harker told reporters after a speech in San Diego, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari wrote an essay, posted on the bank’s website, about his decision at last week’s FOMC meeting to vote in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged. “We are still coming up somewhat short on our inflation mandate, and we may not have yet reached maximum employment,” Kashkari said. “That suggests that somewhat accommodative monetary policy would still be appropriate to close those gaps.” Wall Street was mixed. In 1.25pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.1 percent. In 1.10pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.06 percent. In the Dow, advances in shares of Boeing and those of Apple, which recently traded 1.5 percent and 1.1higher respectively, outweighed declines in shares of Chevron and those of Exxon Mobil, recently down 1.6 percent and 1 percent respectively. Energy stocks followed the price of oil lower, with crude falling below US$52 a barrel. While concern about the impact of US President Donald Trump’s controversial start in office is weighing on equity markets, the outlook for corporate profits and the economy remains positive. "We've been getting some back and forth between the new administration's business-friendly policies versus the disruptions economically and politically from the immigration and trade-related issues," Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia, told Reuters. "However, at the end of the day, the expansion is continuing, the economy and earnings are growing and that should support equities,” Pride noted. A Commerce Department report showed the US trade deficit narrowed 3.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted US$44.26 billion in December from the previous month. Protectionist policies, as championed by Trump, won't get rid of the deficit, some warned. "When an economy is at full employment, an acceleration in demand tends to be accompanied by a pickup in import growth and a wider trade deficit," John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, told Reuters. "The US simply does not have enough spare labour and capacity at any exchange rate to close the deficit, which will likely widen in 2017 and 2018." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.3 percent advance from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index gained 0.3 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.5 percent.

The route adds 200 miles to the record Emirates established last year by virtue of Doha’s location further west than Dubai. Singapore Airlines Ltd.’s planned resumption of direct flights from its home hub to New York in 2018 would comfortably beat both services, with a distance of more than 9,500 miles. There's some confusion regarding the longest-flight title following Air India Ltd.'s switch to a trans-Pacific route between Delhi and San Francisco in order to avoid trans-Atlantic headwinds and reduce travel times. While the service spans more than 9,000 miles, the cities are actually only 7,706 miles apart -- more than 1,300 miles closer than Doha and Auckland. Explainer video on the science behind flight turbulence Media: MediaOS Video Qatar Air will serve Auckland daily using 259-seat Boeing Co. 777-200LR aircraft, with the flight taking about 17 1/2 hours. While demand will come chiefly from Europe, the carrier also expects to attract passengers from the U.S. East Coast, even with the long journey time, Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said at a press briefing after the first service touched down. Related Stories Nearly 80 flights at SFO canceled due to bad weather Yemeni girl’s travel ordeal ends with US citizenship Singapore Airlines flight attendant found dead in San Francisco hotel room Across the region, Qatar Air also serves Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth in Australia, with seat occupancy rates typically running above 85 percent, and plans to add flights to Canberra next February. Al Baker said it’s open to cooperation with a local carrier for onward flights from Auckland following the termination of an existing arrangement with Air New Zealand Ltd. Qantas Airways Ltd., Australia’s biggest airline, plans to start direct flights between Perth in Western Australia and London in March 2018 using a Boeing 787. That trip spans 9,009 miles, according to the Great Circle Mapper website. Direct flights from northwest Europe to the southeast of Australia remain beyond the range of the most modern jets with a full passenger load, though they may be possible in a few years with Boeing’s upgraded 777X series. Even then, Europe-Auckland is likely to remain too much of a stretch. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

That’s what two security researchers are warning, after finding a Mac-based malware that may be an attempt by Iranian hackers to target the U.S. defense industry. The malware, called MacDownloader, was found on a website impersonating the U.S. aerospace firm United Technologies, according to a report from Claudio Guarnieri and Collin Anderson, who are researching Iranian cyberespionage threats. The fake site was previously used in a spear phishing email attack to spread Windows malware and is believed to be maintained by Iranian hackers, the researchers claimed. Visitors to the site are greeted with a page about free programs and courses for employees of U.S. defense companies Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. The malware itself can be downloaded from an Adobe Flash installer for a video embedded in the site. The website will provide either Windows or Mac-based malware, depending on the detected operating system. Iran Threats A screenshot of the fake site.  The MacDownloader malware was designed to profile the victim's computer, and then steal credentials by generating fake system login boxes and harvesting them from Apple's password management system, Keychain. However, the malware is of shoddy quality and is "potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer," the researchers said. For instance, once the malware is installed, it'll generate a fake Adobe Flash Player dialog box, only to then announce adware was discovered on the computer that it'll attempt to clean up. "These dialogues are also rife with basic typos and grammatical errors, indicating that the developer paid little attention to quality control," the researchers said. In addition, the malware failed to run a script to download additional malicious coding onto the infected Mac.   But despite the shoddy quality, the malware still managed to evade detection on VirusTotal, which aggregates antivirus scanning engines. The researchers found other circumstantial evidence that the malware is linked to Iran. An exposed server that the MacDownloader agent uploaded to showed wireless networks called "Jok3r" and "mb_1986." Both of these names have ties to previous Iranian hacking groups, including one known as Flying Kitten, which is suspected of targeting U.S. defense contractors and political dissidents. In an email, Anderson said a colleague of theirs also observed MacDownloader targeting a human rights activist. The danger is that many human rights supporters, especially in Iran, are dependent on Apple devices, the researchers said. "While this [malware] is neither sophisticated nor full-featured, its sudden appearance is concerning given the popularity of Apple computers," they wrote in their report. Mac malware is fairly rare, according to security researchers. That's because hackers tend to attack Windows-based devices, because of their popularity. However, Mac-based malware is still popping up here and there. Last month, researchers found another kind designed to spy on biomedical research centers. A separate Mac-based Trojan was found months earlier, targeting the aerospace industry.  6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

A decline in energy stocks weighed on Wall Street, while investors digested comments from US Federal Reserve officials about the potential for an interest rate increase next month. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said he could support a hike at the Federal Open Market Committee's next two-day meeting in March. "I think March is on the table. I would never take a meeting off the table," Harker told reporters after a speech in San Diego, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari wrote an essay, posted on the bank's website, about his decision at last week's FOMC meeting to vote in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged. "We are still coming up somewhat short on our inflation mandate, and we may not have yet reached maximum employment," Kashkari said. "That suggests that somewhat accommodative monetary policy would still be appropriate to close those gaps." Wall Street was mixed. In 1.25pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.1 per cent. In 1.10pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 0.06 per cent. In the Dow, advances in shares of Boeing and those of Apple, which recently traded 1.5 per cent and 1.1 per cent higher respectively, outweighed declines in shares of Chevron and those of Exxon Mobil, recently down 1.6 per cent and 1 per cent respectively. Energy stocks followed the price of oil lower, with crude falling below US$52 a barrel. While concern about the impact of US President Donald Trump's controversial start in office is weighing on equity markets, the outlook for corporate profits and the economy remains positive.

"However, at the end of the day, the expansion is continuing, the economy and earnings are growing and that should support equities," Pride noted. A Commerce Department report showed the US trade deficit narrowed 3.2 per cent to a seasonally adjusted US$44.26 billion in December from the previous month. Protectionist policies, as championed by Trump, won't get rid of the deficit, some warned. "When an economy is at full employment, an acceleration in demand tends to be accompanied by a pickup in import growth and a wider trade deficit," John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, told Reuters. "The US simply does not have enough spare labour and capacity at any exchange rate to close the deficit, which will likely widen in 2017 and 2018." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.3 per cent advance from the previous close. The UK's FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 per cent, while Germany's DAX Index gained 0.3 per cent.

Crude futures for March delivery fell 1.58 percent to settle at $52.17 per barrel amid concerns of higher U.S. shale production.

That makes it a lot less of a long-term investment," said Maris Ogg, the president at Tower Bridge Advisors. "This is really like a growth company that fesses up that it can't grow anymore." The Dow briefly rose more than 100 points, hitting a record high, before ended 37 points higher, with Boeing contributing the most gains.  "I think the market trading today is sort of indicative of people confused by everything that's going on or investors squaring positions ahead of something," said Mark Luschini, a chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. "I don't think it's necessarily bad, ... but the market is in search of a catalyst to go higher." The Nasdaq composite reached a new all-time high, gaining 0.19 percent. General Motors, Archer Daniels Midland and Michael Kors were among the companies that reported before the bell. Disney, Gilead Sciences, Mondelez, Pioneer Natural Resources and Zillow are among many other companies due to report after the market close. "We are having a pretty good earnings season. That's really [supporting] the market here," said Lisa Kopp, head of traditional investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "We see a generally higher trend for stocks, but with some volatility, for 2017." Calendar fourth-quarter earnings have mostly surprised analysts, with more than 65 percent of firms reporting better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout. "We've come into a period of time where we see fundamentals and earnings improve and you have to juxtapose that with everything that's going on in Washington," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "Let's put this on a percentage basis: 50 percent of this move has been on the promise of tax cuts and deregulation, ... but a lot of this stuff has to come to fruition." Stocks rallied sharply after President Donald Trump won the U.S. election, amid higher prospects of corporate tax cuts, deregulation and government spending. The major U.S. indexes have recently held around all-time highs as investors await for more details on the administration's policies. "I keep coming back to this, and that is we've moved 180 degrees to a business friendly environment in Washington," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. "A lot of people miss the fact that this is such a huge reversal from even the past 16 years." In economic news, the U.S. trade deficit last year reached its highest level since 2012. For the whole year, the deficit rose 0.4 percent to $502.3 billion, the Commerce Department said. Other data released include the job openings and labor turnover survey, which showed job openings in the U.S. totaled 5.501 million at the end of December. U.S. Treasury yields traded mixed on Tuesday after Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Patrick Harker said a March rate hike should be on the table. The benchmark 10-year note yield held near 2.38 percent, while the short-term two-year note yield traded around 1.14 percent. "Regardless of what Harker thinks we know that it really only matters what Yellen, Fischer and Dudley think," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. "As it's clear that the Fed only likes to raise rates on days where there is a press conference and they are scheduled for 4 this year at the same time they want to hike 3 times, they better get moving then. We still are calling for a March hike but the fed funds futures market barely blinked after Harker," Boockvar said in a note. Overseas, European equities traded mostly higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index rising 0.32 percent. In Asia, stocks traded mostly lower, with the Shanghai composite falling 0.12 percent and the Nikkei 225 dropping 0.32 percent. About nine stocks declined for every five advancers at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 345 million and a composite volume of 1.688 billion in afternoon trade. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 11.5. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Cyrus Habib speaks during a committee hearing in Olympia, Wash., in Feb. 2013. (Elaine Thompson/Associated Press) By Cyrus Habib By Cyrus Habib February 7 Cyrus Habib is Washington state’s lieutenant governor. President Trump’s recent executive order denying entry to refugees as well as immigrants and visitors from seven majority-Muslim countries has disrupted the lives of thousands of people here and abroad. I can relate to what those families are going through. Two decades ago, my family would have been one of them. My father came to the United States from Iran on a student visa in 1970 to attend the University of Washington. He obtained bachelor’s and master’s degrees there, became a civil engineer and worked for Boeing until cancer claimed his life last year. He was a green-card holder until he became a citizen in the mid-’90s. My mother, also from Iran, came to the United States in 1980 on a visa, earning her law degree and becoming a citizen later that decade. Like millions of other Middle Easterners, they were drawn here by our country’s promise of equal opportunity for those who work hard and play by the rules. Neither of my parents would have been able to immigrate to the United States under Trump’s executive order. Nor would my Iranian grandmother have been able to visit us here in 1987, when I was receiving treatment for the cancer that would soon after take my eyesight. The contributions my father made to our country’s leading aerospace manufacturer, the work my mother performs daily to administer justice as a Superior Court judge in King County, Wash., and the opportunity I had to see my grandmother’s face before becoming blind — these are all part of my family’s story. Our story, along with those of countless other immigrants and refugees, is an essential part of what truly makes America great, then and now. After I lost my eyesight, my parents, in American fashion, pledged never to let my disability limit my dreams. Their confidence and support allowed me to go from Braille to Yale, and eventually to my current job as Washington state’s lieutenant governor. It’s a tale that can only be told in this country, where hard-working and brave people of every religion, race and national origin come to contribute and flourish. Today, millions of immigrants from majority-Muslim countries do just that. They are teachers and truckers, soldiers and surgeons, entrepreneurs and executives. Of the fatal terrorist attacks committed in the United States since 9/11, not a single one was committed by immigrants from the seven countries singled out by Trump’s executive order. And yet, students, researchers, artists and scientists from these countries are being treated differently than their peers from non-majority-Muslim countries. These individuals and families, unlike mine, would now be denied the opportunity to bring their talent and tenacity to this country, or, once here, would be cut off from their relatives overseas. On Friday, a federal judge halted the executive order after our state attorney general demonstrated that it presented a unique threat to the state’s economy and institutions — drawing on testimony from state universities and Washington-headquartered companies. I’m proud of Attorney General Bob Ferguson for bringing this lawsuit and winning the first round of the legal battle. By taking the Trump administration to court, we in Washington state are leading the country away from actions that would irreparably damage America’s economy and reputation as a bastion of inclusion. I applaud the 15 states that have signed on to our lawsuit in advance of Tuesday’s appellate hearing, and I urge other state attorneys general to join us in challenging this un-American executive order. I also ask members of Congress, each of whom represents many immigrants, to take immediate action to correct this wrong. They should demonstrate a fraction of the courage it takes for a Syrian refugee to escape their war-torn homeland, and act to reverse this brazen act of presidential overreach. In so doing, they will allow stories like mine to unfold for other deserving families. And they will benefit our state and our nation by demonstrating that the United States remains not only the land of the free, but also the home of the brave. Ultimately, this is bigger than courts or Congress. This moment calls for a collective commitment to the importance of inclusion. That’s a lesson I learned early on as a three-time cancer-surviving, fully blind Iranian American from a mixed-religion, immigrant family. And it’s a lesson President Trump must learn if he wants to understand what truly makes America great. Read more here: Eugene Robinson: Trump’s travel ban isn’t about making America safe.

Shares of Apple, IBM, Boeing and Visa accounted for 98 percent of the Dow's gains year to date. Apple's stock alone accounted for nearly a third of the index's gains. "With Apple and IBM, you have to figure they got too cheap," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. "When you have a market this expensive, people go out looking for bargains." The Dow outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite in 2016, lifted by a massive post-U.S. election rally. Shares of Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth Group, IBM and 3M provided the largest points contributions on the Dow last year. They accounted for 46 percent of the Dow's 2016 gains. The Dow is up around 1.6 percent in 2017, having hit a record high earlier in the session. — CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report.

Investors are reviewing mostly upbeat earnings reports as the day’s trading gets underway. The Commerce Department also reported earlier Tuesday that the US trade deficit had narrowed just over three per cent in December, with strong showings in some export sectors. About 40 minutes into the day’s trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were both up 0.4 per cent to 20,134.25 and 5,683.65 respectively. The broader S&P 500 was itself also flirting with another all-time high, up 0.3 per cent at 2,298.52. The rosier open suggested major US indices may resume their recent upward trend after moving mostly sideways around the start of the month. Among the Dow’s major gainers, Boeing was up 1.74 per cent while IBM and Apple both added about 1 per cent. However shares in GM were down more than four per cent, with investors fretting over higher costs despite solid sales and the optimistic outlook for 2017. Shares in oil super-majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil were suffering, however, with prices down 0.6 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively. Currency The increasingly unpredictable French presidential election race unnerved European financial markets on Tuesday, tipping the euro towards its biggest fall this year and driving investors away from French government bonds. The premium investors demand for buying French 10-year government bonds over German 10-year bonds rose to 78 basis points, the highest level since November 2012 before easing back a bit. It was 50 basis points only two weeks ago. The dollar recovered from earlier losses to register its biggest gain of 2017 against a basket of major currencies, jumping against the offshore Chinese yuan after Beijing’s foreign exchange reserves fell below $3 trillion for the first time in six years.

People Press Releases Home / Headlines / 22-Year-Old MIT Student Makes History as NASA Engineer 22-Year-Old MIT Student Makes History as NASA Engineer By Amanda Rey on February 7, 2017 Tweet Pin It Talk about #BlackGirlMagic! Meet Tiera Guinn, a 22–year-old student from MIT that is making history and carving her path as an innovator in the new generation. Guinn, who is still in school and currently maintains a 5.0 GPA, is already working as a Rocket Structural Design and Analysis Engineer for the Space Launch System that Boeing is building for NASA. Her story will certainly call to mind the story in the recent hit movie Hidden Figures, one that Tiera says inspires her. “You should see a black woman as rocket propulsion engineers, as rocket structural and analysis and design engineers. You should see more women in CEO positions,” she said of wanting to see more diversity in her field, according to Vibe. Since a young age, Tiera has always been a mathematician saying “When [my mom and I] would go to the grocery store, she would get me to clip coupons [and] put it in my coupon organizer,” she described to Alabama news station, WBRC. “By the time we got to the register, I’d have to calculate the exact total, including tax. And I did that since I was six years old.” The brilliant mind is currently designing the “largest and most powerful” rocket in history. “I design components for the rockets themselves and then I analyze them to make sure they’re structurally sound,” she explained to the news station. According to Essence, Guinn has plenty of advice to offer young women who are also chasing their dreams. “You have to look forward to your dream and you can’t let anybody get in the way of it,” she says, “No matter how tough it may be, no matter how many tears you might cry, you have to keep pushing. And you have to understand that nothing comes easy.” Photo Credit: WBRC/Screenshot Related ItemsHidden FiguresNASATiera Guinn Tweet Pin It ← Previous Story New England Patriots Take Home Super Bowl LI Win Next Story → Patriots’ Martellus Bennett Skips White House Trip After Historic Super Bowl Win You may also like... ‘Moonlight,’ ‘Hidden Figures,’ and ‘Fences’ Nab 2017 Oscar Nominations ‘Hidden Figures’ Stars Celebrate Film’s Opening Weekend Success NASA Sending First African-American Astronaut to International Space Station You must be logged in to post a comment Login Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

June 3, 2016 The Canadian Press Published Tuesday, February 7, 2017 10:34AM EST Heroux-Devtek Inc. says it will be cutting 90 employees from its workforce by the end of 2017 because some customers have announced reductions to the production rates for certain aircraft programs. The announcement by the Montreal-area aerospace company (TSX:HRX), which makes landing gear for Boeing, Airbus and other aircraft manufacturers, was included with Heroux-Devtek's third-quarter financial results issued Tuesday. Heroux-Devtek said the job cuts would be throughout its offices and plants but didn't provide any other details. According to regulatory documents filed last year, the company employed about 1,400 people in Canada and the United States. Its head office is in Longueuil, Que., a suburb of Montreal. The company estimated the workforce reduction will result in a $4.8 million expense to be recorded in the company's 2017 fiscal fourth quarter, which ends March 31. In its third quarter ended Dec. 31, Heroux-Devtek had $98.5 million of sales, up from $96.6 million a year earlier. Net income rose to $8.2 million or 23 cents per share, from $7 million or 19 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, Heroux-Devtek earned $6 million or 17 cents per share in the third quarter, down from $7.0 million or 19 cents per share.

Caterpillar Inc and Boeing Co led the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record, while bank shares lifted the S&P 500 Index. Bloomberg’s dollar gauge rose the most in almost two weeks after a Fed official indicated interest rates may rise as soon as March.  Emerging-market assets slipped, gold fluctuated near its highest level since November, and crude fell toward US$52 (RM230.67) a barrel. After Trump spent the first weeks of his tenure in the White House taking swipes at other countries’ trading policies — pushing the dollar to a two-month low — investors are still holding out hope he will turn toward the spending and tax cuts he touted in his campaign. Across the Atlantic, political risk is pressuring the euro after French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen laid out a manifesto that included taking the country out of the common currency. “The dollar will go higher from here,” said Adam Cole, head of global foreign-exchange strategy in London at Royal Bank of Canada. “On balance Trump’s policies are dollar positive and that will win over the rhetoric.” What’s coming up in the markets Trump’s administration returns to court today to defend his executive order banning some Muslim travellers from the US, arguing the president has broad authority to head off threats to the country. In the UK, a report due Friday may show industrial activity moderated. Scotland is taking its protest against Brexit to the next level with lawmakers in Edinburgh voting on whether to trigger the mechanism to leave the European Union. But the vote today can’t stop Britain or even Scotland leaving the EU. Stocks The S&P 500 added 0.3 per cent to 2,298.89 at 9:49am in New York. The Dow topped 20,140 for a fresh intraday high. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.6 per cent, led by a 1.2 per cent gain in the property sector. Banking and oil and gas shares retreated for a second day after BNP Paribas and BP posted profits that missed estimates. Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.5 per cent for a second day of gains. The yen weakened back above 112 per dollar after falling below that level yesterday. The euro dropped 0.7 per cent to US$1.0674. The British pound retreated 0.9 per cent to a two-week low of US$1.2363. Bonds Yields on 10-year Treasuries rose two basis points to 2.42 per cent after the biggest drop in more than two weeks in the previous session. China’s foreign-currency reserves edged just below US$3 trillion in January, falling to the lowest since early 2011 after the yuan capped its steepest annual decline in two decades. Greece’s two-year note yields climbed to 9.52 per cent as a quarrel between the nation’s creditors over its fiscal targets boosted concern it is running out of time to complete yet another review of its bailout programme. Commodities Oil dropped 0.6 per cent to US$52.11 a barrel after falling 1.5 per cent yesterday before US government data forecast to show US crude stockpiles expanded for a fifth week. Statoil ASA said it would make another US$1 billion of cost cuts this year after posting a surprise loss, while BP Plc said it still needs to borrow money to cover spending and dividends at current oil prices. Gold slipped 0.4 per cent after advancing for three straight days to the highest level since November. Futures fell 0.1 per cent to US$1,231.40 an ounce. Nickel dropped from highest in more than three weeks amid uncertainty about Philippine supply. Industrial metals come under pressure in London from the stronger dollar. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Ringgit likely to trade easier vis-à-vis greenback next week Trump tax cut talk, China data spur risk rally Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Wilson - 02/07/17 06:00 AM EST 98   © Getty Images Fifty companies and industry groups shelled out more than $716 million to lobby the federal government and Congress last year, according to data provided to The Hill by the Center for Responsive Politics. The eye-popping total represents nearly a quarter of all federal lobbying dollars in 2016 and a slight increase over 2015, when the 50 biggest spenders doled out $715 million. ADVERTISEMENT The five biggest spenders in lobbying last year, in descending order, were the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Realtors, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the American Hospital Association and the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America. Rounding out the top 10 were the American Medical Association, Boeing, the National Association of Broadcasters, AT&T and Business Roundtable. Influencing the government has become a multibillion-dollar business, with companies and trade associations hiring lobbyists and attorneys to push their agenda and shape policymaking. Anger at lobbyists and special interests was a focal point of the presidential campaign, most famously expressed in President Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington. Trump has signed an executive order seeking to slow down the “revolving door” between administration jobs and the private sector, but few expect the deluge of lobbying to slow down under the new administration. “Everyone across the board believe there’s going to be lots of activity in Washington,” Marc Lampkin, the managing partner of the Washington office at law and lobby firm Brownstein Hyatt -Farber Schreck, told The Hill last month. “Corporate America has been seeking relief from the overreach of the Obama administration, so there will be activity on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue,” added Lampkin, a former aide to former Speaker John BoehnerJohn BoehnerObamas sign with agency for speaking gigs Hispanic Dems want Mexican president to address Congress Lobbying’s top 50: Who’s spending big MORE (R-Ohio). Some of the companies and groups that boosted their lobbying spending last year did so in response to major legislative and regulatory fights. Dow Chemical, which is seeking to merge with DuPont, boosted its advocacy spending by 26 percent, to $13.6 million. Other companies that increased their spending included Prudential Financial, which paid lobbyists $9.4 million in 2016, an 18 percent increase over 2015; AbbVie which spent 39 percent more on lobbying; and T-Mobile, which spent $8,089,900, an increase of 32 percent. Amazon significantly expanded its footprint in Washington last year. The company spent $11.4 million on advocacy, a 20 percent increase. Some of the increases in advocacy spending were driven by the 2016 election. The two groups that spent the most, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors, included all political spending in their lobbying reports, which includes things like campaign advertising. Most entities do not report election activities in their total. The Chamber’s spending totaled close to $104 million, while the Realtors spent almost $65 million. Other companies and business groups dialed back their lobbying spending last year, in part due to the lack of legislative activity on Capitol Hill. The National Association of Manufacturers spent $16.9 million on lobbying in 2015 as it pushed for passage of a sweeping Pacific Rim trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration. With that push stalled last year, the group trimmed its lobbying spending to $8.5 million, a nearly 50 percent drop. One industry expert told The Hill that corporations are cutting back on the amount of dues they’re paying to large trade groups and trade associations, choosing instead to target their spending. Many companies refused to comment about their advocacy on the record. Year-to-year comparisons between the 50 largest lobbying spenders are imprecise, because different companies and groups come off and on the list each year. Twenty-nine of the organizations on the top 50 spenders list for 2015 cut back their lobbying budgets in 2016, while seven companies and trade associations fell off the roster entirely.  The American Petroleum Institute, Qualcomm, America’s Health Insurance Plans and George Soros’s Open Society Policy Center all slashed spending on advocacy in 2016. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which scored a win on a GMO labeling law midway through 2016, reduced its advocacy 44 percent from the year before, spending $4.7 million. But the biggest drops on the list came from CVS Health and General Electric. CVS’s lobbying total plummeted 60 percent, to $6 million, in part because of how the company reported its figures. Last year, CVS only included federal lobbying in its advocacy total. The year prior, the company had included both state and federal lobbying in the total, according to a company spokeswoman.  GE, which was the sixth-biggest lobbying spender during 2015, plunged to No. 53 in 2016.  Meanwhile, AARP, Bayer, T-Mobile, American Airlines, Chevron, AbbVie and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers jumped onto the list — with AbbVie, which ranked 88th in spending in 2015, hitting the No. 50 spot last year. T-Mobile climbed to No. 42 from No. 66 in 2015.   — This post was updated at 10 a.m.   Top 50 Lobbying Spenders of 2016  Client 2016 Spending 2015 Spending 2015 Rank U.S. Chamber of Commerce $103,950,000 $84,730,000 1 National Association of Realtors $64,821,111 $37,788,407 2 Blue Cross Blue Shield $25,006,109 $23,702,049 3 American Hospital Association $20,970,809 $20,687,935 7 Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America $19,730,000 $18,920,000 9 American Medical Association $19,410,000 $21,930,000 4 Boeing $17,020,000 $21,921,000 5 National Association of Broadcasters $16,438,000 $17,400,000 10 AT&T $16,370,000 $16,370,000 13 Business Roundtable $15,700,000 $19,250,000 8 Alphabet $15,430,000 $16,660,000 12 Comcast $14,330,000 $15,680,000 14 Southern Co. $13,900,000 $12,860,000 18 Dow Chemical $13,635,982 $10,820,000 26 Lockheed Martin $13,615,811 $13,954,053 17 NCTA - The Internet and Telephone Assoc. $13,420,000 $14,120,000 16 FedEx $12,541,000 $12,405,835 20 Northrop Grumman $12,050,000 $11,020,000 24 Exxon Mobil $11,840,000 $11,980,000 21 Amazon $11,354,000 $9,435,000 34 CTIA $10,970,000 $10,150,000 29 General Dynamics $10,739,944 $10,259,890 28 Verizon Communications $10,080,000 $11,430,000 23 Altria Group $10,060,000 $9,630,000 32 Amgen $9,860,000 $10,525,000 27 Koch Industries $9,840,000 $10,830,000 25 American Bankers Association $9,831,000 $12,690,000 19 Pfizer $9,750,000 $9,417,650 35 Prudential Financial $9,400,000 $7,962,500 47 Biotechnology Innovation Organization $9,230,000 $8,350,000 42 United Technologies $9,165,000 $11,470,000 22 American Chemistry Council $9,020,000 $10,050,000 30 Royal Dutch Shell $8,990,000 $8,700,000 37 AARP $8,710,000 $7,559,000 54 Microsoft $8,710,000 $8,490,000 39 Facebook $8,692,000 $9,850,000 31 Edison Electric Institute $8,620,000 $8,350,000 42 Oracle $8,620,000 $8,470,000 40 General Motors $8,500,000 $9,120,000 36 National Association of Manufacturers $8,490,014 $16,950,000 11 National Amusements (CBS & Viacom) $8,441,000 $7,980,000 46 T-Mobile $8,089,900 $6,127,000 66 Bayer $7,990,000 $7,730,000 51 Coca-Cola $7,930,000 $8,670,000 38 American Airlines $7,870,000 $6,600,000 61 United Parcel Service $7,767,848 $8,155,856 45 Chevron $7,470,000 $7,200,000 56 Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers $7,452,500 $7,640,000 53 Securities Industry & Financial Market Assoc. $7,400,000 $7,770,000 50 AbbVie $7,260,000 $5,220,000 88 Data provided to The Hill by the Center for Responsive Politics, opensecrets.org   Tags John Boehner, Boehner   View the discussion thread.

And in a matter of weeks, share prices rose 53%. But you would have left a lot of money on the table. Because a simple two-sentence set of instructions would have turned that same 53% gain into a stunning 296% gain in the exact same amount of time. Click here to find out how. For Bigger Defense Stock Profits, Think Small By John Persinos on February 7, 2017 Just login with your email address to instantly generate a PDF of this content. Privacy Policy One of the most reliable and proven ways to build wealth over the long haul is to place investment capital in high-momentum trends. President Trump has promised to massively increase military spending and to also pursue a more assertive foreign policy. That adds up to filled coffers for America’s aerospace/defense firms. But here’s an angle that many traders are ignoring: look beyond the usual mega-cap suspects and consider little-known, small-cap defense stocks. Below, I highlight a small defense stock that’s poised for outsized growth and trades at an appealing valuation. Linda McDonough, chief investment strategist of Profit Catalyst Alert, explains that if you want to really cash in on the coming defense boom, you need to think small. “Thanks to the monstrous size of many military budgets, most defense stocks are mega-caps — Goliaths so large they grow slowly. Yet small growth defense stocks exist.” Blue skies ahead for defense… Linda notes that defense spending “catapults upward in times of strife, settles into the trenches for brief periods of peace and then jets forward again as conflicts resume.” Jim Pearce, chief investment strategist of Personal Finance, remarks that the transfer of power in Washington, DC always entails economic winners and losers. This time around, he says, defense contractors are among the biggest winners: “Re-engineering how money flows among nations and between economic sectors has enormous consequences, something Trump intuitively understands, which is why trade reform is at the top of his agenda. Corporate CEOs also understand the ramifications of their industries getting pushed up (or down) the priority list… One sector that probably won’t have to lobby for more dollars is the defense industry.” But with large-cap stocks trading at frothy valuations in early 2017, small is a smart way to go. Smaller defense firms also confer another advantage: they’re tempting takeover targets for deep-pocketed blue chips looking to acquire and integrate new proprietary technologies that can foster organic innovation. Our technology experts at Breakthrough Tech Profits call this process “innogration” and they make it their mission to spot likely takeover targets that will richly reward investors when bigger companies show up as M&A suitors. Jim Fink, chief investment strategist of Options For Income and Velocity Trader, hammers home the case: “Small-capitalization stocks outperform all other types of stocks over the long term.” The Pentagon’s funding trough… Before we get to our small defense stock, let’s look at the big picture. While Congress fights bitter ideological battles over programs with relatively small funding, the Pentagon continues to enjoy enormous largess. Don’t let anyone try to tell you that the U.S. military is lacking for funds. The U.S. military’s fiscal year 2016 budget reached $534.3 billion, an increase of $38.2 billion over the FY 2015 enacted budget of $496.1 billion. For fiscal 2017, the military budget should come in at about $582.70, a roughly 9% year-over-year increase. You can leverage this permanent and growing pool money for multi-year profits. However, investors looking to make money in the aerospace/defense sector tend to fixate on the familiar names: Boeing (NYSE: BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), and Honeywell International (NYSE: HON), to name a few of the biggest. These are all solid investments, especially Honeywell because of its diversification and significant work in the civilian sector. Indeed, Honeywell is a long-time denizen of the PF Growth Portfolio. Since it was added to the portfolio on May 11, 2011, Honeywell has generated a total return of 122.58%. However, these market caps are gigantic and expected boosts in defense spending are pushing up their valuations. For most of them, that means a limited upside. Which brings us to the beauty of small caps. These companies historically outperform the broader market during economic recoveries. U.S. economic growth continues apace (albeit at a modest rate), a context that’s been manna over the past 12 months for smaller valuation companies. The Goldilocks of defense… With a market cap of $1.05 billion, Astronics (NSDQ: ATRO) is large enough to withstand market turmoil but small enough to provide market-beating appreciation. It’s a “Goldilocks” stock that occupies the sweet middle ground. Astronics designs and manufactures products for the aerospace and defense industries around the world. It operates through two divisions, Aerospace and Test Systems. The Aerospace division offers lighting and safety systems, electrical power generation, aircraft structures, avionics products, and other products. The Test Systems division provides automatic test systems, such as communications and weapons test systems, and training and simulation devices to aircraft OEMs. ATRO is a small-cap defense rocket ready to break out with double-digit gains. The company’s earnings growth over the next five years is projected to hit 7.75% on an annualized basis. The aerospace/defense sector has been on a tear lately, but ATRO’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is about 17, compared to 21.4 for Boeing and 20.4 for Lockheed Martin and nearly 19 for the overall sector. If you’re looking for reasonably valued growth in an overbought and risky market, this small cap fits the bill. Meanwhile, we’ll keep an eye on Astronics and let you know if it becomes a takeover target. The yellow metal is showing its mettle… I got this worried email yesterday from a reader: “I was reading your article, ‘Global Domino Effect: Are You Ready?’ published on Feb. 6. It’s a bit of a scary read, by the way. You recommend that investors hedge at least 5%-10% of their portfolios in gold. Would you consider GLD or GLDW to be good hedges that fit your thoughts? I’m a beginning investor and not in much gold right now and I’m trying to park some money in that area.” — Jason E. Jason, it’s never my intention to scare readers. In fact, I disdain the fear-mongers in our business. By the same token, it’s unwise to bury our heads in the sand when genuine risks emerge. A safe gold hedge suitable for novice investors is the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD), the largest gold exchange-traded fund backed by physical holdings of bullion. I’ve recommended this fund in recent issues. A sibling and somewhat riskier fund, SPDR Long Dollar Gold Trust (NYSE: GLDW), made its market debut on January 30. GLDW is the first physically backed gold ETF with a currency hedge against a strong U.S. dollar. GLDW gains when gold prices spike and the value of the dollar increases. (Historically, a strengthening greenback weighs on gold prices.) I’ve also recommended the high-quality gold miner Goldcorp (NYE: GG). Canada-based Goldcorp is on course for production growth and boasts extremely low operating costs, a combination that should boost profits as the price of gold rises this year as analysts expect.

When this same pattern appeared before, it generated fast gains of… 35% on the S&P 500 Index 100% on Yahoo! 117% on American Express 122% on American International Group 163% on Apple …all in a single month! That’s because every time these patterns occur, they send out signals that allow you to pinpoint stock movements like this one from Twitter—BEFORE they happen: And when you combine that advance knowledge with my easy-to-execute trading system, it gives you the stunning ability to amplify normal stock movements as much as 10X. For example, if you had known about this movement and bought Twitter stock, you could have risked $1,000 and cashed out just a few days later with $1,120. That’s not bad. But if, instead, you had used my powerful trading system and invested the same $1,000, you could have cashed out with a stunning $4,170. And now, my system has just pinpointed three brand-new opportunities. I’ll be releasing a new set of two-sentence instructions based on these lucrative patterns in just a few days… and each one could hand you the opportunity to bank triple-digit gains in a very short amount of time.

That photo underscored the importance of the agreement and our trade with Mexico and Canada. Washington is the most trade-dependent state in the nation. The Puget Sound Business Journal reported in November that Washington has exported at least $134.5 billion worth of goods to Canada and Mexico since the agreement was signed. The dust-up over NAFTA focuses on Mexico, from which we import more than we export. PSBJ figures Washington has 150,000 jobs that depend directly on trade with Mexico, which happens to be the world’s sixth-largest exporter of aerospace parts to companies such as Boeing. NAFTA, negotiated under President George H.W. Bush and implemented by Clinton, eliminated most tariffs on traded goods between Canada, the United States and Mexico. It was designed to encourage economic integration among the three countries and thereby boost the economic prosperity of all three. In large part, it has accomplished those goals. The Council on Foreign Relations reports that trade between the three countries increased from $290 billion in 1993 to over $1 trillion in 2016. Such states as Washington and Texas, the nation’s largest exporter, have benefited. Texas has more than a million jobs relying on exports, and Mexico accounts for roughly 37 percent of that total. Whereas Washington’s exports to Mexico are heavy to agriculture, Texas sends mostly electronics, oil, gas and chemicals, and machinery south of the border. The Business Insider recently reported NAFTA has been credited with helping the U.S. auto sector become globally competitive due to cross-border supply chains. Midwestern autoworkers don’t see it that way. They blame carmakers for abandoning plants and workers in such states as Michigan and moving those factories and jobs to Mexico and China. The frustration over trade agreements hit the boiling point during last year’s presidential campaign. Socialist-leaning Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and now-President Donald Trump lambasted trade deals for killing American jobs and allowing companies to move to nations with lower wages and benefits — and weaker worker protections and environmental regulations. Trump called NAFTA “the worst trade deal in the history of the country” and confirmed his intent to renegotiate it since becoming president. That’s where he needs to exercise caution. Trade agreements take years to negotiate and are carefully balanced. Scrapping NAFTA and imposing tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods would likely trigger counter-tariffs imposed on U.S. products. The same goes for other international trade agreements. While critics blame NAFTA for the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, decline in manufacturing employment started over 40 years ago as robots and automation replaced assembly-line workers. However, it took a nose dive between 2000 and 2009, according to U.S. Labor Dept. statistics, and has rebounded slowly since. Roughly, 6 million U.S. factory workers lost their jobs in that nine-year period. NAFTA has benefited agriculture, which is particularly good news for Washington farmers, ranchers and tree-fruit growers. According to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, agriculture exports to Mexico have doubled — and increased by 44 percent to Canada since 1993. It is always good to take a look at existing trade agreements, especially in our rapidly changing world. Modifying them should be carefully planned and negotiated with our trading partners, not hastily imposed by administration fiat. Trade is a two-way street, and no country gets all it wants. Hopefully, there is a better deal for American workers by opening up NAFTA. President Trump just needs to be more measured in his rhetoric and methodical in our national approach.

NASA anticipates the airlock will launch on a commercial resupply mission for integration in 2019, and will be located on a port in the space station's Tranquility module. Image courtesy NanoRacks. The International Space Station allows NASA to conduct cutting-edge research and technology demonstrations for the next giant leap in human exploration and supports an emerging space economy in low-Earth orbit. Deployment of CubeSats and other small satellite payloads from the orbiting laboratory by commercial customers and NASA has increased in recent years. To support demand, NASA has accepted a proposal from NanoRacks to develop the first commercially funded airlock on the space station. "We want to utilize the space station to expose the commercial sector to new and novel uses of space, ultimately creating a new economy in low-Earth orbit for scientific research, technology development and human and cargo transportation," said Sam Scimemi, director, ISS Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. "We hope this new airlock will allow a diverse community to experiment and develop opportunities in space for the commercial sector." In addition to the large number of CubeSats and small satellites NanoRacks wants to deploy from station, their proposed airlock will also be capable of supporting multiple external payloads. Signaling a significant step forward in their airlock plans, NanoRacks announced an independent partnership with Boeing on Feb. 6, 2017, to develop the airlock. Once NanoRacks successfully completes the phases outlined in a Space Act Agreement NanoRacks signed with NASA in 2016, the agency has committed to install the airlock for commercial use, research, and technology demonstrations from the International Space Station. Payloads, including commercial payloads, deployed via the airlock will be coordinated through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), NASA's manager of the U.S. National Laboratory on the space station. All non-NASA funded payloads for the U.S. National Lab are subject to the vetting process CASIS has established. NASA anticipates the airlock will launch on a commercial resupply mission for integration in 2019, and will be located on a port in the space station's Tranquility module. Attached to a separate port on Tranquility is another commercial investment - the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM). This module is the first human-rated expandable habitat to be tested in space and has potential application for future habitation in low-Earth orbit and deep space. The NanoRacks Airlock and BEAM are two examples of NASA's larger efforts to maximize use of the space station and advance commercial activity in space. NASA also issued a request for information last fall seeking additional interest on the part of private enterprises to use available unique space station resources, such as docking ports. As private sector partners play a greater role in this new economy, NASA is able to focus on its deep space exploration goals, including sending humans beyond the moon and eventually, to Mars.

(Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) President Trump and his team abhor institutions they cannot muzzle. “The words ‘so-called judge’ stand out. Those words should never be uttered by an elected official, much less a president, about a sitting judge.” Conservatives go silent when it is the GOP “picking winners and losers.” A border tax makes one company very rich: “A major airline company currently engaged in business with Iran, the leading state sponsor of terrorism, stands to receive billions in tax breaks under a new plan being floated by a large coalition of Republican lawmakers. A new tax plan spearheaded by House Republicans includes a provision that would remove government fees on exports, meaning that Boeing—which is locked in a multi-billion dollar deal to sell the Islamic Republic planes—could receive $56.7 billion in tax breaks from the U.S. taxpayer.” A gag order on the White House might improve its chances in court. Jack Goldsmith: “I’m starting to believe that either Donald Trump wants courts to strike down the Immigration Executive order, or that his White House Counsel is incompetent or ineffectual.” Read the whole thing. Trump’s bombast hasn’t stifled one critical group of pols. “Over a dozen state attorneys general have filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Washington state’s lawsuit against President Trump’s temporary travel ban. The brief outlined the immigration order’s impact on residents, economies and educational and medical institutions across the country.” Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee (D) won’t be muffled. “Inslee suggested multiple ways in which Democratic governors can resist Trump. Governors can amplify the argument that the GOP plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act could result in untold numbers of their constituents getting thrown off of Medicaid, if the GOP replacement block-grants the program to the states, making cuts to Medicaid funds over time more likely. Inslee said Dem governors are in the process of forming a ‘subterranean alliance with Republican governors who are now notifying Congress that cutting their funds is unacceptable.'” Religious Americans shouldn’t remain mute when self-appointed evangelical conservative leaders advocate discrimination against LGBT Americans. “There is near consensus among religious groups on the issue of religiously based service refusals. Roughly six in ten (61 percent) Americans oppose allowing a small business owner in their state to refuse to provide products or services to gay or lesbian people, if doing so violates their religious beliefs. That includes not only large majorities of groups who strongly support same-sex marriage, including Unitarian/Universalists (87 percent), Buddhists (76 percent), and Jewish Americans (72 percent), but also majorities of even major religious groups who are divided over or opposed to same-sex marriage.” One way to snuff out fake news is to refuse to air it. “CNN declined to have [Kellyanne Conway] as a guest on Sunday — in part because the Trump administration offered her in lieu of Vice President Mike Pence, but also because of what the network told me were ‘serious questions about her credibility.’” Good for them. Others should follow suit. opinions right-turn Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

By 2019, the ageing ISS will have an airlock built by NanoRacks attached to its Tranquillity module. ADVERTISEMENT The space agency says the airlock will be able to support "multiple" external payloads. “We hope [it] will allow a diverse community to experiment and develop opportunities in space for the commercial sector," Nasa's Sam Scimem, the director of the ISS division said in a statement. As well as creating the airlock with Boeing, NanoRocks says it wants to launch cube satellites and other small satellites from the ISS. READ NEXT Tim Peake is heading back to the International Space Station Tim Peake is heading back to the International Space Station By Matt Burgess At first glance, a new airlock for the station may not appear a significant improvement, however, it signals Nasa's intentions to involve more commercial, privately funded space missions to use the ISS. Nasa / NanoRacks "We want to utilise the station to expose the commercial sector to new and novel uses of space, ultimately creating a new economy in low-Earth orbit for scientific research, technology development and human and cargo transportation," Scimem continued.

The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (Cots) programme from Nasa has been running since 2005 and, at the time, $500m (£401m) was allocated to encourage private firms to develop transport systems. The space agency also has grander plans for private space firms: "The Commercial Crew and Cargo Program Office (C3PO) will extend human presence in space by enabling an expanding and robust U.S. commercial space transportation industry." ADVERTISEMENT Subscribe to WIRED Last year, one of the biggest commercial projects on the ISS was completed. The Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (Beam), a blow-up room on the space station, was inflated. During seven hours of operations on May 28 the capsule was inflated and astronauts were able to go inside. Beam is designed to "greatly increase the amount of transport volume" for space missions and provide astronauts with more space. Beam was delivered to the ISS as part of a SpaceX delivery mission.

But what tricks can you use to actually turn that resolution into reality? Borrowers are finding it slightly more difficult to pay some bills, according to the most recent results from the American Bankers Association’s Consumer Credit Delinquency Bulletin. Delinquencies for the third quarter rose in five categories: payments for auto loans made at dealerships, auto loans arranged at a bank, personal loans, property improvement loans and bill payments for credit cards provided by a bank. In six other categories, including home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, delinquencies fell or stayed the same. Late payments in general are still at historic lows. Anything can throw you off course. About 22 percent of consumers said they did not pay all bills on time, according to the 2016 Consumer Financial Literacy Survey prepared for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Boeing Employees Credit Union. If you want to build or maintain a strong credit score, you’ve got an extra incentive to pay bills on time. Credit payment history accounts for 35 percent of a credit score, as calculated by FICO. What are some strategies for juggling the bills? 1. See if you can create your own due date to pay the bills. Some utilities let consumers set their own due dates. Get paid on the 15th? Maybe you don’t want a bill due on the first of the month. “We understand juggling multiple bills and payment dates throughout the month can make a managing a budget challenging,” said Stephanie R. Beres, manager for media relations for DTE Energy in Detroit. The “Flexible Due Date” — where you can opt for a shift one time a year — allows customers to chose a monthly due date between 1 and 28. Due dates can be changed for many types of bills — including car loans and leases, credit cards and student loans — said Andrew Johnson, communications manager for GreenPath Financial Wellness. Check with creditors. 2. If you have a student loan, opt for a payment plan that you can afford. We’ve been hearing buzz about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taking legal action against the giant loan servicing company Navient. Among other things, federal regulators charge that Navient, formerly part of Sallie Mae, allegedly encouraged its employees to drive student loan borrowers into forbearance plans, instead of helping them sign up for repayment options based on one’s limited income. Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuits, it’s important for those struggling with high student loan payments to know the differences between a forbearance and an income-based repayment plan when they’re looking for debt relief. Forbearance plans can enable you to halt your payments for a time, but the interest keeps on building, causing your debt to mount and even possibly dragging out an ultimate default. So forbearance should be a last resort, not a first option. When it comes to paying the bills, students should adopt a strategy to pay as much as possible toward their student loans as soon as possible and shop for the right income-driven repayment plan for their finances. “Students have a tendency to choose the payment plan with the lowest monthly payment,” said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of strategy for Cappex.com. “But these plans reduce the monthly payment by increasing the term of the loan, which ultimately increases the total interest paid over the life of the loan.” 3. Is there an app — or scam — for that? Financial tools are being created all the time that can help consumers do a better job budgeting their money and paying bills. But don’t lose even more money by falling for a bill-paying scam. The Federal Trade Commission is warning that some scammers are promoting a “government program that will pay your bills for an up-front payment or processing fee.” Sana Chriss, an attorney for the FTC in the southeast region, said church members in the African-American community in the South have been pitched by friends or other church members to sign up online for a special way for the government to pay their utility, cable and other bills. It’s a phony pitch. A consumer then provides Social Security numbers, credit card numbers and debit card numbers. And then they hand over “hundreds of dollars” for processing. An online account is set up that makes it look initially like the bills are being paid. But no one is paying any of the bills. So the consumer ends up with late fees and possibly a damaged credit score. The consumer loses the money paid for fees and they’ve given away key ID information to scammers who can sell or use that information for ID-related fraud. Regulators are concerned that similar pitches could evolve elsewhere in the country, too. 4. What are some other good tips? Get a visual. Put the dollar amount of a mortgage or other bill due on the calendar each month. Look into auto-pay where money is automatically moved to an account used for bill payment or sent directly to the creditors, prior to the due date. Avoid late payments. 5. What if you really can’t pay the bills? If you’re really having trouble paying bills, seek help from a nonprofit counselor. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling can connect consumers to certified counselors at member agencies. Call 800-388-2227 or go to www.nfcc.org. Services include bankruptcy counseling, debt counseling, student loan debt counseling, housing counseling and debt management plans.

IMAGE: TAL Manufacturing Solutions, an arm of Tata Motors, had showcased the Brabo at the Make in India Summit last year. Photograph: Krishnendu Halder/Reuters. Tata Motors arm TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd had showcased its indigenously made affordable industrial robot the Brabo at the Make in India Summit last year.  Betting on this new product, for which the company estimates sufficient traction among small and medium businesses, TAL expects the robotics vertical to contribute almost 40 per cent of its overall revenues in the next five years, from a marginal share at present.  Amit Bhingurde, TAL's chief operations officer-robotics, told Business Standard they have already sold around 30 robots after they went to market in October 2016. Of these, only four-five were sold to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the rest being sold to small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  TAL currently draws around 70 per cent of its revenues from the aerospace vertical where it is a supplier (tier-I and tier-II) to big names such as Boeing, Airbus and Rolls Royce.  The manufacturing solutions vertical accounts for most of the remaining revenues as the robotics vertical is still in a nascent stage.  But Bhingurde is confident that with a lead pipeline of more than 400 Brabos, and plans to focus on exports, the robotics vertical is likely to grow to a 40 per cent share of overall revenue within the next five years.  'Thrust on technology crucial for Make in India' IMAGE: The Brabo costs between ₹4.75 lakh and ₹6.5 lakh, and the cost is recovered within 15-18 months of commissioning the robot. Photograph: Courtesy TAL.co.in. The Brabo, which can be useful in materials handling, cementing applications, assembly operations etc., has been popular amongst SME customers, because of its affordability.  It costs between ₹4.75 lakh and ₹6.5 lakh, and Bhingurde claims the cost is recovered within 15-18 months of commissioning the robot.  The job that an operator takes seven days to complete is done by a Brabo in 2.3 days, thus significantly reducing the turnaround time.  TAL's team is now working on developing additional features for the robot, including welding, soldering, riveting actions etc.  "With the growing shortage of skilled manpower, ever-increasing wages, IR issues with existing labour unions and changes in regulatory framework, there is a strong case for adopting automation in the industry," TAL said on its website.  Bhingurde said according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), the demand for industrial robots in India (the category the Brabo operates in), is around 6,000 units per annum.  TAL has a manufacturing capacity of 3,000 robots in a year, which can be readily expanded up to 10,000 robots a year based on demand.  Bhingurde, however, feels they are expanding the market by tapping SME customers. "Nearly, 80 per cent of robots made in India were till date going to OEMs. But, the SMEs represent a huge untapped market," he said.  TAL has already exported one unit each of the Brabo to Dubai and Italy and is now working on getting additional international certifications that would enable it to tap more regulated markets such as the US in the long run.  For now, India is definitely the focus market.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here NEW DELHI: In a blow to Air India, 24 co-pilots of its "turnaround vehicle", the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, sought no objection certificate (NOC) to quit the airline over alleged lack of career progression on Monday. Air India had ordered 27 Dreamliners in 2005 and has so far got 23 of these fuel-efficient planes which are now its workhorses. The airline has about 300 pilots for these planes. The 24 pilots who have sought NOC had joined erstwhile Indian Airlines in 2007-08 and used to fly the Airbus A-320s. In 2012 when AI was getting ready to receive the Dreamliners, they were put on training to fly this plane. Their grouse emerges from the fact that people who joined the airline after them as co-pilots are becoming commanders on the A-320 while they remain co-pilots on the Boeing-787.

The route adds 200 miles to the record Emirates established last year by virtue of Doha’s location further west than Dubai. Singapore Airlines Ltd.’s planned resumption of direct flights from its home hub to New York in 2018 would comfortably beat both services, with a distance of more than 9,500 miles. Qatar Air will serve Auckland daily using 259-seat  Boeing Co. 777-200LR aircraft, with the flight taking about 17 1/2 hours. While demand will come chiefly from Europe, the carrier also expects to attract passengers from the U.S. East Coast, even with the long journey time, Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said at a press briefing after the first service touched down. Across the region, Qatar Air also serves Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth in Australia, with seat occupancy rates typically running above 85 percent, and plans to add flights to Canberra next February. Al Baker said it’s open to cooperation with a local carrier for onward flights from Auckland following the termination of an existing arrangement with Air New Zealand Ltd. Qantas Airways Ltd., Australia’s biggest airline, plans to start direct flights between Perth in Western Australia and London in March 2018 using a Boeing 787. That trip spans 9,009 miles, according to the Great Circle Mapper website. READ NEXT: This Scientific Breakthrough Could Cure Jet Lag Forever Direct flights from northwest Europe to the southeast of Australia remain beyond the range of the most modern jets with a full passenger load, though they may be possible in a few years with Boeing’s upgraded 777X series. Even then, Europe-Auckland is likely to remain too much of a stretch. There’s some confusion regarding the longest-flight title following Air India Ltd.’s switch to a trans-Pacific route between Delhi and San Francisco in order to avoid trans-Atlantic headwinds and reduce travel times. While the service spans more than 9,000 miles, the cities are actually only 7,706 miles apart -- more than 1,300 miles closer than Doha and Auckland. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200 General Electric Company (GE) Stock Isn’t Worth the 3.2% Yield Should Under Armour Inc (UAA) CEO Kevin Plank Step Aside? Recent Posts: Should Bill Gates Sell His Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock? Should Under Armour Inc (UAA) CEO Kevin Plank Step Aside? Here’s How Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Can Hit $200 View All Posts Over the years, Baby Boomers across the country have flocked to General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) and GE stock because of its consistent dividend. In fact, a 2015 report from TD Ameritrade showed that GE stock had the second-highest ownership of any stock among its clients 50 or older. Only Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a higher allocation. Source: Shutterstock It seems boomers — and every other age group, for that matter — love the fact that GE has increased its annual dividend in eight out of the last 10 years. Now paying 96 cents on an annual basis for a 3.2% yield, it’s awfully tempting to remain invested in one of America’s oldest and most iconic companies. Jeffrey Immelt has remade the company, moving it out of financials and further into industrials where it got its start. It’s a blue-chip stock if there ever was one, producing a positive annual total return in four out of the last five years. InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto wrote about GE stock recently: I’ve made this argument before, but it really comes down to your end goal. If you’re looking for a hot growth stock, look elsewhere, please! If you want to bide your time and not rock your portfolio with risk, GE stock is a prudent choice. Amen to that. But, that’s not the same thing as saying GE’s 3.2% yield is the reason you should own its stock. I believe you can do better without sacrificing income or capital appreciation. A Better Choice Than GE Stock The stock that comes to mind is Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), which has a dividend yield of nearly 3.5%, almost 30 basis points higher than GE. Over the past five years, Boeing has generated an annual total return of 19.1% through January 31, 650 basis points clear of General Electric. Year to date, it’s up 5%, which is 11 percentage points higher than GE. How does it look if we take out the best and worst years between 2012 and 2016? GE stock actually comes out on top, with an average annual total return of 17.5%, or 760 basis points higher than Boeing. The big difference was 2013, when BA stock almost doubled due to investors recognizing the overall strength in its commercial jets business, as well as the improving profits in its defense business. Fast forward to 2016 and Boeing’s business has remained strong.

For the first of two looks at what’s at stake, we are joined first by Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson from Seattle. It was his suit that led to this weekend’s temporary shutdown of the ban. Attorney General Ferguson, thanks for joining us. BOB FERGUSON, Washington State Attorney General: Thanks for having me on. JOHN YANG: If you — if the court lifts this ban, lifts the temporary restraining order, will you appeal to the Supreme Court? BOB FERGUSON: Well, to be crystal clear, I will use every tool I have to make sure that this unconstitutional executive order doesn’t stand. That said, we’re confident the Ninth Circuit will affirm what Judge Robart, who was appointed, of course, by President George W. Bush, will affirm his decision to grant that TRO. JOHN YANG: I assume you’re anticipating if he does keep it in place that the Justice Department will take it to the Supreme Court. What’s your sense of how your chances would fare on the current court? BOB FERGUSON: Well, I feel very confident. As I mentioned, Judge Robart is a very serious, well-respected judge appointed by President George W. Bush. And he took the significant step of granting a temporary restraining order. There’s a high hurdle for a lawyer to meet in a courtroom to get a judge to grant a TRO, a temporary restraining order. So, given that and the fact the Ninth Circuit declined to give an emergency stay a couple nights ago, we feel confident with our case not just at the Ninth Circuit, but frankly all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, if that’s what it comes down to. JOHN YANG: And all this is right now is just over this temporary restraining order. You would still have to go back for a trial on the merits before Judge Robart in Seattle, is that right? BOB FERGUSON: That’s correct, although we feel confident there, because in order to grant the temporary restraining order, one of the criteria that the judge must conclude is that the state has a high likelihood of prevailing on the merits. He’s already reached that conclusion that we’re likely to prevail once we get to the merits before the judge. JOHN YANG: Now, the Constitution gives the president authority to deal with immigration, to conduct foreign affairs and address immigration. Congress in the immigration law gives the president the power to restrict or suspend the entry of people he may deem appropriate. Why do you argue that this is unconstitutional? BOB FERGUSON: Well, it’s pretty straightforward. Yes, the president has broad authority. We don’t question that. But what the federal government is literally arguing, and that your viewers should be aware of, is they’re arguing that it’s unfettered, that the court cannot look behind any motivation for that order or whether or not it’s constitutional. And that has never been the law and simply cannot be the law. And we are a nation of laws. And nobody can ignore our Constitution. No one’s above the law. And that includes the president of the United States. JOHN YANG: If this executive order had just called for the extreme vetting, as President Trump calls it, and not specified countries, not given preference to Christians — well, it gives preference to religious minorities in these countries, which means Christians and other religions — would that have removed the constitutional objections, in your view? BOB FERGUSON: Well, I’m often asked about different permutations that might solve the significant problem the federal government has. What I can say is, there is pretty significant vetting going on. I just returned from Sea-Tac Airport here in Washington State, where I met individuals who had been denied entry to the country as a result of the president’s executive order, but are now back in. And in one case, he had gone through a through a two-year process to get his visa. He’s now joining his wife, who’s a citizen of this state, and his cousin, who is a graduate of Washington State University and works at Boeing. These are folks who would be great additions to our life in Washington State. And that’s happening all across the country as well. JOHN YANG: So, we’re learning that the judge has asked — the appeals court asked for oral arguments today. Give us a preview. What are you going to be saying before this three-judge panel? BOB FERGUSON: So, you have news that I just am hearing for the first time. So, we’re not surprised if there’s oral argument. We anticipated that would be the case for an issue of this magnitude. And we will make the same case, frankly, that we made before Judge Robart, that there can be no unfettered discretion for a president, that you have to look behind what he’s doing here, and that we find in this case that it violates various constitutional provisions, and also violates specific statutory provisions as well. So we’re confident we will prevail. JOHN YANG: The president has been tweeting about this. He said that this stay, this temporary restraining order, puts our country in such peril, he says. If something happens, blame him, meaning the judge, Judge Robart, and the court system. How do you respond to that? BOB FERGUSON: Well, look, a couple things. Number one, as a lawyer, his comments about the judge being a so-called judge, for example, or statements like that are deeply concerning to anyone who cares about our judiciary. Number two, my wife and I, we are raising our twins, our young twins, to be gracious in victory or defeat. And President Trump is obviously having a very difficult time handling the defeat that he suffered before a federal district court judge. JOHN YANG: What about his underlying argument, though, that this is allowing, this could allow a terrorist to come into the country? BOB FERGUSON: What did I would encourage the president to do is to draft an executive order that’s constitutional. That’s his job. That’s his responsibility. My job and my responsibility is to make sure that everybody, including the president, plays by the rules and follows the Constitution. And in a courtroom, it is not the loudest voice that prevails. It’s the Constitution. And that’s why I think we’re prevailing right now. JOHN YANG: Attorney General Bob Ferguson from Seattle, thank you very much. BOB FERGUSON: Thank you. JOHN YANG: And now for a different take on President Trump’s executive order, Republican Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida joins us from Capitol Hill. Mr. Yoho, thanks for being with us. I don’t know. I hope you were able to hear the attorney general from Washington. REP. TED YOHO, R-Fla.: Yes, I was. Yes. JOHN YANG: What do you say to him? He says this violates both the Constitution and immigration law. What do you say to that? REP. TED YOHO: I disagree with that. I think the president — the executive, regardless who it is, has the ability to decide who comes in and doesn’t if it’s a national security risk. And all he’s asking — I have read the executive order — all he’s asking is put a pause on it so that we get the metrics right, so that we can do the background checks correct. I don’t see a problem with that. And he’s got in there where you come back in 30 days, reassess it, 60, 90, and 120 days. This is a pause. This is not a ban, complete ban. It is a pause. And I think anybody that is concerned with national security, and if you look at our Constitution — he kept talking about being Constitution — the Constitution states very clearly that the number one task of our government is to provide for the common defense and protection of this country. And I think, when you look around the world, other areas that have not done this, I think they’re wishing they would have been a little bit more stringent in the examination of people coming in, in the refugee program. You know, look at Belgium, look at Paris, look at Germany. And I think this is a time that we have to do that. And it’s — again, it’s a temporary pause. And people, I think, just need to calm down, let us work through the process. The courts will work this out. But I think it’s also good that it brought to light how we have to fix our immigration policy. So I welcome that, too. JOHN YANG: And the opponents of this are also arguing that — in their court challenge, that this creates — even this ban, this temporary — temporary pause, as you call it, as you say, would create immediate and irreparable injury, in employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel. How do you respond to that? REP. TED YOHO: You know, I think those are talking points that people are throwing out there. There is going to be some inconvenience. But how inconvenient was 9/11? How inconvenient were the attacks in Belgium and Brussels? Those were extreme consequences that came from not vetting people properly. We don’t want to make that mistake. Would you rather make the mistake and err on the side of caution or wait until something happens and then answer to the American people, why you didn’t vet these people properly? JOHN YANG: In the last Congress, you were on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism. Are these countries, the countries that are specified in the executive order, given your experience on that panel, are these the countries you would have chosen? REP. TED YOHO: I think these are good countries to put on there. You look at Syria, you look at Somalia, you look at these other ones, they don’t have the infrastructure or the I.T. to go back and look at somebody’s birth record, their history, their work records. You look at other countries, and we hear, well, Saudi Arabia is not on, and that’s where the 9/11 terrorists came from, or the majority of them. We have sat down with Saudi Arabia, the UAE. In Egypt, they have good technology. They have good I.T. systems where we can do these background checks. In fact, they have beefed that up since then. And so we feel comfortable with there. But look at Syria. It’s a nation ravaged with war that they can’t go back and look at these records, or Somalia. You can’t go in there in a country like that. Then you look at the people that have infiltrated the refugee programs. We know they’re using fake passports. We know countries that are complicit making fake passports. And so let’s get this right. Let’s let people calm down and make sure that we go through the vetting process, and then we will get through this. JOHN YANG: If the courts were to block this for longer or even maybe strike it down, is there a congressional fix for this? REP. TED YOHO: Yes. Sure. It’s going through and doing legislation, passing it in the House and the Senate, and the president will sign it. And these are things that will be stimulated. This is a catalyst that tells us that we should go ahead and get these processes done. So, yes, for sure. JOHN YANG: And let me ask you about President Trump’s tweets. I know you were elected as a member of the Tea Party. You believe in the Constitution and the three branches of government. REP. TED YOHO: Absolutely. JOHN YANG: What do you think of him saying — calling this judge a so-called judge and saying, if something happens, blame him? REP. TED YOHO: Well, you know, Mr. Trump has his own style, his own technique, his own uniqueness. It’s not something I probably would have done, but, again, that’s the way he has evolved to this point in his life. And it’s worked well for him. And I expect you’re going to see more of that. That’s a minor thing compared to what he’s trying to do. He’s putting national security in front, where it needs to be. And we have had such a lapsed process over the last probably 15 years, that it’s time that somebody stands up and does that. And when you do that, when you have the leadership and the strength to do that, people get upset. And it just takes somebody willing to stand up and take the arrows for that. And, again, it’s a pause. It’s not a ban. JOHN YANG: And, also, let me ask, finally. You were very critical of President Obama for his executive orders, for going around Congress. REP. TED YOHO: Sure. JOHN YANG: How is this different? Why is this case different, in your mind? REP. TED YOHO: I think the big thing is, this centers on national security. When you look at what President Obama did with the executive order November 20 of 2014, he was giving a blanket amnesty to five million people that came into this country illegally. Again, you can’t vet that many people properly. And you can’t use a blanket order for that. That’s not discretionary review of those type of individuals. President Trump, on the other side, is standing up on the — erring on the side of caution on a national security basis that I think we all should applaud, that we’re putting the country first and the Constitution of protecting and preserving our freedoms here. So, that’s where I see a difference. And if you look at what President Obama did, right before he got out, he removed wet foot-dry foot on our Cuban Adjustment Act. And nobody said a word about that, but yet he did the same thing, and I applaud him for doing that. JOHN YANG: Representative Ted Yoho, thanks for joining us. REP. TED YOHO: Yes, sir.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) By NAN Contributor News Americas, LOS ANGELES, CA, Tues. Feb. 7, 2017: Late Sunday, some 127 tech companies, including Airbnb, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Netflix, Snap and Uber, filed an impassioned legal  amicus brief in  The United States Court Of Appeals For The Ninth Circuit in Washington, condemning Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration. Here are ten things the companies credit immigrants with in the brief: 1: Immigrants make many of the US’ greatest discoveries, and create some of the country’s most innovative and iconic companies. 2: There is no denying the contributions inclusive immigration policies have made to the American economy. 3: Immigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list, including Apple, Kraft,Ford, General Electric, AT&T, Google, McDonald’s, Boeing, and Disney. Collectively, these companies generate annual revenue of $4.2 trillion and employ millions of Americans. 4: Immigrants are among our leading entrepreneurs, politicians, artists, and philanthropists and 19.1 percent of immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa were entrepreneurs. 5: The experience and energy of people who come to our country to seek a better life for themselves and their children—to pursue the “American Dream”—are woven throughout the social, political, and economic fabric of the United States. 6: The tremendous impact of immigrants on America—and on American business—is not happenstance. People who choose to leave everything that is familiar and journey to an unknown land to make a new life necessarily are endowed with drive, creativity, determination—and just plain guts. The energy they bring to America is a key reason why the American economy has been the greatest engine of prosperity and innovation in history. 7: Immigrants are leading entrepreneurs. The American economy stands apart because, more than any other place on earth, talented people from around the globe want to come here to start their businesses. 8: While accounting for 16 percent of the labor force nationally and 18 percent of business owners, immigrants make up 28 percent of Main Street business owners. These are “the shops and services that are the backbone of neighborhoods around the country. 9: Immigrants also fuel the growth of the economy as a whole. When immigrants enter the labor force, they increase the productive capacity of the economy and raise GDP. Their incomes rise, but so do those of natives. 10: Immigrants do not take jobs away from U.S. citizens—they create them. Thus, immigration “expand[s] the American work-force, and encourage[s] more business start-ups”—ensuring that [b]usinesses ranging from Apple Corporation to apple growers would be able to find the workers they need in America.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 SEARCH Network ViaSat Is Dramatically Expanding Satellite Broadband If the satellite broadband company gets it right, the market for satellite Internet might expand beyond its traditional niche of farms and mountain cabins. by Mike Freeman, The San Diego Union-Tribune / February 6, 2017 0 Twitter/ViaSatInc (TNS) -- About eight years ago, ViaSat Chief Executive Mark Dankberg bet the company he co-founded on satellite broadband, eventually spending $1 billion to transform a technology considered barely better than dial-up into a service that smoothly streams YouTube video. At the time, the space industry didn’t believe ViaSat could build a satellite with more capacity than all the other Internet satellites in orbit combined. And even if it did, there wasn’t enough demand to justify the cost of the satellite and distribution network needed to sell satellite Internet service which, while better, still fell short of cable and many telephone company alternatives. RELATEDHow New Mini-Satellites Could Impact Hurricane ForecastsSatellite Constellations May Challenge the Broadband IndustrySmallSat Revolution: Tiny Satellites Poised to Make Big Contributions to Essential Science Today ViaSat-1, which launched in 2011, is full with 700,000 Internet subscribers. In addition, the satellite powers in-flight Wi-Fi on more than 500 commercial aircraft from JetBlue, American Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin America, delivering video streaming speeds to each seat. ViaSat-1 also provides in-flight Wi-Fi to Air Force One and other government VIP aircraft. The uptake for ViaSat-1 affirmed Dankberg’s belief in satellite broadband. So the company has doubled down, and then some. It plans to launch ViaSat-2 in late March/early April. The satellite will blast off from French Guiana on an Ariane 5 rocket. At around 300 gigabits per second capacity, the new satellite has about twice the bandwidth of ViaSat-1. The added horsepower will enable faster speeds and bulked up monthly data allowances so subscribers can watch more online video. “There are more and more over the top services – DirecTV Now, HBO Now,” said Dankberg in an interview. “There is just an enormous demand for bandwidth.” The new satellite also will expand coverage beyond North America and into Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, parts of South America and over the Atlantic Ocean. ViaSat-2 represents the latest test to Dankberg’s strategy of engineering satellites to maximize speed and economical bandwidth in hopes of mitigating the Achilles heel of satellite Internet – costly ground equipment/installation, data usage caps and latency. “We are not perfect but we are markedly better than (satellite Internet) used to be,” said Dankberg. “With ViaSat-2, we will be a lot better than ViaSat-1.” If ViaSat gets it right, the market for satellite Internet might expand beyond its traditional niche of farms and mountain cabins. “The better we can make our service, the bigger our market,” said Dankberg. “But that doesn’t mean we are going after people who have Google Fiber. What we are trying to do is go after a bigger segment of people who don’t have those speeds.” ViaSat-2 is the second act in ViaSat’s plan to dramatically expand bandwidth in orbit. The third act is being pieced together at a company-owned facility in Arizona, where workers are assembling payloads for ViaSat-3 – a three satellite constellation slated to begin launching in 2019. Each ViaSat-3 satellite will have 1 terabit-per-second maximum capacity – more than triple that of ViaSat-2. When all are in orbit, the company will have near global coverage. Boeing will build the satellites to carry ViaSat-3’s broadband payloads into space. According to ViaSat, the first two ViaSat-3 satellites will have twice the combined capacity of the 400 communications satellites in orbit today Meanwhile, the all-in cost of building, launching and insuring each ViaSat-3 satellite is expected to be the same as the all-in cost of ViaSat-2, or around $625 million. In theory, that should allow ViaSat to deliver more bandwidth to customers at good prices. “I think the pace of innovation has been faster in satellite than in terrestrial communications,” said Michael Crawford, an analyst with B. Riley & Co. ViaSat “has been very disruptive.” Some analysts are skeptical of ViaSat’s broadband ambitions, however. Wilton Fry of RBC Capital Markets wrote in a research report that the company initially believed it could pack 1.5 million subscribers on ViaSat-1. It ended up filling the satellite with just 700,000 subscribers – perhaps signaling that the company had to serve up more bandwidth than expected to subscribers to counter competitive pressure from non-satellite alternatives. Dankberg said the company is “far more concerned with the financial results than the number of customers we have. One of the things that has worked well for us is we have given more bandwidth to fewer people.” ViaSat faces direct competition from Hughes, owned by EchoStar. Hughes launched its second high capacity Jupiter-2 satellite in December, with an estimated throughput of roughly 200 gigabits per second. It will be delivering Internet service months before ViaSat-2 is up and running. Longer term, skeptics contend cable and fiber optic lines eventually will branch out beyond cities and into satellite’s rural stronghold. In addition, the roll-out of 5G cellular will beef up download speeds and capacity on terrestrial wireless networks, providing an alternative to satellite. And there are new competitors such as OneWeb, which in December got a $1 billion investment from Japan’s SoftBank. It proposes a constellation of 900 small, inexpensive low-orbit satellites globally with 10 terabits per second total capacity. They would offer low latency compared with bigger, high orbit satellites such as ViaSat’s. San Diego’s Qualcomm is an investor in OneWeb. “ViaSat faces a triple whammy over the next 15-plus years, the lifetime of a satellite: Fixed-line coverage build-out, mobile technology (7G by 2030?) and low earth orbit satellite systems designed to bring global broadband coverage,” said Fry, the RBC analyst. Dankberg has doubts about the business models, timing and capabilities of some rival solutions. Even so, he thinks there is plenty of demand for bandwidth to go around – not only from households but also from airlines for in-flight Wi-Fi, high-speed connectivity for cruise ships at sea, oil and gas exploration data streaming, border surveillance video monitoring and other government demands. “In 2020 if things go well, we’ll have three or four terabits up there,” he said. “The world market for bandwidth is probably going to be over 1,000 terabits.” At the cavernous Boeing Commercial Satellite Systems factory in El Segundo, everything seems super-sized: Ceilings seven stories from the floor, a 100-ton door guarding a thermal chamber that mimics the extreme temperatures in space, a pool size vibration table to simulate the violent shaking during launch. Even here, ViaSat-2’s size stands out compared with the other satellites under construction. It weighs as much as 4.5 Toyota Camrys. When fully deployed, its solar panels equal the wingspan of a 767 airliner, generating power equivalent to 300 60-watt light bulbs. It contains 23 miles of electrical wiring. ViaSat forbid pictures of the satellite. Four years ago, the company filed a lawsuit against the builder of ViaSat-1, Space Systems Loral of Palo Alto. It charged Loral with copying ViaSat’s patented payload designs and giving them to arch rival Hughes. In 2014, a San Diego jury found in ViaSat’s favor and ordered Loral to pay $283 million in damages. After a federal judge called for a new trial on the damage award, the companies settled for $100 million. ViaSat’s current residential Internet plans start with 12 megabits per second download speeds for $60 a month. For residential subscribers, there are usually data usage caps for satellite Internet hovering in the 10 to 30 gigabits per month range, which can be gobbled up quickly for subscribers who stream Netflix regularly. Still, satellite Internet is winning market share in rural areas, where speeds for wire line DSL can top out at 2 megabits per second, said Llluc Palerm, senior analysts with Northern Sky Research. About 14 million U.S. households are outside the cable/DSL footprint or have slow DSL service, according to industry estimates. ViaSat and Hughes combined have only about 1.7 million subscribers on their current ViaSat-1 and Jupiter-1 satellites. “The market penetration is still tiny compared with the total addressable market,” said Palerm. “ViaSat-2 and Jupiter-2 might be able to support 1 million extra subscribers each. So even after these new launches, there is still more market to cover.” ViaSat hasn’t disclosed details of the Internet plans it will offer with ViaSat-2. But analysts speculate they could start at 25 megabits per second. As for monthly data caps, Dankberg said the company hopes to have enough bandwidth so usage limits won’t be an problem for most subscribers. “We would like to make it where 85 percent or 90 percent of people would never go above them,” he said. One way ViaSat aims to ease the data-cap problem is with flexibility. It has designed ViaSat-2 so some of its bandwidth can be directed where there is peak demand, which usually occurs between 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. “The bandwidth in the evening rolls across the country from East Coast to West Coast as people watch Netflix,” said Crawford, the B. Riley & Co. analyst. “You can move some beams around to where there is demand.” ViaSat is more than an Internet service provider. Its Satellite Services division accounts for just 40 percent of $1.48 billion trailing 12 months revenue as of Sept. 30. The company also has large government/defense communications hardware and services arm, which provides 43 percent of revenue. And it designs airborne antennas and ground equipment for itself and other commercial satellite operators globally. Satellite Internet and defense, however, have been the main drivers of the company’s 52 percent increase in revenue since ViaSat-1 entered orbit in the fall of 2011. There is a pent up appetite in the U.S. for satellite Internet, since existing satellites have been full for more than a year, said Tim Farrar of Telecom Media and Finance Associates. “The purpose of the ViaSat-2 launch is to get back on track where they can add customers and also improve the service to keep pace with the improvements in terrestrial technology,” he said. With the upcoming ViaSat-3 launches, however, it’s less clear if there is a market globally, said Farrar. Some 470 million people worldwide don’t have good Internet access, according to industry estimates. But many of them can’t afford to pay hundreds of dollars for ground equipment and installation, plus a $50-$60 per month subscription fee.. “Maybe they only have $20 a month,” said Farrar. “So a lot of things ViaSat has done in the U.S., it is really unclear whether they can take those lessons and apply them directly to the broadband market in other parts of the world.” The first two ViaSat-3 satellites – aimed at the Americas and Europe/Middle East/Africa – are slated to launch six months apart starting in 2019. These satellites will be able to deliver 100 megabit per second residential Internet service – enough to power 4K video streaming. The third satellite is targeting Asia with an undetermined launch date. ViaSat-3 satellites are expected to have a lower cost per bit than ViaSat-2. That could benefit ViaSat as it figures out how to serve global markets where affordability is key, according to analysts. One example of a potential business model is creating satellite Wi-Fi hotspots in villages. Residents could tap into the hotspots using their smartphones, prepaying for data use in a way similar to prepaid cellular plans, said Dankberg. “You can see in the poorest towns in Mexico, the kids have smartphones,” he said. “They want to do the things that other kids do. The underlying demand is universal. The way you package and fulfill that demand will be different than in other markets. But to me those are more tactical issues than fundamental issues.” ©2017 The San Diego Union-Tribune Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

To speed up the launching of small satellites, Boeing and NanoRacks announced today that they are partnering to build the first commercial airlock for the station, an addition that will triple the number of satellite launches after it's installed in 2019. Currently, there are only two ways of getting from the ISS into space without losing cabin pressure. One is the large crew airlocks that are used by astronauts and the other is a small airlock attached to the Japanese Experimental module, which is used to launch CubeSats and other small payloads. The problem is, the latter can only handle so many satellites per launch cycle. The NanoRacks Airlock Module will be larger and more robust than the current airlock and will be able to handle a larger traffic of satellites and other payloads going outside the station. As the first privately funded commercial airlock, the new module will be built by NanoRacks while Boeing will supply the Passive Common Berthing Mechanism to connect it with one of the US modules. "The installation of NanoRacks' commercial airlock will help us keep up with demand," says Boeing International Space Station program manager Mark Mulqueen. "This is a big step in facilitating commercial business on the ISS."

Quotes in the article Tata Motors Ltd TTM ▲ 38.09 +0.05 +0.13% Ford Motor Co F ▲ 12.51 +0.13 +1.05% General Motors Co GM ▲ 35.17 +0.09 +0.26% Mazda Motor Corp MZDAY ▲ 6.91 +0.08 +1.17% In what it calls a “thought exercise,” industry researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates that most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars -- more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case -- to recoup higher costs incurred under the House Republican-proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. © Ryan Beene and John Lippert   The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. Hurting Neighbors If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of its factory in Sterling Heights, Michigan, to build light-duty pickups there instead of Mexico, and to add medium- and heavy-duty truck output at the plant, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said.

Credit: REUTERS/Mike Theiler More like this Key tech companies oppose Trump immigration order in court Tech companies come out swinging against immigration ban Trump’s travel ban is a war on tech Video Smart Cities: Montreal The 97 tech firms who have joined forces to oppose President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration say they are looking to protect their employees as well as their business interests. "The order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world's best employees," the court brief reads. "It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States." The list of firms who signed onto the friend-of-the-court brief includes Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, GitHub, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter and Yelp. The move comes in response to the executive order signed on Jan. 27 that temporarily bars citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, as well as all refugees, from entering the United States. The Trump administration has said the ban is only temporary and was designed to protect the nation from terrorist attacks. It has been placed on hold while lawsuits against it work their way through several courts. The 97 companies contend that it would be bad for business. "Immigrants are among our leading entrepreneurs, politicians, artists, and philanthropists," the companies said. "Immigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list, including Apple, Kraft, Ford, General Electric, AT&T, Google, McDonald's, Boeing, and Disney. ...Collectively, these companies generate annual revenue of $4.2 trillion, and employ millions of Americans." The move echoes protests that have erupted around the world about the ban. On Friday, James L. Robart, a U.S. federal judge who presides in Washington state, halted Trump's immigration ban by granting a temporary restraining order against it. That ruling has been appealed by the Trump administration. After Robart temporarily blocked the travel ban, Trump took to Twitter to complain about the move and to disparage the judge. "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!," the president tweeted just hours after Robart made his ruling. Industry analysts say the companies could face similar criticism from Trump, but likely feel the need to defend themselves and their employees. "There could also be backlash if they did not participate, especially if a large number of other companies did," said Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research. "I think this was a principled stand, but it is also a sound business move. All the populations these companies deal with are diverse - employees, prospective employees, customers, and partners. The U.S. being, and being seen as, hostile to refugees, immigrants, and people from other countries would impede their businesses." Judith Hurwitz, an analyst with Hurwitz & Associates, said many companies, particularly international businesses, may be feeling the strain of what the immigration ban could mean to them. "One of the consequences is that companies may decide not to locate their companies in the United States because they are afraid that they will not be able to hire the right people they need," she said. "Technology companies often have unique personnel requirements and have to be able to find the right people no matter where they live. These employees need visas and green cards." While Gottheil isn't sure how much effect the brief will have, he did say it could help sway public opinion.

His name is Rob Taylor, not Rob Convey. A corrected version of the story is below: Amazon increasingly wants to be its own deliveryman Amazon increasingly looks like it wants to be its own deliveryman By MAE ANDERSON AP Technology Writer NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon isn't content just being the "everything store." Increasingly, it looks like it wants to be its own deliveryman, too. Its Monday announcement of a new air cargo hub in Kentucky is merely Amazon's latest foray into building out its own shipping and logistics unit. If successful, the move could ultimately mean lower costs for Amazon — and possibly faster delivery and low prices for consumers. But it could also pit Amazon against package deliverers like FedEx and UPS. Amazon has long plowed its profits back into its business investments. In order to speed up its delivery, it has invested in opening new distribution centers and leasing fleets of trucks. In May, Amazon leased 40 Boeing jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings and Air Transport Services Group Inc., a fleet it dubbed "Prime Air." The moves comes e-commerce continues to outpace retail sales. Amazon said Thursday the number of items it sold in the fourth quarter rose 24 percent compared with a year ago. Its revenue rose 22 percent to $43.74 billion, slightly missing analyst expectations. Meanwhile, profit rose 36 percent to $749 million, or $1.54 per share, ahead of expectations. NEXT STEP On Monday, Amazon took the next step, announcing plans to build a worldwide air cargo hub at a northern Kentucky airport about 13 miles southwest of Cincinnati. The nearly $1.5 billion investment is expected to create 2,700 jobs. It's an auspicious location, since UPS has a big air hub in Louisville and DHL has an international shipping hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Amazon has long batted down rumors that it plans to start its own package delivery service, saying it's just trying to speed up deliveries and lower costs. The company insists it will continue working with the U.S. Post Office, UPS, FedEx and other carriers to deliver packages. "It's not a big surprise," Cathy Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights, said of Amazon's Kentucky announcement. "By utilizing that location they can reach anywhere in the U.S. in two days." E-COMMERCE EXPLOSION If Amazon succeeds in building out its delivery infrastructure, it could ultimately reduce package volume for companies like FedEx and UPS, Roberson said. On the other hand, ecommerce volume is growing so fast there may be room for everyone, she said. For example, UPS reported Monday that 55 percent of its fourth-quarter deliveries — and 63 percent of those in December — were directly to consumers, setting records in both cases. THE RUB It's no sure bet that Amazon will succeed in the highly competitive and complex delivery space. "It's hard to scale up, to have a network as built out and mature as FedEx, UPS or DHL," Roberson said. "Amazon is still not mature." To really go up against that big three, she said, Amazon will have to invest "an awful lot of money in networks and more facilities" — at least double what it's already spending, she estimates. Still, Amazon has a history of developing services for its own use and then offering them to other customers. It built Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, for its own purposes; that service now generates annual revenue of more than $12 billion. "You could see a scenario in the future where they perfected their delivery network and become a carrier for other retailers," said Rob Taylor, CEO of Convey, a company specializing in improving retailer shipment delivery. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Correction: Amazon-Faster Delivery Story " Powerful Quake Kills at Least 6 in Southern Philippines " Residents Say 1st Atom Bomb Test Caused Cancer Cases More Whales Strand in New Zealand, Bringing Total to 650 Minor Earthquake Hits Taiwan, Injuring 4 " Iranian Baby With Heart Defect to Undergo Surgery Soon Nighttime Philippine Quake Kills at Least 4, Injures 126 " Sacrificing California Spillway May Avoid Emergency Releases " The Latest: California Lake Damage May Near $100 Million " New Zealanders Refloat 100 Pilot Whales After 400 Stranded " What's Next in the Legal Battle Over Trump's Immigration Plan " Dylann Roof's Lawyers Look to Have Death Penalty Tossed " Obama Hires Agency for Speaking Gigs, Lawyers for Book Deals

PHOTO: INP RAWALPINDI: An errant pushback tug rammed into a waiting plane at the Benazir Bhutto International Airport on Monday, damaging the aircraft and rendering it unfit for flying. An official of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said that Serene Air flight ER-500 had landed at the airport from Karachi at around 10am. Soon after, a pushback tug which was coming to take the brand-new Boeing 737-800 to the parking bay rammed into the aircraft’s hull. It was still unclear what the cause of the accident was at the time this report was filed. Serene Air jet grounded after accident at Islamabad airport The CAA official added that initial reports suggested that the aircraft was damaged from the front, near its landing gear. He added that the aircraft may not be able to fly until repairs are made. The tug was operated by Royal Airport Services and the shift on duty was reportedly suspended after the accident. CAA Spokesperson Fariha Shah said the authority would hold an inquiry into the accident. She added that the CAA, as a regulator, had a duty to establish the reason of the accident. Meanwhile, a Serene Air spokesperson confirmed the incident and added that its flight schedule would undergo a partial disruption. “A few of the immediate flights have been cancelled due to the incident,” the spokesperson said. “It may take around a week to repair the damaged section of the plane and bring it back into service,” he said. PIA rubbishes reports of technical fault in international flight The aircraft damaged on Monday morning is one of the three aircraft operated by the domestic airline, which started operations on January 29 after the CAA granted it a licence in October 2016. “It [the damaged aircraft] is a brand new Boeing [737-800] which we acquired a few weeks ago at a cost of $50 million,” the Serene Air spokesperson said. The airline official, however, added that the two remaining aircraft are operational. WITH ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM SALMAN SIDDIQUI IN KARACHI Published in The Express Tribune, February 7th, 2017.

The shift has not been suspended and the Tug Operator is an experienced operator and facts that shall be determined by Safety Board of PCAA. The aircraft moved to the parking position on its own power thus making it clear that nothing is wrong with the landing gears. Lastly structural skin is replaceable and will be done In Sh Allah in next few days allowing Serene Air to resume its full operations by aircraft BNA. It is an unfortunate incident that has happened and without results of formal report by PCAA, it is unfair to publish such report.

In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars -- more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles -- to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. Popular Now Supply Chain & Logistics: Top 5 Warehouse Challenges and How to Overcome Them Small Firms Are Better Partners than Holding Companies EPI Report Claims US-China Trade Deficit Cost 3.4 Million Jobs The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. Pure Importers “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo "will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here," the report said. "The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here." Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60% of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82% and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. Hurting Neighbors If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report out last week, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8%, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50%. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said.

Water canon salute to Boeing 787 Dreamliner of Air India at Bangalore International Airport. (TOI File Photo) NEW DELHI: In a blow to Air India, 24 co-pilots of its "turnaround vehicle", the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, sought no objection certificate (NOC) to quit the airline over alleged lack of career progression on Monday. Air India had ordered 27 Dreamliners in 2005 and has so far got 23 of these fuel-efficient planes which are now its workhorses. The airline has about 300 pilots for these planes. The 24 pilots who have sought NOC had joined erstwhile Indian Airlines in 2007-08 and used to fly the Airbus A-320s. In 2012 when AI was getting ready to receive the Dreamliners, they were put on training to fly this plane. Their grouse emerges from the fact that people who joined the airline after them as co-pilots are becoming commanders on the A-320 while they remain co-pilots on the Boeing-787.

By Ryan Beene and John Lippert, Bloomberg News As Washington mulls a tax on imports, an auto industry study suggests the policy would deliver the sharpest blow to Tata Motors Ltd.’s Jaguar Land Rover while giving a leg up to Tesla Inc. and Ford Motor Co. In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars — more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles — to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Mich.-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Walmart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo “will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here,” the report said. “The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here.” Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60 percent of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82 percent and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said.

Malcolm Parry / PNG Share Adjust Comment Print Cavalia Odysseo creator Norman Latourelle welcomed sponsor Jim Pattison to the circus’s premiere in False Creek’s ‘big top’ tent. Malcolm Parry / PNG GIDDY UP: None of the Jim Pattison Group’s 23 auto dealerships offer vehicles powered by only 65 horses. But that’s plenty for the Pattison-sponsored Cavalia Odysseo circus running in False Creek’s “big top” tent to March 5. And a run it is, as 12 breeds of stallion and gelding walk, trot, canter and gallop around the tented and sometimes-flooded ring. Meanwhile, a singer reflects Cavalia founder Normand Latourelle’s sentiments with: “The universe is an illusion, infinite poetry, where dreams in a circle caress the thoughts and the world.” Oddly, the show’s most moving moment has horses and riders lie seemingly asleep together as dawn lightens desert dunes on a huge video backdrop. They’re soon moving again, though, with or without riders being whisked aloft to perform on trapeze-style rings. As for balletics, none top Odysseo’s gymnasts whose serial front-and-back-flips at lightning speed — even in shin-deep water — defy more than gravity. Although those acrobatic performers wear no wacky makeup or metre-long shoes, their risible antics echo circus pioneer Phineas “P.T.” Barnum. Knowing that 19th-century audiences saw horses everywhere around them, he said: “Clowns are the pegs on which the circus is hung.” HOT TO TROT: With ticket demand having already extended Odysseo’s run by two weeks, Jim Pattison could hardly suggest that his old car-salesman inducement system be adapted to sack the least productive horse. Dennis Duckow photographed a free-flight winner about to take off at Abbotsford Airport’s 2016 The Sky’s No Limit — Girls Fly Too event. Dennis Duckow / Double D Photography TAKEOFF TIME: Male gymnasts aren’t the only one to soar high in the air — or beyond it. At Abbotsford International Airport, March 11-12, two-mission U.S. astronaut Heide Stefanyshyn-Piper will tell other women (and men) of her 27 days in space that included five space walks. She’ll appear at the sixth annual The Sky’s No Limit — Girls Fly Too, where 15,000 expected attendees will include some who’ll fly — for free — for the first time. Other women will participate in hands-on and passive aviation displays, including a U.S. Boeing B-52H bomber. Founded by 24-year fixed-wing and helicopter pilot Kirsten Brazier to accompany International Women’s Day, the outreach event (www.girlsfly2.com) aims to have women constitute more than today’s 5.8 per cent of Canada’s professional pilots and 2.3 per cent of aircraft engineers. Dennis Duckow portrayed The Sky’s No Limit — Girls Fly Too founder-pilot Kirsten Brazier beside a vintage Harvard military trainer. Dennis Duckow / Double D Photography Brazier acknowledges the common perception of such jobs being reserved for men. Addressing that in her 2016 book, A Chick In The Cockpit, jet-airliner captain Erika Armstrong noted that “not a lot of women want to be pilots.” For those who do, “You’ll have to attain the pinpoint focus of a Buddhist monk, trade your soul for flight hours … sacrifice everything and anyone around you for your career, but you can be a pilot, too.” Margot Paris, Casey Stainsby and Daryl Fretz framed 2008 city-council hopeful Michael Geller who’ll speak on low-rise-high-density Feb. 15. Malcolm Parry / PNG   DOWN TO EARTH: With highrise links going back to the multi-tower 1990s, Bayshore Gardens scheme, architect, planner, developer and one-time city-council candidate Michael Geller will aim lower Feb. 15. His SFU Harbour Centre lecture on how low- and mid-rise buildings achieve high density in Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, etc. should reflect Geller’s authoritative and entertaining global blog. Jon, Thomas, Heath and Nathan Affolter may hope filmmaking will lead to fame like Warner Bros. studio heads Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack. P Malcolm Parry / PNG NOT SO CRAZY: After renaming themselves, Polish immigrants Harry, Albert and Sam Wonskolaser and Canadian-born brother Jack starred dog Rin Tin Tin in a 1923 film that cemented their Warner Bros studio’s reputation. Vancouver moviemakers Jon, Heath, Nathan and Thomas Affolter may hope Hollywood lightning will strike again. At least their short The Undertaker’s Son is one of six Crazy 8s contest finalists (from 216 applicants) who’ll have eight days to shoot and edit their movies for judging and a gala screening Feb. 25. Several previous contestants now enjoy professional careers, if not fame. Crazy 8s executive director Paul Armstrong greeted screen actress Jacqueline Samuda whose pregnancy saw her transition to voice-over roles. Malcolm Parry / PNG BELLY UP: The British Medical Association insists that expectant mothers be called pregnant people. Screen actors know that either term can mean “unemployed people.” That’s why, with son Griffin Riley due in 2004 and Christian a year later, Jacqueline Samuda began doing well-paid voice-over gigs for animated movies. She then experienced something other pregnant women may. After recording scripted dialogue hours before her first labour, then reviewing it for week-later revisions, “I could certainly hear the breathless element.” Why so? “Having something pressing against your lungs, your bladder and everything else, there’s not a lot of room for breath.” Plenty for a broadened career, though, even for the boys, “who both do voice work, including a recent short (movie) for Pixar.” Sylvie La Riviere and Kimberley Roseblade’s umbrella fencing in 2015 spurred self-defence instruction at Hastings Street’s Academie Duello. Malcolm Parry / PNG EN GARDE: Some swordplay students at Devon Boorman’s Academie Duello can now repel attackers with umbrellas. That’s because David McCormick modified bartitsu stick-fighting at a workshop he’ll repeat Feb 26. Practitioners wield standard bumbershoots, not the ones with concealed sword blades. His technique “is simple, effective, and it will protect you,” McCormick promises. It’s a step-up for the West Hastings Street facility, where some already fence with furled umbrellas instead of swords, but now train to do so in earnest.

Read the full chapter on upholding good governance here. The Trump policy towards Africa will not be clear for several months at least, if we are to judge by the time it has taken past administrations to put their teams in place and articulate their objectives. While it is apparent that the president-elect has had very little contact with the continent, the same was true for Presidents Clinton and Bush. Similarly, President Obama—who later emerged as a champion of African-U.S. private sector investment—did not develop a strategy for the continent until the end of his first term. So, what might lay ahead for Africa? One of the most interesting initiatives to appear in the transition is the formation of Trump’s President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. The purpose of this group is to provide the president with private sector expertise on creating jobs and accelerating economic growth. Author Witney Schneidman Nonresident Fellow - Global Economy and Development, Africa Growth Initiative Twitter WitneySchneid The group is made up of 16 CEOs and, notably, many lead companies that are active in Africa. They include: Blackstone, General Motors, Wal-Mart, Boeing, IBM, Ernst & Young, and GE. The forum’s first meeting is planned for February at the White House. Clearly, the focus of the forum will be on the private sector’s role in rebuilding America’s infrastructure, which Trump announced as a priority on election night. This goal has great relevance and potential for Africa. For instance, one proposal would be to create an economic subcommittee of the forum to look at infrastructure opportunities for American companies in Africa that would utilize American-made components. Enhancing the U.S. role in addressing Africa’s infrastructure deficit with American machinery and other products would increase U.S. exports to the region. In 2015, the export of U.S. goods to Africa was valued at $18 billion, which supports an estimated 121,000 jobs in the U.S., according to the Commerce Department. A strategy that incentivizes American companies in such a way that it increases U.S. exports and jobs to reduce Africa’s infrastructure deficit would contribute to a legacy in Africa for President-elect Trump on par with his predecessors, if not more so. To facilitate its work, an African subcommittee of the forum could coordinate its work with the President’s Advisory Committee on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA), which reports to the president through the secretary of commerce. Over the course of three meetings, the PAC-DBIA has made a number of recommendations related to enhancing the role of the United States in developing Africa’s infrastructure. These recommendations include creating a U.S.-Africa Infrastructure Center and prioritizing U.S. companies and products in building out Africa’s transportation, energy, and health infrastructure. The last three presidents have left positive legacies related to Africa. This includes President Clinton’s signing into law of the African Growth and Opportunity Act; President Bush’s support for the President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief and the Millennium Challenge Corporation; and Power Africa, the Young African Leaders Initiative, and the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit of the Obama administration. A strategy that incentivizes American companies in such a way that it increases U.S. exports and jobs to reduce Africa’s infrastructure deficit would contribute to a legacy in Africa for President-elect Trump on par with his predecessors, if not more so. To make this happen, African leaders should engage the Trump administration actively and with an open mind. They should also endeavor to point out ways in which a substantial infrastructure program could benefit Americans as much it would those on the African continent.

In what it calls a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimates most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of dollars -- more than $17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles -- to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price hike among major automakers, at about $282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co. at $995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, according to Alan Baum, the founder of West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates. Carmakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by phone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo and VW vehicle prices would have to rise by about $7,600 and $6,800 on average, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the U.S. tax code. General Electric Co. and Boeing Co. are among U.S. manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are among the corporate giants warning it will result in costlier products ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. Read more: Ford Seen Reaping Edge Over Toyota With a U.S. Border Tax The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that may be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax may induce automakers to boost U.S. parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, according to the report. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. may also consider expanding existing U.S. operations or building new capacity. Pure Importers “Pure importers” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd., Mazda and Mitsubishi are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their U.S. sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo "will need to ramp up U.S. parts sourcing and/or build plants here," the report said. "The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here." Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting in late 2018. GM, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60 percent of their U.S. vehicle sales domestically, according to the report, with Ford at 82 percent and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California. Hurting Neighbors The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up If auto sales slow, the tax would create an incentive for automakers to keep U.S. plants running at the expense of those in Canada and Mexico. That could encourage Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to accelerate the conversion of factories in Michigan to build pickups there instead of Mexico, said Dan Luria, an economist at the Michigan Manufacturing Technology Center in Ann Arbor and the lead author of the Baum & Associates report. Nissan Motor Co. might export more from Mexico to Latin American markets and less to the U.S. Volkswagen AG could build another U.S. assembly plant. Mazda and Mitsubishi, which rely entirely on imports to the U.S. market, may have to quit the U.S. market or pay other manufacturers to assemble their cars, Luria said. In its current form, the proposed border tax could lead to the production of up to 1 million additional vehicles in the U.S. and 50,000 more jobs at car and part assembly plants, Luria said. In a separate report Wednesday, Colin Langan, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said the proposed border tax could raise average prices in the U.S. by about 8 percent, or $2,500 per vehicle. That’s enough to reduce annual sales by about 2 million vehicles, he said. Langan said he expects a draft bill to be released in late February or early March. He pegged the chances of a border tax being enacted at less than 50 percent. The tax has a good chance of making its way through the House of Representatives but is “very unlikely” to pass in the Senate, Langan said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The maiden flight of the aircraft has been delayed twice since 2014 due to production issues. The twin-engine C919 was unveiled last November at a roll-out ceremony in Shanghai. The plane can carry up to 158 passengers with a range of 4,075 kilometers. A longer range version can fly up to 5,555 kilometers. The narrow-body jet aims to compete with the Boeing 737, and Airbus A320 and is a major symbol of China’s attempt to establish itself as a global supplier of aircraft. China Eastern Airlines has become the launch customer for the plane. COMAC has reportedly received 570 orders for the C919 passenger jet from 23 customers. #China's first domestically-produced large passenger aircraft C919 is expected to take its maiden flight in the first half of 2017 pic.twitter.com/i9IluZXFrT— People's Daily,China (@PDChina) February 6, 2017 China has become a major battleground for Western manufacturers due to growing number of Chinese travelers.

PUBLISHED : Monday, 06 February, 2017, 9:35pm UPDATED : Tuesday, 07 February, 2017, 9:51am Comments:   SCMP staff Share PrintEmail The first Chinese-developed passenger jet, the Comac C919, is Beijing’s answer to the Airbus A320 and Boeing B737 and hopes to break Western planemakers’ domination of the aviation market. China’s marquee passenger jet can carry 175 passengers and has a range of 5,500km, and first rolled off the assembly lines Shanghai in November 2015. Thepaper.cn also reported that the first C919 was delivered to the trial flight centre on Christmas Day in 2016. People’s Daily confirmed on Monday that the C919 was set to make its debut flight in the first half of this year. The project, launched in 2008, despite having suffered repeated delays in its early days, have received 570 orders from 23 customers including Air China, China Southern Airlines, China Eastern and Citic Financial Leasing. According to a report by the Post in 2015, delivery to its first customer, ICBC Leasing, was expected to come after 2018. Comac also said that China might see 6,865 planes delivered by 2035. Although the plane was domestically developed and assembled, 16 foreign companies provided core components. The Post reported that China provided US$482 million in parts for American aircraft manufacturers in 2014. With a maximum range of 5,500km, a New York-based C919 could potentially fly the aircraft to the US West Coast, as far south as Bogota and as far north as Vancouver. China has long wanted to develop its own jets and challenge Boeing and Airbus’ global dominance in the aerospace manufacturing business that is worth trillions of dollars. Industry insiders say it would be a long way before the C919 is seen competing against Western models in international skies, with certification being a key barrier for its export and pilot shortage another.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Trump reaffirms one-China policy in surprise call with Xi 2 John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race 3 Revealed: Malaysia’s ‘new evidence’ in island row against Singapore 4 China’s stock market regulator vows to ‘capture’ more tycoons 5 Hong Kong shivers as city records coldest day this winter Shared 1 Trump reaffirms one-China policy in surprise call with Xi 2 Growing number of foreign firms shutting shop in China 3 Revealed: Malaysia’s ‘new evidence’ in island row against Singapore 4 China to store foreigners’ fingerprints upon entry, starting with Shenzhen 5 John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race Commented 1 Trump reaffirms one-China policy in surprise call with Xi 2 John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race 3 At least 11 injured in blaze as man attempts to ‘throw Molotov cocktail’ on Hong Kong MTR train 4 Revealed: Malaysia’s ‘new evidence’ in island row against Singapore 5 China, US planes come within 305 metres over South China Sea       You may also like Hong Kong John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race 10 Feb 2017 - 10:28am 33 Insomniacs share bedtime routines In partnership with: HKT PREMIER China China to store foreigners’ fingerprints upon entry, starting with Shenzhen 10 Feb 2017 - 8:25am 25 A leap into perfection Sponsored by: Jaeger-LeCoultre China Fire at Chinese factory that supplied Samsung Note 7 batteries 9 Feb 2017 - 10:25am 8 China Does China’s Communist Party follow any succession rules at all? 7 Feb 2017 - 9:21pm 10 Food & Drink Hong Kong store defends selling strawberries individually wrapped 9 Feb 2017 - 10:09am 30 China Why China’s communists struggle with succession planning 6 Feb 2017 - 12:47am 34 Business Amid slowdown, glimmers of hope for Singapore’s economy 6 Feb 2017 - 12:24pm 17 China Ivanka visit ‘shows China wants to forge ties with Trump’ 6 Feb 2017 - 11:35pm 10 Business Luck turns for Vietnam’s gamblers 7 Feb 2017 - 4:23pm Hong Kong Russian’s death-defying video sparks Hong Kong investigation 7 Feb 2017 - 5:45pm 19 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Trump Economic Council Excludes Small Business Leaders, ASBL Reports PETALUMA, Calif., Feb. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Today Donald Trump introduced the members of his economic council with a conspicuous absence of anyone from the small business community. Having stated that he would be the „greatest jobs president God ever created,” and create 25 million new jobs, it’s curious the individuals on his business council are primarily from Fortune 500 firms and large corporations. Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of General Electric, a corporation famous for its aggressive job outsourcing, is on the council as well as 16 other members from corporations such as Walmart, PepsiCo, General Motors, IBM, Boeing, Walt Disney Co. and Tesla Inc. „We’re bringing back jobs” Trump told the press before their first meeting. According to government data 98% of all U.S firms have less than 100 employees and they create 97% of all net new jobs. There are 28 million small businesses in America that are responsible for half of the GDP, half the private sector work force and 90% of U.S exporters. In 2006, a Kauffman foundation study found that 100% of the new jobs since 1988 have come from new businesses which are overwhelmingly small businesses. „If the purpose of the economic council is to try to increase corporate profits by shipping jobs overseas that’s definitely the right group to talk to,” said American Small Business League President Lloyd Chapman. „President Trump has promised to be the greatest Jobs producing president God ever created. Someone needs to show him the U.S Census bureau data that shows small businesses create 97% of all the net new jobs. I haven’t seen one economic policy put forth by the Trump administration that is specifically intended to benefit small businesses, and I don’t expect we will. I’m very disappointed that his economic committee should be 98% percent small business leaders and it’s just the opposite. It’s populated with people from fortune 500 firms and they don’t create jobs small businesses do.”   SOURCE American Small Business League CategoriesUncategorized TagsAdvocacy Group Opinion, Business, Federal Executive Branch & Agency, force, general, private, Small Business Services Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Introducing Echo App Developers: A New Company Ready To Bring Amazon Echo Ideas to Life in 2017 Next PostNext eBusiness Software Leader, Solidify Inc., Releases Latest Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) Version for B2B Manufacturers Search our contacts Search for: Search Recent Posts Operation Food Search to Hold Fourth Purses for Pantries Fundraiser Operation Food Search to Hold Fourth Purses for Pantries Fundraiser Keller Williams Realty Memphis Announces Kiana Lee Keller Williams Realty Memphis Announces Kiana Lee Attendee List Released Ahead of RNA Therapeutics Industry Summit Featuring MHRA, Silence Therapeutics and GSK Business Contacts aBusiness contacts Proudly powered by WordPress

Caterpillar’s moving of its corporate offices to the Chicago area later this year will give the metropolitan area yet another Fortune 500 headquarters. However, when Caterpillar relocates, it will leave just two of Illinois’ 34 Fortune 500 firms with headquarters outside the Chicago area. State Farm Insurance in Bloomington and John Deere in Moline will be the only two Fortune 500 headquarters in Illinois not in the Chicago area once the Caterpillar move is complete. Caterpillar’s announcement Jan. 31 that it is relocating its headquarters is the second time in four years that a Fortune 500 firm has told of plans to head to the big city. In 2013, agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland said it was moving its corporate offices from Decatur to Chicago. The 32 Chicago-area based Fortune 500 companies include Boeing and United Continental Holdings, both in Chicago, Walgreens in Deerfield, and Allstate in Northbrook. Caterpillar’s move should not come as a big surprise, according to a market analyst. “They get to save building a big corporate headquarters and they get a better transportation network,” said Eli Lustgarten, senior vice president for Longbow Research, which provides analysis of companies for investors. Lustgarten, who follows Caterpillar and 15 other firms for Longbow clients, said it is a little out of the ordinary, though, that the construction equipment firm didn’t have a destination point to share when it made the moving announcement. “They may be seeing what kind of deal they can get,” Lustgarten said. “I would suspect if they want better access to (O’Hare) airport they may want to be in the north suburbs. It is about logistics. It remains to be seen how they structure a deal.” Caterpillar said that it would locate some senior executives and support functions to the Chicago area later this year. “Caterpillar’s board of directors has been discussing the benefits of a more accessible, strategic location for some time,” said company CEO Jim Umpleby. “Since 2012, about two-thirds of Caterpillar’s sales and revenues have come from outside the United States. Locating our headquarters closer to a global transportation hub, such as Chicago, means we can meet with our global customers, dealers and employees more easily and frequently.” He added that the new location gives the company an opportunity to add to its team while improving the productivity of senior leaders. Caterpillar senior executives will move into leased office space in the Chicago area later this year. Rachel Potts, corporate media manager for Caterpillar, said a decision on where the company headquarters relocates will not be made until later this year. Despite that, she said, the company wanted to get the word out about the move as soon as possible. “We made a deliberate decision to inform our employees and the Peoria area about the decision soon after it was made, recognizing we are still early in the site-selection process,” Potts said. She noted that the company’s move to the Chicago area will improve access to global customers, dealers and Caterpillar’s worldwide operations, while also enhancing executive recruitment. Lustgarten said because the company will be leasing and not building, its final destination is not as important to know right now. “It’s a lot different than if they were negotiating to build somewhere,” Lustgarten said. “Now, it just depends on what’s available for them to lease.” While the company is saving on building its proposed three-tower office complex in Peoria, it will have to pay Chicago area office rent, Lustgarten said, “and that’s not cheap.” Lustgarten said the Chicago area being a hub for other Fortune 500 headquarters is not a factor in a company like Caterpillar deciding to make such a move. The Caterpillar analyst said the company has been mum so far on just how many people could be moving. “They have not told anybody,” Lustgarten said. “It could be 100 people, up to 300 people. The magnitude will be decided at a later date.” Despite the company’s corporate offices moving to the Chicago area, the company may have a net job loss in the area. That is because 800 jobs at the company’s wheel loader manufacturing plant near Montgomery could be moved to Decatur and North Little Rock, Ark. A decision on that potential move is slated for this spring. Caterpillar said the possible moving of jobs from the Kendall County plant near Montgomery is in keeping with its global restructuring and cost-savings plan announced in 2015. “Faced with lower demand, we continue to evaluate our global manufacturing capacity,” said Denise Johnson, resource industries group president for Caterpillar. The company is considering moving manufacturing from the Montgomery/Aurora site. Large wheel loader manufacturing would be moved to Decatur and medium wheel loader manufacturing would be moved to North Little Rock. Caterpillar would keep an office in the Aurora area for engineering and product support work. “Should we move forward with the decision to relocate production we will support the local leaders to mitigate the impact of our employees, their families and the community,” Johnson said. “We value and respect the significant contributions all employees in Aurora have made in ensuring Caterpillar maintains its unparalleled record of quality and service to our customers and dealer network.” Rich Young, director of community development for Montgomery, said the village’s president and other area leaders will be meeting with Caterpillar officials to try to keep the jobs at the local plant. “It would have a negative impact when you are talking about that number of jobs in the area,” Young said. “It would impact the region, not just the village. It is not something we would want to see. We would like to keep those jobs.” He said because the plant is in unincorporated Kendall County, the village has no tax incentives to offer in keeping the Caterpillar jobs at the facility. He added that because the engineering division will remain it is too early to tell what the overall job loss would be if Caterpillar follows through on the relocation efforts. Young said that Waubonsee Community College is looking to help retrain workers if the company moves forward with its relocation of wheel production jobs.

Of course Welcome to my world of The Unexplained – yes, you're welcome to it More like this Bbc Scotland Bootnotes A non-Standards Soviet approved measure of weight? Sod off, BBC! Our 1,600 KiloJubs beat your 23 Kelpies 6 Feb 2017 at 11:06, Gareth Corfield An eagle-eyed Reg reader has spotted a dastardly BBC attempt to muscle in on the Reg Standards Soviet’s turf – by devising a new and highly unauthorised measure of weight. In an otherwise unremarkable story from last week about construction of the Queensferry Crossing bridge between Edinburgh and Fife being completed, the Beeb noted: “The steel required for the bridge deck weighs a total of 35,000 tonnes - equivalent to almost 200 Boeing 747s.” The corporation’s unnamed writer then went on to say, without elaborating: “The combined steel required for North and South viaducts weighs 7,000 tonnes - enough to make another 23 Kelpies.” So what, exactly, is a Kelpie? “The Kelpies are an art installation not too far from the new bridge,” said Reg reader Mike Bonner, who told us about this horrendous breach of Standards Soviet protocol. “A Kelpie is therefore 304.35 tonnes – more or less,” he added. But what are they, o wise Beeboid? As Mike says, the kelpies that the BBC are talking about are 100ft high steel sculptures fashioned after the carthorses that used to infest the local area. Put together by Glasgow School of Art sculptor Andy Scott, each of the two horse’s heads was designed to weigh 300 tonnes. In Scottish mythology a kelpie is “a shape-changing aquatic spirit” that haunts rivers and takes the form of a horse or a pony. Children are particularly vulnerable to the mythical beasties, which in their equine form cause inquisitive kids to stick to them, so the demonic donkey can drag them into local rivers and drown them. They can also take the form of a beautiful young woman or become a “hairy human” which crushes lone travellers to death in a vice-like grip, the two presumably being separate incarnations. Apparently captive kelpies have the strength of 10 horses, about the same power output as the world’s oldest surviving Rolls-Royce. As for the Beeb’s attempt to claim the Kelpie as a unit of weight? 1,666 KiloJubs say “bugger off”. ® Tips and corrections 47 Comments More from The Register BBC surrenders 'linear' exclusivity to compete with binge-watch Netflix Vows to dump entire series on iPlayer before they air on TV 142 Comments BBC and Snap.

Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and Others Take On Trump's Travel Ban GO 97 companies in total signed to fight against Trump's order Feb 6, 2017 10:21 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Twitter, Uber, and many others - a total of 97 major firms in the US - have decided to join forces to file an amicus brief opposing the Trump travel ban introduced two weeks ago. Ever since the Trump travel ban affecting people from seven predominantly-Muslim countries was introduced two Fridays ago, tech firms have been looking for ways to make things better. They’ve set up funds to donate money to NGOs fighting the ban, they’ve set up funds to help employees who could no longer return to the United States, and they’ve joined lawsuits against the Trump administration. Now, they’ve filed a brief with the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, stating that the companies believe the ban is unlawful, discriminates against people, and is harmful to businesses in the United States. The Washington Post obtained a draft of the filing in which the companies that signed it put the focus on the contribution immigrants have brought to the US economy and the success of business across the United States. “Immigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list, including Apple, Kraft, Ford, General Electric, AT&T, Google, McDonald’s, Boeing, and Disney. Collectively, these companies generate annual revenue of $4.2 trillion, and employ millions of Americans,” the filing reads, adding that between 2006 and 2010 immigrants opened nearly 30% of all new businesses in the country. The letter also fights against the belief that immigrants are taking away jobs from Americans. “Immigrants do not take jobs away from U.S. citizens - they create them. Thus, immigration ‘expands the American work-force, and encourages more business startups’ - ensuring that businesses ranging from Apple Corporation to apple growers would be able to find the workers they need in America.” Unlawful ban The companies further explain that the ban is unlawful as it violates laws passed back in the 60s regarding discrimination. There’s also the fact that the Administrative Procedure Act requires government agencies, including the President, to issue notice and seek people’s comments before instating new rules, something that Trump has not done with its plethora of executive orders signed since his inauguration. A judge overthrew the Trump travel ban, something that the administration has already appealed, hoping to reinstate it. The President has been all over Twitter throwing mud at the judge for not respecting the law and making threats. The Court of Appeals is expected to rule in the next few days. As mentioned, companies have also chosen other ways to fight the travel ban. For instance, Google has set up a $4 million crisis fund to help those affected by the order, Lyft has donated $1 million, while Twitter added a bit more to that sum, directing the money towards the ACLU. Airbnb is promising to find a place to stay to those left stranded, while Uber is setting up a $3 million fund to assist the drivers who will no longer be able to work, including as legal fees. The list of companies that signed the amicus brief includes Lyft, Pinterest, Yelp, Mozilla, Dropbox, Github, Kickstarter, Salesforce, Reddit, Square, Box, and more. #Trump Travel Ban#Google#Apple#Microsoft#Facebook subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news #DeleteUber Pushed 200,000 People to Leave Service Microsoft, Amazon, Expedia Join Washington AG, Take Trump's Ban to Court Google's Pichai and Brin Join Employees in Rally Against Trump Ban Petition Demanding Trump to Release Tax Returns Breaks Record Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Mystery Solved: Why Windows Generic Drivers Are Dated June 21, 2006 LG G6 Confirmed to Feature Snapdragon 821 Chipset Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One Microsoft Teases New Windows 10 Security Announcements    The travel ban is illegal, tech companies say New Apps Portable PeaUtils: A collection of file management tools that comprises checksum and hash tools, file and folder analysis, a file splitter and joiner, hex data preview, and more Jihosoft iTunes Backup Unlocker: Uncover the password of your encrypted iTunes backup using multiple cracking methods, with this novice-friendly piece of software ProgDVB Professional: Watch TV channels from around the world, listen to radio station from the comfort of your computer, and record your favorite shows to watch them later eBook Converter Bundle: Batch convert your ePub or DRM PDFs to other formats with this lightweight software solution that provides ease of use and support for Kindle, NOOK, Kobo file formats Portable Alternate Archiver: Manage multiple files in a folder by organizing them into sub-directories, with the help of this lightweight and easy to handle utility ReaConverter Lite: Batch convert image files, add watermarks, edit photos and save them to a selected output format with this intuitive application xrecode III Portable: Converts audio files with ease and at high speed, supporting various input formats and providing a user-friendly working environment Reader comments The Pirate Bay May Be Blocked in the EU, AG Advises more on: The Pirate Bay i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Will President Trump listen to them? U.S. airline chief executives will bring their grievances directly to the White House on Thursday, when many will meet for the first time with Trump. The CEOs of Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines and American Airlines (AAL) wrote to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week, repeating their objection to the "massive subsidization" of Etihad Airways, Emirates Airline and Qatar Airways and appealing to Trump's "America First" mantra. "The Gulf carriers have received over $50 billion in documented subsidies from their government owners since 2004," they said in the letter. "If left unchecked we will continue to see the Gulf carriers expand in the U.S. market, causing further harm to hard working Americans." Related: Qatar Airways launches world's longest flight The three biggest U.S. airlines want the U.S. government to review the Open Skies agreements that allow the Gulf carriers to fly freely from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to any U.S. destination. The U.S. CEOs say the two nations are "abusing the agreements, and our government has done nothing to stop them." Adding destinations The Gulf carriers have been growing fast in the U.S. Earlier this year, Emirates announced a new service between Dubai and Newark, with a stop in Greece -- a provocative move on the lucrative North Atlantic market traditionally dominated by U.S. and European airlines. Newark is the 12th American destination for Emirates. Related: Warren Buffett's big bet on airlines flies high Qatar Airways is not far behind its regional rival. It will have 11 destinations in the U.S. once its new Doha-Las Vegas service starts in 2018. All three Gulf airlines have in the past rejected the allegations that they're being given an unfair advantage. In 2015, Emirates released a detailed report stating it does not depend "on government subsidies, bailouts, and bankruptcy laws, but operates as a consumer-focused, profit-driven, commercial enterprise." Emirates and Qatar Airways declined to comment on the potential for protectionist measures under Trump. In an interview with CNNMoney, Etihad CEO James Hogan said it was too soon to speculate. "In regards to how that's addressed moving forward we will have to wait and see. At the end of the day you can only work with the issues that are in front of you. If those issues are raised again, we will tackle them," he said. Etihad, which flies to six American cities, is not planning to expand in the U.S. this year. But its home airport in Abu Dhabi has a facility for U.S. bound passengers to complete immigration and customs inspections before boarding. Powerful friends U.S. airline opposition isn't unanimous. Air carriers like Hawaiian Airlines and JetBlue Airways are part of a coalition pushing for the Open Skies agreements to remain unchanged. Those airlines want to keep passengers on the Middle East airlines flowing to their U.S. flights from overseas. Members of the coalition, which includes FedEx, are also seeking a meeting with Tillerson. Taking action against the Gulf carriers is not without risk for President Trump. For starters, their aircraft orders support lots of American jobs. The three airlines, clustered within an hour's flying time of each other, have bought billions of dollars worth of Boeing (BA) airplanes and have billions more on order, supporting thousands of U.S. jobs. Related: Norwegian eyes low-cost airline pact with Ryanair and Easyjet That has earned the trio a powerful ally in Washington, D.C., though Boeing has declined to take a public position for fear of upsetting American airlines. For Trump, it would mean taking on an old friend, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker. Speaking in November after congratulating Trump on his victory, Al Baker said: "I have always said that the rhetoric that surrounded Mr. Trump's campaign with respect to our region is only political in nature, and I am certain that the road ahead will clearly demonstrate that Qatar and the United States have enjoyed a long standing partnership and are close allies."

Gen. David L. Goldfein emphasized the importance to the joint force of incorporating the space domain. He also spoke about the manpower shortage the service faces and the need for dependable budgets for both the service and industry partners. Air Force Maj.

Air Force photo by Senior Airman Jeff Parkinson Download Image Image details page Fighting ISIL Airmen are taking the fight to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant on a daily basis, Goldfein said. During the counter-ISIL campaign in Mosul, he said, the Air Force was dropping ordnance on the group about every eight minutes. The Air Force also killed hundreds of terrorists in their camps in Libya, and has gone after groups in Yemen, Goldfein said. In Afghanistan, the Air Force is supporting Afghan forces with close air support and is helping in critical resupply efforts, the general said. Airmen also are deployed and busy in South Korea, Poland, Germany, Djibouti, the Philippines and other areas, Goldfein said. In some places, he said, they are working with allies to strengthen their capabilities. Nuclear Deterrent The Air Force also manages two legs of the nuclear triad or deterrent -- bombers and intercontinental missiles. The U.S. Navy maintains the nuclear submarine force. The Air Force also maintains the command-and-control system for all nuclear forces if “on the worst day of our nation” the president ever has to use these weapons, Goldfein said. The Air Force also is in space, where the service maintains the satellites that tie the military together, the general said. Space-Based Communications Space is where the Air Force literally touches every service member, Goldfein said, noting that the computers and global positioning systems that service members use each day are linked through Air Force satellites. “Space is the connective tissue for the joint force,” the general said, noting he wants to “normalize” operations in that critical domain. “As we talk about space as a joint warfighting domain, I want to make sure that as part of the dialogue we are not carving space out as something unique -- that only people in the space business understand,” Goldfein said. “We need to look at space as just one more domain in which we operate, and we need to look at constructs used on land, sea and air, and see how many can be applied to space.” An F-35A Lightning II from the 388th Fighter Wing, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, sits on the flight line during Red Flag 17-1 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., Jan. 12, 2017.

Natasha Stannard Download Image Image details page Putting the space domain in its own unique set could mean walls and seams -- and therefor vulnerabilities -- among the domains, Goldfein said. And if space is the connective tissue among the U.S. services, he added, it also connects the United States to its allies and partners worldwide. Aging Air Fleet The Air Force fleet is the oldest it has been, Goldfein said, noting the B-52 bomber was designed in the 1950s, with the last rolling off the assembly line in the late 1960s. But other aircraft are aging too, he added. The F-15, F-16 and A-10 were originally designed in the 1970s. The C-17 in the 1980s. And, the KC-135 is based on the Boeing 707, he noted, was originally designed in the 1950s. Goldfein said the Air Force wants to modernize its fleet, and that is why the F-35 is a priority for the service. The Air Force plans to buy about 1,600 F-35As, he said. “The more F-35s we can procure in the shortest period of time to reduce aircraft age and get more heavily into the 5th-generation capabilities” -- the better,” Goldfein said. Hard Choices Ahead But there are difficult choices ahead for the service, the general said. At the same time the Air Force is buying more F-35s, he said, the service needs to also buy new tanker aircraft, pay for the B-21 bomber program and fund the nuclear modernization program. Add to that, he added, investment in space programs and cyber defense programs and recovering readiness from the trough it went in following sequestration. “One thing on my wish list is a stable budget I can plan against with a reasonable expectation for the future so I can make good fiscal decisions,” Goldfein said. The year-to-year changes in the defense budget make it extremely difficult to make any long-term investments in future capabilities, he said. This impacts the service, and industry partners, he said. “I was in Boeing in Los Angeles and visited the people in the business of building satellites,” Goldfein said. “That’s a pretty sophisticated workforce.” He added, “When I jerk the throttle around in one-year budgets and I tell them, ‘I think I need this much in two to three years from now, but I’m not sure because I think I’m going to get a continuing resolution which means I can’t spend.’” That CEO, he said, “has to somehow sustain that sophisticated workforce. One-year budgets wreak havoc on a service chiefs ability to plan, and on industry.” Multi-domain Command, Control One huge change the Air Force is grappling with is on multi-domain command and control, Goldfein said. Gathering land, sea, air, space and cyber together will be key to military success in the future, the general said. “Part of this is a dialogue within industry and the acquisition corps,” he said. “As we look at the 21st century, perhaps it’s time to focus less on the trucks and the cargo and more on the highway they ride on,” the general continued. “Because traditionally, we’ve built weapons systems and procured munitions and sensors, and then looked at the way to connect them.” That thinking needs to reverse, Goldfein said. “In the future, we need to ask what is the network we will ride on and then what are the apps we’ll need to ride on that network,” he said. “Some of those roll, walk, steam, fly and orbit and it is only as we can connect them as a family that we get multiple dilemmas for an enemy in multiple domains, where 1 plus 1 equals 3 or more.” (Follow Jim Garamone on Twitter: @GaramoneDoDNews) Air Force News News Articles Casualty Releases Press Advisories News Transcripts Publications Speeches Contracts Testimony Messages Special Reports Photos/Videos Photo Essays Week in Photos DoD Video News Other Pentagon Press Badges Military Commissions Press / Media Queries Other News Sources 02/08/2017 Sgt.

The loans, which come from a Canadian aerospace and defence fund targeting research and development projects, will be used for Bombardier's CSeries family of narrowbodies and the Global 7000 business jet, according to a statement from the government. The contributions will be provided over four years, in a number of installments, with the majority allocated to the Global 7000 program. "The repayable contributions announced today will help to ensure that Canada remains at the centre of Bombardier's research and development activities," Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said in a statement. Bombardier initially asked Canada to match a $1 billion injection in the CSeries program from the province of Quebec in 2016. But negotiations dragged on for more than a year as the Liberals made requests of the company, such as changes to its dual class governing structure. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is under pressure to invest in Montreal, Quebec-headquartered Bombardier, after his ruling Liberals unexpectedly won 40 of the province's 78 Parliamentary seats, far more than expected, in an October 2015 election. Bombardier, which briefly considered bankruptcy protection last year after simultaneous airplane developments caused a cash crunch, is now in a better position financially than when it asked for the matching $1 billion. Quebec's spending in the CSeries, along with a separate $1.5 billion investment by the province's largest pension fund in Bombardier's rail division, could trigger a new trade feud between the company and rival Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA . Brazil's foreign ministry in December authorized World Trade Organization proceedings against Canada over Bombardier's roughly $5.4 billion CSeries jetliner program, which competes with some Embraer jets as well as the smallest products of plane giants Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. Reimbursable loans are a key pillar of the world's largest trade dispute, involving mutual transatlantic claims of unfair support for aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing. The WTO found that government loans used by European Union member states to support Airbus airplane developments constituted unfair subsidies, prompting the threat of U.S. sanctions. But, after more than a decade, the case has yet to complete lengthy WTO legal and compliance processes.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Canada’s federal government on Tuesday announced $372.5 million in repayable loans for two of Bombardier Inc’s jet programs, far less than the $1 billion originally sought by the Canadian plane and train maker. The loans, which come from a Canadian aerospace and defence fund targeting research and development projects, will be used for Bombardier’s CSeries family of narrowbodies and the Global 7000 business jet, according to a statement from the government. The contributions will be provided over four years, in a number of instalments, with the majority allocated to the Global 7000 program. Related Franco-Italian ATR chief executive troubled by competition impact of Bombardier Inc bailout Bombardier Inc signs 300-train deal worth up to $1.9 billion with Austrian Federal Railways “The repayable contributions announced today will help to ensure that Canada remains at the centre of Bombardier’s research and development activities,” Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said in a statement. Bombardier initially asked Canada to match a $1 billion injection in the CSeries program from the province of Quebec in 2016. But negotiations dragged on for more than a year as the Liberals made requests of the company, such as changes to its dual class governing structure. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is under pressure to invest in Montreal, Quebec-headquartered Bombardier, after his ruling Liberals unexpectedly won 40 of the province’s 78 Parliamentary seats, far more than expected, in an October 2015 election. Bombardier, which briefly considered bankruptcy protection last year after simultaneous airplane developments caused a cash crunch, is now in a better position financially than when it asked for the matching $1 billion. Looks like @m_pauze erased it from her timeline but here is that tweet: Bombarder loan is nothing but “crumbs”. pic.twitter.com/xIY5pnDsjS — David Akin (@davidakin) February 7, 2017 Quebec’s spending in the CSeries, along with a separate $1.5 billion investment by the province’s largest pension fund in Bombardier’s rail division, could trigger a new trade feud between the company and rival Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA . Brazil’s foreign ministry in December authorized World Trade Organization proceedings against Canada over Bombardier’s roughly $5.4 billion CSeries jetliner program, which competes with some Embraer jets as well as the smallest products of plane giants Boeing Co and Airbus Group SE. Reimbursable loans are a key pillar of the world’s largest trade dispute, involving mutual transatlantic claims of unfair support for aircraft makers Airbus and Boeing. The WTO found that government loans used by European Union member states to support Airbus airplane developments constituted unfair subsidies, prompting the threat of U.S. sanctions. But, after more than a decade, the case has yet to complete lengthy WTO legal and compliance processes. © Thomson Reuters 2017 Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

You can read the full story here. A tornado impacted NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans Tuesday (Feb. 7), according to a statement released by the agency. "At this time, only minor injuries have been reported and NASA employees and other tenants are being accounted for," NASA officials said in the statement. The tornado hit the facility at 11:25 a.m. CST (12:25 p.m. EST/1725 GMT), they added. [In Photos: Tornado Damage at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility]   NASA posted a video to YouTube that shows cell phone footage of the tornado (taken from afar), as well as footage of the facility after the impact. "That thing is an awesome thing to look at," one spectator said in the video, referring to the massive grey funnel on the horizon. @weatherchannel @CNN @FoxNews pic.twitter.com/im2iSxWi7n — Jonathan Simeral (@JonSimeral) February 7, 2017 "Hopefully, everybody's okay, but it is real bad," said a person taking footage of the facility after the tornado had passed. The video seemed to show damage to buildings and a car flipped over in a parking lot. "There is still a threat of severe weather in the area and emergency officials are continuing to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of onsite personnel," the statement said. "The onsite Michoud emergency response team is also conducting damage assessments of buildings and facilities." Currently, the Michoud Assembly Facilityis responsible for manufacturing and assembling the core stage of NASA's next-generation heavy-lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which is built by Boeing, according to NASA's website. Michoud will also assemble and integrate the SLS main propulsion system, including the RS-25 engines, built by Aerojet Rocketdyne. The facility is also involved in manufacturing large structures and composites for the Orion crew vehicle. Previously, NASA used the facility to assemble the external propulsion tanks for the space shuttle program, as well as Saturn V moon rocket stages.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq was led higher by gains in components like Autodesk ( ADSK ), which affirmed Q4 and full year guidance and said CEO Carl Bass is stepping down effective Feb. 8. The information technology group on the S&P 500 rose 0.4% to be among five of the 11 sectors that strengthened. The top performance belonged to consumer staples, which rose 0.8%. Energy fell 1.4% in the steepest decline on the S&P 500 as US crude futures retreated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which touched a record on an intraday basis before pulling back, saw just over half of its blue chips hang on to gains, with Boeing ( BA ) up 1.5% in the strongest advance and Chevron ( CVX ) down the some amount the steepest loss. Economic data was mixed, with the trade deficit in December narrowing to $44.3 billion from a revised $45.7 billion deficit in November. The number of jobs available in December fell slightly to 5.501 million from a downward revised 5.505 million in November, missing estimates for an increase to 5.568 million.

Which CEOs will attend the meeting is not clear, but during a press briefing Feb. 7, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in response to a journalist’s question that the president would want to talk “about economic growth and job creation, how he’s enacting orders to make sure the country’s safe.” Spicer was asked specifically about Trump’s view on Norwegian Air International (NAI) obtaining a foreign carrier permit under the Obama administration under the US-European Union Open Skies agreement despite protests from some US majors and union groups. Spicer responded, “My understanding, if I’m correct, is there is a deal which they’re [NAI] having 50% of the crews and the pilots are American based, they’re flying Boeing planes. There’s a huge economic interest that America has in that deal right now. I don’t want to get ahead of the President on that, but just to be clear, you’re talking about US jobs both in terms of the people who are serving those planes and the person who’s building those planes, that’s a very big difference.” Karen Walker karen.walker@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said he could support a hike at the Federal Open Market Committee’s next two-day meeting in March. “I think March is on the table. I would never take a meeting off the table,” Harker told reporters after a speech in San Diego, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari wrote an essay, posted on the bank’s website, about his decision at last week’s FOMC meeting to vote in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged. “We are still coming up somewhat short on our inflation mandate, and we may not have yet reached maximum employment,” Kashkari said. “That suggests that somewhat accommodative monetary policy would still be appropriate to close those gaps.” Wall Street was mixed. In 1.25pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.1 percent. In 1.10pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.06 percent. In the Dow, advances in shares of Boeing and those of Apple, which recently traded 1.5 percent and 1.1higher respectively, outweighed declines in shares of Chevron and those of Exxon Mobil, recently down 1.6 percent and 1 percent respectively. Energy stocks followed the price of oil lower, with crude falling below US$52 a barrel. While concern about the impact of US President Donald Trump’s controversial start in office is weighing on equity markets, the outlook for corporate profits and the economy remains positive. “We’ve been getting some back and forth between the new administration’s business-friendly policies versus the disruptions economically and politically from the immigration and trade-related issues,” Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia, told Reuters. “However, at the end of the day, the expansion is continuing, the economy and earnings are growing and that should support equities,” Pride noted. A Commerce Department report showed the US trade deficit narrowed 3.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted US$44.26 billion in December from the previous month. Protectionist policies, as championed by Trump, won’t get rid of the deficit, some warned. “When an economy is at full employment, an acceleration in demand tends to be accompanied by a pickup in import growth and a wider trade deficit,” John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, told Reuters. “The US simply does not have enough spare labour and capacity at any exchange rate to close the deficit, which will likely widen in 2017 and 2018.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.3 percent advance from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index gained 0.3 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.5 percent.

Credit: NanoRacks The International Space Station (ISS) will soon feature its first commercially funded airlock, which NASA officials said will allow more small satellites to be deployed from the orbiting lab. NASA has agreed to let the Houston-based company NanoRacks develop the airlock, which is expected to launch in 2019. "We want to utilize the space station to expose the commercial sector to new and novel uses of space, ultimately creating a new economy in low-Earth orbit for scientific research, technology development and human and cargo transportation," Sam Scimemi, director of NASA's ISS division, said in a statement. "We hope this new airlock will allow a diverse community to experiment and develop opportunities in space for the commercial sector." NanoRacks — which has already deployed numerous tiny cubesats from the station's Japanese Kibo module — signed an independent partnership with aerospace giant Boeing on Monday (Feb. 6) to develop the new airlock. Artist's illustration of the commercial airlock that will be installed on the International Space Station in 2019, if all goes according to plan. Credit: NanoRacks Payloads deployed into space via the new airlock will be coordinated and vetted through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), which manages the U.S. national laboratory on the space station.NASA officials said the new airlock will be installed on a port on ISS' Tranquility module. Another Tranquility port currently hosts the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), a prototype designed to test how inflatable habitats perform in space. Besides its current work with NanoRacks, CASIS and Bigelow Aerospace (which built BEAM), NASA issued a request for information last fall asking private enterprises how they can use resources on the space station, such as docking ports. "As private sector partners play a greater role in this new economy, NASA is able to focus on its deep-space exploration goals, including sending humans beyond the moon and eventually, to Mars," agency officials said in the same statement.

Scroll down for video  Launch Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida has been undergoes modifications by SpaceX to adapt it to the needs of the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which are slated to lift off from the historic pad in the near future. A horizontal integration facility at the lower right has been constructed near the perimeter of the pad where rockets will be processed for launch prior of rolling out to the top of the pad structure for liftoff. SpaceX anticipates using the launch pad for its Crew Dragon spacecraft for missions to the International Space Station in partnership with NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 'We should be launching every two to three weeks,' SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told Reuters in an interview on Monday. SpaceX was approaching that pace last autumn, before the Sept. 1 accident, which happened during a routine preflight test.  The explosion destroyed a $200 million Israeli satellite and heavily damaged the launch pad.

Share this article Share 55 shares Shotwell said repairs to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which are still underway, should cost 'far less than half' of a new launch pad, which she said runs about $100 million.  The new launch pad is at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, just north of the Cape Canaveral site. SpaceX is also modifying the rocket's engines to increase performance and resolve potential safety concerns, said Shotwell. The company plans to change the design of the Falcon 9's turbopump - which provides propellants to the rocket's engines - to eliminate cracks that have prompted concern from NASA and the U.S. Air Force. NASA has hired SpaceX to taxi astronauts to and from the International Space Station starting in late 2018. Shotwell said the new turbopumps will be installed before the first unmanned test flights of the commercial space taxi, scheduled for November. THE HISTORIC LAUNCH PADS  The space shuttle Discovery lifts off from launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center October 11, 2000. The pad has now been taken over Elon Musk's SpaceX, which hopes to begin launching its Dragon rockets every two weeks. Since the late 1960s, Pads A and B at Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39 have served as backdrops for America's most significant manned space flight endeavors - Apollo, Skylab, Apollo-Soyuz and space shuttle. Located on Merritt Island, Fla., just north of Cape Canaveral, the pads were originally built for the huge Apollo/Saturn V rockets that launched American astronauts on their historic journeys to the moon and back.  An aerial view of Launch Pad 39A during the Apollo/Saturn era, taken in 1976. During the Apollo era, key pad service structures were mobile. Looking like a giant erector set, is the construction of the payload changeout room for the Space Shuttle Program at Launch Pad 39A in 1976. It allows the capability of loading the shuttle vertically, and making installation or removal of payloads at the launch pad possible. Following the joint U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission of July 1975, the pads were modified to support space shuttle operations.  Both pads were designed to support the concept of mobile launch operations, in which space vehicles are checked out and assembled in the protected environment of the Orbiter Processing Facility and the Vehicle Assembly Building, then transported by large, tracked crawlers to the launch pad for final processing and launch. During the Apollo era, key pad service structures were mobile.  For the space shuttle, two permanent service towers were installed at each pad for the first time, the fixed service structure and the rotating service structure. On April 12, 1981, shuttle operations commenced at Pad A with the launch of Columbia on STS-1.  After 23 more successful launches from A, the first space shuttle to lift off from Pad B was the ill-fated Challenger in January 1986.  Pad B was designated for the resumption of shuttle flights in September 1988, followed by the reactivation of Pad A in January 1990.   SpaceX is one of two companies certified to fly military and national security satellites for the Air Force, the other being United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. 'For us, the concern was not the cracks, but do they grow over time? Would these cracks cause a flight failure?' Shotwell said. 'I think NASA is used to engines that aren't quite as robust, so they just don't want any cracks at all in the turbo machinery.' SpaceX discovered two types of cracks during ground tests of its Merlin engines in 2015, Shotwell said. The cracks were not related to the Sept. 1 launch pad explosion. To fix the more serious cracking issue, the company devised a software fix and then redesigned the turbine wheel, Shotwell said. The first of the redesigned turbine wheels flew in July 2016. A second set of cracks in welds and shrouds are not a concern for flight, but NASA and the Air Force have asked for a redesign, Shotwell said. SpaceX has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion. It has successfully flown 27 out of 29 times since the Falcon 9's debut in 2010. The company flew eight missions in 2016 before the launch pad accident in September grounded the fleet.  The rocket returned to flight last month, flying from a second launch site in California, which is only used for satellites heading into polar or high inclination orbits. A fourth launch site in Texas is under construction.

Will President Trump listen to them? U.S. airline chief executives will bring their grievances directly to the White House on Thursday, when many will meet for the first time with Trump. The CEOs of Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines and American Airlines (AAL) wrote to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week, repeating their objection to the "massive subsidization" of Etihad Airways, Emirates Airline and Qatar Airways and appealing to Trump's "America First" mantra. "The Gulf carriers have received over $50 billion in documented subsidies from their government owners since 2004," they said in the letter. "If left unchecked we will continue to see the Gulf carriers expand in the U.S. market, causing further harm to hard working Americans." Related: Qatar Airways launches world's longest flight The three biggest U.S. airlines want the U.S. government to review the Open Skies agreements that allow the Gulf carriers to fly freely from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to any U.S. destination. The U.S. CEOs say the two nations are "abusing the agreements, and our government has done nothing to stop them." Adding destinations The Gulf carriers have been growing fast in the U.S. Earlier this year, Emirates announced a new service between Dubai and Newark, with a stop in Greece -- a provocative move on the lucrative North Atlantic market traditionally dominated by U.S. and European airlines. Newark is the 12th American destination for Emirates. Related: Warren Buffett's big bet on airlines flies high Qatar Airways is not far behind its regional rival. It will have 11 destinations in the U.S. once its new Doha-Las Vegas service starts in 2018. All three Gulf airlines have in the past rejected the allegations that they're being given an unfair advantage. In 2015, Emirates released a detailed report stating it does not depend "on government subsidies, bailouts, and bankruptcy laws, but operates as a consumer-focused, profit-driven, commercial enterprise." Emirates and Qatar Airways declined to comment on the potential for protectionist measures under Trump. In an interview with CNNMoney, Etihad CEO James Hogan said it was too soon to speculate. "In regards to how that's addressed moving forward we will have to wait and see. At the end of the day you can only work with the issues that are in front of you. If those issues are raised again, we will tackle them," he said. Etihad, which flies to six American cities, is not planning to expand in the U.S. this year. But its home airport in Abu Dhabi has a facility for U.S. bound passengers to complete immigration and customs inspections before boarding. Powerful friends U.S. airline opposition isn't unanimous. Air carriers like Hawaiian Airlines and JetBlue Airways are part of a coalition pushing for the Open Skies agreements to remain unchanged. Those airlines want to keep passengers on the Middle East airlines flowing to their U.S. flights from overseas. Members of the coalition, which includes FedEx, are also seeking a meeting with Tillerson. Taking action against the Gulf carriers is not without risk for President Trump. For starters, their aircraft orders support lots of American jobs. The three airlines, clustered within an hour's flying time of each other, have bought billions of dollars worth of Boeing (BA) airplanes and have billions more on order, supporting thousands of U.S. jobs.

For Trump, it would mean taking on an old friend, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker. Speaking in November after congratulating Trump on his victory, Al Baker said: "I have always said that the rhetoric that surrounded Mr. Trump's campaign with respect to our region is only political in nature, and I am certain that the road ahead will clearly demonstrate that Qatar and the United States have enjoyed a long standing partnership and are close allies."

While you were sleeping: Energy stocks slide Feb. 8 (BusinessDesk) – A decline in energy stocks weighed on Wall Street, while investors digested comments from US Federal Reserve officials about the potential for an interest rate increase next month. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said he could support a hike at the Federal Open Market Committee’s next two-day meeting in March. “I think March is on the table. I would never take a meeting off the table,” Harker told reporters after a speech in San Diego, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari wrote an essay, posted on the bank’s website, about his decision at last week’s FOMC meeting to vote in favour of keeping interest rates unchanged. “We are still coming up somewhat short on our inflation mandate, and we may not have yet reached maximum employment,” Kashkari said. “That suggests that somewhat accommodative monetary policy would still be appropriate to close those gaps.” Wall Street was mixed. In 1.25pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.1 percent. In 1.10pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.06 percent. In the Dow, advances in shares of Boeing and those of Apple, which recently traded 1.5 percent and 1.1higher respectively, outweighed declines in shares of Chevron and those of Exxon Mobil, recently down 1.6 percent and 1 percent respectively. Energy stocks followed the price of oil lower, with crude falling below US$52 a barrel. While concern about the impact of US President Donald Trump’s controversial start in office is weighing on equity markets, the outlook for corporate profits and the economy remains positive. “We’ve been getting some back and forth between the new administration’s business-friendly policies versus the disruptions economically and politically from the immigration and trade-related issues,” Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia, told Reuters. “However, at the end of the day, the expansion is continuing, the economy and earnings are growing and that should support equities,” Pride noted. A Commerce Department report showed the US trade deficit narrowed 3.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted US$44.26 billion in December from the previous month. Protectionist policies, as championed by Trump, won’t get rid of the deficit, some warned. “When an economy is at full employment, an acceleration in demand tends to be accompanied by a pickup in import growth and a wider trade deficit,” John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York, told Reuters. “The US simply does not have enough spare labour and capacity at any exchange rate to close the deficit, which will likely widen in 2017 and 2018.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a 0.3 percent advance from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index rose 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index gained 0.3 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index slid 0.5 percent.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The S&P 500 ended barely higher on Tuesday while the Nasdaq managed to scratch out a new record as gains in big tech names countered energy declines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit an intraday all-time high just after the market opened, and the benchmark S&P 500 came close to yet another record high. U.S. equities have rallied sharply after President Donald Trump's election in November, spurred by hopes the Republican-led government will cut regulations and taxes and enact higher infrastructure spending. However, investors have expressed concerns those polices could be put off as Trump focuses elsewhere such as on immigration. "There is probably a bit of political risk that investors are trying to weigh right now," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. "But outside of that, the story is a pretty good one for stocks in terms of it looks like the economy is continuing to grow, I think corporate profits have been pretty good, certainly enough to support higher prices." With more than half of the S&P 500 having reported results, fourth-quarter earnings are on track to have climbed 8.2 percent, which would be the best performance since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 37.87 points, or 0.19 percent, to 20,090.29, the S&P 500 gained 0.52 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,293.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.67 points, or 0.19 percent, to 5,674.22. Energy was the worst-performing S&P sector, falling 1.4 percent. Chevron's 1.4-percent fall and Exxon's 0.6-percent drop were among the biggest drags on the S&P. Oil prices were pressured by growing gasoline stockpiles in the United States as evidence of a burgeoning revival in U.S. shale production could complicate efforts to reduce a supply glut. "If we are going into a quarter or two of lower energy prices ... the story of improving earnings for the S&P 500, with the help of improving earnings in energy companies, may be suspect," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Tech stocks helped prop up the S&P. Apple rose about 1 percent and Google parent Alphabet gained 0.9 percent. Consumer staples were the best performing S&P group, rising 0.8 percent. In corporate earnings news, Emerson Electric shares rose 4.5 percent after the manufacturer reported a higher-than-expected profit. General Motors fell 4.7 percent after the automaker said that fourth-quarter net income fell partly on the strength of the dollar against the British pound and forecast flat 2017 profit per share. Michael Kors dropped 10.8 percent, after the handbag maker forecast current-quarter profit below estimates. After the market closed, Walt Disney shares fell following the company's quarterly report. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, slightly below the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 108 new highs and 40 new lows. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards Site Archive Suburbs vs. city of Chicago: Who wins Caterpillar's headquarters? Tuesday Feb 7, 2017 at 11:57 AM Feb 7, 2017 at 12:12 PM Robert Reed of the Chicago Tribune It's on: Suburbs versus the city. That's among the area's oldest economic development matchups and, right now, an interesting contest is shaping up over who is going to win the headquarters of massive manufacturer Caterpillar, which last week said it was leaving longtime home Peoria for the "Chicago area." Even as the company's brain trust made its startling relocation proclamation, some observers considered it a fait accompli that the HQ would end up in or around the West Loop. As such, Cat would join fellow blue chippers, including Google and McDonald's, in a quest to raise (or find) its "cool" factor and lure a more digitally savvy and multicultural workforce. But real estate and economic development sources say Cat, which sells big machinery and construction products worldwide, is also pretty serious about being near O'Hare International Airport. That doesn't rule Chicago out, but it does open up opportunities for DuPage County and Cook County's Rosemont, which border the airport from opposite directions, and crave such a high-profile company. "The marquee value is very, very valuable," says John Carpenter, CEO of the Choose DuPage Economic Development Alliance. Already, DuPage County Board Chairman Dan Cronin has sent a letter to Caterpillar CEO James Umpleby touting his west suburban area and stressing a willingness to work with Cat's relocation team. Although no tax breaks or deals are mentioned, Cronin's letter stresses DuPage's business base and that the ongoing Western Access O'Hare Project will provide "convenient, hassle-free access" to the airport. That's true, but it won't be for a while. The estimated $3.4 billion roadway project is being constructed in stages until 2025 with a ramp into O'Hare as soon as 2019, according to the Illinois Tollway. On the eastern side of the airport, Rosemont Mayor Bradley Stephens is mulling ways to entice the company brass. Right now, the catnip on the table includes using a tax increment financing district, property or other types of tax breaks, helping with office build-outs and other sweeteners, says Gary Mack, a village spokesman. Since Cat seems intent on renting office space for its estimated 300 employees, the village is also open to working with a landlord on a package that would help land Cat, he added. Mayor Stephens hasn't spoken to Cat's CEO but hopes to soon have a conversation. "We'd love to have them here and you can't get any closer to O'Hare than Rosemont," Mack said. While the suburbs are openly teeing up their sales pitches, the city of Chicago is being — shall we say — more circumspect. City Hall isn't saying if it is in talks with Caterpillar, but Mayor Rahm Emanuel has cheered the company's relocation decision. Anything can happen, but realistically it seems unlikely the city will offer Cat any major public tax breaks or big relocation incentives, even if the suburbs go that way. This is a much different era than before. In 2001, for example, the city and state combined to give Boeing about $58 million in various incentives over an estimated 25-year span to relocate its HQ to Chicago from Seattle — beating out Dallas and Denver. Now, Chicago and Illinois' heavy burden of public debt, which amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars in unpaid bills, growing operating costs and underfunded pension liabilities makes such corporate largesse unseemly and unaffordable. Right now, City Hall's message is more like: "Other major corporations have made the move to Chicago. Why not you?" Caterpillar isn't saying too much, either. In an email to me, Caterpillar spokesperson Corrie Scott said the company has "been in touch with several different community leaders in the Chicago area since our announcement," but didn't expand on that reply. However, Caterpillar did add it wasn't slamming the door on any opportunity that offered to discuss public perks. "Incentives were not the driver in our announcement. However, we are considering all options as we select a site," Scott said in the email. That's an intriguing comment. To me, it says taxpayers may help pave the way for Cat's big Chicago-area move.    About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Advertise With Us Customer Service Newspaper in Education Submit an Ad Internships Contact Us Market Place Shop Cars Homes Free Classifieds Ad Classifieds Community Info Community Served About us Historic Headlines Peoria History Forms Anniversaries Births Engagements Weddings 100th Birthday Jobs in Peoria Pets Place a Classified Ad Real Estate Rentals Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the major U.S. stock benchmarks are off to a bullish February start. Consider that the Nasdaq Composite has reached all-time highs this week — by definition, uncharted territory — while the S&P 500 continues to rattle the cage on the 2,300 mark. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, +0.36%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has rallied to the range top, punctuating an extended test of the 2,277 breakout point. The 2,300 mark matches notable resistance. Recall that the S&P 500’s record close (2,298.37), and absolute record peak (2,300.99), define the range top. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reclaimed the 20,000 mark, rising toward the range top. On further strength, the Dow’s record close (20,100.91) is closely followed by its absolute record peak (20,125.58). Both levels have been surpassed early Tuesday, placing the blue-chip benchmark in nominally uncharted territory. True to recent form, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop is stronger. Here again, the range top — technically 5,669.61 — matched the Nasdaq’s absolute record peak. The index has cleared resistance early Tuesday, reaching its latest all-time high. The 5,670 area pivots to support, and is followed by a modest floor around 5,650. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has bottomed two points above the 5,574 breakout point, an area also illustrated on the hourly chart. It subsequently rallied from support, topping last week two points under record territory. More plainly, the Nasdaq’s 2017 price action remains technical, and supports a bullish view. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has absorbed the late-January downturn. To reiterate, the blue-chip benchmark has reclaimed Dow 20,000, rising within striking distance of all-time highs. Conversely, the ascending 50-day moving average, currently 19,772, closely matches the range bottom. More broadly, the Dow’s bull flag — pinned to the steep 2016 breakout — is a continuation pattern, currently punctuated by a February breakout attempt. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has rallied to the range top from a successful test of the breakout point. Recall that the 2,300 target marks a headline hurdle, currently under siege. Conversely, the ascending 50-day moving average, currently 2,259, is closely followed by notable support around 2,252. The bigger picture Broadly speaking, the U.S. benchmarks’ bigger-picture backdrop remains firmly bullish. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are pressing record territory, rising from a successful test of well-defined support. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, +0.76%  continues to lag slightly behind. Still, the small-cap benchmark has maintained the range bottom, circa 133.20, preserving its bullish range-bound posture. Separately, the 50-day moving average, currently 135.35, has marked a recent inflection point. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains comparably stronger. As illustrated, the MDY has recently maintained the 50-day moving average, rising to challenge the range top. Resistance broadly spans from about 309.60 to 311.00, closely matching the 2016 peak and the MDY’s record close. Similarly, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 SPY, +0.39%  is pressing record territory. Recall that its all-time closing high rests at 229.57, and is closely followed by its absolute record peak of 229.71. The SPY topped last week at 229.55, just two cents under its record close. Similarly, the SPY has thus far topped this week at 229.66, fractionally under its absolute record peak. The selling pressure near resistance remains muted, and a slow-motion breakout attempt is underway. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. To reiterate, the index has survived an extended test of the 2,277 breakout point, punctuated by four straight closes nominally higher. Upon holding support, the S&P has rallied to challenge record territory, an area closely matching the 2,300 mark. Recall that last week’s close missed a record close by less than one point. Beyond the granular, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains bullish, and the 2017 price action remains distinctly technical in spots. As always, technical price action within an uptrend supports a bullish view. Tactically, the S&P’s 2,277 breakout point remains first support, and is followed by a deeper floor around 2,252. The S&P 500’s intermediate-term path of least resistance points higher barring a violation. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Initially profiled Jan. 12, and revisited last week, the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +0.26% continues to trend higher. On a headline basis, the GLD has reached a nearly three-month peak, its best level since Nov. 11. Technically, the breakout punctuates a “higher high” confirming the initial January trend shift. (Recall that the 50-day moving average’s slope ticked higher last week, a lagging indicator, consistent with a trend shift.) From current levels, notable support spans from about 115.00 to 116.20. Gold’s recovery attempt is intact barring a violation. Conversely, trendline resistance is within view, circa 118.50, and is closely followed by a target matching the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Boeing Co. BA, +1.19%  is a Dow 30 component positioned to rise. (Yield = 3.5%.) As illustrated, the shares have recently launched from trendline support, reaching all-time highs amid a sustained volume increase. The ensuing pullback has been fueled by decreased volume, placing the shares at an attractive entry near the breakout point, and 3.7% under the January peak. The trendline closely matches support, and Boeing’s path of least resistance points higher barring a violation. Baidu, Inc. BIDU, +1.37% is a large-cap Internet search service provider based in China. The shares started 2017 with a breakout, knifing atop trendline resistance and the major moving averages. The subsequent pullback has been comparably flat, positioning the shares to build on the initial spike. Tactically, the 200-day moving average, currently 170.90, has marked an inflection point — underpinning the prevailing range — and a posture higher supports a bullish bias. Consider that the recent rally from support has been fueled by a volume uptick. Meanwhile, JD.com JD, +1.28%  is a well positioned large-cap Chinese e-commerce name. Late last month, the shares reached nine-month closing highs, clearing a relatively well-defined range top. The ensuing pullback has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, positioning the shares to extend the breakout. The February low, circa 27.90, offers an area from which to work, and a posture higher supports a bullish bias. Celestica, Inc. CLS, -0.81%  is a Toronto-based contract manufacturer coming to life. Technically, the shares have recently gapped to 11-year highs, rising after the company’s fourth-quarter results. The shares are less extended on the four-year chart, and positioned for potentially material follow-through. First support matches the top of the gap, just above 13.20, and is followed by the breakout point, circa 12.60.

To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the major U.S. stock benchmarks are off to a bullish February start. Consider that the Nasdaq Composite has reached all-time highs this week — by definition, uncharted territory — while the S&P 500 continues to rattle the cage on the 2,300 mark. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, +0.36%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has rallied to the range top, punctuating an extended test of the 2,277 breakout point. The 2,300 mark matches notable resistance. Recall that the S&P 500’s record close (2,298.37), and absolute record peak (2,300.99), define the range top. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reclaimed the 20,000 mark, rising toward the range top. On further strength, the Dow’s record close (20,100.91) is closely followed by its absolute record peak (20,125.58). Both levels have been surpassed early Tuesday, placing the blue-chip benchmark in nominally uncharted territory. True to recent form, the Nasdaq Composite’s backdrop is stronger. Here again, the range top — technically 5,669.61 — matched the Nasdaq’s absolute record peak. The index has cleared resistance early Tuesday, reaching its latest all-time high. The 5,670 area pivots to support, and is followed by a modest floor around 5,650. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has bottomed two points above the 5,574 breakout point, an area also illustrated on the hourly chart. It subsequently rallied from support, topping last week two points under record territory. More plainly, the Nasdaq’s 2017 price action remains technical, and supports a bullish view. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has absorbed the late-January downturn. To reiterate, the blue-chip benchmark has reclaimed Dow 20,000, rising within striking distance of all-time highs. Conversely, the ascending 50-day moving average, currently 19,772, closely matches the range bottom. More broadly, the Dow’s bull flag — pinned to the steep 2016 breakout — is a continuation pattern, currently punctuated by a February breakout attempt. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has rallied to the range top from a successful test of the breakout point. Recall that the 2,300 target marks a headline hurdle, currently under siege. Conversely, the ascending 50-day moving average, currently 2,259, is closely followed by notable support around 2,252. The bigger picture Broadly speaking, the U.S. benchmarks’ bigger-picture backdrop remains firmly bullish. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are pressing record territory, rising from a successful test of well-defined support. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, +0.76%  continues to lag slightly behind. Still, the small-cap benchmark has maintained the range bottom, circa 133.20, preserving its bullish range-bound posture. Separately, the 50-day moving average, currently 135.35, has marked a recent inflection point. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400’s backdrop remains comparably stronger. As illustrated, the MDY has recently maintained the 50-day moving average, rising to challenge the range top. Resistance broadly spans from about 309.60 to 311.00, closely matching the 2016 peak and the MDY’s record close. Similarly, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 SPY, +0.39%  is pressing record territory. Recall that its all-time closing high rests at 229.57, and is closely followed by its absolute record peak of 229.71. The SPY topped last week at 229.55, just two cents under its record close. Similarly, the SPY has thus far topped this week at 229.66, fractionally under its absolute record peak. The selling pressure near resistance remains muted, and a slow-motion breakout attempt is underway. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 is acting well technically. To reiterate, the index has survived an extended test of the 2,277 breakout point, punctuated by four straight closes nominally higher. Upon holding support, the S&P has rallied to challenge record territory, an area closely matching the 2,300 mark. Recall that last week’s close missed a record close by less than one point. Beyond the granular, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains bullish, and the 2017 price action remains distinctly technical in spots.

Initially profiled Jan. 12, and revisited last week, the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +0.26% continues to trend higher. On a headline basis, the GLD has reached a nearly three-month peak, its best level since Nov. 11. Technically, the breakout punctuates a “higher high” confirming the initial January trend shift. (Recall that the 50-day moving average’s slope ticked higher last week, a lagging indicator, consistent with a trend shift.) From current levels, notable support spans from about 115.00 to 116.20. Gold’s recovery attempt is intact barring a violation. Conversely, trendline resistance is within view, circa 118.50, and is closely followed by a target matching the October breakdown point, circa 119.30. Boeing Co. BA, +1.19%  is a Dow 30 component positioned to rise. (Yield = 3.5%.) As illustrated, the shares have recently launched from trendline support, reaching all-time highs amid a sustained volume increase.

The S&P 500 was up 5.34 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,297.9 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 22.95 points, or 0.41 percent, at 5,686.51. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology index's 0.58 percent rise and industrials' 0.56 percent gain leading the advancers. Apple's 1.3 percent rise provided the biggest boost to the S&P and the Nasdaq, while Boeing's 1.9 percent rise helped lift the Dow. Shares of Michael Kors dropped as much as 15.4 percent to a more than one-year low of $34.92, after the handbag maker cut its full-year revenue forecast. Health insurer Centene was up 5.3 percent at $66.99 following better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit. General Motors slipped 4.5 percent to $35.22 after the automaker said fourth-quarter net income fell partly because of $500 million in foreign exchange losses. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P. Twenty-First Century Fox fell 1.9 percent to $30.48 after its quarterly revenue missed Wall Street expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,576 to 1,170. On the Nasdaq, 1,535 issues rose and 1,077 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 25 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 25 new lows.

Mr Pennycook will make way for Steve Murrells, the chief executive of the group's food business, who will join the board on 1 March. Read more Co-op recalls chocolate Easter bunnies after battery found inside In a statement, Allan Leighton, the Co-op’s chairman, said the group owed Mr Pennycook a “huge debt of gratitude” for guiding the organisation on to firmer financial ground. “Richard Pennycook saved our Co-op. In three short years he has rescued and rebuilt our business and restored pride to our 70,000 colleagues and 4.5 million members. We owe Richard a huge debt of gratitude and his place in Co-op history is secured.” The move is one of a number of senior management changes with Pippa Wicks, the former group chief operating officer, becoming the Co-op’s deputy chief executive, and the finance director Jo Whitfield stepping up to the role of interim chief executive at Co-op Food. Mr Pennycook, who first joined as interim chief executive in 2013, will continue to work with the mutual as an adviser, overseeing work to separate the group's pension scheme from the Co-op Bank. The Co-op Group said that Mr Pennycook had guided the firm through the “rescue and rebuild” phases after the mutual came close to collapse. Mr Murrells will now lead the organisation through a so-called “renewal” phase focused on growing the organisation.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The Department of the Navy’s 2017 budget presently accommodates a force of 287 ships, and to bring it back to its 1940s capacity, the Navy would need to double its force. The U.S. maintained 478 active vessels pre-war and peaked with 6,768 at the end of World War II. The president's nostalgia for the 1940s military is good news for the nation’s largest defense ship contractors. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE: GD) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (NYSE: HII) could soon earn significant contracts for large surface combatants and submarines, while Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE: LMT) could score in its littoral combat ship division. While the Navy has a budget of about $11 billion in ship operations alone, it also maintains an extensive inventory of planes — larger even than that of the U.S. Air Force — with air operations budgeted at $8 billion in 2017. Expanding the Navy’s capacity, then, could also favorably impact Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE: NOC), which could seek additional contracts in military aircraft. Tides Are Changing The president’s comments may call attention to the department’s diminished size and force, but the Navy has for years acknowledged its need for expansion. In December, the department released a Force Structure Assessment requesting an additional 68 ships to be able to comply with the Pentagon’s strategic guidance. The wish list included one aircraft carrier, six amphibious warfare ships, eight submarines, 41 surface combatants, nine command and support ships, and three combat logistics ships. The statement noted that the requested fleet of 355 is well below what the Navy desires but is instead the minimum capacity needed to meet demands. “This is the level that balances an acceptable level of warfighting risk to our equipment and personnel against available resources and achieves a force size that can reasonably achieve success,” the report read. To meet global needs with minimal risk, the Navy would need a fleet of 653 ships — a size that would double the Navy’s annual budget and better align with Trump's vision.

February 11, 2017 0953 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:177186 Publish Date: Tue, 07 Feb 2017 14:29:11 GMT Service: Iran SpaceX to hit fastest launch pace Space Exploration Technologies Corp, better known as SpaceX, plans to launch its Falcon 9 rockets every two to three weeks, its fastest rate since starting launches in 2010, once a new launch pad is put into service in Florida next week, the company's president said. The ambitious plan comes only five months after a SpaceX rocket burst into flames on the launch pad at the company's original launch site in Florida, according to Reuters.   SpaceX, controlled by billionaire Elon Musk, has only launched one rocket since then, in mid-January. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said, “We should be launching every two to three weeks.”   SpaceX was approaching that pace last autumn, before the Sept. 1 accident, which happened during a routine preflight test. Shotwell said repairs to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, which are still underway, should cost ‘far less than half’ of a new launch pad, which she said runs about $100 million. The new launch pad is at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, just north of the Cape Canaveral site. Shotwell said, “SpaceX is also modifying the rocket's engines to increase performance and resolve potential safety concerns.” The company plans to change the design of the Falcon 9's turbopump — which provides propellants to the rocket's engines —to eliminate cracks that have prompted concern from NASA and the US Air Force. NASA has hired SpaceX to taxi astronauts to and from the International Space Station starting in late 2018. Shotwell said the new turbopumps will be installed before the first unmanned test flights of the commercial space taxi, scheduled for November. SpaceX is one of two companies certified to fly military and national security satellites for the Air Force, the other being United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). Shotwell said, “For us, the concern was not the cracks, but do they grow over time? Would these cracks cause a flight failure? “I think NASA is used to engines that aren’t quite as robust, so they just don’t want any cracks at all in the turbo machinery. “SpaceX discovered two types of cracks during ground tests of its Merlin engines in 2015.  The cracks were not related to the Sept. 1 launch pad explosion. “To fix the more serious cracking issue, the company devised a software fix and then redesigned the turbine wheel.” The first of the redesigned turbine wheels flew in July 2016. Shotwell added, “A second set of cracks in welds and shrouds are not a concern for flight, but NASA and the Air Force have asked for a redesign.” SpaceX has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion. It has successfully flown 27 out of 29 times since the Falcon 9’s debut in 2010. The company flew eight missions in 2016 before the launch pad accident in September grounded the fleet. The rocket returned to flight last month, flying from a second launch site in California, which is only used for satellites heading into polar or high inclination orbits. A fourth launch site in Texas is under construction.     KeyWords SpaceX fastest launch   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News FM disapproves anti-Kuwaiti picture in Feb. 11 rallies Iran hopes ECO summit in Pakistan will further enhance cooperation US will fully implement JCPOA: EU’s Mogherini NAM deplores US coercive measures against Iran Iran says Daesh elements arrested in vicinity of capital Iranians celebrate 38th anniversary of Islamic Revolution Iran’s Ezzatolahi joins Russian Anzhi Makhachkala Iran defeated by Japan in international basketball friendly Iran’s Jamshidiyan wins omnium cycling silver in Asian meet Iran’s Abadan to host Greco-Roman World Cup 2017 Most Visited ‘Frustrated’ Trump’s insistence on Muslim ban ‘unconstitutional’: Analyst CIA honors Saudi crown prince with 'George Tenet Medal' Trump says he’s considering ‘brand new order’ on immigration www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/1113 sec

(Reuters photo) Monday, President Donald Trump visited U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Florida. Following his visit, the president addressed the senior military commanders and CENTCOM and SOCOM officials who took part in the tour. While reiterating his desire to "build up" the U.S. military, he also gave a bit of a pep talk to the service members. Here is the complete transcript of his comments: I'm honored to be here today among so many of our really and truly great heroes. I want to begin by thanking General Votel and General Thomas for their distinguished leadership and service on behalf of our country. Very, very outstanding people. I'd also like to thank General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's big stuff, when you have the Chairman. Where is—Joe, stand up for a second. This is one of the great people. Thank you. Also, Commander Vogel and everyone serving at MacDill Air Force Base. Quite a place. And we're going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment. You've been lacking a little equipment. We're going to load it up. You're going to get a lot of equipment. Believe me. So importantly, also, let me thank all of the coalition partners and their representatives assembled here today. We proudly—very proudly—stand with you, and we will be fighting for your security. They're fighting for our security and freedom. Let me recognize our great governor and a very good friend of mine, and somebody who endorsed me—that makes him a better friend of mine. You know, if they don't endorse, believe me, if you're ever in this position, it's never quite the same, OK? You can talk, but it never means the same. But this man is a great, great governor and has done a fantastic job—Rick Scott, governor, stand up please. Thank you, Rick. Finally, on behalf of the entire nation, let me express our gratitude to all members—and I mean all members—of our military serving in the United States Central Command and the United States Special Operations Command. We salute the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard, along with our civilian defense personnel, who are so important to the success of what we're doing. Let me also recognize the military families and spouses who bravely shoulder the burdens of war. I want every military family in this country to know that our administration is at your service. We stand with you 100 percent. We will protect those who protect us, and we will never ever let you down. As your president, I have no higher duty than to protect the American people—highest duty we have. I said it the other night. Great, great Supreme Court nominee—you all saw that—but I said to myself, perhaps the only thing more important to me definitely is the defense of our nation. The Supreme Court is so important, but we have to defend our nation. And we will do that, believe me. We will do that. And each and every one of you is central to that mission. The men and women serving at CENTCOM and SOCOM have poured out their hearts and souls for this country. They really experience things that very few people get to experience. You've shed your blood across the continents and the oceans. You've engaged the enemy on distant battlefields, toiled in the burning heat and bitter cold and sacrificed everything so that we can remain safe and strong and free. Our administration will always honor our sacred bond to those who serve, and we will never ever forget you. Believe me, we will never ever forget you. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1816634024" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=1816634024" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement We will ensure that the men and women of our military have the tools, equipment, resources, training and supplies you need to get the job done. You've seen me say we've been depleted. Our Navy is at a point almost as low as World War I. That's a long time ago. That's a long time ago. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. It's not going to happen anymore—not with me. But we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted. I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that. And I want to thank Lockheed Martin and I want to thank Boeing, and I want to thank all of the companies that have really opened up. And when I say opened up, Rick Scott understands this very well—opened up and cut their prices. OK? Because that's what they did. And we've got that program, it's going to be back in really great shape from really being very troubled. And we are going to be taking care of our great veterans. We will make a historic financial investment in the Armed Forces of the United States and show the entire world that America stands with those who stand in defense of freedom. We have your back every hour, every day, now and always. That also means getting our allies to pay their fair share. It's been very unfair to us. We strongly support NATO. We only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper financial contributions to the NATO Alliance, which many of them have not been doing. Many of them have not been even close, and they have to do that. Central Command and Special Operations Command are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism. America stands in awe of your courage. Those serving at CENTCOM have bravely fought across the theater of war in the Middle East, and bravely battled a vicious enemy that has no respect for human life. Today, we express our gratitude to everyone serving overseas, including all of our military personnel in Afghanistan. SOCOM has dispatched its legendary warriors to the most secret, sensitive and daring missions in defense of the United States of America. No enemy stands a chance against our Special Forces—not even a chance. They don't have a chance, and that's the way we're going to keep it. And you're going to be better off because you're going to have the finest equipment known to man. Going to be better off. For proof that our nation has been blessed by God, look no further than the men and women of the United States military. They are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the earth and that the world has ever known. The challenges facing our nation nevertheless are very large—very, very large. We're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction—you've seen that. SIS is on a campaign of genocide, committing atrocities across the world. Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando to San Bernardino. And all across Europe, you've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that. So today, we deliver a message in one very unified voice: To these forces of death and destruction, America and its allies will defeat you. We will defeat them. We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will not allow it to take root in our country. We're not going to allow it. You've been seeing what's been going on over the last few days. We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in—not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country. Freedom, security and justice will prevail. In his first State of the Union message, President George Washington wrote that, "To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace." Almost 200 years later, as the general was also speaking about Ronald Reagan, he said that wisdom comes in three very, very strong words: "Peace through strength." I've said it many times during the campaign, speaking in front of tens of thousands of people at one sitting, and I'd always mention America first—a phrase that you probably never heard, "Make America Great Again." Anybody ever heard that? And peace through strength. The men and women of the United States military provide the strength to bring peace to our troubled, troubled times. We stand behind you. We support your mission. We love our country. We are loyal to our people. We respect our flag. We celebrate our traditions. We honor our heroes. You are our heroes. And we are prepared to fight. And we pray for peace. Leaders are readers! Subscribe now and get 3 magazines for the price of 1. Get Ministry Today, Charisma and SpiritLed Woman all for $24.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Dow, Nasdaq hit record highs as rally regains steam By Reuters Published: 11:29 EST, 7 February 2017 | Updated: 11:29 EST, 7 February 2017 e-mail By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Tanya Agrawal Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were higher in later morning trading on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite hitting record levels and the S&P 500 coming within spitting distance of yet another all-time high. Markets have rallied sharply after Trump's election victory in November, riding on hopes that his plans including simpler regulations, higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts will boost the economy. However, the lack of details regarding economic policies and Trump's focus on isolationist policies, including a travel ban on seven mainly Muslim nations, have also made investors cautious. With the earnings season at its peak, stock valuations are in focus given the run-up in shares. The S&P 500 is trading at 17.7 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have risen 8.2 percent - the best in nine quarters. "We've been getting some back and forth between the new administration's business-friendly policies versus the disruptions economically and politically from the immigration and trade-related issues," said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia. "However, at the end of the day, the expansion is continuing, the economy and earnings are growing and that should support equities." A report from the U.S. Commerce Department showed trade deficit fell more than expected in December as exports rose to their highest level in more than 1-1/2 years, outpacing an increase in imports. At 11:03 a.m. ET (1603 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 80.77 points, or 0.4 percent, at 20,133.19. The S&P 500 was up 5.34 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,297.9 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 22.95 points, or 0.41 percent, at 5,686.51. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology index's 0.58 percent rise and industrials' 0.56 percent gain leading the advancers. Apple's 1.3 percent rise provided the biggest boost to the S&P and the Nasdaq, while Boeing's 1.9 percent rise helped lift the Dow. Shares of Michael Kors dropped as much as 15.4 percent to a more than one-year low of $34.92, after the handbag maker cut its full-year revenue forecast. Health insurer Centene was up 5.3 percent at $66.99 following better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit. General Motors slipped 4.5 percent to $35.22 after the automaker said fourth-quarter net income fell partly because of $500 million in foreign exchange losses. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P. Twenty-First Century Fox fell 1.9 percent to $30.48 after its quarterly revenue missed Wall Street expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,576 to 1,170. On the Nasdaq, 1,535 issues rose and 1,077 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 25 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 25 new lows.

Photos Videos Topics Live BAN 263/6 (86) - IND 687/6 (166) Live SL 296/8 (50) - SA 384/6 (50) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Rahul Gandhi Sasikala Assembly Elections 2017 UP Elections 2017 Raees Home Money US STOCKS-Dow, Nasdaq hit record highs as rally regains steam Shares1 Tue, 7 Feb 2017-10:04pm , Reuters U.S. stocks were higher in later morning trading on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite hitting record levels and the S&P 500 coming within spitting distance of yet another all-time high. Markets have rallied sharply after Trump's election victory in November, riding on hopes that his plans including simpler regulations, higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts will boost the economy. However, the lack of details regarding economic policies and Trump's focus on isolationist policies, including a travel ban on seven mainly Muslim nations, have also made investors cautious. With the earnings season at its peak, stock valuations are in focus given the run-up in shares. The S&P 500 is trading at 17.7 times forward 12-month earnings, above the 10-year median of 14.7 times, according to StarMine data. Fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have risen 8.2 percent - the best in nine quarters. "We've been getting some back and forth between the new administration's business-friendly policies versus the disruptions economically and politically from the immigration and trade-related issues," said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia. "However, at the end of the day, the expansion is continuing, the economy and earnings are growing and that should support equities." A report from the U.S. Commerce Department showed trade deficit fell more than expected in December as exports rose to their highest level in more than 1-1/2 years, outpacing an increase in imports. At 11:03 a.m. ET (1603 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 80.77 points, or 0.4 percent, at 20,133.19. The S&P 500 was up 5.34 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,297.9 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 22.95 points, or 0.41 percent, at 5,686.51. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology index's 0.58 percent rise and industrials' 0.56 percent gain leading the advancers. Apple's 1.3 percent rise provided the biggest boost to the S&P and the Nasdaq, while Boeing's 1.9 percent rise helped lift the Dow. Shares of Michael Kors dropped as much as 15.4 percent to a more than one-year low of $34.92, after the handbag maker cut its full-year revenue forecast. Health insurer Centene was up 5.3 percent at $66.99 following better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit. General Motors slipped 4.5 percent to $35.22 after the automaker said fourth-quarter net income fell partly because of $500 million in foreign exchange losses. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P. Twenty-First Century Fox fell 1.9 percent to $30.48 after its quarterly revenue missed Wall Street expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,576 to 1,170. On the Nasdaq, 1,535 issues rose and 1,077 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 25 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 73 new highs and 25 new lows.

In what it called a “thought exercise,” researcher Baum & Associates LLC estimated most automakers would need to raise vehicle prices by thousands of US dollars — more than US$17,000 per vehicle in Jaguar Land Rover’s case, which imports all its vehicles to the US — to recoup higher costs incurred by a proposed border-adjusted tax. Ford, with significant domestic manufacturing, would need to mull the smallest price increase among major automakers, at about US$282 per vehicle, followed by General Motors Co at US$995, according to the report. The estimates aim to show the relative impact of the tax plan on each automaker, West Bloomfield, Michigan-based Baum & Associates founder Alan Baum said. Automakers are unlikely to raise prices by more than a few thousand dollars per car and would also likely have to foot some of the higher tax burden, he said. “The plan results in a net cost for automakers,” Baum said by telephone. “Each company will then make its own decisions on pricing in order to best compete and maximize its profits.” Volvo Car Corp and Volkswagen AG vehicle prices would have to rise by about US$7,600 and US$6,800 on average respectively, according to estimates by Baum & Associates, which advises suppliers. US President Donald Trump is said to be warming to the border-adjusted tax after initially viewing it as too complicated. The proposal to begin levying companies’ imports and domestic sales, and make exports tax-exempt would completely overhaul the US tax code. General Electric Co and Boeing Co are among US manufacturers getting behind the idea, while Toyota Motor Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc are among the corporate giants warning it would result in costlier products, ranging from food and clothing to gasoline and auto parts. The Baum & Associates report accounts for imports of both finished vehicles and parts for domestic cars that are made overseas. The one automaker that could be able to keep prices steady would be Model S sedan maker Tesla. The proposed border tax might induce automakers to boost US parts procurement and production from existing vehicle assembly plants, the report said. Overseas automakers including Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd’s Subaru, Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Mazda Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp might also consider expanding existing US operations or building new capacity, it said. “Pure importers,” such as Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo parent company Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd, Mazda and Mitsubishi, are most “in the crosshairs” of a border-tax regime due to their total reliance on imports for their US sales, the report said. If the tax is put in place and the companies want to remain competitive, Jaguar Land Rover and Volvo “will need to ramp up US parts sourcing and/or build plants here [in the US],” the report said. “The border tax approach will otherwise consume all of their profits from selling vehicles here.” Volvo is already moving in that direction, with plans to assemble S60 sedans at a new factory in South Carolina starting late next year. General Motors, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda, Ford and Tesla each source more than 60 percent of their US vehicle sales in the US, according to the report, with Ford at 82 percent and Tesla exclusively assembling vehicles in California.

News Business Business Comment BP: Why a messy debate over the CEO's pay counts as progress after Deepwater Horizon The oil giant's compensation bill is falling, and it is investing and making profits again  James Moore @JimMooreJourno Tuesday 7 February 2017 15:25 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, received a bumper pay package despite losses PA Let’s not kid ourselves, the Deepwater Horizon disaster still casts a long and dark shadow over BP.  The company’s latest results make that clear. It continued to add to the vast pile of money set aside to compensate the victims of a disaster that killed 11 people and saw black gunk pouring into the Gulf of Mexico nearly seven years ago, all over local wildlife and the livelihoods of people living in the vicinity.  Read more BP misses forecasts as annual earnings slide again Big oil pledge to tackle climate change dismissed as ‘drop in ocean’ Shell says oil demand could peak in five years The company’s cumulative payout now stands at a staggering $62.6bn (£50.4bn). The 2016 charge of $6.9bn looks like another enormous addition, until you consider that it compares to a charge of $12.3bn in 2015 and therefore represents something like progress. Lots of people are saying that BP is now through the worst, but that’s entirely the wrong way of looking at it. You don’t get “through” an event that kills people, pollutes a vast area and produces losses like that. You learn from it, and ensure that it becomes embedded in the corporate DNA – to the extent that the next time an ambitious executives suggests scrimping on irksome safety requirements to save a bit on costs, they get fired.  Still, it remains true that the business is now at least making money, albeit a lot less money than BP’s analysts had been expecting. Some 29 per cent less in the final three months of the year, if you compare BP’s net income with their consensus forecast.  The company is also investing in new projects. Given the environmental damage caused simply by burning oil when you’re not spilling it into the sea, it’s hard not to view that fact with anything other than mixed feelings. But having continually preached the virtues of investing for the long term, I’d be a hypocrite if I failed to recognise that BP is doing so.  It is, in fact, taking risks to look to its future. The company makes clear that it needs the price of Brent Crude to sit at $60 a barrel for its cash flow to cover its investment plans and the promises it has made to shareholders over dividends.  By contrast, Shell is more or less happy at today’s $55 or so, as is Exxon Mobil. BP therefore represents the riskier option, notwithstanding the pall cast over the company by its recent history.  It would only take Opec members to start increasing production for things to get painful, and for those newly minted profits to evaporate. At the very least, cost cuts could be expected to follow.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

SolAero, in a statement, says that it is expanding its existing facility to meet the new demand. SolAero already supplies solar panels to satellites and will start qualifying OneWeb’s order in March in readiness to supply panels by September. OneWeb’s unit have to be fully space qualified in order to handle severe space radiation and thermal stress conditions. Its client list is impressive and the company says it has some 180 satellites flying with its technology, including satellites from Space Systems/Loral, Boeing and the European Space Agency. OneWeb Satellites, a joint-venture between OneWeb and Europe’s Airbus aerospace comp any, is also creating a new facility at Exploration Park, Florida, where it intends building the Low Earth orbiting broadband satellites.

News Business Business News Lloyds apologises for distress caused by ‘utterly corrupt’ bankers in £245m HBOS loan scam Lender will now review cases and pay compensation 'if appropriate', following pressure from MPs Ben Chapman Tuesday 7 February 2017 14:08 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online David Mills, centre, and his colleague Michael Bancroft, left, Lynden Scourfield, right Thames Valley Police Lloyds Banking Group, owner of HBOS, said it will review the cases of hundreds of its customers who were scammed in a £245m fraud, involving two former employees. On Monday, MPs had put pressure on Lloyds to pay compensation for the damage caused. The bank had maintained that it was actually a victim in the case.  “The group deeply regrets that the criminal actions have caused such distress for a number of HBOS business customers,” Lloyds said in a statement on Tuesday. Read more Former HBOS bankers convicted of bribery and fraud over £245m scam "Customer cases will be considered afresh in light of all relevant evidence including new evidence that emerged during the trial.” The bank said that it was important that it “did not do or say anything that could subsequently prejudice the trial. It also said that it would now “proactively” contact affected customers and provide redress if appropriate, but that it advised anyone who thought they had a valid case for compensation to contact the bank. The eventual cost of the fraud could be up to £1bn, the BBC reported, citing sources close to the investigation.

When handing out the sentence, Judge Martin Beddoe described Mr Scourfield as an “utterly corrupt bank manager” driven by “rapacious greed”.  Mr Scourfield pressured business customers into using a turnaround consultancy run by his friends David Mills and Michael Bancroft. The men then fleeced businesses with high fees, saddled them with excessive debt and stripped them of assets, driving many into bankruptcy. In return for his services, Mr Mills and Mr Bancroft arranged sex parties for Mr Scourfield and showered him with exotic foreign holidays and cash bribes. Also convicted for their roles in the scam were Mark Dobson, 56, another former HBOS manager, David Mills’ wife, Alison, 51, and accomplice John Cartwright, 72.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

News Business Business Comment Brexit: The harsh reality of the flexible economy PwC thinks will do fine Flexible economies sacrifice workers' rights on the altar of keeping employers' costs down. The result is insecure employment, and the TUC makes clear that this is increasingly becoming the norm  James Moore @JimMooreJourno Tuesday 7 February 2017 13:25 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Waiting staff are among those who live with insecure employment in Britain's flexible economy Getty PricewaterhouseCoopers clearly wants to be the Brexiteer’s fave accountant.  The firm has just published a report saying it that might not be so bad after all. Triggering Article 50, it argues, will ultimately prove no more than a bump in the road when it comes to the UK economy’s long-term health.  That should ensure PwC keeps Tim Martin’s business at Wetherspoon’s for starters. But before Britain’s noisiest business Brexiteer spills his pint in delight at there being at least one economist that takes a similar view to him, it’s worth just spending a few moments reflecting on why the firm feels it can take this stance without being laughed out of the room.  Read more Ths is the reality of Brexit Britain – and it's going to be painful Leaving EU with no deal an 'iceberg' that will sink May's Brexit hopes Corbyn facing fresh rebellion after issuing second three-line whip Chief economist John Hawksworth says the UK should do better than many of its rivals because of its “relatively flexible economy by European standards”.  Now let’s take a moment to consider what that means. “Flexible economy” is one of those bland phrases that are sometimes used to describe unpleasant things in an attempt to make them a bit more palatable. It’s not quite as bad as describing killing civilians as “collateral damage” but it comes from the same place.  A “flexible economy” is one that allows employers to do pretty much what they like in the name of keeping their costs down. Flexible economies allow people like, say, Mr Martin, to easily fire workers if he feels the need. They accord employees few rights, and are more accepting of practices such as hiring people on zero hours contracts than economies considered to be inflexible.  Proponents argue that they keep more people in work. But it is the type of work for which wages can be changed (for which, read cut) at the drop of a hat. Employees, when they have old-fashioned things such as employment contracts, may not enjoy paid holidays, or even access to sick pay. What’s that? You need to know your hours for the purposes of securing childcare? Pah. Get with the programme. Don’t you understand what a flexible economy means? It means you have to be flexible, not us.  It’s worth noting that on the same day as PwC published its report, the TUC published another one that it commissioned from the Learning and Work Institute.  It found that insecure work has increased by a quarter since 2011 and that one in ten people are now in it. That the increase has been driven by care workers and waiting staff, while depressing, probably won’t come as a great surprise anyone. But the report also cites education workers – notably teachers – as accounting for a tenth of the increase. In other words, insecure work is spreading throughout the labour market. If you’re not in it now, you might be very soon.  This is the reality of the flexible economy that people like Mr Hawksworth cheer and think will make for a better outcome, post Brexit, than the majority of forecasters feel.  Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country.

BERND THISSEN/AFP/Getty Images 3/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Yet it is only the continuation of that insecurity that, according to PwC, will keep the UK’s economic head above water from now on.  Mr Hawksworth also notes that for his rosy view to be realised, the UK will need to remain open to “talented workers”.

RedEye Your weekend plans. Delivered. Business Business Columnists Suburbs vs. city: Who will win the wooing contest for Caterpillar's headquarters? What Caterpillar builds, from small to large Take a look at some of the equipment Caterpillar produces. The company is planning on moving its headquarters from Peoria to the Chicago area.  Take a look at some of the equipment Caterpillar produces. The company is planning on moving its headquarters from Peoria to the Chicago area.  Robert ReedContact ReporterChicago Tribune It's on: Suburbs versus the city. That's among the area's oldest economic development matchups and, right now, an interesting contest is shaping up over who is going to win the headquarters of massive manufacturer Caterpillar, which last week said it was leaving longtime home Peoria for the "Chicago area." Even as the company's brain trust made its startling relocation proclamation, some observers considered it a fait accompli that the HQ would end up in or around the West Loop. As such, Cat would join fellow blue chippers, including Google and McDonald's, in a quest to raise (or find) its "cool" factor and lure a more digitally savvy and multicultural workforce. But real estate and economic development sources say Cat, which sells big machinery and construction products worldwide, is also pretty serious about being near O'Hare International Airport. That doesn't rule Chicago out, but it does open up opportunities for DuPage County and Cook County's Rosemont, which border the airport from opposite directions, and crave such a high-profile company. "The marquee value is very, very valuable," says John Carpenter, CEO of the Choose DuPage Economic Development Alliance. Already, DuPage County Board Chairman Dan Cronin has sent a letter to Caterpillar CEO James Umpleby touting his west suburban area and stressing a willingness to work with Cat's relocation team. Although no tax breaks or deals are mentioned, Cronin's letter stresses DuPage's business base and that the ongoing Western Access O'Hare Project will provide "convenient, hassle-free access" to the airport. That's true, but it won't be for a while. Peoria resident discusses Caterpillar's HQ move to Chicago area Peoria resident Ryan Murphy discusses Caterpillar's plan to move its headquarters out of Peoria to the Chicago area. Jan. 31, 2017.

Kim / Chicago Tribune) See more videos The estimated $3.4 billion roadway project is being constructed in stages until 2025 with a ramp into O'Hare as soon as 2019, according to the Illinois Tollway. On the eastern side of the airport, Rosemont Mayor Bradley Stephens is mulling ways to entice the company brass. Right now, the catnip on the table includes using a tax increment financing district, property or other types of tax breaks, helping with office build-outs and other sweeteners, says Gary Mack, a village spokesman. Since Cat seems intent on renting office space for its estimated 300 employees, the village is also open to working with a landlord on a package that would help land Cat, he added. Mayor Stephens hasn't spoken to Cat's CEO but hopes to soon have a conversation. "We'd love to have them here and you can't get any closer to O'Hare than Rosemont," Mack said. While the suburbs are openly teeing up their sales pitches, the city of Chicago is being — shall we say — more circumspect. Views from Peoria on Jan. 31, 2017, the day Caterpillar announced it will move its headquarters to the Chicago area from the central Illinois city. (John J. Kim / Chicago Tribune) City Hall isn't saying if it is in talks with Caterpillar but Mayor Rahm Emanuel has cheered the company's relocation decision. Anything can happen, but realistically it seems unlikely the city will offer Cat any major public tax breaks or big relocation incentives, even if the suburbs go that way. This is a much different era than before. In 2001, for example, the city and state combined to give Boeing about $58 million in various incentives over an estimated 25-year span to relocate its HQ to Chicago from Seattle — beating out Dallas and Denver. Now, Chicago and Illinois' heavy burden of public debt, which amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars in unpaid bills, growing operating costs and underfunded pension liabilities makes such corporate largesse unseemly and unaffordable. Right now, City Hall's message is more like: "Other major corporations have made the move to Chicago. Why not you?" Caterpillar isn't saying too much either. In an email to me, Caterpillar spokesperson Corrie Scott said the company has "been in touch with several different community leaders in the Chicago area since our announcement," but didn't expand on that reply. However, Caterpillar did add it wasn't slamming the door on any opportunity that offered to discuss public perks. "Incentives were not the driver in our announcement. However, we are considering all options as we select a site," Scott said in the email. That's an intriguing comment. To me, it says taxpayers may help pave the way for Cat's big Chicago-area move. roreed@chicagotribune.com Twitter @reedtribbiz Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune O'Hare International Airport Chicago City Hall Caterpillar will move headquarters to Chicago area, citing transportation access In Peoria, Caterpillar's move feels like 'kick in the gut' Cat's new HQ goal: Change culture Sports Breaking Trending RedEye Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Advertising 38°

InnoCorp announces SubMurres - its revolutionary, unrivaled, unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drone-transitioning from water to air to land without any individual or multiple deployments, fission of elements, (as in rockets), or complicated maneuvering. It's here-what the top tech companies and governments around the world are vigorously seeking! Like the Murres, a unique seabird which can circumnavigate in air and in water, SubMurres does both in unprecedented fashion. Patent-protected SubMurres has all the key features of a submarine, including complete marine functionality, communication tower with periscope for panoramic viewing of above-water landscape, dual propulsion blades, fully-articulated rotors that emerge as needed, sensors, and more. But it doesn't end there. The dual submarine aircraft moves ubiquitously from water to air. As a submarine, SubMurres glide silently underwater performing its mission as it surfaces. Once on the water surface its flight system is engaged and its four rotors emerge from their compartments as vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) is initiated. Once airborne, there is no expulsion of parts. SubMurres simply flies unfettered, with all components intact. Its landing apparatus allow it to settle on terrain, and its second camera system allows it to fully capture surroundings. From land, it can be directly re-dispatched to water. No need to redeploy or to be picked up by another carrier aircraft, unlike any of the chief aeronautic industry or Navy-funded university's latest submersive drone models! SubMurres can return to the water without redeployment from another submarine or any other transport vehicle. Unlike other drones in use today, the device is controlled by command rather than by a thin tethered wire or other medium. SubMurres is a diesel/battery powered vehicle. It has a main diesel engine, a generator, and a battery bank. The diesel's engine can either power the vehicle or run the generator that recharges the battery bank. As a diesel/battery powered UUV/UAV, SubMurres surfaces to run its diesel engine to charge the batteries. Once fully charged, SubMurres can head underwater using the battery-powered electric motors to drive its thrusters, sensors, cameras, and related equipment. While diesel/battery powered submarines are nothing new, InnoCorp is the first to implement this technology in a UUV/UAV drone, thereby significantly extending its operational capacity. "There is nothing in the world like SubMurres! There is nothing like this anywhere," says InnoCorp CEO, Jae Lee. He adds: "Even the innovative industry moguls like Boeing and its latest hailed "flying submarine" requires additional aircraft to carry it, as shared in its video release. Boeing's drone and many others like it currently being used or in development are not autonomous vehicles -unlike what we've developed. What we've got is a total game-changer." Attached are photographs of this revolutionary drone. With its sleek aerodynamic design, seen from several angles as it transforms from submarine to boat, to helicopter and to airplane. SubMurres is truly not one vehicle but four - having complete but separately integrated systems that allow it to rotate to any of those functions. SubMurres have stunning, game-changing implications for military operations; for drilling; for subsurface inspections (such as bridge footings and piers); for gaming and film-making; for the toy industry, and more. SubMurres brings the full meaning of autonomous vehicles to life. View an animated video please here Comment on this article using your Disqus, Facebook, Google or Twitter login.
