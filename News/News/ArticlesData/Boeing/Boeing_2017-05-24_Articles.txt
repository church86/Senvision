Most Popular DARPA By Jay Bennett May 24, 2017 DARPA announced today that it has selected Boeing to design and build a new reusable, hypersonic spaceplane called the Phantom Express that would fly into high suborbital altitudes to launch satellites into orbit before coming back down to land horizontally like an airplane. The unmanned craft, part of the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program, would release a small expendable upper stage rocket after it reaches suborbital altitudes. The upper stage would continue to carry the payload to orbit while the first stage—the spaceplane itself—would bank and return to Earth to land on a runway. DARPA hopes the XS-1 will allow the Department of Defense to launch satellites into low Earth orbit with only a few days' notice, compared to the months it currently takes to plan satellite launches, and that the spaceplane will be capable of landing and relaunching within hours.

"We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight." Unlike the Air Force's X-37B unmanned spaceplane that launches on top of an Atlas V rocket, the XS-1 will launch vertically on its own internal engines using cryogenic propellants—liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The Phantom Express, roughly the size of a business jet, would fly to hypersonic speeds over Mach 5 to reach high suborbital altitudes before releasing the satellite-launching second stage to carry a payload up to 3,000 pounds the rest of the way to low Earth orbit. Phase 2 of the Experimental Spaceplane program covers design, construction, and testing of the craft, including 10 test fires of the propulsion system over 10 days to demonstrate the system is robust enough for quick turnaround launches. Phase 2 is expected to last through 2019. Then the defense agency along with Boeing hope to begin flight tests in 2020 during Phase 3. A total of between 12 and 15 test flights are tentatively planned, with the first few conducted as shakedown flights to extensively test the spaceplane. After those initial flights are completed, DARPA wants to launch the XS-1 10 times in 10 days, culminating with a flight carrying the upper-stage satellite delivery system. Concept image of DARPA's XS-1 experimental spaceplane, to be built by Boeing and slated to achieve first flight by 2020. YouTube DARPA If the program is successful, DARPA predicts the XS-1 could operate with costs under $5 million per launch. The XS-1 will make use of Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engines—modified Space Shuttle main engines—composite materials for propellant tanks, autonomous flight control technologies, and hybrid composite-metallic wings and surfaces to withstand the high stress of hypersonic flight and temperatures as high as 2,000º F. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," said Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, in a press release. In addition to providing launch services to the military, DARPA plans to share key design specifications for the XS-1 with commercial spaceflight companies. The defense agency stated that it is a goal to facilitate the commercial sector to take advantage of XS-1 technologies to reduce launch costs across the board. In the next couple years we could see some engine test fires, and then come 2020, if all goes according to plan, the first ship in the Experimental Spaceplane program will take to the skies.

On Wednesday, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced that Boeing will continue to work with them on the next phase of their Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. The goal of the program is to build an autonomous aircraft that’s capable of launching into orbit 10 times over the course of 10 days by 2020. DARPA has picked a design for its Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) and awarded Phases 2 & 3 of the program to @Boeinghttps://t.co/lJmGc2TNHwpic.twitter.com/Dcr7LZQbMb— DARPA (@DARPA) May 24, 2017 “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two,” Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager, said in a news release. Roughly the size and weight of a modern business jet, the spaceplane, known as the Phantom Express, will be able to take off vertically like a rocket and fly at hypersonic speeds. The current design of the Phantom Express does not include external boosters like a modern spaceship. It will be powered by an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants. “This engine has a demonstrated track record of solid performance and proven reusability,” Eileen Drake, president and CEO of Aerojet Rocketdyne, said in a statement. Once in space, the Phantom Express will be capable of deploying a small satellite weighing up to 3,000 pounds into low-Earth orbit, according to a news release from Boeing.  On the journey back to Earth, the space plane will land horizontally on a runway, where it can be prepared for the next flight “potentially within hours,” according to DARPA. DARPA says the design of the Phantom Express will bring the cost of a launch down to $5 million, ten times lower than current costs. Boeing has been working with DARPA and two other companies on phase one of the XS-1 project, which involved the development and concept of the design. Now, only the aerospace company will continue to work with the agency on phases two and three, beginning with the construction phase. After the construction, DARPA and Boeing plan to conduct 10 launches over a period of 10 days to demonstrate the cost efficiency and reliability of the Phantom Express. The project is scheduled to begin conducting flight tests in 2020.

While DARPA’s goal for the project is focused on bolstering “national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space,” they are also encouraging companies to invest in the spaceflight technology. The agency says they intend to “release selected data from its Phase 2/3 tests and will provide to all interested commercial entities the relevant specs for potential payloads.” “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Back in November, when the Liberal government announced it would be making an “interim” purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing, it was all about the need for speed. There wasn’t time to hold an “open competition” to select a permanent replacement for the air force’s aging fleet of CF-18s, as the Liberals had promised during the election. The reason: the government had discovered a critical “capability gap” in our air defences that had to be filled at once. Well, here we are in May, and the Super Hornets that were supposedly so urgently necessary to the defence of our national borders turn out to be just another in the apparently endless list of pawns to be sacrificed in pursuit of the Trudeau government’s real and only strategic objective, propping up Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. Billions of dollars in direct and indirect aid to Bombardier, from both the federal and Quebec governments, having met with the entirely predictable response from its competitors — not only a suit before the World Trade Organization on behalf of Brazil’s Embraer, but latterly a complaint to the U.S. Commerce department by Boeing, demanding retaliatory duties of nearly 160 per cent — the government has now taken the unprecedented step of tying an important procurement decision to the outcome of a private trade dispute. “Canada is reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing,” Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland declared last week, adding: “Our government will defend the interests of Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace industry and our aerospace workers.” As if the implied threats were not quite heavy-handed enough, Canada’s ambassador to Washington, David MacNaughton, volunteered his opinion that Boeing, by availing itself of the remedies for alleged unfair trade practices prescribed under the laws of the United States, was guilty of “lousy customer relations.” Nice little fighter-jet deal you got there. Pity if anything should happen to it. The particulars of the dispute, we should be clear, are not the issue. Whatever the technical definition of an illegal export subsidy, there is no doubt that Bombardier is the beneficiary of government subsidy — many of them, in fact. Neither is there much disagreement that last year’s sale of 75 CSeries passenger jets to Delta — at a substantial loss — would not have been possible, for a company that was deep in debt and rapidly running out of cash, without the timely arrival of $1.3 billion in aid from the government of Quebec. Bombardier does not even bother to deny much of this. It says only that the scale of the support, and the discount on the planes, was not unusual or out of bounds, in an industry in which all of the players, including Boeing, are heavily subsidized. Which is true. It doesn’t make any side’s subsidy any smarter — indeed, that all sides are subsidizing each other’s jets to a draw only makes the stupidity of the whole exercise more obvious. Neither is the folly of one government’s subsidy made less by another’s tariff. Rather than punish Delta for exploiting Bombardier’s weakness, the U.S. government would be better advised to take the Quebec taxpayers’ money and run. So everyone’s in the wrong. That’s not the point. The point, rather, is that the government of Canada seems willing to escalate a dispute between two private companies into an all-out trade war — one that, as by far the smaller partner, we are in no position to win. If there is any country that has an interest in a rules-based approach to resolving trade disputes, it is us. If the U.S. is abusing its own trade laws, there are other and better remedies available to us than cancelling procurement deals, whether through NAFTA or the WTO. If it is not — if it is we who are in the wrong, legally speaking — all the more reason not to do so. It’s not clear what the government’s end game is. Suppose our bluff is called — Boeing refuses to withdraw its complaint, the relevant U.S. authorities find in its favour, the tariffs are applied. Is it really ready to nix the Super Hornets deal in response? Perhaps it is. The “interim” purchase has been almost universally criticized by military experts as an expensive distraction: what is needed, nearly everyone agrees, is to get started on acquiring a permanent replacement fleet. The “capability gap” was a transparent invention: the underlying rationale, that we had to be ready to meet all of our NATO and NORAD obligations simultaneously, had never previously been part of defence doctrine. Related F-35 jets waiting in wings as Liberals’ ‘interim’ Super Hornet purchase in limbo Ottawa hints Boeing shouldn’t take military contracts for granted in trade spat with Bombardier ‘Stand up for American companies’: Bombardier and Boeing clash at trade hearing in Washington Absolutely nothing stands in the way, in other words, of the government going ahead with the promised competition — nothing, except the Liberals’ other, and contradictory, promise that the Lockheed F-35 favoured by the previous Conservative government would not be part of it. But a truly open competition would expose the government to the embarrassing risk that the F-35, against which the Liberals had inveighed to much political effect, might win. So: put off the competition until after the next election, using the interim purchase as a pretext. If it costs $12 billion, all in, for planes that would likely be junked in 10 years, well, what price power? But now the Liberals have dragged one costly policy misstep into the midst of another, trapping themselves in yet another fork of their own making. Either the Super Hornets are an urgently needed stopgap for a glaring deficiency in our military capacity, in which case the Liberals’ clumsy attempt at blackmail, if it does not collapse in humiliation, would trade away national security for the benefit of a failing, but well-connected, private company. Or the planes, contrary to the government’s repeated assurances, were every bit as expendable as they now appear — in which case the Liberals merely broke a key election promise and lied about it. Either way, it seems so unlike them. Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar Array National More Andrew Coyne: ‘Urgent’ Super Hornets just another pawn in Trudeau’s desire to prop up Bombardier Andrew Coyne  05.24.2017 ShareAdjustCommentPrint Back in November, when the Liberal government announced it would be making an “interim” purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing, it was all about the need for speed. There wasn’t time to hold an “open competition” to select a permanent replacement for the air force’s aging fleet of CF-18s, as the Liberals had promised during the election. The reason: the government had discovered a critical “capability gap” in our air defences that had to be filled at once. Well, here we are in May, and the Super Hornets that were supposedly so urgently necessary to the defence of our national borders turn out to be just another in the apparently endless list of pawns to be sacrificed in pursuit of the Trudeau government’s real and only strategic objective, propping up Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. Billions of dollars in direct and indirect aid to Bombardier, from both the federal and Quebec governments, having met with the entirely predictable response from its competitors — not only a suit before the World Trade Organization on behalf of Brazil’s Embraer, but latterly a complaint to the U.S. Commerce department by Boeing, demanding retaliatory duties of nearly 160 per cent — the government has now taken the unprecedented step of tying an important procurement decision to the outcome of a private trade dispute. “Canada is reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing,” Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland declared last week, adding: “Our government will defend the interests of Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace industry and our aerospace workers.” As if the implied threats were not quite heavy-handed enough, Canada’s ambassador to Washington, David MacNaughton, volunteered his opinion that Boeing, by availing itself of the remedies for alleged unfair trade practices prescribed under the laws of the United States, was guilty of “lousy customer relations.” Nice little fighter-jet deal you got there. Pity if anything should happen to it. The particulars of the dispute, we should be clear, are not the issue. Whatever the technical definition of an illegal export subsidy, there is no doubt that Bombardier is the beneficiary of government subsidy — many of them, in fact. Neither is there much disagreement that last year’s sale of 75 CSeries passenger jets to Delta — at a substantial loss — would not have been possible, for a company that was deep in debt and rapidly running out of cash, without the timely arrival of $1.3 billion in aid from the government of Quebec. Bombardier does not even bother to deny much of this. It says only that the scale of the support, and the discount on the planes, was not unusual or out of bounds, in an industry in which all of the players, including Boeing, are heavily subsidized. Which is true. It doesn’t make any side’s subsidy any smarter — indeed, that all sides are subsidizing each other’s jets to a draw only makes the stupidity of the whole exercise more obvious. Neither is the folly of one government’s subsidy made less by another’s tariff. Rather than punish Delta for exploiting Bombardier’s weakness, the U.S. government would be better advised to take the Quebec taxpayers’ money and run. So everyone’s in the wrong. That’s not the point. The point, rather, is that the government of Canada seems willing to escalate a dispute between two private companies into an all-out trade war — one that, as by far the smaller partner, we are in no position to win. If there is any country that has an interest in a rules-based approach to resolving trade disputes, it is us. If the U.S. is abusing its own trade laws, there are other and better remedies available to us than cancelling procurement deals, whether through NAFTA or the WTO. If it is not — if it is we who are in the wrong, legally speaking — all the more reason not to do so. It’s not clear what the government’s end game is. Suppose our bluff is called — Boeing refuses to withdraw its complaint, the relevant U.S. authorities find in its favour, the tariffs are applied. Is it really ready to nix the Super Hornets deal in response? Perhaps it is. The “interim” purchase has been almost universally criticized by military experts as an expensive distraction: what is needed, nearly everyone agrees, is to get started on acquiring a permanent replacement fleet. The “capability gap” was a transparent invention: the underlying rationale, that we had to be ready to meet all of our NATO and NORAD obligations simultaneously, had never previously been part of defence doctrine. Absolutely nothing stands in the way, in other words, of the government going ahead with the promised competition — nothing, except the Liberals’ other, and contradictory, promise that the Lockheed F-35 favoured by the previous Conservative government would not be part of it. But a truly open competition would expose the government to the embarrassing risk that the F-35, against which the Liberals had inveighed to much political effect, might win. So: put off the competition until after the next election, using the interim purchase as a pretext. If it costs $12 billion, all in, for planes that would likely be junked in 10 years, well, what price power? But now the Liberals have dragged one costly policy misstep into the midst of another, trapping themselves in yet another fork of their own making. Either the Super Hornets are an urgently needed stopgap for a glaring deficiency in our military capacity, in which case the Liberals’ clumsy attempt at blackmail, if it does not collapse in humiliation, would trade away national security for the benefit of a failing, but well-connected, private company. Or the planes, contrary to the government’s repeated assurances, were every bit as expendable as they now appear — in which case the Liberals merely broke a key election promise and lied about it. Either way, it seems so unlike them. Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Almost 25 years since the -3 model started flying on the Boeing 737 Classic, more than 24,000 iterations of the engine are still in service, and it will take nearly another decade for the CFM56’s successor—the CFM Leap—to overtake it in the global fleet. Numbers of the two most popular variants, the CFM56-5B powering the Airbus A320 family and the -7B for the Boeing 737NG series, will continue to grow until 2020, according to Aviation Week’s 2017 Commercial Aviation Fleet & MRO Forecast. CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines, predicts that it will produce roughly 1,400 CFM56 engines this year, 1,000 in 2018, 250 in 2019 and 100 in 2020. Against the Leap, this means that the CFM56’s share of production will decrease from 78% this year, to 51% in 2018, to 11% in 2019 and to 5% in 2020. “Keep in mind that 2017 to 2020 are projections only; the CFM56 product line is still selling,” notesJamie Jewell, CFM’s director of strategic communications. Naturally, CFM takes its cue from narrowbody production at Airbus and Boeing, and particularly the latter, since CFM is the sole engine supplier for the 737NG and 737 MAX. Boeing’s rate of 42 single-aisles per month is dominated by the CFM56-7B-powered 737NG, but by 2020, when 57 will roll out monthly, the majority should be Leap-equipped 737 MAXs. CFM says that CFM56 production peaked in 2016 at 1,665 units, while Aviation Week forecasts that the in-service fleet will top out in 2018 at just under 25,000 engines. Nonetheless, accurate forecasts about engine numbers are tricky, not least because Boeing hasn’t specified its ratio of 737NGs to MAXs going forward. Also, some analysts think that production plans, including Airbus’s rise to 60 narrowbodies per month in 2019, are too aggressive. Slower growth in emerging markets, combined with ongoing cheap fuel could lead to a spate of deferrals for new aircraft, meaning the CFM56 count could stay higher for longer. History suggests how market-leading engines are superseded. In 1997, there were almost 4,000 CFM56-3s flying on 737 Classic aircraft worldwide. The engine was approaching the peak of its popularity, but in the same year the 737NG entered service, sporting a new, more efficient powerplant, the CFM56-7, which became the fastest-selling engine to that date. Production of the older CFM56-3 ceased four years later. Even so, the in-service fleet of -7s only overtook that of -3s in 2005, eight years after the former engine’s introduction. CFM56-3 values fell rapidly after in-service numbers were overtaken by its successor, the CFM56-7. There appear to be parallels between the introductions of the CFM56-7 and the Leap, which were both designed to offer better fuel burn on re-engined variants of popular narrowbodies. CFM expects to complete transition to Leap production in 2020, so -7 production will wind down in roughly the same time as the -3—about four years after the introduction of their successors. However, there also are several reasons why the CFM56-7’s story will not just repeat that of the CFM56-3. First, the newer engine outsold its predecessor almost three to one across a longer production run. Engine values usually start to drop once the population of a new iteration succeeds that of the older, so pricing for the CFM56-7 (and, to a lesser extent, the CFM56-5B) could remain stable for another decade. On the other hand, Leap’s fuel-burn gain of 16% is twice what the -7 offered over the -3. From 2002 to 2008, oil rose from $30 to $145 per barrel, and CFM56-3 values were cut in half. Future oil price inflation could mean a quicker-than-expected demise for the -7. Reliability berholung eines CFM56-7B-Triebwerks bei der Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg. / Overhaul of a CFM56-7B engine at Lufthansa Technik in Hamburg.  Credit: Lufthansa Technik Any discussion of the CFM56’s future must note its exceptional reliability. When the -7 was introduced, its predicted mean time between overhaul was 20,000 hr., but engines operating in clement conditions have lasted up to one-third longer—to the consternation of some MRO providers. Given this reliability and a production rate that peaked only last year, the bow wave of CFM56 overhauls is yet to arrive. CFM56-7 maintenance spending will jump from $3.3 billion to $4.2 billion next year, stabilize until 2022, and then steadily rise to $6.5 billion by 2026, predicts Aviation Week’s 2017 Commercial Aviation Fleet & MRO Forecast. “We are seeing an upward trend for CFM56-5B and -7B shop visits, as more are due for scheduled maintenance, and we expect the trend to continue in the next year or so,” says Choo Han Khoon, executive vice president of engine total support at ST Aerospace. Better-than-predicted reliability and a long production run mean that CFM56-7 maintenance won’t peak until the mid-2020s. Maintenance spending on the A320’s CFM56-5B powerplant will grow less dramatically than on the -7B but is still expected to rise by about one-third in the next 10 years. In contrast, the mature CFM56-3 represents a shrinking market for MRO providers. Rather than overhaul such old engines, many operators decide instead to tear them down for parts or lease-in a replacement that still retains some service life. Aviation Week forecasts that the CFM56-3 fleet will drop to 525 from 1,970 engines by 2026, and that MRO demand will fall to $74 million from $479 million. The Maintenance Market The CFM56 has more MRO options than any other engine. Globally, 42 facilities offer CFM56 overhauls and even Pratt & Whitney maintains its competitor’s powerplant. Unlike widebody engine OEMs, CFM has not tried to dominate the aftermarket, so a healthy mix of independent MROs, airline affiliates and OEMs all offer services. This deep market helps keep maintenance prices down and is, according to lessors, a major factor behind the enduring residual values of CFM56-5 and -7 engines. CFM has promised to keep maintenance costs for the Leap at a similar level to the -7 and -5. This should ease the transition from CFM56 to Leap, although wavering buyers will pay close attention to the reliability of the new powerplant, which incorporates several new technologies. That said, more than half of Leap engines have been sold with an OEM maintenance contract, a much higher proportion than for the CFM56. CFM Services, which provides the maintenance, is now a joint effort between Safran and GE; the two manufacturing partners once competed in the CFM56 aftermarket. The OEMs service about one-third of the global CFM56 fleet. Such changes might not bode well for MRO pricing. Discussing Rolls-Royce’s ubiquitous TotalCare contracts, one customer tells Inside MRO: “We can’t tell if it is a good offer or not because there’s nothing to compare it with.” Nonetheless, the sheer volume of Leap orders, now over 12,000, should ensure that independent MRO providers will eventually develop the needed overhaul capabilities.  Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

  U.S. to build hypersonic spaceplane that can fly 10 times in 10 days                Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo   Source: Xinhua | 2017-05-25 03:41:10 | Editor: huaxia Phantom Express is envisioned as a highly autonomous experimental spaceplane, shown preparing to launch its expendable second stage on the top of the vehicle in this artist's concept. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is collaborating with Boeing to fund development of the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. (Xinhua/Boeing Rendering) WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced Wednesday it has selected Boeing company to design, build and test the first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would be able to fly 10 times in 10 days. The unmanned vehicle, known as Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1), roughly the size of a business jet, would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speed. But unlike the U.S. military's X-37B spaceplane that launches with an external booster, it would be powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants, the DARPA said in a statement. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the spaceplane would release an expendable upper stage that is able to deploy a 3,000-pound (1,360-kilogram) satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. Currently, months or years of preparation is needed to send a single satellite into orbit. According to the DARPA, building XS-1 will need significant advances in both technical capabilities and ground operations, but "would revolutionize the Nation's ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent." "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager. Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 design beat out concepts proposed by Masten Space Systems and Northrop Grumman. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," said Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works. Next, Boeing will build and test the technology demonstration vehicle, culminating with 10 test fires of the vehicle's engine on the ground in 10 days to demonstrate propulsion readiness for flight tests in 2019. Then, there would be 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020. After these flights are completed, the DARPA would launch the XS-1 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds (400 to 1,360 kilograms) into low Earth orbit. If the program is successful, the agency predicted that the XS-1 could operate with costs under five million U.S. dollars per launch, including the cost of an expendable upper stage, which accounts for "a small fraction of the cost of launch systems the U.S. military currently uses for similarly sized payloads."

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is collaborating with Boeing to fund development of the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. (Xinhua/Boeing Rendering) WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced Wednesday it has selected Boeing company to design, build and test the first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would be able to fly 10 times in 10 days. The unmanned vehicle, known as Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1), roughly the size of a business jet, would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speed. But unlike the U.S. military's X-37B spaceplane that launches with an external booster, it would be powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants, the DARPA said in a statement. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the spaceplane would release an expendable upper stage that is able to deploy a 3,000-pound (1,360-kilogram) satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. Currently, months or years of preparation is needed to send a single satellite into orbit. According to the DARPA, building XS-1 will need significant advances in both technical capabilities and ground operations, but "would revolutionize the Nation's ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent." "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager.

The project, known as XS-1, is expected to debut in 2020, and military bosses claim it will 'bolster national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space.' Scroll down for video  About the size of a business jet, it will take off like a rocket, boost itself beyond the atmosphere and release an expendable second-stage rocket and satellite, then and land like an airplane on a runway. Boeing declined to say how much it will put into development of the vehicle, which it calls Phantom Express, with DARPA, which is an agency under the U.S. Department of Defense.

Share this article Share 20 shares The DARPA-Boeing venture joins a race to design a generation of reusable launch vehicles designed to cut the cost of putting payloads into space.  Elon Musk's SpaceX and Blue Origin, a venture backed by Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, are working on reusable launch vehicles. 'The reusable first stage ... would be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours,' DARPA spokesman Jared Adams wrote in an email.  The goal of the XS-1 program is to fly 10 flights within 10 days. Boeing said it is still evaluating launch sites, but DARPA´s Adams said Phantom Express would fly from Cape Canaveral, where two other Boeing space programs are based. The company took over one of the hangars used by NASA´s now-retired space shuttles for a commercial space taxi that will ferry astronauts and potentially paying passengers to and from the International Space Station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.  The first flight of Boeing´s CST-100 Starliner is scheduled for next year. HOW THE PHANTOM EXPRESS WILL MAKE SPACE AFFORDABLE The XS-1 program envisions a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds.  The vehicle would be launched with no external boosters, powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants.  Once it reaches the correct altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit.  The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours.  Two other former shuttle hangers house a pair of Boeing-built robotic spaceplanes developed and operated under the Air Force´s X-37B program.  The vehicles, which resemble miniature space shuttles, have made four flights so far, the last of which ended on May 8 after a secretive two-year mission. Unlike the X-37B which is launched aboard an expendable rocket, Phantom Express will get itself into space.  The vehicle will be powered by a liquid-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, which is based on the now-retired space shuttle main engine. An upper-stage motor for Phantom Express has not yet been announced.  The spaceplane is designed to loft satellites weighing up to 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) into low-altitude orbits around Earth.  The project has the with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. 'The program aims to achieve a capability well out of reach today—launches to low Earth orbit in days, as compared to the months or years of preparation currently needed to get a single satellite on orbit,' DARPA says. It claims the plane would 'revolutionize the Nation's ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent.' 'The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,' said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager.  'We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight.' In its pursuit of aircraft-like operability, reliability, and cost-efficiency, DARPA and Boeing are planning to conduct a flight test demonstration of XS-1 technology, flying 10 times in 10 days, with an additional final flight carrying the upper-stage payload delivery system.  THE X-37B SECRET SPACEPLANE The reusable X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle's (OTV-4) return earlier this month concluded an almost two-year mission in orbit, according to the US Air Force.  The Air Force tweeted shortly after 8am that the vehicle had landed safely, marking the conclusion of its fourth classified mission, which lasted more than 700 days.  The unmanned X-37B, which resembles a mini space shuttle, landing on a runway used by the now-mothballed craft. The Boeing-built space plane blasted off in May 2015 from nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station aboard an Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Like a shuttle, X-37B (picutred) is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft. The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite The X-37B, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted unspecified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit. It was the fourth and lengthiest mission so far for the secretive program, managed by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The Air Force said the orbiters 'perform risk reduction, experimentation and concept-of-operations development for reusable space vehicle technologies.'  However, the exact nature of the mission and its cost is classified.       If successful, the program could help enable a commercial service in the future that could operate with recurring costs of as little as $5 million or less per launch, including the cost of an expendable upper stage, assuming a recurring flight rate of at least ten flights per year—a small fraction of the cost of launch systems the U.S. military currently uses for similarly sized payloads.   XS-1 Phase 2 includes design, construction, and testing of the technology demonstration vehicle through 2019. It calls for initially firing the vehicle's engine on the ground 10 times in 10 days to demonstrate propulsion readiness for flight tests. Phase 3 objectives include 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020.  After multiple shakedown flights to reduce risk, the XS-1 would aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5. Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. DARPA intends to release selected data from its tests and will provide to all interested commercial entities the relevant specs for potential payloads. 'We're delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,' said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1.  'Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.' Darpa launched the XS-1 program in 2014.   Over the past two years, Darpa has funded Phase 1 studies by three companies: Boeing, partnered with Blue Origin, Masten Space Systems, partnered with XCOR Aerospace and Northrop Grumman, partnered with Virgin Galactic.   The US Air Force's top secret X-37B space plane was caught on camera by a team of amateur astronomers last year. South African astronomer Greg Roberts captured this of the space plane in two-second–long exposures just a few weeks after launch The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite.  According to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth orbit, between 110 (177km) and 500 miles (800km) above earth. By comparison, the International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles (350km).

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

(Photo by AFP) The US Department of the Treasury is reviewing licenses for Boeing Co. and Airbus to sell Iran aircraft, while it will do its best to impose “additional sanctions” on Tehran. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made the comments before a House of Representatives panel Wednesday. "We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria and North Korea to protect American lives," he told members of the House Ways and Means Committee. Officials in the administration of US President Donald Trump have been sparing no efforts to undermine the nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers, including the US, as it was negotiated in the administration of President Barrack Obama. "I can assure you that's a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president," Mnuchin told lawmakers. Most of Iran's aging fleet of 250 commercial planes were purchased before 1979, and as of June 2016, only 162 were operational, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Airlines in Iran have been operating for decades on ageing fleet of Boeing and Airbus airliners, plus some Russian planes bought or leased since the revolution.   Iran and the world powers – the US, Britain, Russia, Germany, china and France – reached a nuclear deal in Vienna in July 2015. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran undertook to put limitations on its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of nuclear-related sanctions imposed against Tehran. Trump has been a staunch opponent of the Iran nuclear deal as it was negotiated under his Democratic predecessor  despite the Republican Party’s opposition. Loading ...

REUTERS/Alwyn Scott 25 May 2017 06:25AM Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.: The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on Wednesday said it will invest up to US$146 million in an alliance with Boeing to build an experimental spaceplane that can deliver small satellites into orbit on a daily basis. The project, known as XS-1, is expected to debut in 2020. Boeing declined to say how much it will put into development of the vehicle, which it calls Phantom Express, with DARPA, which is an agency under the U.S. Department of Defense. About the size of a business jet, Phantom Express will take off like a rocket, boost itself beyond the atmosphere and release an expendable second-stage rocket and satellite, then turn around and land like an airplane on a runway. The DARPA-Boeing venture joins a race to design a generation of reusable launch vehicles designed to cut the cost of putting payloads into space. Elon Musk's SpaceX and Blue Origin, a venture backed by Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, are working on reusable launch vehicles. “The reusable first stage … would be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours,” DARPA spokesman Jared Adams wrote in an email. The goal of the XS-1 program is to fly 10 flights within 10 days. Advertisement Advertisement Boeing said it is still evaluating launch sites, but DARPA’s Adams said Phantom Express would fly from Cape Canaveral, where two other Boeing space programs are based. The company took over one of the hangars used by NASA’s now-retired space shuttles for a commercial space taxi that will ferry astronauts and potentially paying passengers to and from the International Space Station, a US$100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. The first flight of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner is scheduled for next year. Two other former shuttle hangers house a pair of Boeing-built robotic spaceplanes developed and operated under the Air Force’s X-37B program. The vehicles, which resemble miniature space shuttles, have made four flights so far, the last of which ended on May 8 after a secretive two-year mission. Unlike the X-37B which is launched aboard an expendable rocket, Phantom Express will get itself into space. The vehicle will be powered by a liquid-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, which is based on the now-retired space shuttle main engine. An upper-stage motor for Phantom Express has not yet been announced. The spaceplane is designed to loft satellites weighing up to 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) into low-altitude orbits around Earth.

Ocean Science Jason Reed-pool/Getty Images In the three years since Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people aboard, an international search team has spent some $150 million to scour tens of thousands of square miles of ocean. The effort has yielded no helpful sign of the Boeing 777, but that doesn’t mean it’s been a pure waste of time and money. Along with a few scraps of the jet, the search has turned up a variety of scientific advances. Thanks to efforts made in the search, oceanographers are more familiar with the terrain far below the surface of the Indian Ocean. The deep-tissue forensic analysis of scant data from the missing plane will help guide future searches for other aircraft gone astray. Now, as well, scientists studying the movement of objects across the Earth’s watery surfaces wield a far greater understanding of the variables that influence where and how fast those objects go. That last bit of the MH370 saga started in July 2015, when a piece of the Boeing 777’s wing washed up on the island of Réunion, off Africa’s southeastern coast, more than 2,500 miles from the primary search area. Researchers from Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization tossed a series of six replicas of that part, called a flaperon, in the water. They matched the replicas’ behavior with their knowledge of ocean winds and currents, and made their best guess for where it would have started its journey more than 16 months earlier. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is running the search, used that intel, along with other clues, to select a 46,000-square mile chunk of Indian Ocean as the likely resting place of MH370 and its passengers. On the Hunt Alex Davies Two Pilots Say They Can Find MH370. All They Need Is $5 Million Alex Davies Our New Best Guess for Where to Find MH370: The Indian Ocean Nick Stockton That Piece of Debris Won’t Tell Us Where MH370 Crashed Then the search party—human spotters, drones, underwater scanners, aquatic robots, dozens of ships—trolled the zone, as they had other targeted areas for two years. They found zilch. Last summer, they put the hunt on hold and returned to shore. Meanwhile, something about the drift modeling bothered the Australian researchers. They weren’t sure the wood and metal fabrications floated in quite the same way as a real Boeing 777 flaperon. They weren’t even exactly the same size and shape. They had settled for an estimate, because they didn’t have access to the real deal. “We would have used a genuine flaperon earlier if one was available,” says David Griffin, the lead research scientist. They weren’t about to mess around with the MH370 flaperon itself, a rare bit of evidence from the crash, and Boeing didn’t have any spares available, let alone the six the researchers wanted. Parts like that are harder to come by than you might think. Most Boeing 777’s need theirs, and there aren’t many of the modern airplanes in aircraft boneyards to scavenge for parts. French police officers carry a piece of debris known as a flaperon in Saint-Andre, Reunion Island on July 29, 2015. AP In December, 2016, they got lucky. The US National Transportation Safety Board, working with Boeing, located an available flaperon—source undisclosed—and sent it down under. Griffin and his team rushed to validate their original work. They cut the flaperon to fit the shape of the original as found on Réunion, and dropped it in a water tank to confirm its buoyancy matched, too. Then they sailed into the waters near southeast Tasmania, to see whether their new sample matched the movement of the replica they had used for their testing, and how any differences could call into question their original findings. Their work has been pushing some of those boundaries forward. Metron engineer Doug Marble The bad news: The new flaperon didn’t match the replica. It pitched over much more readily, indicating lower wind speeds than previously thought could affect its movement. Its weight balance was less symmetrical than that of the replica, suggesting drag forces in the water would send it in a different direction. After 13 days of fresh testing, the team compiled the data and discovered that the flaperon most likely drifted both faster than the replica and up to thirty degrees to the left of the wind. That new information doesn’t actually change the current proposed search area, a roughly 10,000-square-mile zone north of the area where the searchers focused in the early days. Its value is in validating that area of focus, whereas the previous study’s location theory depended on assumptions about other oceanographic variables, specifically the possible arrival of an ocean eddy that would carry the flaperon to the south, and which may or may not have actually happened. More broadly, the research helps advance the potential for drift analysis contributing to other applications—a technique that is perhaps surprisingly underutilized. “Accurately predicting the motion of a small object, which changes its orientation to the wind and currents over a period of seconds, drifting across an entire ocean basin over a period of months, requires an exquisite combination of models which don’t exist in an integrated form today,” says Doug Marble, a senior manager at simulation and engineering consultancy Metron. “Improved field observations and advances in computing and numerical methods have brought us large advances in environmental modeling, but there’s still work to be done. [The Australian researchers’] work has been pushing some of those boundaries forward.” Both Marble and Griffin say the potential impact of improved drift analysis can be expansive, aiding in man-overboard searches, oil spill tracing, plastic pollution, the progress of invasive species across the seas, fishery development, and coral reef management. Whether it will actually help find MH370, however, remains to be seen. With the search currently suspended, it will likely take still more convincing research to compel the Australian government to dive back in—according to The Telegraph, Australian transport minister Darren Chester has declined to reopen the search, since “the new analysis did not appear to constitute new evidence.” But even if the aircraft is never found, the insights brought about by the researchers’ persistence will pay dividends—and possibly save lives—in the future.

News Tech Health Planet Earth Strange News Animals History Culture Space.com Live Science News Tech Health Planet Earth Strange News Animals History Culture Space.com Live Science News Tech Health Planet Earth Strange News Animals History Culture Space.com Live Science Space.com US Military's XS-1 Space Plane Will Be Built by Boeing (Video) By Tariq Malik, Space.com Managing Editor | May 24, 2017 01:09pm ET MORE The U.S. military's new XS-1 space plane will be built by Boeing, and it's called the Phantom Express. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced today (May 24) it had selected Boeing for the next phase of its XS-1 project, known as the Experimental Spaceplane, after an intense competition among aerospace companies. The XS-1 is aimed to be a completely reusable military space plane capable of launching 3,000-lb. (1,360 kilograms) satellites into orbit 10 times in 10 days. The spacecraft could dramatically reduce the cost of launches to $5 million per flight, DARPA officials said. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," DARPA program manager Jess Sponable said in a statement. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 — fabrication and flight." [DARPA's Experimental XS-1 Space Plane in Pictures] The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has picked Boeing to design and build the XS-1 military space plane, a robotic spacecraft for launching small satellites. Boeing's design, called Phantom Express, is shown here in an artist's concept. Credit: Boeing The first test launches will begin with Phase 3, which aims to launch the XS-1 between 12 and 15 times in 2020.Phase 2 of the XS-1 program will have Boeing design, build and test a technology demonstration vehicle by 2019, according to the DARPA statement. A ground-based engine test will be included, to show the feasibility of firing the engine 10 times in 10 days, DARPA officials said. "After multiple shakedown flights to reduce risk, the XS-1 would aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5," DARPA officials wrote in a statement. "Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds [400 to 1,360 kg] into low Earth orbit." (Mach 5 means five times the speed of sound, which equates to 3,806 mph, and Mach 10, or 10 times the speed of sound, is 7,612 mph.) Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 design beat out concepts by two other teams: a partnership of Masten Space Systems and XCOR Aerospace, and the team of Northrop Grumman and Virgin Galactic.   Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 space plane design is shown in launch position in this artist's concept. The autonomous spacecraft is designed to launch vertically, deploy a second stage payload in orbit and return to Earth for a runway landing. Credit: Boeing The Phantom Express XS-1 is designed to launch to the edge of space, and deploy a piggyback-mounted second stage that would carry a satellite the rest of the way into orbit. The space plane would then return to Earth to make a runway landing. The XS-1 will launch vertically using an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine fueled with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The AR-22 engine is a version of main engines that were used to power NASA's space shuttles, Boeing representatives said in a statement. The Phantom Express will be built by Boeing's Phantom Works division, which also built the two robotic X-37B space planes that are currently in use by the U.S. Air Force for classified missions. The reusable X-37B space planes have flown four missions to date, each longer than the last, with the latest mission (called OTV-4) landing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on May 7 after 718 days in orbit. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a separate statement. DARPA officials said the rapid-turnaround goal of the XS-1 space plane and the technologies that make it possible won't benefit just the U.S. military. DARPA will publicly release some of its results from the Phase 2 and 3 trials, and share payload specifications for interested commercial companies, agency officials said. "We're delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality," Brad Tousley, director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office, which oversees the XS-1 project, said in the DARPA statement, "Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities."

Like the National Association of Manufacturers, Boeing in April took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post, congratulating Trump on his first 100 days in office. (Mic Smith / AP) We’ve heard a lot about fake news. What about fake ads? Surely they deserve the “Pinocchio” reality check. Let’s start with the April 29 full-page Washington Post ad run by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) applauding the president for his first 100 days. The organization hailed the trumpeter in chief for his accomplishments and hoped for more of the same. “Thank you President Trump, for 100 days of progress,” the ad cheered. Advertisement Square, Site wide Whose progress? Obviously NAM’s, or it wouldn’t have forked out the Post’s fee—about $127,000. The problem is, most of the triumphs the ad touts are dubious. For example, it opens with a whopper. “You’ve promoted investment and created jobs.” Well, yes and no. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 93,000 fewer new jobs were created from February to April 2017 (522,000), under the Trump reign, than over the same months in 2016 (615,000). As for new investment, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, gross private domestic investment in the first quarter of 2017 (adjusted for inflation and seasonal variations) was up 1.7 percent from the fourth quarter 2016—not much to brag about. Next, NAM’s ad gushed about the two pipelines (Dakota Access and Keystone XL) the president OK’d. While Trump claimed Keystone will create 28,000 jobs when completed, the State Department put the number a tad lower, at 35 or 50. According to NAM, the job creator in chief will rescue American manufacturers by reducing “the job-crushing regulatory burden,” “the red tape,” “the overreaching EPA and unfair labor regulations,” “the oppressive rules that obstructed energy development and prevented American independence.” And if that wasn’t enough, he’ll roll back “harmful Obamacare mandates.” Wow! So, which manufacturers have suffered under such ruinous rules? Not Emerson Electric Co., of which NAM’s chairman, David Farr, is CEO: In fact, its 2016 global sales were $14.5 billion. Boasting about its numbers, Emerson’s online blurbs claim it’s “one of a handful of companies with 60 consecutive years or more of increasing dividends to its shareholders.” Not FLUOR Corp., of which NAM’s vice chair, David Seaton, is CEO: One of the world’s largest engineering corporations, FLUOR’s 2016 revenues rose to $19 billion, up from $18 billion in 2015. Not the firms represented on NAM’s Executive Committee. For example, Pfizer earned $52.8 billion. Ingersoll Rand’s sales and revenues rose to $13.5 billion. Fresenius Medical Care Services 2016 revenues soared 7 percent over 2015, to $17.9 billion. And Cargill Inc.’s 2016 revenues were a whopping $107 billion. Even ExxonMobil, whose 2016 earnings were down to $7.8 billion, reported this was due to “sharply lower commodity prices, upstream”—not ruthless regulations. We are relieved to note that with $7.8 billion in revenue, ExxonMobil is not yet out of business. Interestingly, most of the rules or acts that NAM says Trump reversed are those which hadn’t yet taken effect (not “overturned” as the ad claims). But a few were already in motion and the Trump/congressional changes will be big. For example, this past February and March, Trump and Congress killed the 2016 Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule that required firms applying for government contracts to report cases in which they violated federal laws in the past—say, on wages, safety, health, collective bargaining and civil rights. According to Heidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute, the rule was designed to ensure that workers are protected and that billions of dollars in federal contracts are no longer awarded to companies with a record of violations. Trump also overturned a 2015 Environmental Protection Agency rule designed to stop firms from dumping toxic waste into waterways. While it will take some time for the new order to take effect, it’s official. As a non-NAM member, it’s hard to see why polluting waterways is a plus, though industries have long resented any government intrusions. They might also be hit with the cleanup bill down the road—although to be fair, they might not, since the tab is often picked up by taxpayers. Score one for industry. The ad ends with a rapturous crescendo: “And you’re just getting started. The 12 million men and women who make things in America stand with you to renew the American Spirit.” Good job, Donald! Is it possible that even a few of those who “make things” will not cheer? If they don’t, NAM might suggest these employees—whose salaries, benefits, work conditions, health and quality of life will surely deteriorate—eat some American pie. (Cake, after all, is for the French.) Good job, NAM! Barbara Koeppel is a freelance investigative reporter based in Washington, D.C.

The spaceplane, called Phantom Express, is a project of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Chicago-based Boeing’s pick as design partner was announced Wednesday. Boeing and DARPA will jointly invest in the development. The spaceplane would fly to the edge of space, then return to Earth and land on a runway like a conventional aircraft. “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a news release.

As the next step toward a future of routine, responsive, and low-cost space access, DARPA has awarded Phases 2 and 3 of the program to The Boeing Company. DARPA has selected The Boeing Company to complete advanced design work for the Agency's Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program, which aims to build and fly the first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would bolster national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space. The program aims to achieve a capability well out of reach today-launches to low Earth orbit in days, as compared to the months or years of preparation currently needed to get a single satellite on orbit. Success will depend upon significant advances in both technical capabilities and ground operations, but would revolutionize the Nation's ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3-fabrication and flight." The XS-1 program envisions a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds. The vehicle would be launched with no external boosters, powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. In its pursuit of aircraft-like operability, reliability, and cost-efficiency, DARPA and Boeing are planning to conduct a flight test demonstration of XS-1 technology, flying 10 times in 10 days, with an additional final flight carrying the upper-stage payload delivery system. If successful, the program could help enable a commercial service in the future that could operate with recurring costs of as little as $5 million or less per launch, including the cost of an expendable upper stage, assuming a recurring flight rate of at least ten flights per year-a small fraction of the cost of launch systems the U.S. military currently uses for similarly sized payloads. (Note that goal is for actual cost, not commercial price, which would be determined in part by market forces.) To achieve these goals, XS-1 designers plan to take advantage of technologies and support systems that have enhanced the reliability and fast turnaround of military aircraft. For example, easily accessible subsystem components configured as line replaceable units would be used wherever practical to enable quick maintenance and repairs. The XS-1 Phase 2/3 design also intends to increase efficiencies by integrating numerous state-of-the-art technologies, including some previously developed by DARPA, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force. For example, the XS-1 technology demonstrator's propulsion system is an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). Other technologies in the XS-1 design include: + Advanced, lightweight composite cryogenic propellant tanks to hold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants + Hybrid composite-metallic wings and control surfaces able to withstand the physical stresses of suborbital hypersonic flight and temperatures of more than 2,000o F + Automated flight-termination and other technologies for autonomous flight and operations, including some developed by DARPA's Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program XS-1 Phase 2 includes design, construction, and testing of the technology demonstration vehicle through 2019. It calls for initially firing the vehicle's engine on the ground 10 times in 10 days to demonstrate propulsion readiness for flight tests. Phase 3 objectives include 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020. After multiple shakedown flights to reduce risk, the XS-1 would aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5. Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. Another goal of the program is to encourage the broader commercial launch sector to adopt useful XS-1 approaches, processes, and technologies that facilitate launch on demand and rapid turnaround-important military and commercial needs for the 21st century. Toward that goal, DARPA intends to release selected data from its Phase 2/3 tests and will provide to all interested commercial entities the relevant specs for potential payloads. "We're delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality," said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. "Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities."

By Laura Woods | May 24, 2017 Following months of speculation, President Donald Trump’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2018 was released on Tuesday. Titled “A New Foundation for American Greatness,” the document details his plans to reduce the national deficit, promote job growth and shift government spending. The president wants to increase funding in some areas, but one segment of his plan puts 66 federal programs on the chopping block, reducing government spending by $26.7 billion. While many on Capitol Hill said the budget was “dead on arrival,” it will likely undergo several drafts and changes before being ratified. If passed, the current budget could have a monumental impact on many industries. Take a look at the possible impact of Trump’s budget. Trump’s Budget Offers a Boost to Some Industries Companies and government agencies providing law enforcement, construction and defense services could greatly benefit under Trump’s budget. By far the front-runner, the president wants to increase defense spending by $52 billion to a whopping $639 billion total, meaning these three companies could really cash in. Lockheed Martin Global security and aerospace company Lockheed Martin was the largest U.S. government contractor in 2015, with $36.3 billion contracted. The vast majority — $29.4 billion — was defense contracts, and that number could rise if Trump’s budget passes. The plan calls for the purchase of 70 Joint Strike Fighters, which are made by Lockheed Martin. Boeing The world’s largest aerospace company placed second in both overall federal government contracts and defense contracts in 2015 — $16.6 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively. Despite Trump’s clash with Boeing over the cost of Air Force One, his budget allots for the purchase of 14 Super Hornets. Used by the Navy, Boeing manufactures these fighter jets. Related: The Cost to Operate and Maintain Air Force One Raytheon Ranking fourth overall, Massachusetts-based Raytheon garnered $13.1 billion in government contracts in 2015. Almost all — $12.7 billion — was for defense contracts. Trump appears to be a fan of the company, as he chose to use its long-range Tomahawk missiles against Syria in April 2017, so it would likely get even more business with additional funding. Many Industries Will Take a Hit Under Trump’s Budget Simultaneously proposing cutbacks and introducing new spending initiatives means Trump’s budget won’t benefit everyone. Funding that powers many industries — healthcare, education, environmental and even some aerospace programs — is slated to be reduced or completely eliminated, which could have a negative impact on these companies. Planned Parenthood Not surprisingly, Trump’s budget includes zero funding for Planned Parenthood. For the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2015, the nonprofit received $553.7 million in government health services grants and reimbursements, totaling 43 percent of its funding. The organization currently provides healthcare to 2.5 million patients, but Trump’s budget puts these services at risk. SpaceX Proposed reductions to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) budget weren’t extreme — $19.1 billion in funding for 2018, compared with $19.2 billion in 2017 — but this could affect Southern California-based SpaceX. One of NASA’s largest contractors, the agency paid SpaceX $671.9 million in contracts during 2015. President Trump signed the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 into law in March, but SpaceX founder and billionaire Elon Musk took to Twitter to voice his disappointment about its lack of funding for Mars exploration. CGI Technologies and Solutions Inc. Part of Trump’s presidential campaign focused greatly on reducing the size of the Environmental Protection Agency, and his budget reflects that. Trump wants to cut the EPA’s budget from $8.2 billion in 2017 to $5.7 billion in 2018, which would likely have a major impact on the agency’s contractors. The largest, IT services provider CGI Technologies and Solutions Inc. — a 40-year partner of the EPA — received $66.2 million in contracts from the agency in 2015. Next Steps for the Proposed 2018 Budget Now that he’s finished with it, Trump’s budget proposal will head to Congress. It’s not expected to pass in its current state — a standard outcome — but lawmakers from the House and Senate will review their respective pieces and work to find common ground. Fiscal year 2018 begins Oct. 1, meaning lawmakers should have the plan ready to go by Sept. 30. This doesn’t usually happen, so don’t expect any of Trump’s policies to go into effect until the end of the year.

UNMANNED DARPA taps Boeing for unmanned reusable spaceplane By Ross Wilkers May 24, 2017 Boeing has emerged as the winner of a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency competition to design and test an unmanned reusable spaceplane DARPA hopes can cut the time and costs of getting satellites into orbit. DARPA envisions the XS-1 Experimental Spaceplane as a class of hypersonic aircraft that could launch into low-Earth orbit within days versus the months or years currently required to launch a single satellite. Boeing will build the future Phantom Express spaceplane to carry satellites up to 3,000 pounds and return back to Earth on a runway similar to that of business jets. Contract figures were not disclosed for phases two and three of XS-1 Boeing was selected for. Boeing and Northrop Grumman each received $6.5 million for phase one in August 2015 and a third company Masten Space Systems got $3 million. Through XS-1, the agency aims to facilitate a commercial service with recurring costs of $5 million or less per launch at an assumption of 10 flights per year. DARPA will also release some test flight data from phases two and three in an effort to spur adoption of the XS-1 program's processes and technologies across the commercial launch sector. (DARPA concept video of the XS-1 spaceplane) The unmanned arena figures to be key for Boeing's defense business going forward as its current main fighter jet production programs face an uncertain future after the 2020s. Boeing chief Leanne Caret started that role in March of last year and has highlighted unmanned as two of her six main priorities for the airplane maker's nearly $30 billion segment. Caret told Reuters in July 2016 Boeing's interest in autonomous vehicles includes both the space and undersea domains. Boeing acquired undersea drone maker Liquid Robotics five months later. Phase two covers design, construction and testing of a demonstration vehicle through 2019. DARPA and Boeing will initially fire the spaceplane's engine on the ground 10 times in 10 days in an effort to show propulsion readiness for full flight tests. For phase three, the Boeing-DARPA team will conduct 12-15 flight tests in 2020 with the goal to fly the spaceplane 10 times over 10 straight days. Initial flights will be without payloads but eventually aim to deliver a demonstration payload at 900-3,000 pounds into low-Earth orbit. Phantom Express would be powered by an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a derivative of the engine used on the Space Shuttle. Aerojet designed the engine to be reusable and use both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fuel. About the Author Ross Wilkers is a senior staff writer for Washington Technology.

And more importantly, which top UAV companies should you consider buying? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 24, 2017 at 12:08PM What is the biggest drone manufacturer in the world? That's a tough question to answer. Honestly, it depends on what you mean by "biggest" -- and how fuzzy you like your math when evaluating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) companies. According to the most recent report out from the drone industry watchers at DroneII.com, for example, the top three largest UAV manufacturers in the world are China's SZ DJI Technology Co. at No. 1 and Xiaomi at No. 3, with France's Parrot sandwiched in between them. American companies don't even enter the ranks of the top UAV companies before No. 4 player Hover Inc., followed in short order by No. 5 AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV), 3D Robotics at No. 6, and Boeing (NYSE:BA) subsidiary Insitu at No. 7. Counting No. 9 entrant Ehang, that gives America five of the top 10 slots, which is more than any other country can boast. AeroVironment's Quantix drone is helping lift it into the top ranks of leading drone companies. Image source: AeroVironment. What's more, DroneII uses some rather fuzzy metrics when assigning ranks to leading drone companies -- factors such as how often a company's name is used in Google searches for terms such as "drone" and "UAV," how often a company's name appears in blog and media postings, and how many employees at a company have words such as "drone" or "UAS" included in their job titles on LinkedIn. Like I said, fuzzy math. How investors rank the leading drone companies When it comes to investors looking to participate in the nascent drone industry, however, the task of figuring out which companies are the biggest drone manufacturers is a bit simpler. Right off the bat, we can discard top UAV companies such as DJI and Xiaomi, and Hover and 3D Robotics, because they're privately owned. We can't invest in them, and so -- to be blunt -- they're therefore of no interest to us. So who does that leave? AeroVironment and Boeing, obviously -- the only two companies with a ticker -- move to the top of our list. Neither Boeing nor AeroVironment is a big player in the market for "recreational" drones, the now-ubiquitous camera-toting quadcopters that have made DJI and Parrot famous. Rather, they focus on making drones for the military. Boeing's Insitu is most famous for its ScanEagle drone, which famously played a part in the Navy's rescue of MV Maersk Alabama's Captain Phillips back in 2009, for example. And AeroVironment is the biggest drone manufacturer for the military, having sold literally tens of thousands of drones for the Pentagon over the past few decades. In addition to their military customers, Boeing and AeroVironment are also spinning up commercial drone businesses. Boeing has touted ScanEagle's usefulness for monitoring wildfires and helping firefighters, for example. And last year, AeroVironment unveiled a large-scale initiative to market its new Quantix drone to industry, advertising the drone as ideal for such uses as surveying oil pipelines for leaks and monitoring the health of farm crops. Boeing versus AeroVironment Which of these two companies makes for the better investment? If you're looking for something close to a pure-play drone investment, AeroVironment is clearly the better choice. Nearly 89% of the revenues AeroVironment makes in a year, it makes from selling drones. In contrast, drones represent just the tiniest sliver of annual revenue for Boeing -- about 1%.   From a valuation perspective, though, the choice swings the other way. With $5.1 billion in trailing earnings, and $9 billion in positive free cash flow, Boeing is both profitable and generates tons of cash. AeroVironment isn't, and doesn't. Sad to say, while AeroVironment is growing strongly in drones, it doesn't appear to be growing profitably yet.  Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

And now the Department of Defense has picked Boeing to turn that spaceplane into a reality. DARPA, the agency that tests new advanced technologies for the military, has picked Boeing’s design concept, called the Phantom Express, to move forward as part of the agency’s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. That means DARPA will work together with Boeing to build and test out the company’s vehicle. The goal of DARPA’s XS-1 program is to create a spacecraft that’s something of a hybrid between an airplane and a traditional vertical rocket. The spaceplane is meant to take off vertically and fly uncrewed to high altitudes above Earth. From there, the vehicle will release a mini-rocket — a booster with an engine that can propel a satellite weighing up to 3,000 pounds into orbit. As the booster deploys the satellite, the spaceplane will then land back on Earth horizontally just like a normal airplane — and then be fueled up for its next mission. DARPA wants the turnaround time between flights to last just a few hours. A hybrid between an airplane and a traditional vertical rocket But perhaps the most audacious goal is the price DARPA wants for each flight. The agency is aiming for the spaceplane to cost $5 million per mission, a significant bargain considering most orbital rockets cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to launch. And Boeing says it’s up to the task. “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a statement. Boeing was one of three companies vying for the chance to build a spaceplane for XS-1. The other two contenders included Northrop Grumman Corporation and Masten Space Systems. The three companies had all been awarded contracts through Phase 1 of the XS-1 program to determine the feasibility and methods needed to make such a frequently reused spaceplane possible. The three companies each paired up with a commercial launch provider to come up with their designs: Northrop paired with Virgin Galactic, Masten with XCOR Aerospace, and Boeing with Jeff Bezos’ company Blue Origin. Though it looks like Boeing has decided to go with a different company to make the propulsion system for its spaceplane. The vehicle will use an AR-22 engine, manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne, instead of an engine from Blue Origin. The AR-22 is roughly the same type of engine used to power the Space Shuttle, according to Aerojet. “This engine has a demonstrated track record of solid performance and proven reusability,” Eileen Drake, president and CEO of Aerojet Rocketdyne, said in a statement. A rendering of the Phantom Express preparing for launch. Image: Boeing Now that Boeing has been selected by DARPA, the company is moving forward into Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the XS-1 program. Phase 2 includes the manufacture and testing of the vehicle’s technologies on the ground through 2019. In Phase 3, which is suppose to begin in 2020, the spaceplane will do 12 to 15 flight tests. A big objective of this phase is to fly the plane 10 times over a 10-day period, to demonstrate that the vehicle can do quick turnarounds. The first of these flights won’t include payloads, but the spaceplane will eventually test out sending payloads weighing 900 and 3,000 pounds into lower Earth orbit. DARPA says the XS-1 will meet a critical need for the military by decreasing the amount of time it takes to get a satellite into orbit. That could be important if the US needs to get a satellite up in a pinch, perhaps if a crucial satellite in space is suddenly lost. But DARPA also hopes that the technologies created through the XS-1 program will eventually be adopted by the commercial spaceflight industry, to make getting satellites to space a potentially faster and cheaper endeavor. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1, said in a statement. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Next Up In Science Time to say ‘I told you so’: cannabis can treat seizures Here are the microbes you can pick up at the hospital — and those you leave behind Here's Trump's plan to destroy the US science budget Elon Musk ‘cautiously optimistic’ about Paris climate deal after speaking to Trump US Justice Department sues Fiat Chrysler for cheating emissions tests Our brains predict events in fast-forward Now Trending Far Cry 5 promises to be controversial, but not for the usual reasons Far Cry’s new enemies are American.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced today (May 24) it had selected Boeing for the next phase of its XS-1 project, known as the Experimental Spaceplane, after an intense competition among aerospace companies. The XS-1 is aimed to be a completely reusable military space plane capable of launching 3,000-lb. (1,360 kilograms) satellites into orbit 10 times in 10 days. The spacecraft could dramatically reduce the cost of launches to $5 million per flight, DARPA officials said. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," DARPA program manager Jess Sponable said in a statement. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 — fabrication and flight." [DARPA's Experimental XS-1 Space Plane in Pictures] The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has picked Boeing to design and build the XS-1 military space plane, a robotic spacecraft for launching small satellites. Boeing's design, called Phantom Express, is shown here in an artist's concept. Credit: Boeing Phase 2 of the XS-1 program will have Boeing design, build and test a technology demonstration vehicle by 2019, according to the DARPA statement. A ground-based engine test will be included, to show the feasibility of firing the engine 10 times in 10 days, DARPA officials said. The first test launches will begin with Phase 3, which aims to launch the XS-1 between 12 and 15 times in 2020. "After multiple shakedown flights to reduce risk, the XS-1 would aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5," DARPA officials wrote in a statement. "Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds [400 to 1,360 kg] into low Earth orbit." (Mach 5 means five times the speed of sound, which equates to 3,806 mph, and Mach 10, or 10 times the speed of sound, is 7,612 mph.) Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 design beat out concepts by two other teams: a partnership of Masten Space Systems and XCOR Aerospace, and the team of Northrop Grumman and Virgin Galactic. Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 space plane design is shown in launch position in this artist's concept. The autonomous spacecraft is designed to launch vertically, deploy a second stage payload in orbit and return to Earth for a runway landing. Credit: Boeing The Phantom Express XS-1 is designed to launch to the edge of space, and deploy a piggyback-mounted second stage that would carry a satellite the rest of the way into orbit. The space plane would then return to Earth to make a runway landing. The XS-1 will launch vertically using an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine fueled with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The AR-22 engine is a version of main engines that were used to power NASA's space shuttles, Boeing representatives said in a statement. The Phantom Express will be built by Boeing's Phantom Works division, which also built the two robotic X-37B space planes that are currently in use by the U.S. Air Force for classified missions. The reusable X-37B space planes have flown four missions to date, each longer than the last, with the latest mission (called OTV-4) landing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on May 7 after 718 days in orbit. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a separate statement. DARPA officials said the rapid-turnaround goal of the XS-1 space plane and the technologies that make it possible won't benefit just the U.S. military. DARPA will publicly release some of its results from the Phase 2 and 3 trials, and share payload specifications for interested commercial companies, agency officials said. "We're delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality," Brad Tousley, director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office, which oversees the XS-1 project, said in the DARPA statement, "Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities."

The XS-1 program envisions a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds, the release noted. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit. The release offered no timetable for the jet’s completion but disclosed plans to conduct 10 flight tests in 10 days to demonstrate the technology, with the final flight carrying an orbital payload. ...

Boeing will develop an autonomous, reusable spaceplane capable of carrying and deploying a small expendable upper stage to launch small (3,000 pound/1,361 kg) satellites into low Earth orbit. Boeing and DARPA will jointly invest in the development. Once the spaceplane – called Phantom Express – reaches the edge of space, it would deploy the second stage and return to Earth. It would then land on a runway to be prepared for its next flight by applying operation and maintenance principles similar to modern aircraft. “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” said Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works. The Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine, would power the spaceplane. It is designed to be reusable and operates using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fuel. Phantom Express would offer an advanced airframe design as well as third-generation thermal protection to create a vehicle capable of flying at high flight velocity, while carrying a smaller, more affordable expendable upper stage to achieve the mission objectives. In the test phase of the program, Boeing and DARPA plan to conduct a demonstration of 10 flights over 10 days. For more information on Defense, Space & Security, visit www.boeing.com.

Boeing announced this week it was in talks to sell wide-body jets to SaudiGulf but did not disclose the aircraft type. The final agreement would include purchasing options with delivery of the 777s targeted from 2020, said the SaudiGulf chief executive Samer Al Majali. The 777s could be used to fly to destinations in North America, Europe and Asia, Mr Al Majali said, although cautioned that would depend on the airline obtaining international traffic rights. Based in Saudi Arabia’s eastern city of Dammam, SaudiGulf launched in 2016 and operates domestic flights between Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah and will start services to Abha next week. The airline expects to carry 700,000 passengers in 2017, its first full year of operations, and expand its narrow body fleet to between 26 and 30 aircraft "within the next three years", Mr Al Majali said. Its current fleet consists of four Airbus A320 narrow-body jets. Saudi Arabia’s aviation sector is becoming increasingly competitive with the regulator awarding two domestic operating licences last year, including to SaudiGulf. State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) has announced plans to launch a low-cost airline this year and budget carrier flynas ordered 60 Airbus A320neos in January. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Saudi airline set for major Boeing 777 order Virgin Atlantic flight from Dubai to London evacuated over ‘non-credible security threat’ Emirates to tap into China demand with A380 expansion on Beijing and Shanghai routes Passenger numbers rise at Abu Dhabi International Airport MOST VIEWED Business | All Abu Dhabi economy shows signs of recovery Construction begins at Abu Dhabi’s largest solar power project Emaar Malls takes 51 per cent stake in online fashion retailer Namshi Pop-up fashion entrepreneurs make their own way in Dubai Workplace Doctor: Do non-Muslims have to work full hours during Ramadan in the UAE?

The new airliners, which will add to the already existing 21 airliners, were acquired through a dry-lease,10-year-long procedure. TAROM currently operates a fleet of 21 airliners: four Boeing 737-700s (with a maxim range of 4,900 km), four Boeing 737-300s (with a range of up to 3,400 km), four Airbus A318-111s (with a range of up to 2,780 km), seven ATR 42-500s (with a range of up to 1,200 km) and two ATR 72-500s (with a range of up to 950 km). The Romanian Air Transport Company (TAROM) was established in 1954 and operates under the authority of the Ministry of Transport. Since June 2010 it has been a member of the SkyTeam Alliance and since 1993 a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).   Transport Minister: Two long-range airliners for flights to China and U.S. will enter the fleet by the end of the year   The second of the two new Boeing 737-800 NG airliners will arrive next week, and two more long-range airliners for flights to China and the U.S. will enter TAROM’s fleet, Transport Minister Razvan Cuc stated at the ceremony. Early this month, the Transport Ministry announced that TAROM signed the lease contract for two new 189-seat Boeing 737-800 NG airliners. The first airliner entered TAROM’s fleet on Tuesday and the second will arrive next week. “By the end of the year, other airliners will enter TAROM’s fleet, including two long-range airliners that will operate on routes to China and the United States,” Cuc stated. The two new Boeing airliners have been leased for ten years from the Air Lease company, after the Pegasus Airlines gave up on their purchase, according to TAROM representatives. After 10 years, TAROM will decide whether to buy the two airliners, depending on their wear and tear, TAROM CEO Eugen Davidoiu pointed out. According to him, the two new Boeing airliners will operate flights to Madrid, Tenerife, Tel Aviv and Larnaca. The procurement was necessary after two Airbus A310 airliners that the Petre Roman Government bought in 1992 were decommissioned last year. “The two Airbus A310s will probably be sold via public tender this year. If we get 10 million euro from this transaction, that would be fine,” Davidoiu stated.   Dragnea:  TAROM – national pride; our ambition – turn it into a regional benchmark company   “TAROM should be managed in a professional and Romanian way, in line with Romania’s and the company’s interest”, Social Democratic Party leader Liviu Dragnea stated on Wednesday at Henri Coanda-Otopeni Airport, adding that the airline is a national pride and the authorities’ ambition is to turn it into a benchmark company in the region. “I hope that the Minister of Transport and TAROM, under the Prime Minister’s coordination, see through the commitment concerning the 30 airliners, but they needn’t stick to only 30. I am very glad, I am proud. It is the first time I board an aircraft with excitement. It’s exceptionally beautiful (…) TAROM should be a company managed in a professional and Romanian way, in line with the interest of Romania and pursuing the company’s sincere interest. I do not know if the company was thus managed in the past years so as to willingly bring it into a situation that is not really pleasant … And quite incidentally, at the same time private airlines have developed. However, be it private management or not, it is important that the objectives set for TAROM be achieved. The targets are the national ones,” Dragnea said when the first airliner of the two TAROM acquired landed. The event was also attended by Premier Sorin Grindeanu, U.S. Ambassador Hans Klemm and Interior Minister Carmen Dan.   Ambassador Klemm: TAROM’s aircraft purchase – symbolic for strengthening Romania-US strategic partnership   Ambassador of the US in Bucharest Hans Klemm stated on Wednesday that TAROM company purchasing a Boeing aircraft is symbolic for the strengthening of the strategic partnership between Romania and the US. “We also hope to sell more F-16 aircraft to Romania,” Klemm added on the Otopeni Airport.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's How to Find the Best Dividend Stocks A good screener can do half the work for you. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 24, 2017 at 9:02AM Finding a great dividend stock is about more than just finding the stock with the biggest yield. Sure, when dividends are your focus, the dividend yield is the most important number. But there are a number of other factors you also need to consider. For example, you might find a stock paying a great dividend today. But if the company isn't generating the free cash flow necessary to fund its dividend, it might be forced to cut its dividend tomorrow -- in which case, you'll be in the unfortunate position of owning a not-so-great dividend stock, and probably one whose stock price is plummeting as other investors flee the falling dividend. Of course, if falling dividends are bad, it makes sense that growing dividends must be good, right? In this case, you might also want to look into a dividend stock's payout ratio. This metric expresses as a percentage the dividends a company pays relative to the earnings it uses to pay them. A stock with a 100% payout ratio, for example, may be "maxed out" and financially incapable of growing its dividend. Conversely, a dividend stock with a payout ratio of only 50% might have ample room to grow its dividend over time. Analyst projections for rising earnings are another indicator that over time, a stock that pays a good dividend today might pay an even better dividend tomorrow. A GREAT DIVIDEND MAKES EVERYONE SMILE. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. With these considerations in mind, I've taken the liberty of drawing up a screen on free stock screening website finviz.com). I've instructed it to search for: Reasonably large, established companies, with a $2 billion in market cap and up. A respectable dividend (at least 3%). Companies that devote less than 70% of annual profits to dividend payouts. Positive free cash flow. Companies projected to continue earning, and growing earnings, over the next five years. The following are three stocks that appear to fit the bill. Go ahead -- read on and give them a look, and see if you agree. Boeing You probably know that Boeing (NYSE:BA) makes great airplanes, but did you know that it also pays a great dividend? At 3.1%, Boeing's dividend yield is almost half again as big as the average payout of S&P 500 companies. Yet at the same time, Boeing's P/E ratio of 21.6 is nearly four points cheaper than the average valuation of 25.4 times earnings on the S&P.  What's more, Boeing's $5.68-per-share annual dividend represents only 58% of reported net income -- the aforementioned payout ratio -- which lends some assurance that its dividend is "safe." Adding further assurance is the fact that, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Boeing generated $9 billion in free cash flow over the past year. That's more than enough to cover Boeing's dividend obligations -- it's almost twice Boeing's reported net profits. Furthermore, analysts who follow the company expect to see Boeing grow its profits at about 16% annually over the next five years -- giving the company plenty of opportunity to continue growing its dividend. That Boeing has booked orders for more than 5,700 aircraft  that still remain to be built and delivered, with more orders coming in every day, supports analysts' belief that Boeing will be growing its profits, and its dividends, for years to come. Vale S.A. Producing iron ore and pellets, coal, and even precious metals, Vale S.A. (NYSE:VALE) seems like a name that more investors should know. But being based in Brazil, it's a name that may fly too low to have appeared on all investors' radar. That would be a shame, though, because Vale stock has a lot to recommend it to value investors and dividend investors alike. (It's not just me saying that, either. Last week, investment banker BMO highlighted Vale as a stock with 22% upside potential.) In terms of valuation, Vale stock sells for a lowly 9.3 P/E ratio. (Some investors may worry that the company is being sued by Brazilian authorities over its role in the 2015 Samarco mine disaster, but with the lawsuit now suspended, and a settlement being worked out, that risk may not be as big as once feared). And as for the dividend, it yields a tidy 4%, making Vale a more generous dividend payer than Boeing, despite earning a bit less than Boeing does ($4.7 billion annually) and also generating less free cash flow ($5.6 billion). Still, there's plenty of profit, and cash, to finance the generous dividend payout. With its annual dividend payout of $0.34 per share, and diluted earnings per share of $0.91, I calculate the dividend payout ratio at about 37%, which leaves plenty of room for expanding the dividend as well. With analysts on average estimating that Vale will grow not much slower than Boeing -- 15% annually over the next five years -- I see every likelihood that dividends will, in fact, grow over time. Valero And I think we'll wrap up with yet another story of respectable growth wrapped in a value stock package: oil refiner Valero (NYSE:VLO). Valero just wrapped up its Q1 earnings last month, reporting rising profit margin and better-than-expected earnings. With those numbers in the bag, Valero stock now sells for a very attractive P/E ratio of just 13.8 -- and because Valero, like the other stocks on this list, generates more cash from its business than it reports as net income, and an even better price-to-free cash flow ratio of just 7.6. But Valero is more than just another pretty value stock. It also sports the best dividend yield on today's list, weighing in at 4.3%. Even so, its annual dividend payments of $2.80 per share represent just 55% of net profit. What's Valero's incentive to grow those profits? That depends, as the company may prove cautious about boosting payments in the face of a topsy-turvy oil market that's seen recent price spikes in response to oil production cutbacks by Russia and OPEC. Still, with most analysts agreeing Valero has the ability to grow its profits at a respectable 13% annual rate over the next five years, I see potential for this dividend, too, to grow.  Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of Vale S.A. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy. Author Rich Smith (TMFDitty) I like things that go "boom."

The final agreement would include purchasing options with delivery of the 777s targeted from 2020, SaudiGulf Chief Executive Samer Al Majali told Reuters by email. The 777s could be used to fly to destinations in North America, Europe, and Asia, Al Majali said, although he cautioned that would depend on the airline obtaining international traffic rights. Based in Saudi Arabia’s eastern city of Dammam, SaudiGulf launched in 2016 and operates domestic flights between Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah and will start services to Abha next week. The airline expects to carry 700,000 passengers in 2017, its first full year of operations, and expand its narrow body fleet to between 26 and 30 aircraft “within the next three years”, Al Majali said. Its current fleet consists of four Airbus A320 narrow body jets. Saudi Arabia’s aviation sector is becoming increasingly competitive with the regulator awarding two domestic operating licences last year, including to SaudiGulf. State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) has announced plans to launch a low-cost airline this year and budget carrier flynas ordered 60 Airbus A320neos in January.

But airlines complain the order will cost them millions more than the nearly $900,000 that the FAA estimates it will cost U.S. carriers to remove the seats, roughly 10,000 in all. That’s because the FAA didn’t include replacing the seats in its estimate. Airlines, including some from other countries worried about meeting the standard, complained it would be uneconomical to fly with fewer seats on their planes. SkyWest Airlines of St. George, Utah, for example, said it would cost $250,000 to $500,000 to replace the seats on each of the 120 affected planes in its fleet. SkyWest is a regional carrier that operates feeder flights for the USA's four biggest airlines: American, Delta, United and Alaska. “Calculating these numbers would make the part cost in the millions just for our fleet,” Daniel Burkhard, SkyWest's engineering manager for compliance, told FAA when the fix was proposed.

The seats are on planes such as Boeing’s 717-200 and MD-90-30 aircraft, Bombardier’s CRJ700, CRJ900 and Q400 aircraft, and Embraer’s E170 and E190 planes. Videos reviewed by the FAA and Brazil’s civil aviation organization found that in a collision, a passenger might slide down the seat with the chin to hit the tray table on the seat ahead in a way that seriously injures the neck. “The intent of this (airworthiness directive) is to provide a safe outcome for passengers during a survivable crash by preventing serious injuries,” said the 29-page order from Paul Bernado, acting manager of FAA’s transport airplane directorate. The order is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. A committee of industry officials questioned the testing and the FAA’s proposed order from a year ago, saying the testing was inaccurate and subjective. But FAA stuck to its order for removing the seats. FAA estimated it would cost $85 to remove each unsafe seat, for a total of $890,970 to remove 10,482 seats flying with U.S. carriers within five years. Zodiac, SkyWest and Delta Air Lines asked that FAA allow for modifications of the seats, to make them safer. FAA refused to delay the order, but said if Zodiac develops a remedy short of removing the seats, it could be approved at that time.

Boeing 777 order by Q3 -CEO 24 May, 2017 DUBAI, May 24 (Reuters) - SaudiGulf Airlines expects to finalise an agreement for up to 16 Boeing 777 airliners with the planemaker by the third quarter of this year, its chief executive said on Wednesday. Boeing announced this week it was in talks to sell wide body jets to SaudiGulf but did not disclose the aircraft type. The final agreement would include purchasing options with delivery of the 777s targeted from 2020, SaudiGulf Chief Executive Samer al-Majali told Reuters by email. The 777s could be used to fly to destinations in North America, Europe, and Asia, al-Majali said, though cautioned that would depend on the airline obtaining international traffic rights. Advertisement Based in Saudi Arabia's eastern city of Dammam, SaudiGulf launched in 2016 and operates domestic flights between Dammam, Riyadh, and Jeddah and will start services to Abha next week. The airline expects to carry 700,000 passengers in 2017, its first full year of operations, and expand its narrow body fleet to between 26 and 30 aircraft "within the next three years", al-Majali said. Its current fleet consists of four Airbus A320 narrow body jets. Saudi Arabia's aviation sector is becoming increasingly competitive with the regulator awarding two domestic operating licences last year, including to SaudiGulf. State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) has announced plans to launch a low-cost airline this year and budget carrier flynas ordered 60 Airbus A320neos in January.

Source: Boeing The final Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft has now completed its major radar upgrade, the manufacturer Boeing announced on 23 May. The last of five RSAF E-3As has completed the Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) that has already been rolled out for other operators of the type, with the work having been carried out on the first aircraft by Boeing in Seattle and on the remainder by the Boeing-owned Alsalam Aerospace Industries in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. "The modernised software, multiple radar nodes, and overall enhanced operation make this the most significant upgrade to the AWACS radar since it was developed in the 1970s," Keith Burns, Saudi AWACS programs manager for Boeing was quoted as saying. As noted by Boeing, RSIP comprises a new radar computer, a radar control maintenance panel, and electrical and mechanical software and hardware. These, the company said, should improve the overall capabilities of the AN/APY-2 radar to track targets at the same time as increasing its reliability. The RSIP kit is built by Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems and has already been installed on US Air Force, UK Royal Air Force, NATO, and French Air Force AWACS fleets. Boeing delivered Saudi Arabia's AWACS aircraft between June 1986 and September 1987. With the Saudi RSIP programme now complete, the Kingdom is understood to have plans to put its E-3A fleet through the same Block 40/45 upgrade as that rolled out for the US and French air forces. The Block 40/45 is essentially a mission computing systems upgrade that covers hardware, in the form of a new suite of current state-of-the-art flat-screen computers, as well as the necessary software. This takes the aircraft very much into a Windows type of environment, enhancing the system's networking capability while improving the aircraft's reliability and lowering life-cycle costs.

The contract, issued by the Department of Defense earlier this month, was reported by the company this week. Boeing's multi-object kill vehicle, or MOKV, technology increases an interceptors' ability to locate and destroy incoming missiles. "Our MOKV concept gives the Missile Defense Agency flexibility in eliminating threats more efficiently and affordably," Paul Geery, vice president of Mission Solutions, Phantom Works, said in a press release. "We've created a robust, resilient design that benefits from our extensive experience in advanced seekers." Boeing received an initial study contract from the Missile Defense Agency in 2015 to design and develop the MOKV concept. It will now conduct risk reduction efforts for the technology. The MOKV system consists of a carrier vehicle with on-board sensors and a number of kill vehicles. The vehicles can be cued to destroy specific objects in a cluster of missile threats.

Sci-Tech by Eric Mack May 24, 2017 10:29 AM PDT @ericcmack Boeing's Phantom Express heads for spaaace. Boeing Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force's super-secretive Boeing-built X-37B space drone came back to Earth after nearly two years in orbit. For its next trick, Boeing plans to collaborate with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to create a new spaceplane that will be less mysterious but just as experimental. The new craft will be called "Phantom Express" and be designed to carry and launch small satellites aboard a plane rather than a rocket. It's kind of like skydiving, but when this plane's passenger gets pushed out the door at the edge of space, it doesn't fall to the ground. After dropping its cargo off in orbit, the plane fires an engine to turn around and return to Earth, landing on a runway to prepare for its next flight, just like a plane or the old space shuttle. In fact, Phantom Express will be equipped with a version of the Space Shuttle main engine, the AR-22 from Aerojet Rocketdyne. DARPA and Boeing will both invest in the development of the new craft and plan to conduct a demonstration of 10 flights over 10 days at some point in the future.

"We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria, and North Korea to protect American lives," Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee. "I can assure you that's a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president," he said, adding that the Trump administration is convinced that sanctions "really work." Mnuchin did not elaborate on the department's review of the aircraft sale licenses, which were issued by the Treasury last year under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. His statements followed President Donald Trump’s call on Iran to stop funding "terrorists and militias" during a trip this week to the Middle East. The Boeing aircraft sale was the biggest deal for a U.S. business contemplated in the landmark nuclear accord, while the Airbus sales were also among the largest business deals to come out of the agreement. IranAir has agreed to buy 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing and 100 from Airbus. All the aircraft need U.S. licenses because of their reliance on U.S. parts. Most of Iran's aging fleet of 250 commercial planes were purchased before 1979, and only 162 were operational last year, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Iran has said that halting the aircraft sales would breach the nuclear agreement, though some legal experts say the Treasury has authority to withdraw the licenses. For Boeing, losing the IranAir deal could force it to cut back production of 777 passenger jetliners. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval," a spokeswoman told Reuters by e-mail.

These 7 planes are trying to end Airbus and Boeing's dominance in the skies Benjamin Zhang May 24, 2017, 3:19 PM 67,779 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP The single-aisle airliner market is one of the most lucrative and hotly contested segments in the aviation business. But for the past 15 years, that white-hot competition has almost exclusively been between two companies — Airbus and Boeing.  In recent years, companies from around the world have launched aircraft aimed at breaking the Airbus-Boeing duopoly.  On Monday, China's COMAC and the Russia's United Aircraft Corporation announced a joint venture called the China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation or CRAIC. According to the two companies, the new joint venture will be tasked with developing a new long-range wide-body airliner.  CRAIC is the product of a joint venture agreement signed by COMAC and UAC in June of 2016 with the blessing of Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin.  "We will cooperate sincerely with UAC, unite as one, and strive to make the program a model of Sino-Russian cooperation," COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong said in a statement. "We will follow the latest international mainstream airworthiness standards, build more competitive long-range widebody aircraft, and strive to provide customers with better service and make new contributions to the global aviation market." The new JV will be will be based in Shanghai near COMAC's existing facilities and will also produce its future aircraft in the Chinese city.  In addition to the new Sin0-Russia wide-body, there is a slew of state-of-the-art airplanes from around the world designed to challenge Airbus' and Boeing's market dominance.  But before we get to their challengers, let's take a look at the next generation offerings from Airbus and Boeing. View As: One Page Slides Airbus A320neo family Airbus The Airbus A320neo family of airplanes are updated versions of the company's original A320-family with new-generation engines and optimized aerodynamics. The line up of medium-range airliners includes a trio of models — the 160-seat A319neo, the 189-seat A320neo, and the 240-seat A321neo. All three variants can be equipped with modern CFM LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofan engines.  Thus far, Airbus has more than 5,000 orders for the various versions of the A320neo. The first A320neos entered service in early 2016.   Airbus A350XWB Airbus The Airbus A350 XWB or Extra Wide Body is a family of next-generation long-haul widebody airliners. More than 70% of the aircraft is built using carbon composites, titanium, and advanced aluminum alloys. As a result, Airbus claims the A350 delivers 25% lower operating costs, fuel burn, and C02 emissions.   For increased passengers comfort, the cabin of the aircraft is pressurized to 6,000 ft. of altitude.  The A350 can be had in three different versions — the 280-seat Dash 800, the 325-seat Dash 900, and the 366-seat Dash 1000. All versions of the A350 are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB turbofan engines.  The A350 has a maximum range of more than 11,000 miles.  Through April 2017, Airbus has 831 orders for the A350. Eighty-one of the planes are already in service with 12 operators.    Airbus A330neo Airbus The A330neo or New Engine Option is an upgraded version of the existing Airbus A330 with next fuel-efficient engines, a new wing design, and avionics. The A330neo can be had with 257 seats or 287 seats.  All versions of the A330neo will be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 turbofan engines. Through the end of April, Airbus has 210 orders for the A330neo.    Boeing 737 MAX-Series Boeing Like the A320neo, the 737 MAX is the latest version of Boeing's long-serving short-to-medium range airliner that it has been selling for 50 years. For MAX duty, Boeing gave its 737 new engines, wings, avionics, and a slew of other updates. The 737 MAX series is made up of four different variants — the 149-seat 737 MAX7, the 189-seat MAX8, the 200-seat MAX200, and the 220-seat MAX9. The updated 737 is available with new CFM LEAP-1B turbofan engines. Boeing has more than 3,700 orders for the 737MAX and entered service in May.  Boeing 787 Dreamliner Boeing The 787 Dreamliner is a family of next-generation long-range widebody airliners. The carbon-composite Dreamliner is available in three guises  — the 242-seat Dash 8, the 290-seat Dash 9, and the 330-seat Dash 10.  The Boeing 787 is capable of delivering more than 8,700 miles of range while coddling passengers in a cabin optimized for more comfort and reduced jetlag.  Boeing Dreamliners are powered by either General Electric GENx-1B or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.  Through April 2017, Boeing has more than 1,200 orders for the Dreamliner.  Boeing 777X Boeing The Boeing 777X is the latest development of the company's wildly successful 777 family of airliners. Under development, the 777X is expected to replace not only existing versions of the 777 but also Boeing's iconic 747 jumbo jet. The 777X is available in two versions ranging from 350 to 425 seats and will be powered by General Electric GE9X engines. According to industry analysts, the 777X is expected to deliver unit costs lower than that of the Airbus A380 superjumbo.  Through April, Boeing has 306 orders for the 777X, which are expected to enter service in late 2019. Bombardier C-Series Bombardier The Bombardier C-Series is Airbus' and Boeing's most prominent rival. Although the Canadian airplane maker has long been a major player in regional airliners, the C-Series is the first time the company has had to compete against the US and European titans.  The Bombardier airliner has, thus far, struggled to net the level of sales as the 737 and the A320. But the C-Series has garnered critical acclaim for its performance, fuel efficiency, and design.  The C-Series lineup consists of two variants of the plane — the 133-seat CS100 and the 160-seat CS300. In the marketplace, the C-Series competes against the Boeing 737MAX7 and the Airbus A319neo.  Like the A320neo, the C-Series is powered by a version of Pratt & Whitney's revolutionary geared turbofan engines — the PW1500G. The Bombardier C-Series entered commercial service in 2016 and has more than 300 firm orders for the plane.  Embraer E-Jet E2 REUTERS/Nacho Doce Like Bombardier, Embraer is also a major regional airliner powerhouse that's moving up to the big leagues to compete against Airbus and Boeing. Embraer's contender is the second generation of the company's E-Jet called the E2. Even though the first generation airplane made a living mostly with regional airlines, Embraer is marketing the second generation as a smaller alternative to the A319 and the MAX7.  The E2 lineup comprises three variants — the 88-seat E175-E2, the 106-seat E190-E2, and the 132-seat E195-E2.  The E2 is powered by two versions of Pratt & Whitney's geared turbofan engine. The Embraer E-Jet E2 is expected to enter service in 2018. The Brazilian airplane maker currently has roughly 270 orders for its latest jet.  Mitsubishi MRJ REUTERS/Kyodo The Mitsubishi MRJ is Japan's first native commercial airliner in 50 years. The MRJ or Mitsubishi Regional Jet lineup is made up of the 80-seat MRJ70 and the 92-seat MRJ90. Although the MRJ variants are much smaller any of the offerings from Airbus or Boeing, the plane represents a domestic alternative for a country whose airlines have long been one of Boeing's most loyal customers. The MRJ will also be powered by Pratt & Whitney's geared turbofan engine. The Mitsubishi airliner is expected to enter service in 2018. The company currently has more than 220 orders for the MRJ. COMAC ARJ21 AP The COMAC ARJ21 is China's first modern airliner. COMAC or Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, was founded in 2008 to design and produce indigenous airplanes for the country's burgeoning airline industry. According to Boeing, Chinese airlines are expected to order more than 6,300 airplanes over the next 20 years with a total value topping $1 trillion. The ARJ21 is a 90-seat regional airliner designed for short-to-medium range duty. It's powered by a pair of General Electric CF34-10A engines. The Chinese government-owned company currently has almost 350 orders for the plane — mostly from domestic airlines and leasing companies. The ARJ21 entered service in late 2015 . COMAC C919 AP The C919 is COMAC's first mainline jet designed to go head-to-head with the A320neo and the 737 MAX. The 168-seat jet is expected to be powered by a pair of CFM LEAP-1C engines. Thus far, COMAC has 517 orders for the C919 with almost all of them from Chinese operators. The Shanghai-built airliner is expected to make its first flight next year and enter service sometime after 2020. The C919 made its maiden flight in May of 2017.  Irkut MC-21 Irkut The Irkut MC-21 is the latest airliner to emerge from the Russian aviation industry. The MC-21 will be available in two versions — the 165-seat MC-21-200 and the 211-seat MC-21-300. The MC-21 is available with two engine options — the Russian Aviadvigatel PD14 and the American Pratt & Whitney PW1440G geared turbofan. Irkut currently has 175 orders the MC-21— made almost exclusively by Russian airlines and leasing companies. Although Irkut does not have a track record in the commercial aviation space, the company and its Yakovlev subsidiary have a long history building some of the world's elite military aircraft.  In addition, Irkut also manufactures components for the rival Airbus A320.  CRAIC 929 China Daily/via REUTERS China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation has been set up to develop an aircraft capable of breaking up Airbus' and Boeing's duopoly in the widebody airliner market.  The Sino-Russian jetliner remains unnamed, however, it has commonly been referred to as the 929. Little is know about the aircraft, however, CRAIC is aiming for a 280-seat widebody with a range of more than 7,500 miles. The 929 is expected to take roughly a decade to develop.  Get the latest Boeing stock price here.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Space Boeing tapped to build Phantom Express spaceplane for DARPA David Szondy May 24, 2017 Phantom Express shown preparing to launch its expendable second stage on the top of the vehicle in this artist’s concept (Credit: boeing-spaceplane) View gallery - 2 images DARPA's ambitious launch-a-day spaceplane is a step closer to lift off after Boeing announced that it's been assigned the contract to work with the agency to design, build and test a technology demonstration vehicle for the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. Called the Phantom Express, the goal is to create an unmanned, autonomous, hypersonic, reusable spaceplane that can deliver small payloads of 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) to low Earth orbit. Currently, space launches are special events that take months or years in preparation, but as the world becomes more dependent on orbital assets, stepping up the pace is becoming a major priority. This is especially the case for the military, which often requires new satellites put in place on very short notice to fulfill missions in a fast-changing world. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW The Phantom Express is DARPA's idea for a craft that can deliver small payloads into orbit for about US$5 million each. Unlike the US Air Force's X-37B, the Phantom is a self-contained vertical launch vehicle about the size of a business jet and uses cryogenic liquid oxygen and hydrogen propellants to power an updated version of the Space Shuttle's Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine. The idea is that the Phantom Express would lift off from a launch pad and go into a suborbital trajectory at hypersonic speeds while shielded by third-generation thermal protection. After it reaches the edge of space, it would launch a small, expendable second stage, which would deliver the payload to orbit. Meanwhile, the Phantom would bank and return to the spaceport, where it would land like a conventional aircraft. Because the Phantom would be built and operated more like a military aircraft than a space vehicle, and even uses off-shelf military components, DARPA says that it has a potential turnaround time for the next launch of hours instead of weeks. According to the agency, this first of a new class of spaceplanes would allow the US to quickly recover even if faced with the catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites. Boeing's task is to develop a technology demonstrator capable of carrying out 10 flights in 10 days by using easily accessible subsystem components that can be quickly ordered and replaced. As the XS-1 project enters Phase 2 and 3, the vehicle will incorporate advanced, lightweight composite cryogenic propellant tanks, hybrid composite-metallic wings and control surfaces capable of withstanding hypersonic temperatures and stresses, and automated flight-termination and other technologies, including those from DARPA's Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program. If all goes to schedule, Phase 2 will see static engine tests by 2019, followed by Phase 3 that will include 12 to 15 flight tests by 2020, the 10 in 10 days flight demonstration, and hypersonic test flights at Mach 5 (3,800 mph, 6,125 km/h). This will be followed by flights at Mach 10 (7,600 mph, 12,250 km/h) and delivering payloads of up to 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) to low Earth orbit. DARPA says that in addition to the Phantom Express helping meet military needs, it hopes it will attract interest in the XS-1 technology from private firms. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," says Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 — fabrication and flight."

(Boeing Illustration) The Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency says it has selected the Boeing Co. to develop and test its XS-1 hypersonic space plane, using a design now known as the Phantom Express. Boeing won out over Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems to take the long-running XS-1 project beyond Phase 1 into Phase 2/3, culminating with test flights in 2020. The reusable space plane would be designed to carry and deploy a small, expendable upper stage, then return to Earth for a runway landing. The upper stage would be capable of putting satellites weighing up to 3,000 pounds in low Earth orbit. “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said today in a statement. DARPA will provide up to $146 million for the project. Boeing said it would invest jointly with DARPA in the plane’s development, but declined to give a specific figure for its contribution. Boeing and the Air Force already have tested a reusable space plane known as the X-37B four times. The most recently flown X-37B landed earlier this month after spending nearly two years in orbit. Boeing had partnered with Blue Origin on rocket engine studies during Phase 1 of the XS-1 project, but for Phase 2/3, the company will go with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s AR-22 engine, which is based on the design for the space shuttle main engines. “As one of the world’s most reliable rocket engines, the SSME is a smart choice to power the XS-1 launch vehicle,” Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO and President Eileen Drake said in a statement. “This engine has a demonstrated track record of solid performance and proven reusability.” Phase 2 of the XS-1 project calls on Boeing to complete its design for the Phantom Express and conduct ground tests by 2019. One of the key ground tests calls for firing the rocket engine 10 times over consecutive 10 days. Phase 3 would involve 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020. One objective is to have the XS-1 fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days to demonstrate reusability with a rapid turn-around. Subsequent test flights would fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload weighing between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. DARPA said one of its aims was to encourage the rise of commercial launch services that could operate with recurring costs of $5 million or less per launch. Toward that end, DARPA plans to release selected data from its Phase 2/3 tests and share relevant payload specifications with commercial ventures. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, said in the agency’s news release. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

In an announcement on Wednesday, DARPA said that Boeing, which was selected for phase one of the project, would keep working on its advanced design for the Experimental Space plane (XS-1) program with additional funding for phases two and three. While Phase One of XS-1 was more of a drawing board/concept phase, phases two and three are all about actually building a space plane and conducting flight tests, demonstrations, and hopefully, delivery of a satellite into orbit. Here's how DARPA describes what it hopes XS-1 may one day pull off: The XS-1 program envisions a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds. The vehicle would be launched with no external boosters, powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. Since it's DARPA, the project is focused on national security, and there's no doubt the Pentagon could save plenty of money and time by launching satellites via a low-cost space plane. But the agency also notes in its announcement that another goal is to "encourage the broader commercial launch sector," and it will release testing data out to companies who are interested during phases two and three. The X-S1 hypersonic space plane DARPA So it looks like the military won't be the only ones having fun flying planes into space, Mr. Skywalker. DARPA has been behind a number of huge technological advances that have made their way to the private sector, like the Internet, a ton of the components of modern-day computing, and GPS, just to name a few. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Check out the demo video below: This article was originally published on Business Insider.

Banking on such bullish trends, investing in some solid defense stocks seems judicious. US-Saudi Arabia Seal Weapon Deal Trump signed an almost $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which could be worth $350 billion over the next 10 years. The White House said that this was „a significant expansion of security relationship” between the countries. Saudi Arabia imported $3 billion worth of U.S. arms last year, the maximum by any country. Saudi Arabia is also the primary destination for U.S. arms sales, with the kingdom acquiring nearly 10% of U.S. exports in the 2011 to 2015 period. The oil-rich kingdom is on a broad-based push for economic development and is looking forward to signing a series of deals with private U.S. corporations worth tens of billions of dollars. The arms package will boost Saudi Arabia’s military prowess as tensions flare in the region. Saudi Arabia is being targeted by radical Islamic extremism, hence, such a deal will help the country counter terrorist attacks. The U.S. also views the nation as a potential partner in its endeavor to check the global ambitions of Iran. Further, the Saudi Arabia deal could lead to additional sales for both Israel and the Persian Gulf countries, all of whom are apprehensive about Iran’s aggressive foreign policy and its support toward terrorist groups in the region. Benefactors of the Deal Lockheed Martin is poised to be the biggest gainer from the deal. The world’s largest defense contractors, whose technology was part of the agreement, said that the deal „will directly contribute to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 by opening the door for thousands of highly skilled jobs in new economic sectors”. According to Lockheed Martin, Saudi Arabia has „expressed its intent” to buy $28 billion worth of weapons systems from the company. This includes 150 Sikorsky helicopters, the THAAD missile defense system and four littoral combat ships. Jet maker Boeing also signed a handful of deals with Saudi Arabia during Trump’s weekend visit. This involved the sale of military and passenger aircraft. Raytheon, which has done business in the Middle East for more than five decades, plans to form Raytheon Arabia that will create home-grown defense, aerospace and security capabilities in Saudi Arabia in areas like cybersecurity and missile defense. In fact, these types of arms deals have led to the rally in defense stocks in the past, according to CNBC analysis using Kensho. Going back to 2009, one month after the then U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF was up 3.3%, reflecting almost double the return of the S&P 500. Defense Stocks Soar to All-Time Highs This time also it seems Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia is paying off for defense stocks. Shares of Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and other big defense players rallied on May 22 on the arms deal. While Lockheed Martin was the big winner with 1.6% after jumping to a new 52-week high of $280.79 per share, General Dynamics went up 0.9% to $197.55, after hitting a 52-week high of $199 a share. Raytheon, in the meantime, rallied 0.4% after peaking to $163.57 a share, also a 52-week high. Boeing was up 1.2% to just under $183 a share, but, unlike others it did not scale a 52-week high. Nevertheless, the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio was up 0.9%, while the ITA gained 0.8% 5 Best Defense Picks for Your Portfolio With defense stocks hitting highs on U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal, investing in such companies will be prudent.

The latest contract is in addition to a previously announced $42.7 million contract to provide support and maintenance for the BFT-1 program, the release explained. "This award demonstrates the critical role that our Mobile Datacom organization continues to play in providing the US military with trusted BFT-1 satellite tracking communication capability," the release stated. BFT, or Blue Force Tracking, consists of a terminal and antenna that can both track the position of satellites and transmit data to military commanders. U.S. Air Force F-15Cs have demonstrated the ability to securely communicate with other aircraft and ground stations using a Boeing-developed networking system, the company announced Monday. The sharing of information took place during recent test flights at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., using Talon HATE airborne pods. The pods enabled the F-15C pilots to share information through the military's Link 16, Common Data Link and Wideband Global SATCOM satellites. Boeing said that in addition the tests validated intra-flight datalink network capabilities used by F-22 aircraft. "We've completed developmental flight test," Lt. Col. Christopher Bradley, Air Force Talon HATE manager, said in a press release. "We look forward to fielding this system, not only to immediately provide aircrews with actionable information faster and at a higher quality, but also to help the Air Force learn important lessons for the employment of tactical gateway systems in the future." "This aerial network is a giant leap forward in tactical fighter capability with real-time connectivity and expanded information sharing," said Paul Geery, vice president of Phantom Works Mission Solutions and Boeing's Talon HATE program manager. "We are now demonstrating secure datalink connections between F-15Cs and F-22s in a way that integrates information for the pilot into a common operating picture." Boeing said additional tests on the system using advanced sensors for improved aircraft targeting will be held later his year.

The non-stop service from the central Florida city had only just taken off on Sunday when two crew members reported feeling ill. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was forced to dump fuel, and returned to Sanford airport 45 minutes after take-off. Four people were taken to hospital, and other passengers were assessed at the airport – before the plane was checked by a chemical hazards team. Passengers were delayed by 24 hours in their journey home, as a replacement aircraft had to be dispatched to Florida from the UK. Initial tests on the grounded aircraft proved inconclusive, and the cause of the crew members’ sickness has not been ascertained. A modern type of aircraft which first came into service in 2009, the Dreamliner is designed so that, in contrast to older planes, cabin air is not drawn in from the engines. A report by the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive (GCAQA) – which represents more than 800,000 airline staff – in 2014 praised Boeing for “designing [the Dreamliner] so it can provide clean breathing air to passengers and crews.” “For over 50 years,” the report added, “all commercial jet aircraft have used the flawed practice of supplying passengers and crews with unfiltered breathing air taken directly from the compression section of the engine using a process known as ‘Bleed Air’.” “The Boeing 787 is unique in that it uses a new “bleed-free” architecture through the use of electrical compressors that ensures passengers and crews are no longer exposed to oil fumes.” A spokesperson for Thomson said: “The safety of our customers is of paramount importance to us, and we would like to reassure everyone that events such as these are rare.” However, the incident will add to the ongoing debate about the effects of cabin air on passengers and aircraft crew. Richard Westgate died in 2012 Last year, the trade union Unite called for a public inquiry into potentially toxic fumes in cabins, in response to a report into the death of pilot Richard Westgate. Mr Westgate died in 2012 after claiming that he had been poisoned by cabin fumes. A British Airways employee, he was found dead in a hotel in the Netherlands, 15 months into a period of medical leave due to “cognitive dysfunction, ataxia and other deficits”. A coroner’s report said that post-mortem examinations “disclosed symptoms consistent with exposure to organo-phosphate compounds in aircraft cabin air.” Airline reviews Unite called for further investigation, saying: “The aviation industry simply cannot continue to ignore the clamour for action.” The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says that incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft are rare, and that there is no evidence of negative long-term health effects.

He lives in Dallas. President Trump spoke to leaders of countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council on May 21 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Here's what he said, in three minutes. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) “Many thousands” of American jobs will be created, President Trump says, thanks to a mammoth arms deal that he signed with Saudi Arabia over the weekend. On paper. Whether and where those jobs will actually materialize is anyone’s guess — and the only new jobs that have been announced will be in Saudi Arabia, where Lockheed Martin will employ 450 workers to manufacture Black Hawk helicopters. That didn’t stop Trump from boasting that the deal will also be a boon for workers in the United States, part of an emerging era of American greatness ushered in by the deals Trump has been making on our behalf. “For Americans, this is an exciting time,” Trump said in his speech announcing the deal. “A new spirit of optimism is sweeping our country.” But at least one industry observer urged news organizations to treat the deal’s reported figures with skepticism. “Most of the time,” Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said to McClatchy, the enormous worth of packages such as the Saudi deal “isn’t reached.” Regardless of its worth, everything about the Saudi arms deal — except for the $24 billion in military gear that was approved for sale to the Saudis by President Barack Obama and was reportedly part of the package — is pure Trump: It’s big, it’s bold, it involves large numbers and optimistic claims, and it is a fluid, under-negotiation entity that somehow is transformed into concrete fact by the headlines the president adores. Those headlines blare loud enough to drown out the work of meek fact-checkers asking simple questions. Questions such as: What jobs will the deal create? Where will they be? A spokesman for Raytheon, one of the companies that along with Lockheed Martin, Boeing and General Dynamics signed memorandums of understanding with Saudi Arabia as part of the deal, was unable to even speculate as to whether or how many jobs the arms package will add. Is there any way for Raytheon to estimate how many jobs the deal will create? “No,” said the spokesman, Mike Doble. Lockheed Martin’s chief executive said in a statement that the deal would “support” thousands of jobs in the United States and Saudi Arabia. Boeing said the deal would “create or sustain” jobs in both countries. Neither company would put a specific number on new jobs being created in the United States. [Trump wants to manage the economy by personally running every business. He can’t.] Get past the bluster of Trump’s speech and accompanying tweets and you’ll find a statement on the White House website that details the fine print: “This package demonstrates the United States’ commitment to our partnership with Saudi Arabia, while also expanding opportunities for American companies in the region, potentially supporting tens of thousands of new jobs in the United States.” “Potentially supporting” were never words that the president uttered in Riyadh. “Jobs, jobs, jobs,” he proclaimed. White House press secretary Sean Spicer took things a step further Saturday morning, saying that the deal would create “hundreds of thousands of jobs.” In the span of hours, “many thousands” became “hundreds of thousands” of jobs that will either be created, supported or sustained, depending on whose words you choose to hear. But this is nothing new: Trump’s relationship with jobs numbers has long been defined by questionable and false claims. At least 10 times since taking office, Trump has taken credit for jobs deals that were either in the works before he was elected or have absolutely nothing to do with him or his policies. All told, those deals do add up to “many thousands” of jobs. As with many things involving Trump, his views as a private citizen are in direct contradiction to what he thinks as president. Monthly jobs statistics, for instance, were not to be believed according to Trump the entrepreneur and presidential candidate, who tweeted more than a dozen times that Labor Department reports were “fake,” “phony,” “false” and “fiction.” As president, Trump has taken a different view. “I talked to the president prior to this,” Spicer said during a March media briefing, “and he said to quote him very clearly, ‘They may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now.’ ” What’s hard to get at are the real benefits of deals such as the Saudi arms package for American workers. Will the new jobs announced in all-caps breathlessness by the president and his team come to fruition? If they do, how much credit does Trump deserve? For one part of the larger deal, which reportedly comes to $350 billion over 10 years and includes both military and infrastructure spending — the $20 billion that the Saudis pledged to private-equity giant Blackstone to help the firm fund U.S. infrastructure projects — the answer to the latter question is very little. Trump adviser and Blackstone chief executive Stephen Schwarzman said the $20 billion had been in the works for more than a year, easily predating Trump’s administration. Added to the $24 billion in arms sales that were approved by the Obama administration, Blackstone’s $20 billion brings the total portion of the Saudi deal that Trump can’t rightly take credit for to $44 billion. [Trump’s first foreign trip is all downhill from here] In announcing the jobs that Trump claims will be created by the arms deal, he took time to make two other claims that screamed for immediate and thorough fact-checking. Not only have 1 million new jobs been added since Trump became president, but “nearly $3 trillion of new value” has been added to the economy, the president said. Does that mean $3 trillion more in gross domestic product? New corporate profits? Tax revenue? Doesn’t matter. Nor does it matter that the million-jobs claim is highly debatable. In Trump’s world, the only thing that matters is that it sounds good — a deal, and one that he personally made, on behalf of the American people. 0 Comments  Share on FacebookShare   Share on TwitterTweet Share via Email Justin Glawe is an independent journalist.

The Boeing flight MH17 was shot down by the Ukrainian air force fighter jets, but not necessarily piloted by Ukrainian pilots. It was a CIA and NATO operation to frame Russia. Most likely the Dutch government was a part of this operation.Now, they are trying to hang all the dogs on Waltzman -Poroshenko, because neither the Dutch monarchs, nor the CIA would fancy to be incriminated in this crime.Poroshenko is a dead man walking, especially after banning the Russian social media, which is where every Ukrainian lives.Germany is pressing Ukraine to get back and start cooperating with Russia in terms of trade, because otherwise is a total alles kaput. That’s why someone from CIA or NATO is leaking the documents to “Sovershenno sekretno,” which is not a pro-Putin publication. I am certain that these documents are real, and that all they do is to implicate in this horrible crime a few low level Lugansk regional SBU officers, the country bumpkins.May 9th leak of personnel data of the Luganst Regional SBU office was the first hint.  I posted two videos, thinking that these could be the beginning of something bigger. I was right.No doubt that we will see more documents and even witnesses coming forward.=================================The following is the translation of an article SBU orders to destroy all evidence of the conducted special operationBelow are images of 4 «цiлком таемнiх» («top secret») documents generated by the Security Service of UkraineThe newspaper “Under Absolute Secrecy” got hold of photocopies of documents generated by the Security Service of Ukraine SBU pertinent to the special operation commenced by the SBU in order to find and destroy all the evidence of mass murder that  took place in the sky over the Donbas on July 17, 2014.The newspaper “Sovershenno sekretno” initiated its own investigation title:“Unwrapping The Mystery a mystery of the Boeing MH17 crash. The operation of the Security Service of Ukraine “Clean up” Part 1– Order to conduct the following special procedures in order to destroy the facts of a special operation.– Order to carry out effective preventive measures among witnesses of special operations that were conducted on July 17, 2014.– Order to identify and detain witnesses of the civil aircraft explosion.– Order to redeploy and regroup the servicemen who were deployed to serve their official duties in the territory of the village Grabovo, Donetsk region.– As part of a special operation, command to destroy all materials that indicate the presence of a combat aircraft having carried out combat missions in the specified area on July 17, 2014.THE SOURCE OF THESE PHOTOCOPIES First, we reacted to these documents with skepticism.  Most of them, judging by the holes punched in a side, were extracted from some folders and photographed. The orders, encrypted telegrams, plans and decrees are written on the official forms with official trident-crowned letterhead of “Служба Безпеки Украiни” which means the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), as well as on the ordinary sheets of A4 paper. All of the documents contain signatures, resolutions, file numbers and seals. The materials generated by the secret bureaucracy of the Ukrainian “безпеки” or security have fallen into our hands, and these explosive materials should lead to the international scandal and should bring the President of Ukraine Poroshenko and his generals on the defenders bench of the tribunal at the Hague as war criminals.The person who handed us these documents appeared out of nowhere and disappeared into nowhere. During our several meetings in the course of a month he changed five phone SIM cards and changed his email address three times.When asked why he decided to leak the documents to us, he replied that he knows and respects us as journalists of the newspaper “Sovershenno sekretno”.When asked who he is and how he managed to get the secret SBU documents, he answered something like this: “This is an intermediate result of a long and diligent work. In Ukraine, I have several old friends, who are sick and tired of being set up and walked all over. These guys are finicky, however, on one hand they want these bastards to get what deserve, but on the other hand, they want a small safety net. That’s why they want some money for these documents.” After he mentioned money, we got a bit sad. The financial power of our editorial office and our partner the Journalist Agency for Federal Investigations FLB.ru are rather modest. “Believe me,” he told us. “I personally just want those SBU bastards to get what they deserve.”Copies of the documents looked legitimate. Later, we gave them over to one of the Lubyanka (Moscow city Criminal Police Department) experts for examination, and he pointed out that all of the documents had been drawn up according to the rules of record management that go back to the KGB.  Many senior employees of the security service of Ukraine are the former employees of KGB. Of course the authenticity of these documents can be established not by journalists, or even a Police expert, but by the court appointed investigators, who must study the original orders and decrees, without sanitization made in our case, apparently for operative purposes and for security reasons.What’s important for us that finally after three years since the plane crash the names of real witnesses and probably real executors of this murder are beginning to emerge. That’s why today you have the opportunity to read copies of 4 completely criminal orders issued by the Security Services of Ukraine.And that’s why, we have no choice, the newspaper “Sovershenno sekretno” announces a public investigation ““Let’s uncover the secret of Boeing MH17 crash.”Only with your help we can get other criminal orders, encrypted telegrams and decrees. The international commission for investigation of the Malaysian Boeing 777 crash in the Netherlands does not want to work, and distorts and classifies the investigation results. Let’s all help to find out what had happened, or at least get closer to the truth. The truth is about how those 298 people who died.These four photocopies allow us to draw three preliminary groundbreaking conclusions.The first conclusion is: that the new Kiev authorities are responsible for the shooting down of the Malaysian Boeing 777 MH17 flight. President Poroshenko and his generals have been hiding the truth and lying for the last 3 years.The second conclusion is that the Ukraine’s military aviation is involved in this resonant plane crash.The third conclusion is that in order to cover up the traces of this monstrous crime, starting with the end of July 2014 the SBU undertook measures to destroy the facts of this special operation and all the materials indicating the presence of a combat aircraft having carried out combat missions on July 17, 2014.Dozens of people were involved in this special operation of downing the aircraft and the subsequent “cleanup”; there were hundreds of unwitting witnesses among the military personnel of the Ukrainian army. We hope that sooner or later they will speak up.In the meantime we expect that within the next month or so we will be able to obtain other documents from the depths of the Ukrainian “безпеки” (security) and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense that will point at the real culprit of the MH17 flight crash.SPECIAL SBU OPERATION TO LIQUIDATE THE EVIDENCEWe are posting the SBU secret documents in the chronological order the way they were issued. The photocopies of originals are accompanied by the Russian translation. As it is stated in one of the orders, the start of the “cleanup” operation was given three days after the shooting of the aircraft, on July 20, 2014. It was on this day when the first deputy director of the SBU Colonel General Vasily Sergeyevich Gritsak approved the “Plan for the main organizational, counterintelligence and special investigation measures of the DKR SBU dated 20.07.2014 No. 1 / 1-837.” (DKR is counterintelligence department of the SBU. We do not have the copy of this Gritsak’s plan yet, but hope that we will get it – FLB)Document No. 1http://www.sovsekretno.ru/public/userfiles/images/1-grek-SSU-Kacap-220717-2105.jpgTop Secret(without supplement - for officialuse only)Copy №1Personally to the Head of  KRP Office of the DKR SBUKiev(KRP DKR is Office of counterintelligence search ofcounterintelligence department – FLB)Stamp: Security Service of UkraineRef. No. 1/978 dated 22.07.2014Resolution: As part of the ATO in this territory of the Lugansk region I ask you to transfer the materials to the DKR SBU, Kiev.Gritsak, 26.07.2014In regarding to the initiation of the case of the counterintelligence investigation “Katsap”[Katsap is derogative for “Russian”]Based on the order of the Security Service of Ukraine from 02.09.2003 No. 0012 and the directive of the Director of SBU dated 05.08.2009 No. 3/1855 “On certain problems and issues in the organization of work on counterintelligence cases,” we report that on July 22, 2014 we initiated the case of the counterintelligence investigation “Katsap” No. 1/1044 regarding a citizen of Ukraine, the head of one of the state enterprises. The case is classified as “intelligence activity of special services of foreign states, organizations, and groups of persons against Ukraine” and it has been filed by the counterintelligence department of the Security Service of Ukraine in Lugansk region.The reason for initiating this case was the operational data obtained during the counterintelligence investigation in the problem areas of the Lugansk region, which indicates the involvement of this subject with the special services of RF in order to destroy the state system of Ukraine, as it is shows in the behavior and actions of the subject.From persons, who confidentially cooperate with the Security Services of Ukraine, we obtain information that the subject “Katsap” has the regular contacts with representatives of the terrorist organization of the LNR (Luganst People’s Republic). Namely the object has periodic contacts with In addition, “Katsap” communicates with representatives of the mass media of foreign countries (RF, the European Union) in which he indicates that he is a direct witness and has evidence of law violations conducted by the Ukrainian army and aviation, namely of the shooting down of the civil aircraft on 17.07.2014.In daily activities he uses conspiracy methods, possibly has several national passports, periodically changes home addresses. These features of the behavior of the object further indicate his possible involvement with the national security services of foreign states.“Katsap” has stable connections among representatives of local authorities, law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies of the region and accordingly has real opportunities to influence the environment and to obtain diverse intelligence information.The information received indicates that “Katsap” probably owns information that can cause damage to the state and be used by the Russian national special service.Amendment:Plan of counterintelligence measures for SKP “Katsap” No. 1/1044, c/c No. 1, Identification No. 1/4 -2948 from 22.07.2014, secret, in 3 (three) sheets.Head of the SBU Departmentfor Lugansk regioncolonel М. Grek «22» July 2014 ”—As you can see, one high-ranking Ukrainian state official has been targeted the officers of the SBU department for the Lugansk region that were conducting a special operation. A week after the Boeing crash, on July 22, the operational case “Katsap” was filed against him. As it follows from this document “Katsap” interested “безпеку” (security) mainly because he “is a direct witness and has evidence of law violations by the Ukrainian army and aviation, namely of the shooting down of the civil aircraft on 17.07.2014”. We do not know yet what happened to this witness.Document No. 2Office KRP DKP SBUUrgent Top Secret(urgency mark) (classification)Outgoing encrypted telegram No. 6130From: Kiev, UKRP SBUDestination: LuganskRecipient: Head of Office SBU for Lugansk regionMr. Grek М.Regarding the detention of witnesses(in addition to ET No. 6138 from 24.07.2014)In pursuance of the instructions of the Director of the SBU “on identification and detention of witnesses” of the incident occurred on July 17, 2014, near village Grabovo, Donetsk region, operative support of materials regarding a special operation in the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions is carried out by the Office KRP DKR .It has been established that there are actual witnesses of the shooting down of the civilian aircraft, some persons are identified and detained, but at the same time the Office has received data that one of the servicemen who is located in the territory of the Lugansk region has videotaped this event.In this regard, we ask you to identify and detain a person from among the military personnel who made a photo-video recording of the event.In the future we ask you to report on the situation directly to the UKRP DKR of the Security Service of Ukraine.Sincerely,Head of department No. 4 UKRPDKR SB of Ukrainecolonel Kalchenko R.The signature is correct cap.

No. 7-21 Special notebook No. 11 Page No. 27—As you remember, some witnesses of the “shooting down of the civilian aircraft” were the inhabitants of settlements in the area of the plane crash .They were shown by the Russian mass media and they testified that on the day of the tragedy the locals heard explosions and saw the fighter jets. But does anyone know about the fate of the Ukrainian soldier who took pictures of the Ukraine air force military aircrafts attack on the Boeing flight MH17 and who was searched for by the Ukrainian counterintelligence on July 24?As our operational source told us — this man was called Vyacheslav, he had the rank of sergeant, served in one of the mortar element of ATO. Vyacheslav made photos of “shooting down of the civil aircraft” by using his smartphone Apple iPhone 4. (We hope to get these pictures – Ed.)We speak about him in the past tense because this sergeant died, and he died under strange circumstances. Vyacheslav was shot by a sniper when he was outside of the combat zone. At the time of his death Vyacheslav was the only junior rank among the senior officers surrounding him. His personal effects were immediately taken away by SBU officers, but the day before, as our source said, Vyacheslav managed to transfer photos to his acquaintance – commander of the mortar element of the military unit A1556, warrant officer Andrei Vladimirovich Drozd. (Interim commander of the m/u A1556 – Lieutenant Colonel I. Stakhiv, in the Russian transcription he most likely is Stakhov).According to the same information, warrant officer Drozd as the commander of the mortar regiment received an order for nonstop mortar shelling of the Boeing crash area. In addition, it is known that for some time he was in the hospital due to a leg wound.We bring up here all these details because warrant officer Andrei Drozd is a valuable witness and we hope very much that “preventive work” wasn’t carried out with him the same way as it was, allegedly, conducted against his colleague Vyacheslav by a sniper bullet. Lieutenant Colonel I. Stakhiv is also a valuable witness.To be continued…. ===================http://thesaker.is/sbu-orders-to-destroy-all-evidence-of-the-conducted-special-operation-mh17/...

Ben Sandilands Editor of Plane Talking Share Ever since John Howard decided that the PM’s then-brand new Boeing BBJ VIP jets in 2002 had to be as uncomfortable as possible, there have been press gallery reporters, and perhaps political successors, pining for a less agonising way of covering long-distance trips. Airbus has just rekindled those dreams by releasing details of a VIP version of its high-tech remake of its wide-body A330 capable of taking a select prime ministerial party non-stop from Canberra to London, or Washington DC, or just about anywhere! It’s called the ACJ330NEO, and the media release says it can fly non-stop for 20 hours from Europe to Australia. OK, let’s not quibble too much. Twenty hours and 17,400 kilometres non-stop coming eastbound isn’t the same as doing it non-stop in the other direction, nor long enough to do it from Canberra. But it could be done! All that is required is to eject one or two superfluous or under-performing members of the prime ministerial entourage at a range- and payload-critical moment and maybe 21 or 22 of the original contingent of 25 people could make it to Buckingham Palace. Airbus, like Boeing, always seems to be very conservative in its range-payload estimates, which if you are trying to navigate the tricky airspace between Australia and Europe, even with top level approvals, is no doubt prudent on their part. VIP jets don’t necessarily have to file flight plans consistent with commercial ETOPS rules either. There is no doubt on the specs that the ACJA330 will be a potent carriage, especially fitted out with enough room for full flat sleeper seats for all in an official party, compared to the exceedingly ordinary seating arrangements in the ancient, but alas, still under contract, VIP BBJs of RAAF Squadron 34. There is nothing wrong, of course, with an opulently outfitted 737-based BBJ. Except that John Howard was concerned that they might be perceived as too luxurious for Australian political sensitivities some 15 years ago — hence the subsequent suffering. Even the PM would have found the sleeping arrangements grotesquely inferior to what Qantas, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore Airlines and so forth routinely offer to their premium customers today. In its current technology forms, the A330 is well known to the RAAF as a multi-role tanker transport, as well as a major part of the wide-body fleets of Qantas and Virgin Australia. However, by the time any Australian government has a VIP fleet free of contract obligations and in an environment where it might dare seriously canvass a more comfortable and versatile alternative to the BBJs there will almost certainly be ACJ350s on offer. We already know that from late next year there will be commercial A350s flying that might out-distance an ACJ330NEO, and that in the early 2020s, the technology for them to take around 100 passengers non-stop each way between Sydney or Melbourne should have been reliably established. *This article was originally published at Plane Talking Share this article Advertisement Topics airbus John Howard planes We recommend From around the web Powered by Taboola 0 comments Leave a comment Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz Russia Fears NATO (And These 5 Weapons Are a Big Reason Why) Dave Majumdar May 23, 2017 TweetShareShare The Boeing AH-64A Apache helicopter gunship was first introduced in 1986 as a weapon to blunt an anticipated Soviet armored spearhead punching through the Fulda Gap in what is now central Germany. The Apache proved itself an able tank killer during the 1991 Gulf War, decimating Iraq’s beleaguered forces. Since then, the Apache has undergone many modernizations—adding ever improving sensors and weapons. But like its predecessors, the newest Apache models can carry sixteen Hellfire anti-attack weapons—or enough to wipe out a company of tanks in a single salvo. While the Apache has mostly been used to fight insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years, the powerful gunship retains its formidable anti-tank punch. Senior U.S. defense and foreign policy officials are increasingly focused on a resurgent Russia and the threat it might pose in Europe. Over the past two years, Russia has behaved aggressively in Ukraine and stepped up its bomber and submarine patrols. Indeed, NATO officials like Royal Navy Vice Adm. Clive Johnstone—commander of NATO's Maritime Command—have pointed out that Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic is at an all time high. Meanwhile, Moscow is building up its forces in its Kaliningrad enclave. But what is NATO doing in response? Here are five NATO weapons that will be used to deter Russian aggression in Europe. Virginia-class Submarines While Russia has invested in some very capable new submarines, the United States Navy and its fleet of Virginia-class nuclear attack submarines still dominate beneath the waves of the Atlantic. Indeed, the United States’ fleet of Virginia-class boats will continue to grow and improve. On Tuesday, U.S. defense secretary Ashton Carter said that the latest defense “budget invests over $8.1 billion in 2017, and more than $40 billion over the next five years,” giving the United States the “most lethal” submarine force in the world. “And it not only buys nine of our most advanced Virginia Class attack submarines over the next five years, it also equips more of them with a versatile Virginia payloads module, which triples each submarine's platform strike capacity from twelve Tomahawk missiles to forty.” F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Though the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is years behind schedule, plagued with unending technical glitches, incurred massive cost overruns and will likely never deliver the capabilities that were originally promised, the stealthy new jet looks likely to become a formidable weapon in time. The F-35 won’t be the fastest, most maneuverable or even the best-armed aircraft on Earth—by many of those measures it’s sorely outclassed by current and even previous generation warplanes—but it has some key advantages. The Joint Strike Fighter’s strengths are its stealth and sensors, which will allow it to penetrate and strike areas beyond the reach of conventional fighters while also collecting a detailed intelligence picture. The F-35 is also equipped with potent electronic warfare systems, which should prove to be useful. With its operational requirements documents having been drawn up as the Cold War was ending, the F-35 is less than ideal for dealing with today’s ultra high-end threats emanating from Russia and China. As such, the F-35 is not a perfect or even necessarily a good aircraft, but it is the jet America has chosen to invest in for better or worse. American and allied aviators will have to make it work—and make it work in Europe. Long Range Strike Bomber Given Russia’s prowess at developing air defenses—particularly its efforts at developing low frequency radars that are capable of tracking fighter-sized stealth aircraft—the Long Range Strike Bomber (LRS-B) that is being developed over the next decade will be critical to holding targets deep inside Moscow’s heartland at risk. While the LRS-B program is extremely secretive and is currently under protest, it is known that the requirements for the new stealth bomber call for it to be able penetrate into the densest of air defenses—even those backed by low frequency radar. That means that the new bomber will almost certainly be a flying wing design and might incorporate some electronic and cyber warfare capabilities to blind the lowest frequency VHF radars that it can’t evade with shaping alone. (Note: This first appeared in 2016 and is being reposted due to reader interest.)  Leopard 2 The Leopard 2A7 is the latest in a long lineage of German tanks designs that started with the diminutive Panzerkampfwagen I—and it will continue to remain the backbone of the Bundeswehr and other NATO powers.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to end India’s role as the world’s largest arms importer by asking foreign firms to share technology with local players and then manufacture in India – in return for a slice of the $250 billion analysts estimate New Delhi will spend on its military over the next decade. Under the “Strategic Partnership” model, the government will shortlist and then pick Indian companies to join forces with foreign firms. The winners will be guaranteed billions of dollars of orders to incentivise them to manufacture. “For each platform, one private sector strategic partner will be chosen,” Defence Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after a cabinet meeting. “You don’t set up a manufacturing facility if you don’t have any hope of getting orders.” Government and industry representatives have been haggling over the details of the model for more than a year, delaying discussions for tens of billions of dollars worth of deals. Indian defence manufacturing is small and dominated by state-run outfits, many of which have been criticised for poor performance. Private firms such as Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Tata Group and recent entrants Reliance Group and Adani Group are desperate to muscle in on their business.

Reuters Foreign manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus and Saab also see India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Modi was keen to get the project approved before he travels next Monday to Germany, France, Spain and Russia, where buying weapons will be high on the agenda. Among the long-awaited orders that executives hope the new policy could kick-start are a multi-billion-dollar submarine tender and another for a large number of single-engine fighter jets the Indian Air Force says it needs. Lockheed Martin and Saab are in the race for the fighter jets, while companies in Germany, Spain, Russia and France are likely to be interested in the submarine tender. Actual orders could still be years away, as India’s procurement process often moves slowly and specific details of how the policy will work have yet to be released. In June, Modi is also expected to visit the United States, which has emerged as one of the top arms suppliers to India in recent years. Final details India wants to replicate other countries that have used state policy to build leading defence firms. Some executives and analysts have said the new policy could undermine competition and hand winning Indian firms a virtual monopoly, but the government decided it has reached enough of a consensus to push the policy through. “We see the policy as doing something good for indigenisation,” Jayant Patil, Head of Defence and Aerospace at Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest private sector engineering firm, told Reuters. Patil said that industry representatives had raised concerns in recent meetings about how the policy would be structured, specifically on the financial and technical criteria used for selecting partners. “The final details are still awaited. We discussed some roadblocks but we hope they will be addressed,” he said. Larsen’s “unmatched competency” lay in submarines, Patil said, suggesting it would focus on winning that strategic partnership. Some Indian companies are unhappy with a rule restricting them to becoming a strategic partner in just one of four sectors that will be the first covered by the policy – submarines, fighter jets, helicopters and armoured vehicles. Companies such as Reliance, a newcomer to defence, had laid out ambitious plans to build anything from submarines to helicopters and missiles, but the strategic partnership model will likely force it to narrow its focus. Tata, Mahindra and Reliance have all invested money in building helicopters. According to draft guidelines of the model seen by Reuters, the government will use a range of technical and financial criteria to shortlist six Indian companies and several foreign players. The two groups of companies will then begin talks to pitch jointly to the government, with New Delhi choosing the winning team, based in part on how much technology the foreign companies are prepared to transfer to their Indian partners. “With all the effort that has gone into finalising the policy, it can potentially be a turning point in India’s endeavour to have a robust homegrown private defence industrial base,” said Pierre de Bausset, President of Airbus in India. “We will assess the policy fine print when it is released.

The distinctive twin-engine fighter, a version of the F/A-18 Hornet produced by McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, is the backbone of the RCAF, and will be one of the stars of the extensive static display in the air show at RAF Scampton on September 9 and 10. Thousands of Canadian airmen were based in Lincolnshire during the war, serving within the RAF's Bomber Command, Coastal Command and Fighter Command.

Three land-based Canadian Coastal Command squadrons were located in Lincolnshire at RAF North Coates and RAF Strubby, and many of the RCAF's Fighter Command units were based in the area for periods of the war.

Airshow director Paul Sall said: "The history between Lincolnshire and the Royal Canadian Air Force is undeniably strong, with many Canadian Air Force personnel based in the county through the Second World War. "The connection with RAF Scampton is particularly of note, with 30 members of the legendary 617 'Dambusters' Squadron being Royal Canadian Air Force. "To confirm the Royal Canadian Air Force will be sending a CF-18 Hornet to be part of the inaugural Scampton Airshow is just magnificent and reinforces the long-standing relationship with Lincolnshire. "We're yet to receive confirmation which unit will be sending the CF-18 but we're all keeping our fingers' crossed, that given its links with the county, it will come from 401 Squadron." Scampton Airshow tickets can only be purchased in advance at www.scamptonairshow.com. Tickets are priced at £39, with all under-16s able to enjoy the airshow free when accompanied by an adult ticket-holder.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 4 Distinguished Organizations Identified as National Models for Innovation + Inclusion Leadership The Society for Diversity will recognize the winners of the Innovation + Inclusion Leadership Awards at the Diversity 3.0 Conference in Chicago CHICAGO, IL, UNITED STATES, May 24, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — For the last 8 years, the Society for Diversity (SFD) has recognized the work of outstanding organizations and individuals who have demonstrated excellence in employment equity and workplace inclusion. During SFD’s annual conference at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place in Chicago, Innovation + Inclusion Leadership Awards will be conferred in 4 categories on June 28th. The selected individuals and organizations serve as national models for getting better outcomes from the investment in workplace diversity and inclusion. What has been unique about SFD’s awards is that its national nomination and selection process is completely practitioner led. The Society for Diversity, the #1 global professional association for diversity and inclusion, acknowledges that the quality of equity work has evolved and improved over the years. Therefore, in 2017, SFD added „innovation” to the award to signify how collaboration, new strategies, and technology have changed equity, diversity and inclusion work. The 2017 award winners are: – Individual category: Nzinga C. Shaw, Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer of the Atlanta Hawks Basketball Club – Corporate category: Veterans United Home Loans (VUHL) – Nonprofit category: The Institute for Sustainable Diversity & Inclusion – Education category: Kent State University Andrea Brandon, Society for Diversity Staff Liaison to the Awards Committee, noted that there were several characteristics that stood out about the award winners. Brandon said, „Nzinga Shaw’s leadership as a Diversity & Inclusion Officer has resulted in major changes in the Atlanta Hawks organization, and her work has served as a blueprint for changes in the NBA. Despite the odds being against her as a young, African American woman, Nzinga’s tenacity to see change has paid off and it enables her to stand out above the rest.” Each of the awards recipients have amazing stories to share, and have demonstrated success in a way that can be replicated nationally. For example, Effenus Henderson, Co-Founder at the Institute for Sustainable Diversity and Inclusion, is the former Chief Diversity Officer for Weyerhaeuser, where he worked for 40 years. As a thought-leader, Mr. Henderson has held numerous board level positions, as well as served as the Co-Chair for the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) Diversity and Inclusion Standards Taskforce. The Institute for Sustainable Diversity and Inclusion created a collaborative learning model in partnership with major northwest firms such as Nordstrom, Boeing, Alaska Airlines, T-Mobile, Port of Seattle and more, in order to leverage transformative education and practical tools to address emerging issues in inclusive work environments. Likewise, Kent State University developed an interactive Education and Training Lab that features simulations and intercultural assessment tools to facilitate dialogue and workshops for its 2,200 faculty, staff and students. It was so successful, that the University extended its work to over 500 community-based leaders and partners. Loreli Wilson, Manager of Diversity and Inclusion at Veterans United Home Loans (VUHL), had already implemented several robust diversity interventions when she achieved her Certified Diversity Professional (CDP) Credential from SFD’s Institute for Diversity Certification in 2016. Brandon notes, „VUHL’s overall ability to increase racial diversity and improve their new employee tracking efforts have worked to ensure that employees are not expected to ‚fit’ BEFORE they start working, but that they are engaged to ‚fit’ into a great professional environment, and stay with the company, AFTER they are hired.” Other honorable award nominees include: Gail B. Williams, Hodges University; James Banks, Suffolk County Community College; Felicia Johnson, Goodyear; Sayumi Irey, Bellevue College Social Justice Leadership Institute; Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant, University of Vermont; Eric Guthrie, BetterMEBetterWE; Mission Hospital; Empowerment Through Integration (ETI); and INROADS, Inc. Leah Smiley, President of the Society for Diversity, asserts, „I have personally worked with many of the nominees so I know choosing a winner was a difficult decision. Nevertheless, what makes this awards process organic is the fact that people who work in the field are making the decisions and determining what is most important in advancing this work around the world.” Angela Winfield, Director of the Department of Inclusion and Workforce Diversity at Cornell University and Nikki McGruder, Regional Manager at Diversity Awareness Partnership, served as the Awards Committee co-chairs. The committee evaluated the following criterion in making their decision: – Use of innovative or advanced equity, diversity and inclusion technology – Next generation strategies for inclusion or culture change – Enterprise-wide or management learning/collaboration – Revenue generation or cost savings from equity, diversity and inclusion efforts Winfield said, „The award recipients demonstrated clear, measurable and significant impact. In the diversity and inclusion space, it is easy to be lulled into thinking it is all about increasing awareness and how employees feel, which certainly is important, but it is at least equally important to get tangible results. By designing innovative approaches and programs aimed at making a measurable difference, we advance not only diversity and inclusion, but also our organizations. Each of the award recipients has done just this and moved into a brave new space where diversity and inclusion is bringing benefit to everyone involved.” McGruder added, „Being clear and intentional about driving forward diversity and inclusion goals was the main motivator for the choices I made for award recipients. Being creative in the approach to providing education, training and opportunities to create inclusive environments is what all organizations should be striving for. These recipients have figured out that we can no longer just talk about diversity in a „pie in the sky” way. They are about doing the work to get it done.” Smiley concurs, „The conversation about diversity and inclusion has to move beyond a simplistic discussion about race, gender or political correctness, towards innovations, strategies and skills that get meaningful and intentional results. This is the overarching purpose of the Diversity 3.0 conference.” The awards dinner will be held on Wednesday, June 28th from 6:00pm to 8:00pm and Laura I. Gomez, Founder of Silicon Valley’s Atipica, is scheduled to give a keynote address. Conference attendees will represent diversity and human resource executives from 3 countries and 27 states.

Dedrone currently is headquartered in San Francisco and has operations in Kassel, Germany. The addition of former military advisors and expansion to the D.C. market represents the drone security company’s commitment to protecting federal airspace and operations from all drone threats. Lisa Meserve joins Dedrone as a Federal Sales Manager. Meserve is a U.S. Air Force veteran, having served for over 13 years. She was a government contractor, and DoD civilian for Air Force Space Command before her passion for the startup world was ignited, and she joined SecureLogix Corporation. She comes to Dedrone from Globalscape. Phillip Pitsky joins Dedrone as the Federal Business Development Lead. Before Dedrone, Phil worked for The Boeing Company for more than eight years where he held various roles in strategic development and management positions. Phil served in the U.S. Navy for more than ten years as a Cryptologic Collection Operator where prior assignments included the Naval Security Group Activity Kunia, HI and the USS Gettysburg (CG64) where he deployed to the Persian Gulf, Northern Atlantic, and Eastern Pacific in support of Global War on Terrorism. “Dedrone’s system is designed to be accessible and integrated for individuals, enterprises, and militaries, and bringing on Phil and Lisa to the team advances our knowledge of the needs of federal agencies, intelligence providers, and national defense leaders, and find the best way to provide them custom solutions,” shares Joerg Lamprecht, CEO and co-founder of Dedrone. “Our commercial, off-the-shelf software is a proven drone detection system, unlike any that is on the market. We’re acutely aware of the rise in drone terrorism across the world, and we look forward to working with new partners and customers in the federal space to combine efforts and protect our airspace from all drone threats.” David Prantl, Dedrone’s Vice President of Technology, will be heading operations in Washington, D.C., where he will coordinate with Meserve and Pitsky to expand the startup’s presence and service to the federal market. Prantl joined Dedrone in January 2016 and was previously based in the company’s office in Kassel, Germany. “Dedrone’s offering is the nexus between physical, cyber and airspace security, and it’s the next frontier of communications technology,” shares Dedrone Vice President of Business Development, Sebastian Blum. “With the rise in drone technology, there is a clear connection between rogue, hacker drones and the security gaps that now exist for enterprises and government administrations, including the U.S. military. That is why we’ve brought on Lisa and Phil to the team, and expanded our on-ground operations for government service providers.” About Dedrone Dedrone is the international market and technology leader in the field of drone detection. DroneTracker, which was developed by Dedrone, provides early warning of illegal UAVs and is used to protect industrial plants, government buildings and other critical infrastructure installations against smugglers, spies, and terrorist attacks. Dedrone, based in San Francisco, California, was founded in 2014 by the serial entrepreneurs Joerg Lamprecht, Rene Seeber and Ingo Seebach, and has the backing of reputable international investors.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to end India's role as the world's largest arms importer by asking foreign firms to share technology with local players and then manufacture in India - in return for a slice of the $250 billion analysts estimate New Delhi will spend on its military over the next decade. Under the "Strategic Partnership" model, the government will shortlist and then pick Indian companies to join forces with foreign firms. The winners will be guaranteed billions of dollars of orders to incentivise them to manufacture. "For each platform, one private sector strategic partner will be chosen," Defence Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after a cabinet meeting. "You don't set up a manufacturing facility if you don't have any hope of getting orders." Government and industry representatives have been haggling over the details of the model for more than a year, delaying discussions for tens of billions of dollars worth of deals. Indian defence manufacturing is small and dominated by state-run outfits, many of which have been criticised for poor performance. Private firms such as Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Tata Group and recent entrants Reliance Group and Adani Group are desperate to muscle in on their business. Indian Navy's Scorpene submarine INS Kalvari. Reuters Foreign manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus and Saab also see India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Modi was keen to get the project approved before he travels next Monday to Germany, France, Spain and Russia, where buying weapons will be high on the agenda. Among the long-awaited orders that executives hope the new policy could kick-start are a multi-billion-dollar submarine tender and another for a large number of single-engine fighter jets the Indian Air Force says it needs. Lockheed Martin and Saab are in the race for the fighter jets, while companies in Germany, Spain, Russia and France are likely to be interested in the submarine tender. Actual orders could still be years away, as India's procurement process often moves slowly and specific details of how the policy will work have yet to be released. In June, Modi is also expected to visit the United States, which has emerged as one of the top arms suppliers to India in recent years. Final details India wants to replicate other countries that have used state policy to build leading defence firms. Some executives and analysts have said the new policy could undermine competition and hand winning Indian firms a virtual monopoly, but the government decided it has reached enough of a consensus to push the policy through. "We see the policy as doing something good for indigenisation," Jayant Patil, Head of Defence and Aerospace at Larsen &  Toubro, India's largest private sector engineering firm, told Reuters. Patil said that industry representatives had raised concerns in recent meetings about how the policy would be structured, specifically on the financial and technical criteria used for selecting partners. "The final details are still awaited. We discussed some roadblocks but we hope they will be addressed," he said. Larsen's "unmatched competency" lay in submarines, Patil said, suggesting it would focus on winning that strategic partnership. Some Indian companies are unhappy with a rule restricting them to becoming a strategic partner in just one of four sectors that will be the first covered by the policy - submarines, fighter jets, helicopters and armoured vehicles. Companies such as Reliance, a newcomer to defence, had laid out ambitious plans to build anything from submarines to helicopters and missiles, but the strategic partnership model will likely force it to narrow its focus. Tata, Mahindra and Reliance have all invested money in building helicopters. According to draft guidelines of the model seen by Reuters, the government will use a range of technical and financial criteria to shortlist six Indian companies and several foreign players. The two groups of companies will then begin talks to pitch jointly to the government, with New Delhi choosing the winning team, based in part on how much technology the foreign companies are prepared to transfer to their Indian partners. "With all the effort that has gone into finalising the policy, it can potentially be a turning point in India's endeavour to have a robust homegrown private defence industrial base," said Pierre de Bausset, President of Airbus in India. "We will assess the policy fine print when it is released." #Adani group#Airbus#Bae systems#Boeing#Defence manufacturing#Lockheed martin#Mahindra#Narendra modi#Newstracker#Reliance#Saab#Tata Published Date: May 25, 2017 07:04 am | Updated Date: May 25, 2017 07:31 am Also See China-Russia joint venture to produce passenger jets rivalling Airbus, Boeing Indian Army to get M-777 ultra-light howitzers: Country's first artillery guns since Bofors explained 'Adani to decide on investment in Australia coal mine soon' Top Stories Despite terror attack, Manchester's multicultural community is still going strong 30 Kg Gold Missing from IGI Customs Vault, CBI Arrests Senior Official Kashmir human shield victim calls Major Gogoi's award illegal, files complaint with SHRC Champions Trophy 2017: Virat Kohli says disastrous season with RCB taught him to accept limitations Registration of projects: A double-edged sword under RERA Pakistan defence spend likely to shoot up by 30%, but Nawaz Sharif's real enemies are Chinese debt trap, poverty Sachin: A Billion Dreams premiere — SRK, Anushka Sharma, Virat Kohli, other celebrities spotted Cricket Scores Current & Recent Upcoming South Africa in England, 3 ODI Series, 2017 ENG Vs SA England beat South Africa by 72 runs Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 BAN Vs NZ Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 5 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 PNE Vs MUM Mumbai Indians beat Rising Pune Supergiant by 1 run Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 IRE Vs NZ New Zealand beat Ireland by 190 runs Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 IRE Vs BAN Bangladesh beat Ireland by 8 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 MUM Vs KOL Mumbai Indians beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 6 wickets Ireland Tri-Nation Series, 2017 BAN Vs NZ New Zealand beat Bangladesh by 4 wickets Indian Premier League, 2017 HYD Vs KOL Kolkata Knight Riders beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 7 wickets (D/L method) Indian Premier League, 2017 MUM Vs PNE Rising Pune Supergiant beat Mumbai Indians by 20 runs Indian Premier League, 2017 DEL Vs BLR Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Delhi Daredevils by 10 runs ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 AUS vs SL - May 26th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 BAN vs PAK - May 27th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST South Africa in England, 3 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs SA - May 27th, 2017, 03:30 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 IND vs NZ - May 28th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 AUS vs PAK - May 29th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST South Africa in England, 3 ODI Series, 2017 ENG vs SA - May 29th, 2017, 03:30 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 NZ vs SL - May 30th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy Warm-up Matches, 2017 IND vs BAN - May 30th, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 ENG vs BAN - Jun 1st, 2017, 03:00 PM IST ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 AUS vs NZ - Jun 2nd, 2017, 03:00 PM IST Site Index हिंदी फर्स्टपोस्ट About Firstpost Newsletter RSS Twitter Facebook Sections Front Page Politics Sports India World Business Life Entertainment Photos Videos Plus New Delhi Mumbai Photos Videos FP Exclusives Video Room Weather Others Sample Papers Online Business Technology News MTV India Online Shopping in India ICC Champions Trophy 2017 IPL 2017 E-Learning Franchise Opportunity Tools RSS Feeds Apps iOS Android Copyright © 2017.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse 3/3 By David Lawder | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that his department is reviewing licenses for Boeing Co (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA) to sell aircraft to Iran, telling lawmakers he will increase sanctions pressure on Iran, Syria and North Korea. "We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria and North Korea to protect American lives," Mnuchin said in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee. "I can assure you that's a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president." He did not elaborate on the review of the aircraft licenses, which are tied to Iran's compliance with a 2015 agreement with world powers to freeze its nuclear program. IranAir has agreed to buy a total of 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft worth a total of $35 billion - $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 passenger jets from Boeing, 100 from its European rival Airbus and 20 turboprop planes from Franco-Italian supplier ATR (AIR.PA)(LDOF.MI). All of the aircraft need U.S. export licenses.

DARPA just announced it's one step closer to building a hypersonic space plane Paul Szoldra Business Insider May 24, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share darpa xs1More (DARPA) The Pentagon's research and development shop is moving one step closer toward building a hypersonic space plane that could shuttle satellites or people into space in record time. In an announcement on Wednesday, DARPA said that Boeing, which was selected for phase one of the project, would keep working on its advanced design for the Experimental Space plane (XS-1) program with additional funding for phases two and three. While Phase One of XS-1 was more of a drawing board/concept phase, phases two and three are all about actually building a space plane and conducting flight tests, demonstrations, and hopefully, delivery of a satellite into orbit. Here's how DARPA describes what it hopes XS-1 may one day pull off: The XS-1 program envisions a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds. The vehicle would be launched with no external boosters, powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. Since it's DARPA, the project is focused on national security, and there's no doubt the Pentagon could save plenty of money and time by launching satellites via a low-cost space plane. But the agency also notes in its announcement that another goal is to "encourage the broader commercial launch sector," and it will release testing data out to companies who are interested during phases two and three. So it looks like the military won't be the only ones having fun flying planes into space, Mr. Skywalker. DARPA has been behind a number of huge technological advances that have made their way to the private sector, like the Internet, a ton of the components of modern-day computing, and GPS, just to name a few. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Check out the demo video below: NOW WATCH: The Marine Corps of the future wants to invade enemy beaches with drones and robots that are armed to the teeth More From Business Insider This Futuristic Military Space Plane Could Deliver Troops And Supplies Around The World At Warp Speed Boeing Is Building A Fighter Jet That Can Launch Military Satellites Into Space The US military is building a futuristic 'Spaceplane' to defend the country from space weapons Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Below, Council Member Kshama Sawant's take. Kelly O Last week, respected labor leader and Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the MLK County Labor Council, Nicole Grant, raised a number of concerns regarding Socialist Alternative’s endorsements in this year’s city elections. While I disagree with her letter, as a socialist and as a member of the labor movement myself, I feel the question of which candidates unions and the left choose to support is a vital one for working people to discuss. Socialist Alternative and I believe that pro-corporate, establishment-friendly politics do not serve working class and oppressed people. We support candidates who have demonstrated they are prepared to firmly stand up against the political establishment and unapologetically fight for our interests. Such candidates, at present, are unfortunately all too uncommon. After careful consideration, and following a candidate forum and democratic process within our organization, other Socialist Alternative members and I voted to endorse Jon Grant for city council and Nikkita Oliver for mayor. Both are running as left independent candidates and rejecting corporate campaign contributions, while boldly campaigning for working class demands like rent control, requiring 25 percent of new development be affordable, taxing the rich and corporations for a major expansion of city-owned affordable housing, and strong independent community oversight to stop police brutality and racial profiling. Socialist Alternative has a long track record of supporting and actively building the labor movement. Unions are vital organizations for the self-defense of working people against exploitation and mistreatment by their bosses. Of course, as with any movement, there have been and will continue to be debates and differences of views. It is no secret we disagree with the long-standing policy of the majority of union leaders of supporting the Democratic Party, whose leadership is thoroughly pro-corporate. Here in Washington State and Seattle we have seen again and again Democratic Party politicians side with the interests of big business against unions, people of color, and the environment. In our opinion, this cautious policy of supporting corporate-friendly Democrats seen as most likely to win has meant workers keep losing. Thousands of Boeing workers have lost retirement benefits, public workers have been furloughed, our public schools are illegally underfunded, and meanwhile Washington State is home to some of the most astronomically wealthy individuals in the history of the world. It was this reliance on the Democratic Party establishment that led the vast majority of union leaders to refuse to support the working class campaign of Bernie Sanders in 2016 out of a desire to not alienate the front-runner in the primaries, Hillary Clinton (who herself later succeeded in alienating many union members in the November election). In Seattle’s last city election, the majority of unions endorsed Tim Burgess, the most conservative member of the City Council, rather than backing the insurgent campaign of Jon Grant. Despite being outspent by almost six-to-one, Grant came close to winning with over 45 percent of the vote. Labor’s support for Burgess unfortunately helped tip the election. The vast majority of unions in 2013 supported the pro-developer incumbent Richard Conlin when I ran against him for city council, even though he had voted against paid sick leave for workers and was opposed to the $15 minimum wage. Nonetheless, we heard from a great many rank-and-file union members who voted for our socialist campaign based on a $15 minimum wage, rent control and taxing the rich. To her credit, Nicole Grant (at the time, Executive Director of the Certified Electrical Workers of Washington), broke with the majority of labor leaders to strongly support us. Past differences have never prevented Socialist Alternative or me from supporting the struggles of unions or collaborating closely on many issues. We have no doubt that despite our disagreement over this year’s elections, we will continue our important common work on other issues based on genuine agreement and honest discussion when we disagree. Donald Trump and the Republican Party represent a serious danger to working people, women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and the environment. We have been at the forefront of organizing resistance to their vile agenda. But let us remember that there are no Republicans on the ballot in Seattle’s election this year. The city council is made up of eight Democrats and one socialist. The responsibility for the affordable housing crisis, weak labor law enforcement, underfunded public transit and social services, police brutality, a $210 million new youth jail, and a proposed $160 million new police bunker lies squarely at the door step of the Democratic Party establishment that has long run Seattle. Working people, progressives, and especially Seattle’s strong labor unions, do not need to settle for this state of affairs. We can develop our own political party and run our own candidates, independent of corporate cash. I wish that my sister Nicole’s response to Socialist Alternative’s endorsements last week had not included highly personalized attacks on Jon Grant. The majority of working people are fed up with personal attacks that all too often substitute for genuine debate. We understand that Nicole and many other labor leaders feel strongly about supporting Teresa Mosqueda, who we agree has made important contributions to workers’ struggles. We endorsed Jon Grant and Nikkita Oliver because they have shown themselves willing to stand up to this city’s entrenched Democratic establishment. As I know from personal experience, whoever is elected this year will, from day one, face huge pressures from the pro-corporate wing of the City Council and big developers to adapt themselves to a status quo agenda. History shows that most elected progressives buckle and conform under such pressures. At times we will need to agree to disagree on certain issues. But we can and must continue to discuss our differences in a mutually respectful manner, focusing on political issues not personalities, and keeping in mind our shared goal of building movements of working people.

The winners will be guaranteed billions of dollars of orders to incentivise them to manufacture."For each platform, one private sector strategic partner will be chosen," Defence Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after a cabinet meeting. "You don't set up a manufacturing facility if you don't have any hope of getting orders."Government and industry representatives have been haggling over the details of the model for more than a year, delaying discussions for tens of billions of dollars worth of deals.Indian defence manufacturing is small and dominated by state-run outfits, many of which have been criticised for poor performance. Private firms such as Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Tata Group and recent entrants Reliance Group and Adani Group are desperate to muscle in on their business. Foreign manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus and Saab also see India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Modi was keen to get the project approved before he travels next Monday to Germany, France, Spain and Russia, where buying weapons will be high on the agenda. Among the long-awaited orders that executives hope the new policy could kick-start are a multi-billion-dollar submarine tender and another for a large number of single-engine fighter jets the Indian Air Force says it needs. Lockheed Martin and Saab are in the race for the fighter jets, while companies in Germany, Spain, Russia and France are likely to be interested in the submarine tender. Actual orders could still be years away, as India's procurement process often moves slowly and specific details of how the policy will work have yet to be released. In June, Modi is also expected to visit the United States, which has emerged as one of the top arms suppliers to India in recent years. FINAL DETAILS India wants to replicate other countries that have used state policy to build leading defence firms. Some executives and analysts have said the new policy could undermine competition and hand winning Indian firms a virtual monopoly, but the government decided it has reached enough of a consensus to push the policy through."We see the policy as doing something good for indigenisation," Jayant Patil, Head of Defence and Aerospace at & Toubro, India's largest private sector engineering firm, told Reuters. Patil said that industry representatives had raised concerns in recent meetings about how the policy would be structured, specifically on the financial and technical criteria used for selecting partners. "The final details are still awaited. We discussed some roadblocks but we hope they will be addressed," he said. Larsen's "unmatched competency" lay in submarines, Patil said, suggesting it would focus on winning that strategic partnership. Some Indian companies are unhappy with a rule restricting them to becoming a strategic partner in just one of four sectors that will be the first covered by the policy - submarines, fighter jets, helicopters and armoured vehicles.Companies such as Reliance, a newcomer to defence, had laid out ambitious plans to build anything from submarines to helicopters and missiles, but the strategic partnership model will likely force it to narrow its focus.Tata, Mahindra and Reliance have all invested money in building helicopters.According to draft guidelines of the model seen by Reuters, the government will use a range of technical and financial criteria to shortlist six Indian companies and several foreign players. The two groups of companies will then begin talks to pitch jointly to the government, with New Delhi choosing the winning team, based in part on how much technology the foreign companies are prepared to transfer to their Indian partners."With all the effort that has gone into finalising the policy, it can potentially be a turning point in India's endeavour to have a robust homegrown private defence industrial base," said Pierre de Bausset, President of Airbus in India. "We will assess the policy fine print when it is released."

Among the long-awaited orders that executives hope the new policy could kick-start are a multi-billion-dollar submarine tender and another for a large number of single-engine fighter jets the Indian Air Force says it needs. Lockheed Martin and Saab are in the race for the fighter jets, while companies in Germany, Spain, Russia and France are likely to be interested in the submarine tender. Actual orders could still be years away, as India's procurement process often moves slowly and specific details of how the policy will work have yet to be released. In June, Modi is also expected to visit the United States, which has emerged as one of the top arms suppliers to India in recent years. FINAL DETAILS India wants to replicate other countries that have used state policy to build leading defence firms. Some executives and analysts have said the new policy could undermine competition and hand winning Indian firms a virtual monopoly, but the government decided it has reached enough of a consensus to push the policy through. "We see the policy as doing something good for indigenisation," Jayant Patil, Head of Defence and Aerospace at & Toubro, India's largest private sector engineering firm, told Reuters. Patil said that industry representatives had raised concerns in recent meetings about how the policy would be structured, specifically on the financial and technical criteria used for selecting partners. "The final details are still awaited. We discussed some roadblocks but we hope they will be addressed," he said. Larsen's "unmatched competency" lay in submarines, Patil said, suggesting it would focus on winning that strategic partnership. Some Indian companies are unhappy with a rule restricting them to becoming a strategic partner in just one of four sectors that will be the first covered by the policy - submarines, fighter jets, helicopters and armoured vehicles. Companies such as Reliance, a newcomer to defence, had laid out ambitious plans to build anything from submarines to helicopters and missiles, but the strategic partnership model will likely force it to narrow its focus. Tata, Mahindra and Reliance have all invested money in building helicopters. According to draft guidelines of the model seen by Reuters, the government will use a range of technical and financial criteria to shortlist six Indian companies and several foreign players. The two groups of companies will then begin talks to pitch jointly to the government, with New Delhi choosing the winning team, based in part on how much technology the foreign companies are prepared to transfer to their Indian partners. "With all the effort that has gone into finalising the policy, it can potentially be a turning point in India's endeavour to have a robust homegrown private defence industrial base," said Pierre de Bausset, President of Airbus in India. "We will assess the policy fine print when it is released."

By Tommy Wilkes NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India approved on Wednesday a long-awaited policy to boost local defence manufacturing by effectively picking industry champions that would tie up with foreign players to make submarines, fighter jets, helicopters and armoured vehicles. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to end India's role as the world's largest arms importer by asking foreign firms to share technology with local players and then manufacture in India - in return for a slice of the $250 billion analysts estimate New Delhi will spend on its military over the next decade. Under the "Strategic Partnership" model, the government will shortlist and then pick Indian companies to join forces with foreign firms. The winners will be guaranteed billions of dollars of orders to incentivise them to manufacture. "For each platform, one private sector strategic partner will be chosen," Defence Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after a cabinet meeting. "You don't set up a manufacturing facility if you don't have any hope of getting orders." Government and industry representatives have been haggling over the details of the model for more than a year, delaying discussions for tens of billions of dollars worth of deals. Indian defence manufacturing is small and dominated by state-run outfits, many of which have been criticised for poor performance. Private firms such as Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Tata Group and recent entrants Reliance Group and Adani Group are desperate to muscle in on their business. Foreign manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus and Saab also see India as one of the biggest sources of future growth.

 DARPA just announced it's one step closer to building a hypersonic space plane Paul Szoldra May 24, 2017, 12:22 PM 4,739 facebook linkedin twitter email print DARPA The Pentagon's research and development shop is moving one step closer toward building a hypersonic space plane that could shuttle satellites or people into space in record time. In an announcement on Wednesday, DARPA said that Boeing, which was selected for phase one of the project, would keep working on its advanced design for the Experimental Space plane (XS-1) program with additional funding for phases two and three. While Phase One of XS-1 was more of a drawing board/concept phase, phases two and three are all about actually building a space plane and conducting flight tests, demonstrations, and hopefully, delivery of a satellite into orbit. Here's how DARPA describes what it hopes XS-1 may one day pull off: The XS-1 program envisions a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds. The vehicle would be launched with no external boosters, powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. Since it's DARPA, the project is focused on national security, and there's no doubt the Pentagon could save plenty of money and time by launching satellites via a low-cost space plane. But the agency also notes in its announcement that another goal is to "encourage the broader commercial launch sector," and it will release testing data out to companies who are interested during phases two and three. So it looks like the military won't be the only ones having fun flying planes into space, Mr. Skywalker. DARPA has been behind a number of huge technological advances that have made their way to the private sector, like the Internet, a ton of the components of modern-day computing, and GPS, just to name a few. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Check out the demo video below: SEE ALSO: An F-35 pilot explains why Russia and China's counterstealth can't stop him NOW WATCH: A Navy SEAL commander explains how he learned to never give up Loading video...

Deerfield-based Walgreens Boots Alliance ranked the highest among suburban-based firms, at No. 94. Other companies making the list were North Chicago-based AbbVie (143), Northbrook-based Allstate Corporation (200), Deerfield-based Mondlez International (213), Oak Brook-based McDonald's Corp. (215), Libertyville Township-based Abbott Laboratories (242), Riverwoods-based Discover Financial Services (317), Glenview-based Illinois Tool Works (465), and Deerfield-based Baxter International (520). Chicago-based Boeing Co. was the highest ranked Illinois-based company at No. 73, while Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway was the highest-ranked U.S. company at No. 3. Two China-based financial companies were ranked 1 and 2. Caterpillar Inc., which recently announced it is moving its headquarters from Peoria to Northbrook, dropped to No. 503 on the list. It was ranked at 155 last year. The annual list of the top 2,000 companies is based a mix of sales, profits, assets and market value. Forbes uses an equal weighting of all four metrics to rank companies according to size. Each company receives a separate score for each metric. Forbes adds up the scores to compile a composite score. The highest composite score gets the highest rank. In addition to Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Apple were the U.S. companies on the Top 10 list. "Forbes' 2017 Global 2000 list faces much pressure amid unsteady geopolitical climates and slowing economies. Yet, in aggregate, these 2,000 companies have managed to come out stronger than last year, with increased sales, profits, assets and market values," said Halah Touryalai, deputy editor of investing at Forbes Media. "Despite slowing GDP figures, China and the U.S., whose companies make up more than 40 percent of the list, continue to dominate the top 10 list with financial giants, "This list illustrates that in spite of headwinds, the world's dominant companies remain a steady force in an unpredictable and challenging environment," Touryalai added.

Safran in January announced a plan to buy Zodiac Aerospace to become the world's No. 3 aerospace supplier to Boeing Co. and Airbus SE behind United Technologies Corp. and General Electric Co. The deal quickly drew fire from hedge fund TCI Fund Management, which said Safran was overpaying. TCI urged Safran to abandon the deal and attacked the complicated transaction that it said gave preferential treatment to the Zodiac's family shareholders and two institutional investors in the company. Safran said in March that it was reviewing its offer after Zodiac issued a profit warning amid new problems in its seat-building business. The company already had been struggling to produce business class seats for Boeing and Airbus and other cabin interior items, such as toilet doors. Safran on Wednesday said it would pay EUR25 a share for 100% of Zodiac shares. Safran originally had said it would pay EUR29.47 a share for Zodiac in a tender offer. It also adjusted other elements of the complex deal. The new structure offers an alternative to the cash offer for some Zodiac shares. Safran is offering preferred shares in exchange for Zodiac stock in a structure with an implied value of around EUR24 for each Zodiac share. This component is capped at 31.4% of Zodiac's total outstanding the stock. The preferred shares carry the same rights as ordinary shares but have to be held for at least three years after the completion of the tender offer. The deal's completion is in part contingent on 50% of Zodiac shares with voting rights being tendered. To placate investors such as TCI who were looking for Safran to return more capital to shareholders, Safran said if the deal goes through it would undertake a EUR2.3 billion share buyback over two years.

Arms sales to Saudi Arabia catapulted stocks in defense companies to record highs. And history shows that such key deals boost the value of defense firms. Banking on such bullish trends, investing in some solid defense stocks seems judicious. US-Saudi Arabia Seal Weapons Deal Trump signed an almost $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, which could be worth $350 billion over the next 10 years. The White House said that this was “a significant expansion of security relationship” between the countries. Saudi Arabia imported $3 billion worth of U.S. arms last year, the maximum by any country. Saudi Arabia is also the primary destination for U.S. arms sales, with the kingdom acquiring nearly 10% of U.S. exports in the 2011 to 2015 period. The oil-rich kingdom is on a broad-based push for economic development and is looking forward to signing a series of deals with private U.S. corporations worth tens of billions of dollars. The arms package will boost Saudi Arabia’s military prowess as tensions flare in the region. Saudi Arabia is being targeted by radical Islamic extremism, hence, such a deal will help the country counter terrorist attacks. The U.S. also views the nation as a potential partner in its endeavor to check the global ambitions of Iran. Further, the Saudi Arabia deal could lead to additional sales for both Israel and the Persian Gulf countries, all of whom are apprehensive about Iran’s aggressive foreign policy and its support toward terrorist groups in the region. Defense Stock Benefactors of the Deal Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is poised to be the biggest gainer from the deal. The world’s largest defense contractors, whose technology was part of the agreement, said that the deal “will directly contribute to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 by opening the door for thousands of highly skilled jobs in new economic sectors”. According to Lockheed Martin, Saudi Arabia has “expressed its intent” to buy $28 billion worth of weapons systems from the company. This includes 150 Sikorsky helicopters, the THAAD missile defense system and four littoral combat ships. Jet maker Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) also signed a handful of deals with Saudi Arabia during Trump’s weekend visit. This involved the sale of military and passenger aircraft. Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN), which has done business in the Middle East for more than five decades, plans to form Raytheon Arabia that will create home-grown defense, aerospace and security capabilities in Saudi Arabia in areas like cybersecurity and missile defense. The 10 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade In fact, these types of arms deals have led to the rally in defense stocks in the past, according to CNBC analysis using Kensho. Going back to 2009, one month after the then U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:ITA) was up 3.3%, reflecting almost double the return of the S&P 500. Defense Stocks Soar to All-Time Highs This time also it seems Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia is paying off for defense stocks. Shares of Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics GD and other big defense players rallied on May 22 on the arms deal. While Lockheed Martin was the big winner with 1.6% after jumping to a new 52-week high of $280.79 per share, General Dynamics went up 0.9% to $197.55, after hitting a 52-week high of $199 a share. Raytheon, in the meantime, rallied 0.4% after peaking to $163.57 a share, also a 52-week high. Boeing was up 1.2% to just under $183 a share, but, unlike others it did not scale a 52-week high. Nevertheless, the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio PPA was up 0.9%, while the ITA gained 0.8% 5 Best Defense Picks for Your Portfolio With defense stocks hitting highs on U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal, investing in such companies will be prudent. And it also makes more sense to invest in such stocks when Trump asks for an increase in military spending to the tune of $54 billion (read more: 5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Promises to Spend Big on Defense).

Rothbard Library & Resources Mises Institute LRC Bestselling Books Political Theatre Podcasts Store About Contact Donate Advertise The Enemies List By Bionic Mosquito May 24, 2017 The only U.S. president to make Saudi Arabia his first foreign visit… Trump signed a mega-deal with Saudi Arabia: Running parallel to Trump’s summit with Saudi King Salman on Saturday is a business forum that will include senior executives from about 45 U.S. companies. Defense contractors Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) are due to attend. Also on the list: Boeing (BA), ExxonMobil (XOM), Dow Chemical (DOW), GE (GEK), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), oil services firms and investment groups. For example: Lockheed Martin President Marillyn Hewson praised the deal.  “At Lockheed Martin, we are proud to be part of this historic announcement that will strengthen the relationship between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” Hewson said in a statement. Current Prices on popular forms of Gold Bullion Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant Saudi Aramco signed $50 billion of deals with 11 U.S. oil companies, including Haliburton, Jacob’s, Schlumberger, Emerson, Honeywell and McDermott International. And to disabuse you of the notion that this is about jobs in the USA: In the deal, Saudi Arabia agrees to buy military equipment from the United States and to hire American companies to build them in Saudi Arabia… Enough of the enemies; let’s turn to the warmer side of the visit.  The family: Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner called the president of Lockheed Martin, a major supplier of U.S. military equipment, for a lower price for the radar system as part of the deal… Spirits were high, with Kushner greeting national security adviser H.R. McMaster with a high-five… And what is a presidential visit without a little humor thrown in? On Sunday, Melania Trump will make some cultural visits, while Ivanka Trump plans to hold a roundtable session on “women’s economic empowerment.” In Saudi Arabia!  Get the joke? You are known by the company you keep: During a ceremony, Salman placed the King Abdulaziz al Saud Collar — Saudi Arabia’s highest civilian honor — around Trump’s neck.  The gold medallion previously had been bestowed on Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. They say every president soon has you longing for the return of the last president: What emerged as a veritable love fest between the two governments was a marked contrast to years of growing estrangement under President Barack Obama. Obama, who sold about $115 billion in U.S. weapons to Saudi Arabia during his eight years as president, had slowed military cooperation with the kingdom in large part because of what it considered Saudi Arabia’s indiscriminate bombing of civilians in Yemen. Ahhhh.  The good old days.  “Growing estrangement” would be a good policy in this case. Can we send a few hundred thousand snowflakes to the kingdom? American country star Toby Keith performed at a men’s-only concert in Riyadh on Saturday night, coinciding with Trump’s visit. And I bet they were all white men.  Well, very, very light brown. And now we know what Trump meant by “drain the swamp”: The minister went on to borrow one of Trump’s favorite campaign slogans, saying that a new relationship between the United States and the Arab world could “drain the swamps from which extremism and terrorism emanates.” Does this mean Saudi Arabia and the CIA will be flushed down the toilet?  I doubt it. Not when there are hundreds of billions of dollars of huuuuge deals at stake.  In this case, silence is golden…literally: …there was public silence from the U.S. delegation on the issue of human rights in Saudi Arabia… Conclusion Tillerson said the two nations have “like-minded” goals in the security and economic spheres. “Like-minded”?  Yes; criminals, one and all.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman New Graphene Delivery Technology &amp; Trading Update This announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation 596/2014.   Applied Graphene Materials plc    („Applied Graphene Materials”, „AGM” or „the Group”)   New Proprietary Graphene Delivery Technology and Trading Update   Applied Graphene Materials, the producer of specialty graphene materials, is pleased to provide information about its new, proprietary technology, Structural InkTM, which enables the highly targeted delivery of graphene to composites, together with a trading update.   Significant progress has been made in Applied Graphene Material’s core target market segments of composites and coatings, including new intellectual property.   Structural InkTM   Applied Graphene Materials has registered a patent having developed a highly innovative, new technology, Structural InkTM, that once fully commercialised will be targeted at the advanced composites industry.   Structural InkTM comprises the deposition of graphene nanoplatelets directly onto composite laminates in a controlled and targeted manner. By adopting Structural InkTM technology, end users will have the ability to increase mechanical toughness, which can be derived through the addition of graphene. Application to specific areas will enable the optimisation of the performance and structural design of composite materials. Ultimately this will improve component integrity and performance, enable further weight reduction and also reduce total manufacturing costs.    Applied Graphene Materials has signed heads of terms for a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre with Boeing (AMRC). This JDA will focus on the development and commercial exploitation of Structural InkTM technology, through collaboration projects with AMRC’s industry partners. At an early phase in the development cycle, AGM plans to locate a technology demonstration cell within the AMRC’s Composites Centre.   Richard Scaife, the AMRC Composites Centre Manager, said: „Over the last 24 months, our research staff and engineers have been collaborating with Applied Graphene Materials on its Structural InkTM technology development and we are delighted that we are now able to progress to a formal, long term agreement. While this technology is still relatively immature in aerospace terms, we believe it highlights significant potential for performance improvements with both weight and cost savings to those designing critical composite structures.  In the near future we will be sharing information on this technology with our aerospace partners, but also see the potential for early adoption with partners operating in less safety critical industrial sectors.”   Although at an early phase of its development cycle, four specialist end-users from different sectors of the composites industry have committed to explore Structural InkTM. These include Prodrive Composites Limited („Prodrive”), which has signed heads of terms for a Joint Development Agreement with Applied Graphene Materials to focus on the development towards near term applications. Prodrive works in the high-end automotive, motorsport, aerospace and leisure goods sectors, designing and producing lightweight, high performance composite structures.   John McQuilliam, Chief Engineer of Prodrive Composites commented „We have investigated the potential for graphene within Prodrive’s business and identified several application areas for development and ideally early adoption. We feel confident that Applied Graphene Materials represents a strong partner for Prodrive, having an approach to development that is both innovative, yet realistic. We understand that some features of their graphene technology are quite unique, but are also reassured that adoption into other commercial composite applications has already been proven.”   Trading Update   The Group has continued to make good progress during the year. Taking the latest forecast into consideration our expectation is that LBITDA* for the year ending 31st July 2017 will be in line with earlier estimates at a loss of £(4.0m) based on revenues for the current year of £0.3m. Cash is expected to be significantly ahead of expectation at £4.5m.     Jon Mabbitt, Chief Executive Officer of Applied Graphene Materials, said: „We are very excited about the opportunity that Structural InkTM opens up for AGM and our customers. Whilst we continue to collaborate with customers on developing tailored graphene dispersions for a range of applications, this printing technology offers AGM another route to market and a tried and tested product offer that we believe will be very compelling for composites end users.   It is pleasing that we are being recognized as a highly supportive and competent development partner for industrial graphene applications. The foundations we have laid over the last 3 years are really starting to bear fruit. We have consistently focused on the core markets where we know we can deliver significant enhancements for large-scale industries and our collaborations across these areas continue to build momentum.”   *LBITDA comprises loss on ordinary activities before interest, tax, exceptional costs, depreciation and amortisation   Ends     For further information, please contact:   Applied Graphene Materials                                                                            +44 (0) 1642 438 214 Jon Mabbitt, Chief Executive Officer    N+1 Singer                                                                                                           +44 (0) 207 496 3000 Richard Lindley / Nick Owen    Hudson Sandler                                                                                                  +44 (0) 207 796 4133 Charlie Jack / Emily Dillon / Jocelyn Spottiswoode   Notes to Editors   About Applied Graphene Materials Applied Graphene Materials works in partnership with its customers using its knowledge and expertise to provide bespoke graphene dispersions and formats to deliver enhancements and benefits for a wide range of applications. The Group’s strategy is to target commercial application in three core markets: coatings, composites and polymers and functional fluids. The Group has developed proprietary bottom-up processes capable of producing high purity graphene nanoplatelets using a continuous process. The manufacturing processes are based on sustainable, readily available raw materials and therefore do not rely on the supply of graphite, unlike most other graphene production techniques. Applied Graphene Materials owns the intellectual property and know-how behind these processes. Applied Graphene Materials was founded by Professor Karl Coleman in 2010 with its operations and processes based on technology that he initially developed at Durham University.  The Group was admitted to AIM in November 2013, raising £11 million, and is based at the Wilton Site on Teesside. In January 2016, the Group raised a further £8.5 million to support its ongoing activities.

Eisenstein Share Share Tweet Comment Email Print advertisement Former Ford CEO Mark Fields fashioned himself an agent of change, promising to transform a Rust Belt auto manufacturer into a high-tech "mobility company." But three years after taking the helm, Fields has been tripped up by changes beyond his own control. The 56-year-old New York native was summarily sent out to pasture, Ford announced Monday, replaced by former Steelcase CEO Jim Hackett. That, along with a series of other high-level management moves, appears to have been months in the making, reflecting the growing frustration among major investors — including the founding Ford family — over weak sales, declining earnings and a stock price down 40 percent since Fields stepped into the CEO role in July 2014.

"He put us in a great position. I'm very thankful to Mark. But this is a time of great change and fortunately we have a transformational leader," Ford said, referring to new CEO Hackett. Officially, Fields tendered his resignation last Friday, "after a discussion he and I had," Chairman Ford said during a subsequent interview on CNBC. But the speed with which a successor was named suggested to industry observers it was only a matter of time, and a question of whether Fields, a 28-year Ford veteran, would jump or be pushed. Field Marshaled in Change Things looked a lot more promising just three years ago, when Fields stepped in for the retiring Alan Mulally. Fields was the protégé of the former Boeing executive, who guided Ford through the Great Recession. It was, in fact, Fields who largely crafted the "Way Forward" plan that let the second-largest U.S. automaker avoid the bankruptcies that nearly destroyed Detroit rivals General Motors and Chrysler. But, after a promising start, a number of factors came into play leading to the management shake-up. "There's no question that all of us were acutely aware that the stock had been languishing," the Ford chairman acknowledged. But there has been growing concern that while Fields had a clear vision of where the auto industry is heading five, even 10 years from now, his grasp of current challenges may have been a bit more murky. In recent years, Fields had been a frequent speaker at the Consumer Electronics Show, underscoring the way the automobile is becoming as much a digital device as a mechanical one. Under his leadership, Ford has rapidly expanded its spending on technology, early this year ordering a major expansion of its new Silicon Valley research center. Technology Up Front Barely a month ago Ford announced a three-way venture with Amazon and Starbucks that will allow motorists with the latest Ford Sync 3 infotainment system to call up the Alexa voice assistant and use it to have a cup of java waiting when they pull into the nearby coffee shop. Ford was hailed by a recent Navigant Research study that declared it the industry leader in development of autonomous vehicles, ahead of Waymo, the self-driving spin-off from Google. Ford plans to have its first fully driverless vehicle in production by 2021. The carmaker has launched car-sharing and ride-sharing projects and is exploring a variety of other new mobility concepts. If one bought into Fields's vision, that is essential, as there will likely be far fewer consumers buying cars in 2025 than there are today, many owners expected to switch to sharing services like Uber and Lyft. Related: Why 95 Percent of Your Driving Won't Be in Your Own Car by 2030 Fields also was betting that those car-share services would opt for electric, rather than gas-powered models. In many ways, his vision echoed that of Elon Musk, and Wall Street has embraced Tesla — last month driving its stock up to the point it had a higher market capitalization than either Ford or General Motors. But the message failed to resonate with Ford investors — especially after the carmaker saw first-quarter sales dip 40 percent to $1.6 billion, with the full-year numbers also expected to decline. "It will be many years before a lot of the stuff Fields has been working on will achieve a payoff," said Joe Phillippi, a long-time Wall Street analyst and now head of AutoTrends Consulting. Having a long-term vision isn't a bad thing, Phillippi stressed, but critics contend Fields lost sight of Ford's short-term challenges. Its passenger car fleet, models like the Fusion and Focus, have been allowed to age without necessary replacements. It has been slow to recognize and respond to some key market shifts, as well — notably the revival of the midsize pickup truck segment. General Motors got there in 2014 with models like the Chevrolet Silverado. Ford's reborn Ranger truck is still a year away.

On October 30, 2001, Ford gave walking papers to Jacques Nasser, another visionary leader who set out to create a very different Ford. Nasser was an early proponent of in-car technologies. He also spent heavily on non-traditional operations, like auto parts and repairs and recycling. But critics felt he ignored the core of Ford's business and, after Nasser's ouster, Bill Ford — then handling dual roles as chairman and CEO — adopted a strategy dubbed "One Ford." That led the Detroit maker to return focus to its core brand, selling off a host of foreign luxury marques, including Volvo, Land Rover and Jaguar, that Nasser had acquired at a premium. While the "Blue Oval" Ford brand quickly rebounded, Mulally eventually killed off domestic Mercury, too. And even now, Lincoln, the homegrown luxury division, continues to struggle. How much CEO Hackett will reverse the course set by Fields is uncertain. He was, in fact, heading Ford's Smart Mobility unit for the last year, so Hackett seems unlikely to completely walk away from many of the projects Fields set in motion. But Chairman Ford made it clear the new chief executive also will have to not only "drive innovation" for the long haul, but improve the carmaker's cost efficiencies and "deliver results around the world." Boosting that stock price is certain to be one of the metrics by which the 62-year-old Hackett will be judged. Paul A.

BUSINESS Rocket Lab's Electron rocket 'made it to space' in the company's first test flight Geoff Dale / Rocket Lab Rocket Lab Chief Executive Peter Beck with the company's Electron rocket. Rocket Lab Chief Executive Peter Beck with the company's Electron rocket. (Geoff Dale / Rocket Lab) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter Small-satellite launch company Rocket Lab said its Electron rocket “made it to space” in its first test flight, as the Huntington Beach firm and other small-rocket start-ups begin to inch closer to commercial operations. In a tweet Wednesday evening soon after the launch Rocket Lab said it was “delighted." The Electron rocket, which did not have a satellite aboard during this test flight, was intended to reach an elliptical orbit, about 186 to 310 miles above Earth at an 83- degree inclination. The company’s 10-day launch window opened Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m. Pacific time, but the launch was delayed by three days because of weather conditions at the company’s private launch complex on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula. Rocket Lab completed construction on the launch complex in September. Company Chief Executive Peter Beck said in a statement last week that the “No. 1 priority” of this first test flight was to “gather enough data and experience to prepare for a commercial phase.” “We are all incredibly excited to get to this point,” he said. This was the first of three test launches before Rocket Lab starts launching customer payloads. The company has already secured contracts with customers such as NASA and Earth-imaging firm Planet. The growing launch manifest puts pressure on Rocket Lab to test its rockets and move on to commercial service, said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International. Rocket Lab is building a business around the burgeoning small-satellite market. Thanks to technological advancements that slashed satellite development and launch costs, a number of companies, including SpaceX, OneWeb and Boeing, have proposed so-called constellations of hundreds or even thousands of small satellites that would provide low-cost broadband Internet access. To meet the expected demand for launches, companies such as Rocket Lab are tailoring their rockets to give these small satellites a dedicated ride to space. The Electron is small — about 56 feet long, with a diameter of about 4 feet — and is intended to lift small satellites or other payloads weighing up to 330 pounds to a low orbit. The rocket’s first stage is composed of nine Rutherford engines, which are powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene. The company said it used 3-D printing for all of the primary components of the Rutherford engine. Recently, there has been a flurry of activity from small-satellite launch vehicle developers. Tucson-based Vector Space Systems launched a test of its Vector-R rocket earlier this month in Mojave, Calif. Another industry player, Long Beach-based Virgin Orbit, is aiming to test LauncherOne — a satellite-launching rocket that will be dropped from beneath the wing of a Boeing 747 — for the first time by the end of the year.

(GeekWire Photo / Chelsey Ballarte)More The High Dive is known for drawing crowds into the local music scene, but this week, music wasn’t what drew nearly 200 people to the venue – it was NASA. Nerd Nite Seattle is a monthly gathering at the bar in the city’s Fremont neighborhood, featuring beer, tasty Mexican food, science talks and, of course, nerdy Seattleites. Tuesday night’s event drew in plenty of the regulars, plus an assortment of first-timers. One of the first-timers was NASA astronaut Anne McClain. She mingled with the crowd, and then got on stage to speak about her rigorous astronaut training, share hilarious stories about other members of her astronaut class, and reflect on how growing up in Washington state made her want to go to space. “I decided when I was about 3 years old, the first time I told my mom I wanted to be an astronaut,” said McClain, who is now 37. “Luckily she is a bit of a nerd herself, and so she really fostered that.” Young McClain and her family (who came out to support her at Nerd Nite) were frequent visitors to the Pacific Science Center. They also went to the Space Needle, where McClain played pretend-astronaut. “I remember riding the Space Needle and going up in the elevator and being scared, but thinking, ‘This is going to be like going up a launch tower,’ and so I would sit there and try to face that fear,” she said.   Almost 200 people turned out for Nerd Night’s NASA event at the High Dive in Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood. (GeekWire Photo / Chelsey Ballarte)More McClain followed up on her childhood dream by attending West Point and becoming an Army major, helicopter pilot and flight instructor. In 2013, she won a spot in NASA’s most recent class of astronaut candidates. She’s still waiting for her first spaceflight assignment, but in the meantime, she’s playing a role in the development and testing of future spaceships. This week may have marked the first time the denizens of Nerd Nite Seattle hosted an astronaut, but it wasn’t the first time they’ve gathered to talk about space. Nerd Nite volunteer Jenny Haaland said they’ve hosted talks about planets and other space topics before. One Star Wars night in particular got very intense. Nerd Nite’s quirkiness is a big part of its appeal. Haaland said she loves finding out what people are passionate about, and taking in the night’s nerdy atmosphere. “Bars tend to be very insular, and Nerd Nite just isn’t,” she said. “People are willing to turn to one another and say, ‘Well, what did you think about that?’ and talk about what we just heard.” Nerd Nite does bring in some families – but a large pool of attendees are in their early careers, typically working at tech firms such as Amazon and Boeing. Amazon software development engineer Michael Li said he enjoys coming because it’s a refreshing break after a long day’s work. What better place for a NASA-focused Nerd Nite than Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood — self-proclaimed Center of the Universe and home to the towering Fremont Rocket. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)More McClain’s Seattle visit was part of a NASA tour program known as Destination Station, which sends astronauts, researchers and outreach specialists to cities across the country. The Destination Station team also checks in with local companies to spread the word about commercial opportunities in space. During this week’s stopover, the team visited Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin rocket venture, Microsoft and Starbucks. Among the topics that came up at Starbucks were the challenges of managing product shelf life and brewing coffee in zero-G, said Pete Hasbrook, an associate program scientist for the International Space Station program. Tuesday’s Nerd Nite ended with an inspiring video about the space station and its crew, plus a round of audience questions that sparked a conversation about leadership in space. Inspiring the nerd crowd may not have been the only thing on McClain’s schedule, but being at the High Dive and reconnecting with her childhood memories were definitely among the highlights. “I still feel inside like a little kid from Spokane with a dream,” she said. “My heart would race when I went to Pacific Science Center because I would pretend to be an astronaut, and now I get to come back and give back to the community that I think compelled me to where I am.” More from GeekWire: NASA’s newest women astronauts get the Glamour treatment: Want to join them?

He made it his goal to give members of his local an avenue to do just that. Lacey approached IAM Local 63 leadership with an idea to have T-shirts made with the proceeds going to Northwest Battle Buddies, a charitable foundation that provides U.S. combat veterans with professionally trained service dogs who help with PTSD at no charge. Following membership approval, the shirts were made and quickly became a hit, especially the “Remember Everyone Deployed” version. “We had nearly 100 shirts sold in the first eight hours,” said Lacey. “It’s awesome to see people’s reaction to the shirts, everybody loves them. I see a lot of people wearing red on Fridays, and not just the shirts we sold. That tells me that they made a conscious decision to remember our military when they got dressed.” Lacey, a Boeing employee, has also put together a packet to help veterans navigate the process of signing up for benefits through the Veteran Affairs Department. “I became frustrated when I went to sign up at the V.A.,” said Lacey. “There was no real guide and you just had to figure things out on your own. So I wanted make it easier for others to get through the process, they have enough things to worry about without having to stress about signing up for the benefits they earned.” That experience inspired Lacey to get more involved and that’s when he came up with the idea of having T-shirts printed by the local. “The benefits are two-fold,” said Lacey. “We support veterans by raising money for a great cause, and we also raise awareness by all these people wearing the shirts around town.” “Brother Scott’s work is a shining example of what it means to be a Fighting Machinist,” said IAM Western Territory General Vice President Gary Allen. “I’m moved by the work he is doing, and I am proud of Local 63’s service to veterans and the community.” RELATED ARTICLES Oregon IAM Member Working to Help Fellow Veterans Read more Path to Freedom Raises Thousands for Guide Dogs Read more White House Budget Would Gut Federal Workers’ Retirement Read more MOST POPULAR NEWS / ARTICLES President Trump is Meeting with the Chinese President.

REUTERS/Jim Bourg By Sarah Halzack, the Washington Post May 23, 2017 at 6:00 pm | Print View There were fresh hints on Tuesday that a proposal by House Republicans for a new tax on imports has a difficult path to becoming law. At a conference, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the so-called border adjustment tax “ doesn’t create a level playing field” and “has the potential to pass on significant costs to the consumer.” Meanwhile, as executives and economists testified before the Ways and Committee about the matter, it was apparent that GOP lawmakers face some resistance to the idea within their own ranks. Rep. Erik Paulsen, R-Minn., said he can not support the border adjustment tax as it is described in the plan. Another Republican, Rep. Jim Renacci of Ohio, said he is skeptical of the idea, even though he has “been trying not to be.” “I’m very concerned for the low-margin companies in my district,” Renacci said. These would appear to be setbacks for a core tenet of Republicans’ wider tax reform plan. The border adjustment tax provides an important stream of revenue that would create room for them to slash taxes in other ways. Much of corporate America is in agreement that it would like to see a sweeping overhaul of the tax system - but there is a deep divide about how best to achieve that. That rift was on display during Tuesday’s hearing. Brian Cornell, the chief executive of big-box behemoth Target, said in his testimony that he believed Target’s tax rate would leap from 35 percent to 75 percent if this proposal were enacted. That’s because the border adjustment tax would prevent companies from deducting the cost of imported goods. Target says it is America’s second-largest importer, and that it about half of what it sells comes from overseas. “We - like many others - would be left with only bad options,” Cornell said. Cornell argued that the retail industry would be forced to raise prices for consumers if a border adjustment tax were to be implemented. “Every time your constituents fill up their gas tanks, they would pay more. The people who shop at Target are middle-class working families, whose budgets are already stretched,” Cornell said. “For them, this new tax would be a budget breaker.” The committee also heard from Juan Luciano, the chief executive of Archer Daniels Midland, a producer of food ingredients, animal feeds and other items. Luciano’s company is part of a coalition of exporters such as GE, Boeing and Caterpillar that supports the tax. Luciano said U.S. businesses in his industry have been losing global market share, and that he believes this tax change could help stop that. “This proposal offers the chance to give American farmers, American workers and American agriculture the chance to compete fully and to continue providing American products to customers around the globe,” Luciano said. If Congress were to implement a border adjustment tax, it would mean businesses could no longer deduct the cost of imports from their tax bill. Since retailers rely heavily on overseas manufacturers to make the goods they sell to customers, they worry their tax bills would increase dramatically. Some economists have been dismissive of these concerns, because they expect that the value of the dollar will adjust under this scenario in such a way that retailers’ costs wouldn’t actually skyrocket. But importers tend not to find this particularly reassuring, often arguing that it is uncertain whether this will play out in the real world like it does in the textbooks. “ There’s one word that I continue to hear again and again, which is ‘if,’’’ Cornell said during the hearing. Opponents of the tax also say that there is a chance the provision could be deemed not compliant with World Trade Organization rules. Even if a border adjustment tax were to garner broad support in the House, it appears poised to hit stumbling blocks in the Senate, where several Republicans have expressed doubts about the idea. Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., for example, said earlier this month , “Right now, in the Senate anyway, I think the border adjustment tax is dead on arrival.” Like what you're reading?

Here’s what we know so far. The tests will happen at two locations: Milpitas, California on Yosemite Drive and Mariani Avenue next to Apple’s 1 Infinite Loop headquarters. The application for the license, which was made public by the FCC, says: Apple Inc. seeks to assess cellular link performance in direct path and multipath environments between base station transmitters and receivers using this spectrum…These assessments will provide engineering data relevant to the operation of devices on wireless carriers’ future 5G networks. Apple intends to transmit from two fixed points located at Apple-controlled facilities in Cupertino and Milpitas, CA. These transmissions will be consistent with the parameters and equipment identified in Apple’s accompanying Form 442, and will include the use of a horn antenna with a half-power beamwidth of 20 degrees in the E-plane and H-plane and a downtilt between 20 – 25 degrees. Apple anticipates that it will conduct its experiments for a period not to exceed 12 months. Millimeter Wave Technology One of the promises of 5G is that speeds will be faster than current wireless technology. And what that really means is that (Apple) music streaming and Netflix binging will be easier. Millimeter wave means that the radio waves are at a higher frequency than today’s 4G LTE standards. On the electromagnetic spectrum, millimeter waves are between 30 and 300 gigahertz (GHz). Apple wants to test the 28 and 39 GHz bands. Currently, radar, satellite and certain military systems use this area of the spectrum. Apple Satellite That might mean Apple’s tests have less to do with iPhone, and more to do with Apple Maps. Another possibility is satellite internet. Last month The Mac Observer reported that Boeing is working on a plan for 1,000 satellites to provide internet access for customers, and Apple was invited to participate. At the same time, shorter wavelengths can’t travel as far as longer wavelengths. We’re talking hundreds of meters instead of kilometers. And millimeter waves can’t penetrate walls and other obstacles easily. If the transmitter and receiver aren’t in a direct line of site, there is signal loss. Internet from spaaaace! Workarounds could include smaller cell towers, called microcells, femtocells and picocells (depending on range). Antenna size is inversely proportional to frequency size, which means that 5G millimeter waves can use smaller antennas and use the spectrum more efficiently. In any case, Apple is certainly paying attention to future technologies. We probably won’t see ubiquitous 5G Wi-Fi until the early 2020s, although some estimates are more optimistic than others. In the meantime, we’ll have to be content with 4G LTE.

Phones by Roger Cheng May 24, 2017 8:18 AM PDT @RogerWCheng Motorola says it has a strict regimen of testing when it comes to battery safety. Josh Miller/CNET Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 sent the wireless industry into a frenzy when the phones started catching fire. Samsung itself recalled and scrapped the phones, and many other companies started looking into their own manufacturing processes. But at least one phone maker held firm with the processes it already had in place. "Absolutely not," said Motorola's Russ Gyenes when asked whether his company made any changes after the Note 7 problem flared up. Gyenes, an engineer who focuses on batteries, was speaking to a group of journalists on Tuesday. While Samsung has largely repaired its image with the launch of the Galaxy S8, the potentially volatile nature of battery technology remains an issue. The Note 7 incident put a spotlight on how companies in all industries ensure the safety of the batteries in their devices. Samsung, for instance, introduced an eight-point battery check that it shared with the industry in hopes of raising standards everywhere. When asked about Samsung's test, Gyenes smirked. "I looked at that eight-point check," he said. "Why weren't they doing it before?" What I saw inside Samsung's battery testing center CNET senior reporter Shara Tibken visits Samsung headquarters in South Korea to see firsthand how the company has stepped up its battery testing after the disastrous Note 7 fires. She also gets an early look at the new Galaxy S8. by Shara Tibken 4:05 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF His comments are bold for any company, even one whose legacy in dealing with battery technology goes back to the invention of the first cell phone. Hoverboards, e-cigarettes, electric cars and computer batteries have shown at least isolated instances of batteries catching fire. Boeing fielded questions about the safety of lithium-ion batteries for its 787 Dreamliner. Gyenes noted that Motorola testified as an expert in those proceedings. The discussion was part of a broader campaign to get Motorola -- a historic brand in the wireless world that fell on hard times with the rise of the iPhone -- back into the public consciousness with a new brand strategy and phones like the Moto Z. Gyenes said that Motorola, a unit of Chinese tech giant Lenovo, would have caught the issues with the Note 7 batteries early on because it looks at the process from the individual cell construction level, or well before the batteries are mass produced. It also performs checks on supplier X-ray processes and has an audit with 118 questions that its battery manufacturer partner must pass. Get one wrong, and the process is a failure. "That's a showstopper," he said. In that eight-point check, the addition of X-ray tests and more accelerated battery usage would have helped, but Gyenes suggested the introduction of that process was more of a "marketing campaign." Samsung, for its part, said the new process wasn't put in place to stop future Note 7-like incidents, but was more holistic. The company is also vowing to do these checks themselves, which go beyond other vendors. "The eight-point battery process reflects what we learned from the Note 7, but it represents an overall improvement in our quality assurance," said a Samsung spokesman. To its credit, Samsung has laid out its entire process for everyone to see, which is a rarity in this industry. Motorola is attempting to capitalize on the Note 7 incident, but Gyenes said he's been eager to talk about this for a long time. "I've been behind the scenes for years asking why can't we sell safety," he said. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

These are the most common propulsion system used in most of the larger satellites,” says Avimanyu Basu, a lead analyst at Technavio for space research. The chemical propulsion systems carry a substantial amount of fuel for satellite missions, which makes it unsuitable for nano and microsatellite designs. The adoption of these systems is expected to decrease over the forecast period due to the emergence of nano-scale satellites, demand for satellites with higher payload-carrying capacity, and need for environmentally-friendly propulsion systems. Hybrid propulsion satellite The hybrid propulsion satellites market is expected to be worth USD 4.51 billion by the end of 2017 and is expected to grow at a moderate pace through the forecast period. These satellites have been in existence for the past two decades, and are mainly used to reduce overall launch costs, launch multiple geostationary satellites using a single launch vehicle, and reduce dependence on chemical fuels. The highest growth for the market segment is expected to originate from the emerging space-based research countries such as China and India. All-electric propulsion satellite “Launched in 2016, all-electric propulsion satellites are expected to increase their adoption rates swiftly. The cost-effective, efficient, and capability to carry larger payloads nature of all-electric propulsion satellites are the key factors driving its adoption rates,” says Avimanyu. Since the provision of electric propulsion enhances the performance and payload-carrying capacity of a satellite, satellite operators will be able to accommodate or equip a higher number of payloads into one satellite. Also, the swift developments in the propulsion system are drawing investments from countries such as China, Japan, India, Germany, France, the UK, and the US.

The order covers 10,482 seats used mostly on mostly smaller regional jets. Airlines will have five years to remove the seats. The FAA proposed the action last year and made it final on Wednesday. The FAA says the seats can slide forward in crashes and cause passengers’ heads to slide down the back of the seats in front of them, hitting their chins on the tray tables. Zodiac Seats California, the seat maker, and two companies that use the seats in their planes, Canada’s Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer, argued that the order was based on limited research. Delta Air Lines called for more testing. Zodiac, Bombardier, regional airline SkyWest and others protested that the FAA underestimated the cost of removing 10,482 seats, which the FAA put at $890,970. The seats have been installed on planes including some models of Boeing 717s and MD-90s, Bombardier Series 900s, and Embraer 190s and ERJ 170s. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Using a protein, grown in the laboratory and implanted behind the retina, this promising new procedure offers hope for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other retinal diseases. “These are terrible diseases that truly impact the quality of life for many people,’’ said Wagner, the president and CEO of LambdaVision. “To offer patients the possibility of restoring their vision provides them the chance to see a new grandchild, resume a golf game, drive again or read a favorite book. For many people, restored vision would allow them to return to an independent life.’’ LambdaVision uses a light-activated protein, bacteriorhodopsin, to stimulate the retina of patients suffering from impaired or lost vision due to retinal degenerative diseases. The protein, isolated from high-salt environments, including the Dead Sea, is grown and purified in the laboratory. The protein works by absorbing light and converting it into a signal that is picked up by specialized cells in the retina, relayed to the optic nerve and ultimately interpreted by the brain. More than 31 million people worldwide suffer from irreversible vision loss caused by macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. The incidence of blindness caused by retinal degenerative diseases is increasing at a rapid rate due to an increase in the global geriatric population, Wagner said. LambdaVision’s implant can restore high-quality vision to those patients who are no longer candidates for traditional treatments and have end-stage retinal degeneration, Wagner said. Current treatments only succeed in slowing the progression of disease. LambdaVision was founded through support from UConn’s Technology Commercialization Services in 2009. Dr. Robert R. Birge, distinguished professor of chemistry at UConn, led a research group that included Wagner. The protein is in pre-clinical trials across the country to determine the stability and efficacy of the implant. “LambdaVision has been incredibly fortunate to have the continued support of UConn and the State of Connecticut, and we owe much of our success to the incredible mentors that have helped us to propel the research and development and commercialization of the technology,’’ she said. “In the early stages of development, they were the believers.’’ LambdaVision has won many awards, including most recently: a 2016 UConn SPARK Technology Commercialization Fund Award and the prestigious 2016 MassChallenge CASIS-Boeing Prize for Technology, which allows the company to carry out experiments aboard the International Space Station. Since gravity can interfere with the uniformity of the retinal implant films, the hope is that work done in microgravity will be faster and yield improvements in the homogeneity and stability of the product. The company also won the $15,000 Wolff New Venture Prize, sponsored by UConn’s Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CCEI) and a National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research Grant. “To be on the brink of a new and exciting medical breakthrough is thrilling,’’ Wagner said. “I’m very eager to see this technology available in the medical community where it can make a difference in people’s lives.’’     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on May 25, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: May 25, 2017 @ 1:37 am Filed Under: 24/7 OSI, Americas, Cuba, English, Environment, Health, Intelligence, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Research, Security, Technology Incubation Program, United States Government, United States of America, US State Governments, US State of Connecticut NEXT ARTICLE → the last Democratic bogeyman About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts Farmington Startup Sets Sights on Curing Retinal-Disease Blindness the last Democratic bogeyman Could Chocolate Guard Against an Irregular Heartbeat?

Phones by Roger Cheng May 24, 2017 8:18 AM PDT @RogerWCheng Motorola says it has a strict regimen of testing when it comes to battery safety. Josh Miller/CNET Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 sent the wireless industry into a frenzy when the phones started catching fire. Samsung itself recalled and scrapped the phones, and many other companies started looking into their own manufacturing processes. But at least one phone maker held firm with the processes it already had in place. "Absolutely not," said Motorola's Russ Gyenes when asked whether his company made any changes after the Note 7 problem flared up. Gyenes, an engineer who focuses on batteries, was speaking to a group of journalists on Tuesday. While Samsung has largely repaired its image with the launch of the Galaxy S8, the potentially volatile nature of battery technology remains an issue. The Note 7 incident put a spotlight on how companies in all industries ensure the safety of the batteries in their devices. Samsung, for instance, introduced an eight-point battery check that it shared with the industry in hopes of raising standards everywhere. When asked about Samsung's test, Gyenes smirked. "I looked at that eight-point check," he said. "Why weren't they doing it before?" What I saw inside Samsung's battery testing center CNET senior reporter Shara Tibken visits Samsung headquarters in South Korea to see firsthand how the company has stepped up its battery testing after the disastrous Note 7 fires. She also gets an early look at the new Galaxy S8. by Shara Tibken 4:05 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF His comments are bold for any company, even one whose legacy in dealing with battery technology goes back to the invention of the first cell phone. Hoverboards, e-cigarettes, electric cars and computer batteries have shown at least isolated instances of batteries catching fire. Boeing fielded questions about the safety of lithium-ion batteries for its 787 Dreamliner. Gyenes noted that Motorola testified as an expert in those proceedings. The discussion was part of a broader campaign to get Motorola -- a historic brand in the wireless world that fell on hard times with the rise of the iPhone -- back into the public consciousness with a new brand strategy and phones like the Moto Z. Gyenes said that Motorola, a unit of Chinese tech giant Lenovo, would have caught the issues with the Note 7 batteries early on because it looks at the process from the individual cell construction level, or well before the batteries are mass produced. It also performs checks on supplier X-ray processes and has an audit with 118 questions that its battery manufacturer partner must pass. Get one wrong, and the process is a failure. "That's a showstopper," he said. In that eight-point check, the addition of X-ray tests and more accelerated battery usage would have helped, but Gyenes suggested the introduction of that process was more of a "marketing campaign." Samsung, for its part, said the new process wasn't put in place to stop future Note 7-like incidents, but was more holistic. The company is also vowing to do these checks themselves, which go beyond other vendors. "The eight-point battery process reflects what we learned from the Note 7, but it represents an overall improvement in our quality assurance," said a Samsung spokesman. To its credit, Samsung has laid out its entire process for everyone to see, which is a rarity in this industry. Motorola is attempting to capitalize on the Note 7 incident, but Gyenes said he's been eager to talk about this for a long time. "I've been behind the scenes for years asking why can't we sell safety," he said. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

By Franz-Stefan Gady for The Diplomat May 25, 2017               The Indian Army is slated to place an order for up to 11 U.S.-made AH-64E Apache heavy attack helicopters, the latest and most advanced variant of the helicopter gunship, according to Indian media reports. The new helicopters will  provide the service with a much needed close-air support capability. As I reported previously, India and the United States concluded an agreement for the procurement of 22 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and 15 CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters in November 2015. For a number of years, the Indian Army has been engaged in a tug of war with the Indian Air Force over who should operate this future fleet of Apache gunships. The Army initially asked for the gunships to be inducted into its ranks, or for the Air Force to at least share the helicopters with the ground forces. The Air Force, however, rejected both proposals. The Hindu now reveals that the matter came up again during last week’s Defense Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting, chaired by Indian Defense Minister Arun Jaitley. According to an unnamed defense ministry source, the Indian Army finally got its way and will operate separate AH-64E squadrons in the future.Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month. The November 2015 weapons deal includes an optional clause for a follow-on order of 11 extra Apaches and seven Chinooks. The Mail Today reported on May 20 that the Army is seeking to buy a total of 39 AH-64E helicopters to be divided up into three squadrons and stationed near India’s borders with China and Pakistan. Should the Indian Army indeed wish to procure 39 Apache gunships, a new contract would have to be negotiated, which could take a while. As I reported back in 2015:  India’s Cabinet Committee of Security (CCS), a government body headed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and responsible for military procurements, approved the purchase… after more than ten (some sources say 13) American price validity extensions, which stipulate that the American defense contractor Boeing would sell the military hardware at the price agreed upon in 2013. A new contract would not only involve price haggling, but also include difficult negotiations over U.S. offset obligations. Indeed, the prolonged negotiations over the initial batch of 22 Apache helicopters are partially to blame for the inter-service rivalry. In 2012, then Indian National Security Advisor Shankar Menon decided that any new attack helicopters procured would go the Army. The Air Force, however, countered that it had already begun the acquisition process in 2012.  Following extensive field trials, the Indian Air Force selected the Apache gunship and the Chinook helicopter in 2009.

Phones by Roger Cheng May 24, 2017 8:18 AM PDT @RogerWCheng Motorola says it has a strict regimen of testing when it comes to battery safety. Josh Miller/CNET Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 sent the wireless industry into a frenzy when the phones started catching fire. Samsung itself recalled and scrapped the phones, and many other companies started looking into their own manufacturing processes. But at least one phone maker held firm with the processes it already had in place. "Absolutely not," said Motorola's Russ Gyenes when asked whether his company made any changes after the Note 7 problem flared up. Gyenes, an engineer who focuses on batteries, was speaking to a group of journalists on Tuesday. While Samsung has largely repaired its image with the launch of the Galaxy S8, the potentially volatile nature of battery technology remains an issue. The Note 7 incident put a spotlight on how companies in all industries ensure the safety of the batteries in their devices. Samsung, for instance, introduced an eight-point battery check that it shared with the industry in hopes of raising standards everywhere. When asked about Samsung's test, Gyenes smirked. "I looked at that eight-point check," he said. "Why weren't they doing it before?" What I saw inside Samsung's battery testing center CNET senior reporter Shara Tibken visits Samsung headquarters in South Korea to see firsthand how the company has stepped up its battery testing after the disastrous Note 7 fires. She also gets an early look at the new Galaxy S8. by Shara Tibken 4:05 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF His comments are bold for any company, even one whose legacy in dealing with battery technology goes back to the invention of the first cell phone. Hoverboards, e-cigarettes, electric cars and computer batteries have shown at least isolated instances of batteries catching fire. Boeing fielded questions about the safety of lithium-ion batteries for its 787 Dreamliner. Gyenes noted that Motorola testified as an expert in those proceedings. The discussion was part of a broader campaign to get Motorola -- a historic brand in the wireless world that fell on hard times with the rise of the iPhone -- back into the public consciousness with a new brand strategy and phones like the Moto Z. Gyenes said that Motorola, a unit of Chinese tech giant Lenovo, would have caught the issues with the Note 7 batteries early on because it looks at the process from the individual cell construction level, or well before the batteries are mass produced. It also performs checks on supplier X-ray processes and has an audit with 118 questions that its battery manufacturer partner must pass. Get one wrong, and the process is a failure. "That's a showstopper," he said. In that eight-point check, the addition of X-ray tests and more accelerated battery usage would have helped, but Gyenes suggested the introduction of that process was more of a "marketing campaign." Samsung, for its part, said the new process wasn't put in place to stop future Note 7-like incidents, but was more holistic. The company is also vowing to do these checks themselves, which go beyond other vendors. "The eight-point battery process reflects what we learned from the Note 7, but it represents an overall improvement in our quality assurance," said a Samsung spokesman. To its credit, Samsung has laid out its entire process for everyone to see, which is a rarity in this industry. Motorola is attempting to capitalize on the Note 7 incident, but Gyenes said he's been eager to talk about this for a long time. "I've been behind the scenes for years asking why can't we sell safety," he said. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

The Redcar firm is one of a handful across the UK involved in the potentially multi-billion pound graphene market, racing to commercialise the so-called wonder product, a form of carbon that is tougher than diamond, a better conductor than copper and is just one atom thick. Now the firm has registered a patent after developing innovative new technology called Structural Ink, which can be printed directly onto composites, that once fully commercialised will be targeted at the advanced composites industry. Four firms are already working with AGM, exploring Structural Ink, including Milton Keynes based Prodrive Composites Limited, which works on advanced technologies within the motorsport industry. The team at Wilton, Redcar, is already working on a number of partnerships looking at ways in which graphene can be used in a whole host of sectors, and last year the business hooked its first customer, when it announced its first production order and commercial application in which the miracle material is being used in a range of high performance fishing rods, made by Washington-based Century Composites Ltd. Now AGM has signed heads of terms for a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with the University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and Boeing.

Whilst we continue to collaborate with customers on developing tailored graphene dispersions for a range of applications, this printing technology offers AGM another route to market and a tried and tested product offer that we believe will be very compelling for composites end users.

The foundations we have laid over the last three years are really starting to bear fruit. We have consistently focused on the core markets where we know we can deliver significant enhancements for large-scale industries and our collaborations across these areas continue to build momentum.” In a trading update to shareholders the group said it has continued to make good progress during the year and that it expects its loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year ending July 31 to be in line with earlier estimates at a loss of £4m based on revenues for the current year of £300,000. Cash is expected to be significantly ahead of expectation at £4.5m.

By: Reuters | New Delhi | Updated: May 24, 2017 8:05 PM Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to end India’s role as the world’s largest arms importer by getting foreign firms to impart technology to local players and then manufacture in India. (Representative Image: Reuters) India approved on Wednesday a long-awaited policy to boost local defence manufacturing by effectively picking industry champions that would tie up with foreign players and make high-tech defence equipment. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to end India’s role as the world’s largest arms importer by getting foreign firms to impart technology to local players and then manufacture in India. Under the “Strategic Partnership” model, the government will shortlist and then pick Indian companies to join forces with foreign firms to supply fighter jets, helicopters, armoured vehicles and submarines. “For each platform, one private sector strategic partner will be chosen,” Defence Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after the cabinet’s Committee on Security cleared the policy. He said the policy was designed to encourage manufacturing by assuring the selected companies of future orders. “You don’t set up a manufacturing facility if you don’t have any hope of getting orders,” he said. Government and industry representatives have been haggling over the details of the model for more than a year, delaying the launch of tens of billions of dollars worth of deals. You may also like to watch: Indian firms Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Tata Group and recent entrants Reliance Group and Adani Group are all expected to compete fiercely to become one of four strategic partners. Foreign manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus and Saab are looking to India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Modi and Jaitley were keen to get the project approved before the prime minister completes three years in office on May 26. Modi then heads off next Monday to Germany, Spain and Russia, where defence procurement will be high on the agenda. In June Modi is expected to visit the United States, which has emerged as one of the top arms supplier to India in recent years. A Ashish Jha May 24, 2017 at 10:38 pm Good step. It will not only save substantial amount of economy but will also boost the future growth of the defence equipment and future ties with other countries. But it will take time to become self reliant in defence sector.

Behind that was a battle over a proposal to enact “Single Payer” (SP) health care financing in California. Behind that is a power play about money. SP is a method by which health care expenditures are financed by public agencies. For example, Medicare and Medicaid are SP systems. Now, a powerful commercial and political interest (the California Nurses Association) is pushing legislation to establish a consolidated state-run SP agency. They want Medicare and Medicaid to run through the new agency and to eliminate private insurance so that all healthcare payments in California (~$400 billion per year) would run through that agency. There can be benefits to SP systems but healthier populations are not necessarily one of them. Just compare the French and Swiss systems, neither of which is SP, with Canada, which is SP: The Commonwealth Fund, 2014 So why the push for a consolidated state-run SP agency? The answer: to establish a single point of political power, which is more lucrative for cronies who derive revenues from government spending. The single point of political power in the case of the proposed SP system would be a nine-person board requiring the inclusion of at least one representative from the nurses union. That’s like requiring that a board managing military spending provide at least one seat to Boeing. If you want a sense of what’s in store for citizens if such a board manages healthcare financing in California, see what has happened to citizens as a result of pension financing managed by the boards of CalPERS and CalSTRS. It’s about a single point of political power. There is a reason the US healthcare-industrial complex has become the biggest recipient of government spending. Nothing helps them more than establishing a single point of political power. Political philanthropists and citizens should pay close attention to elected officials and candidates who curry favor with any member of the healthcare-industrial complex. As discussed here, California is already not getting results from doubling spending on cronies to more than $100 billion per year. The state’s goal should be greater citizen health, not greater crony wealth.

Kris Osborn May 24, 2017 TweetShareShare Modernizing computer networks for the nuclear arsenal is part of the current Air Force plan to build as many as 400 new Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs, to serve through the 2070s. The Air Force is seeking more interactions with private sector firms to build better networks for securing nuclear weapons computer systems, service officials said. Air Force engineers say protection of computer networks is well established in many ways, but that the service needs to widen its scope with greater focus on IT dimensions to its nuclear arsenal’s command and control apparatus. “Information technology that touches weapons systems needs to be cyber secure, updated and patched. Worldwide nuclear systems are one example of where we need to get an overhaul,” Peter Kim, Air Force Chief Information Security Officer, told Scout Warrior in an interview. The need to adjust nuclear arsenal computer systems was further emphasized in a recently announced U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board Study on the topic that will be released in 2017. “Today’s dependences on cyber systems were not prevalent when legacy nuclear systems were fielded, nor were today’s cyber threats, including supply chain concerns,” the study’s outline states. Modernizing computer networks for the nuclear arsenal is part of the services’ current plan to build as many as 400 new Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs, to serve through the 2070s. The Air Force is now assessing industry proposals to build the new ICBMs, from Northrop Grumman, Boeing and Lockheed Martin.   The study preview goes on to indicate that the Air Force will benefit from a clearer understanding of how nuclear weapons’ security can be achieved in today’s increasingly digital environment. Initiatives to look at securing computer networks for nuclear weapons comprise a key part of an Air Force program aimed at better connecting with private sector innovators. The Air Force effort, which involves strengthening email encryption and computer-virus protections, is operating within part of a broader Defense Department effort referred to as Defense Innovation Unit – Experimental, or DIUx, Kim said. Thus far, DIUx centers have been announced by Defense Secretary Ashton Carter in Silicon Valley, Austin, Texas and Boston, Mass., Kim added. “There needs to be innovative technologies that can help us be more productive, safe and secure with cyber security,” he explained. Among other things, the Air Force is seeking partnerships designed to address potential vulnerabilities with operating systems, infrastructure and various computer networks.

Opinion Op-Ed Op-Ed America's military is built to help defense contractors, not troops Rick Bowmer / Associated Press An F-35 jet arrives at its new operational base at Hill Air Force Base, in northern Utah on Sept. 2, 2015. An F-35 jet arrives at its new operational base at Hill Air Force Base, in northern Utah on Sept. 2, 2015. (Rick Bowmer / Associated Press) Max Brooks and Lionel Beehner The speaker was civilian, the audience military. Soldiers and marines leaned forward as the speaker described the hazards inherent to moving troops or supplies in developing countries. Those in uniform nodded. Many knew firsthand what happens to an ambushed truck convoy in a clogged Iraqi alley or on a narrow Afghan switchback. Many had lost friends on those alleys and roads. All were looking for solutions. And here it was: hover bikes! Through flashing slides of an artist's renderings, the civilian confidently boasted that the future of military transport was here. "Great," grumbled one soldier after the presentation, "all the enemy has to do is string up a clothesline between two buildings." "Or just hide up on the second floor with a baseball bat," added a young Marine, "and hit us in the face as we pass." "Hey, you guys talking about the hover bikes?" a passing civilian contractor asked. "Cool stuff, huh?" This scene exemplifies our deeply broken military procurement process. The system pads the pockets of big defense firms at the expense of our troops, delivering boondoggles instead of quality products that save lives. Before he took office, Donald Trump suggested he would overhaul the procurement process. He said he’d slash the cost of the F-35 and even discussed scaling back the bling on Air Force One. Since taking office, he has reversed himself, promising to lavish the military with whatever it needs. But does the need come from the military or those who arm them? Without reform, not only will more American tax dollars vanish down the Pentagon's bottomless well, but more Americans may lose lives and limbs. Greed and incompetence have always infected the equipment of armies. The term "shoddy" comes from the flimsy, mass-produced shoes that "shod" our troops during the Civil War. When President Eisenhower warned against the military-industrial complex, he foresaw a new age of collusion between politicians, defense contractors and those who wear the stars. It was bad enough during the Cold War, but the dysfunction is even worse now. Consider that of the 63 largest Pentagon programs at the moment, 50 are over budget by $296 billion. And that's just money. What about blood? In the early days of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, when Americans were being killed by low-tech, jury-rigged improvised explosive devices, the Pentagon was spending billions on air-superiority fighter planes, anti-ballistic missile lasers, and uniforms so cheap they were said to tear like tissue paper in the field. The military relies on a familiar clutch of defense contractors that face little public scrutiny or competition from outside firms, and so have little incentive to provide cost-effective technologies. Instead, they offer shiny objects. Consider the Future Combat Systems, a fleet of networked vehicles that was supposed to provide greater mobility and communications capabilities. How did it do? The multibillion dollar program was shelved in 2009. Peeling back the onion of the military's procurement process reveals a broken yet intricate system that traverses congressional districts and crosses party lines. In his memoirs, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates complained at length about how big money, special interest groups, and politicians looking to create local jobs conspire to keep expensive yet iffy programs (like missile defense) up and running. Without reform, not only will more American tax dollars vanish down the Pentagon's bottomless well, but more Americans may lose lives and limbs in tomorrow's wars. The first step is to seek more input from the frontlines — the only way to find out what’s really needed. (We could look to Israel as an example; there, the military and the tech sector work hand-in-glove.) The second step is to restore true competition. Right now, companies outside the so-called Iron Triangle almost never win bids. But if an outside company like, say, Airbus makes a better mousetrap (or Air Force tanker) than an established contractor, like Boeing, then they should be rewarded. Quality matters more than brand. Reform, however, cannot succeed without greater oversight, and right now no one is minding the store. Yes, there are various agencies and committees, offices and officers, but there is no centralized power tasked with rooting out inefficiencies. This needs to change, or rather, it needs to change back. A long time ago, when Eisenhower was a general and America was embroiled in World War II, a scrappy, sharp-elbowed senator headed a committee that oversaw all military corruption and waste. This senator took names, made sure that every dollar was well spent, not squandered, and that American weapons only killed America's enemies. That senator's name was Harry S. Truman. What we need today is a new version of the Truman Committee, one given broad authority to truly drain the swamp. Will the military brass resent this kind of disruptive intrusion? Some might, at least those who have cushy consulting jobs lined up with contractors. But the majority of them care deeply about the men and women under their command, and would rather they had something more practical than hoverbikes.

Privacy Policy Unlike many previous OPEC summits that ended in squabbling, this week’s biannual gathering in Vienna seems to be on course for a foregone and happy conclusion: extended production cuts. But as explained below, don’t pile indiscriminately into the energy sector. Stick to certain stocks that during the energy price slump showed prudence. Their debt-slashing discipline is about to pay off in a big way. Saudi Arabia and Russia have been tipping their hands in recent days, giving investors a glimpse of their intentions ahead of the OPEC meeting scheduled to start on Thursday, May 25. The two major oil producers have announced their backing for a nine-month extension of the existing production cut of 1.2 million barrels per day from OPEC plus 558,000 barrels per day from a group of non-OPEC countries. OPEC members also will consider the initial public offering (IPO) for part of Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company Saudi Arabia Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, which is slated for 2018. Saudi Arabia is OPEC’s de facto leader and it’s in the Saudi’s interests to keep prices high enough to bolster Saudi Aramco’s IPO. At the same time, Russia’s economy and government depend on a steady stream of petrodollars. Another positive sign: the latest Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) rig count on May 19 showed that U.S. drillers added rigs for the 18th consecutive week, implying that the energy rally so far has legs. These developments are in stark contrast to OPEC’s failed attempt to implement a production freeze at a meeting in Doha in April 2016. However, in this unpredictable investment climate, your smartest strategy is to look for strong energy stocks, notably those with the lowest ratios of long-term debt-to-equity. They’re less vulnerable to wild oil price swings and they’ll grow the fastest if the oil rebound proves sustainable. Let’s take a closer look at how you should trade the energy resurgence. A billion here, a billion there… During the free-spending days of President Johnson’s Great Society, Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (R-IL) famously said: “A billion here, a billion there, sooner or later it adds up to real money.” Senator Dirksen was referring to the nation’s increasingly indebted finances during the 1960s, but he could have been referring to many beleaguered companies right now in the energy patch. How colossal is the energy sector’s collective debt? According to recent analyst estimates, the amount of outstanding loans and lending commitments to the energy industry that large U.S. banks currently have on their books totals $123 billion. With OPEC production cuts apparently sticking and oil prices resuming their upward trajectory, many investors looking for growth opportunities are eager to jump back into energy stocks. But many seemingly enticing energy plays are in reality ticking time bombs of debt. Crude to the rescue… Regardless, it appears that crude is playing the role of stock market cavalry. When broader indices are flagging, oil price rises tend to give them buoyancy. After seesawing in recent weeks, the price of the U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, now hovers at about $50/bbl, while Brent North Sea Crude, on which international oils are priced, stands close to $54/bbl. Robert Rapier, our in-house energy guru, is optimistic about energy’s prospects. He’s also cheered by the debt-reduction efforts of many key energy players, arguing that they’ve set the table for capital appreciation in coming months. As chief investment strategist of The Energy Strategist, Robert deeply understands the dynamic of the energy sector. He points out: “As far as U.S. oil producers go, they are mostly signaling that they are going to manage to be profitable even with an extended period of $50/bbl oil. Results for Q1 show that the majority has made significant strides toward improving cash flow and profitability…” For laudable debt management, Robert singles out exploration and production giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX): “All in all, it looks like Chevron will continue to be able to fund its capital needs and the dividend from a combination of cash flow and assets sales, while completion and ramp-up of three megaprojects this year should enable them to close the gap without the asset sales. That all assumes that oil prices don’t recover much from here, but also that they don’t collapse back below $40/bbl… The 4% dividend looks safe at current oil prices, and you can pick up shares today for not much more than they were a year ago. I suspect that will no longer be the case a year from now.” Hardy survivor… Indeed, Chevron is a resilient major player that’s on the cusp of a breakout. Chevron’s latest operating results were encouraging, in large part because the company has been methodically pruning its portfolio, by selling non-performing assets, cutting expenses and emphasizing its most profitable operations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Chevron reported enhanced cash flow from operations of $3.9 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in the same quarter a year ago. The company also paid back $900 million in debt. In addition to its fortress-like balance sheet, Chevron stands out for its diversification. With a market cap of $201 billion, the giant energy producer boasts a mix of assets, including liquefied natural gas, deepwater fields spread around the world, shale plays in North America, and downstream activities such as refining and retailing. The latter downstream assets confer high margins and somewhat buffer the company from oil price gyrations. CVX’s total debt-to-equity ratio now stands at 30.62, considerably below the staggering debt levels incurred by many of its peers. Projected earnings growth is exceptional. The average analyst expectation is that year-over-year earnings growth at Chevron will reach 194.3% in the current quarter, 140.8% next quarter, and 374.5% in the current year. My own estimates call for Chevron to generate a five-year earnings growth rate of about 76% over the next five years, on an annualized basis. That’s a stunning improvement from the annualized growth rate of -38.65% over the past five years, during the energy price slump. In coming issues, I’ll pinpoint other standout opportunities in the recovering energy sector. After a long free-fall, energy prices are bouncing back. But energy rallies have faded before. You need to stay selective, especially with a broad market correction and perhaps recession looming in the wings. Much ado in the House of Saud… Also noteworthy this week regarding Saudi Arabia has been President Trump’s visit to the kingdom. A reader on May 21 asked this question: “How will the arms sales to Saudi Arabia announced yesterday affect Honeywell specifically and other defense stocks generally?” — Paul D. Paul, the $55 billion Saudi deal signed during Trump’s visit represents a windfall for Honeywell (NYSE: HON), Boeing (NYSE: BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), and other major defense contractors and their suppliers. Boeing and the oil sheiks inked a major deal for Boeing’s Chinook helicopters and surveillance aircraft. The U.S./Saudi arms deal also includes procurement worth up to $6 billion for Sikorsky Aircraft (now owned by Lockheed Martin) to build 150 Blackhawk helicopters in Saudi Arabia. This Sikorsky/LMT deal is significant because the Blackhawk is a highly versatile “aerial jeep” and a popular export product around the world. Through the Blackhawk, the Saudis are eager to build up the desert kingdom’s indigenous defense industry. The Saudi agreement also calls for missile-maker Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) to start a branch in Saudi Arabia. By getting its nose under the Saudi tent, Raytheon will have an even more entrenched position in the strife-torn region. The company already was instrumental in building the Iron Dome missile defense shield for Israel. The good news for Honeywell in these deals is that the company provides the electronics gear and sophisticated avionics — the internal high-tech “guts” — for many of these fixed-wing and helicopter programs. Honeywell is a member of the Personal Finance Growth Portfolio. Got any questions or comments? I’d especially like to know how you’ve fared with our recommendations.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Aerospace Oxygen System Market: Growth, Demand and Key Players to 2025 Global Aerospace Oxygen System Market: Overview Oxygen is a pivotal part of our lives, quintessential for sustenance of human, animal and plant alike, the gas accounts for 21.0 percent in terms of volume among all dry air constituents. With evolving transportation scenario, passengers’ preference have shifted from using wheels to cars to aircrafts. As per International Air Transport Association, in 2015, globally, over 3.5 Billion people had safely commuted. With air transport being cost effective day-by-day, the number of travellers is expected to increase significantly. Thriving number of aircraft passengers has created a strong demand for efficient oxygen systems. With increasing altitude, partial pressure of oxygen decreases which makes it progressively more difficult to inhale or intake oxygen. To maintain suitable level of oxygen concentration for both passengers and pilot, life support systems and oxygen systems are required. Aerospace oxygen systems provide oxygen to occupants through pipe lines, fittings and are centrally regulated. With applications in cargo, transport and military sectors, the demand for aerospace oxygen system market is increasing steadily.

Sundeep Khanna GM’s retreat, and that of many other multinational companies, suggests that the mantra of global expansion that has driven companies to seek markets and sourcing bases across the world is in some doubt. Photo: Bloomberg Enough has been written about how General Motors Co. (GM), the world’s third largest car maker, made a hash of its India business till it was finally forced to pull the plug. Not enough though has been said about how little it matters. The fact is GM never made a difference to India and in turn, India contributed little to the auto maker’s fortunes. Twenty years after its re-entry into India, the Detroit-based company, which was once the apogee of multinational ambitions, has precious little to show for its exertions barring the small matter of a billion dollars in losses. Nor is India the only country off GM’s radar. In quick succession over the last few years, it has now pulled out of Russia, South Africa and Europe preferring to save its ammunition for the US market, where it is under threat from manufacturers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Volkswagen AG. ALSO READ: General Motors India exit leaves dealers, customers in a quandary GM’s retreat, and that of many other multinational companies, suggests that the mantra of global expansion that has driven companies to seek markets and sourcing bases across the world is in some doubt. For the last two decades, as India eased its entry barriers, it had become almost an article of faith for large global corporations to include the country in their plans. Betting on India became almost a mandatory pre-requisite for a business plan. A number of those bets have turned sour. In 2007, the UK-based Vodafone Group acquired a majority stake in Indian telecom services provider Hutchison Essar for roughly $10.9 billion. Over the next 10 years, in the world’s fastest growing market for telecom services, despite robust growth in terms of subscriber numbers as well as revenue, Vodafone’s shareholders found little joy in its Indian venture. Even before the Reliance Jio sledgehammer hit all the incumbents, Vodafone had piled up huge losses and this March, it announced a merger with Idea Cellular in a clear sign of waning interest in the India business. In the banking space, the last 6-7 years have seen a number of foreign banks like Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays Plc, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and ING exiting all or part of their businesses in India. Indeed, for a business which saw the entry of foreigners nearly 100 years ago, multinational banks have steadily lost market share in the country with their share of advances dropping to 4.41% in 2015. Lurching from crisis to crisis in their home markets following the financial crash of 2008, the world’s biggest banks are now focusing on sacrificing geographical spread in the quest to maintain profitability. We saw a similar exodus 15 years ago when power sector companies like Enron, AES, Cogentrix and CMS Energy pulled out within a few years of rushing into India. With this, the oft perpetrated myth that a long-term commitment to India is bound to pay off eventually stands dispelled. For all its promise, India hasn’t been a runaway success for multinationals. Estimates by Bain & Co. indicate that while in Brazil, MNC sales as a percentage of top 100 company sales grew from around 25% to 40% within the decade of the 1990s, in India, the figure was around 8% in 2014. Not one of the top 10 companies in Fortune’s ranking of US corporations by revenues— Walmart, Exxon Mobil, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, McKesson, UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health, General Motors, Ford Motor and AT&T—has a significant share of its business coming out of India. In the past, many MNCs were pushed into global expansion by high taxation rates as well as labour costs in the US. Adding to that were the incentives newly liberalizing countries were willing to hand out. Not any more as US firms are increasingly being incentivized to stay at home. According to Good Jobs First, a Washington D.C.-based non-profit that tracks federal, state and local economic development subsidies, a few years ago, Washington state awarded Boeing Co. the largest corporate tax break any state had given any corporation—a massive $8.7 billion handout aimed at encouraging Boeing “to maintain and grow its workforce within the state”. That’s the kind of red carpet India isn’t willing to lay out for MNCs. It isn’t just India. An equal number of multinationals have found China a bridge too far. McDonald’s spent 26 years in the country before selling off 80% of its operations this January to a consortium led by China’s CITIC and the private equity firm Carlyle. Mattel shut down its ambitious 36,000 square feet store in Shanghai within two years of opening it. In the spirit of Donald Trump’s America for Americans, older US MNCs are in retreat while a new generation of them, companies like Google and Facebook are now laying their markers. So far though, even this latter set has little to show by way of returns on their investments. Could it be that the cult of multinationalism, the favourite prescription of every consulting firm over the last 30 years, isn’t quite what it has been cracked up to be? After all, what’s the point of Coca Cola when the very US triumphalism that it represented is itself under threat!

Inmarsat and Qatar Airways recently announced plans to install GX Aviation inflight broadband solution across Qatar Airways’ flagship fleet. GX Aviation is the world’s first inflight connectivity solution with reliable, seamless high-speed global coverage provided through a single operator, Inmarsat says. Inmarsat has built a team of experts from various fields, that have come together to deliver pertinent solutions to the aviation market. “We are now seeing a growing degree of proliferation of airlines selecting Inmarsat’s high speed broadband services. IFC can be a clear service differentiator for an airline, often making the difference between ticket sales, or not,” says Ben Griffin, regional vice president MEA Aviation, Inmarsat, in an interview with TradeArabia. “Whether we like it or not, the connected revolution is well under way and generations to come demand the basic right to be connected regardless of being on the land, sea or in the air,” he says. Excerpts from the interview: Inmarsat is making huge strides in aviation communication. Please provide an overview of the latest developments in this sector and Inmarsat's innovative solutions? Inmarsat has long been involved in aviation connectivity; predominantly with the cockpit communications for safety applications, but more so now with the explosion of interest and demand for passenger connectivity. To address this, Inmarsat took the decision to invest nearly $2 billion in 2010 and has made significant further investments since then, in order to provide a broadband service capable of providing the levels of bandwidth and performance for tomorrow’s passengers. The philosophy was to start with a global coverage pattern, which has been achieved with its initial constellation of three GX/Ka band satellites. This is being complemented with additional satellite coverage (most recently the launch of our 4th satellite for this constellation on May 15) where it is required to meet the needs of high density capacity requirements. Aside from providing a network that provides bandwidth and uninterrupted coverage for airline routes, Inmarsat has built a team of experts from various fields, that have come together to deliver pertinent solutions to the aviation market. Whether these are ISP functions or value added services, we are developing all sorts of services, solutions and applications that are in high demand from airlines and their passengers. The main objective here is to provide a quality service to passengers at a price point that allows maximum flexibility to airlines to develop the service in whichever way suits their particular brand or philosophy. This represents a significant deviation from the way in which IFC is being offered today by many of the alternative IFC providers, who operate a far more rigid model. How are these developments being accepted and implemented by the global airlines? We have done a great job in getting the market ready for the implementation of these services; it has taken years and we have developed very good existing relationships that, to some degree, we have nurtured from our legacy business. Inmarsat is regarded as a quality provider of robust network services; a high enough quality to meet stringent Air Traffic Control standards worldwide. There are very few airlines in the world who aren’t looking at IFC in some way or form and building from our strong legacy position, the Inmarsat proposition is compelling due to the reputation of quality, reliability and long standing in the market. We are now seeing a growing degree of proliferation of airlines selecting Inmarsat’s high speed broadband services (GX aviation) - Qatar Airways, IAG, Lufthansa Group, Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand, Norwegian Air Shuttle to name a few – with many more to be announced throughout the rest of 2017 and beyond. GCC has some of the world's biggest airlines. How are they implementing these latest broadband technologies for the benefit of passengers? The GCC airlines mostly already have some degree of IFC and have been early adopters of these services for their passengers. It fits well with their profile to offer the very best in passenger services, which was certainly the main driver behind Qatar Airways’ selection of Inmarsat GX for their B777/A350 fleet. It is difficult, however, to embody these changes in aircraft already operating for the airlines. In order to make the fairly significant retrofit changes both inside and outside of the fuselage, it requires taking the aircraft out of revenue service for a few days. This is typically done coincidentally with the airline’s heavy maintenance schedule to mitigate special grounding, but on some occasions these retrofits are of great enough priority to make special groundings. What we are seeing among the GCC airlines with significant new aircraft coming from Boeing and Airbus, is very smart planning ahead. The Inmarsat technology is available line-fit (fit by the manufacturers as part of the aircraft assembly) which means that when these aircraft enter service with the airline they already have the equipment installed – which makes life considerable easier. The passenger is at the forefront of all of this – the forward thinking of the airlines, along with Inmarsat, to be able to forecast passenger trends and needs is quite amazing. IFC can be a clear service differentiator for an airline, often making the difference between ticket sales, or not. Anticipating the needs of the passenger to connect their devices and what it is they want to do in flight for the coming years is not an easy task – but with Inmarsat the airlines can be confident they are getting a scalable platform that will not lock them out of future upgrades and capabilities. It’s not all about ‘just’ passenger Wifi, of course. With decent, reliable connectivity the crews can cater for passenger needs far better in terms of CRM and a whole host of other services. Qatar Airways recently announced introduction of high-speed broadband in partnership with Inmarsat (GX Aviation). Please tell us more about this partnership. Qatar Airways and Inmarsat have been working together since the inception of the airline – Qatar Airways uses Inmarsat’s satellite technology for safety services on all of its wide-body aircraft and already operates cabin connectivity using Inmarsat’s SwiftBroadband service on many of its aircraft. From our close working relationship, Qatar Airways identified a need to enhance the passenger connectivity in a way that existing providers simply couldn’t meet, QR has installed various connectivity solutions on its aircraft previously. An airline such as Qatar Airways has very strong insistence on 5 star service and prides itself on putting passengers at the focus of everything they do – so the Inmarsat GX aviation technology with assured levels of performance was the perfect fit. We worked together for many months to define the requirements and expectations and we are now pleased to have their commitment on the B777 and A350 fleet, initially. This is significant as it underlines Qatar Airways trust in Inmarsat to deliver a service in line with their very high levels of service and delivery – something Inmarsat has always taken great pride in. Any other major deals in the offing in the region? Yes. But none that can be disclosed at this point. With cost factor being a restricting element in the take up of the services by passengers, how are you encouraging the airlines to make it more cost-effective to passengers? It is not simply the cost that may turn passengers off, it is also the mechanism of payment that has proved difficult. Credit card transactions on aircraft are frequently cumbersome and prove a significant barrier to increasing uptake. Inmarsat has been working on, and is making available, multiple ways of authentication to overcome these hurdles. This means passengers can use multiple ways of getting online without traditional payment methods – much more aligned to the ways in which we connect and authenticate on the ground. Simplifying the ‘login’ pages and processes is key to getting higher uptake. Of course, cost is of concern and there are multiple models that are available to tackle this – but these are fairly sensitive and do vary airline by airline, depending again on their philosophy and on how they wish to offer service to passengers in different classes of travel. What we can confidently say is that the cost of data is reducing and Inmarsat’s GX represents extremely high value in terms of providing the highest quality, assured service levels with keen pricing. The low-cost airlines are another big market for these services. How do you see them taking up the products you offer? The LCC community are looking at this and implementing it. As above, the models do require tweaking as they are typically less brand sensitive and, therefore, open to alternative models that may incorporate third party involvement. Other than passengers using the service, what are the key areas in which your solutions can be used by airlines to increase efficiency and safety? Passengers are indeed one of the main stakeholders of this service. Cabin crew are another – offering a stable connection allows significant improvement in many aspects of crew performance – not only in CRM (customer care, changing gate information, connecting flights etc) but perhaps more importantly with telemedicine applications where crew can connect to healthcare experts on the ground and access real-time video diagnosis and support in cases of in- flight sickness where the airline may otherwise elect to divert the aircraft, saving very significant sums of money. Connecting the aircraft to the airline network enables the most valuable assets (the aircraft and crew) to always be connected to monitor all manner of elements. For technical and operational staff, connected peripherals such as engine data, airframe health, fuel levels etc can lead to efficiencies that, frankly, the industry has not yet properly explored. Once again, Inmarsat is conducting significant research to see how this can be realised both in terms of cost savings and service enhancements What is your vision for the next five years? The vision for the next five years is to get the region’s airlines connected – to provide the choice for passengers if they want to connect, or not. To allow passengers to connect reliably to a service that doesn’t cut in or cut out – to provide an experience that passengers don’t see a need to complain about, to have airline partners who want to do more. Whether we like it or not, the connected revolution is well under way and generations to come demand the basic right to be connected regardless of being on the land, sea or in the air. I would like to see the region’s airlines taking Inmarsat’s services – but for now I will be pleased to watch Qatar Airways rolling out a connectivity service that is the envy of the world. - TradeArabia News Service   Tags: Qatar Airways | Inmarsat | Connectivity | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Oman Hotels to invest $258m in 10 new projects Dadabhai sets stage for destination weddings in Bahrain GTA ME signs exclusive collaboration with Geneva Tourism India’s Vistara receives its first A320neo Emirates in bid to improve traveller experience at DXB Oman Air reintroduces signature Iftar boxes for Ramadan Jean Boulle unveils world's first diamond coated aircraft Ramadan delights at Kempinski Hotel Ajman DXB to showcase artwork by adults with special needs Ramadan room offerings at Oryx Hotel TDIC unveils new Lagoons Sales Centre Six weeks of Dubai Summer Surprises from July 1 Dukes Dubai hotel welcomes new GM Texas de Brazil opens in Riyadh Swiss-Belhotel to operate two new hotels in Kuwait Airbus extends partnership for military satellite communications New direct flights from ME to key Turkey destinations Al Maha Arjaan by Rotana completes $13.6m renovation UAE citizens don't need pre-entry visa for Argentina MEA hotels report positive results in April Anantara Hotels unveils exciting offers for Ramadan Singapore Tourism concludes Middle East roadshow Emirates offers special fares from Kuwait Oman Air vows to back SMEs TDIC releases rehabilitated turtles at Saadiyat Beach New cluster sales director for Rotana Abu Dhabi hotels Azkadenya opens first branch in Saudi Arabia Passengers evacuated off plane from Dubai to Heathrow Cathay Pacific to axe 600 jobs in major restructuring WTM on target for record-breaking year of business deals Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The Ryanair boss said that "you can not have Britain be seen to leave the EU and not suffer". He said British people are deluding themselves because they are only talking to themselves and reading UK newspapers with a constant diet of "utter rubbish"  about how they will negotiate a great deal for Britain.  Mr O'Leary said the UK is taking themselves out of the Open Skies arrangements with the EU. After March 2019 there could be a period where there are no flights to the UK and people here might have to go back to "using the boats", he stated.  On the airline's performance, Mr O'Leary said Ryanair expects to fly 130 million passengers in the year to March 2018 up from 120 million the previous year. Mr O'Leary also told today's press conference that he believes Aer Lingus owner International Airlines Group would have to be broken up in the event of a hard Brexit. Ryanair boss says airline does not want to buy Alitalia Ryanair is ready to deploy up to 30 planes in Italy to replace capacity lost if Alitalia collapses or is restructured but does not want to buy the struggling Italian carrier, chief executive Michael O'Leary said yesterday. Ryanair's view mirrors the stance of rival EasyJet and Aer Lingus owner International Airlines Group. They have both said they are interested in replacing Alitalia capacity but say they do not want to buy the airline.  Alitalia has filed for bankruptcy protection and a commissioner was appointed to review its future and determine whether it can continue under a new business model.  The commissioner, Luigi Gubitosi, has said that Alitalia's long-haul traffic is doing well and that selling the airline in one block would be the preferred option.  Asked at a Brussels news conference whether Ryanair would be interested in buying Alitalia, O'Leary replied with an unequivocal "no". He added that his company had submitted an expression of interest only because it wants to "participate in the process".  Ryanair is instead preparing to deploy up to 20 aircraft initially over a two-week period this summer if Alitalia cuts capacity significantly.  "We've written to the Italian government and we've said 'look, if something untoward happens, don't worry, we will step into the breach'," O'Leary said.  The planes will be found by tweaking schedules and extending leases, he said, adding that the potential deployment could increase up to 30 planes over the next 12 months.  Ryanair might take "a couple of additional deliveries" from Boeing over the next 18 months, the airline's CEO said.  Last week EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall said that she had no interest in buying Alitalia, adding to rejections from the heads of IAG, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Norwegian Air Shuttle.  Any short-haul capacity cut by Alitalia would lead to "opportunities for EasyJet," she told analysts after the airline reported first-half results. Rome and northern Italy would be of particular interest to EasyJet, she added. Willie Walsh, head of IAG - which also owns Iberia, Vueling and British Airways - said this month that the group's airlines, in particular Vueling, could speed its growth in Italy, depending on what happened with Alitalia.  Italy is one of Europe's largest travel markets and a big tourist destination, but short-haul routes are dominated by low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet.  Ryanair now has a 28% share of capacity from Italy to western Europe compared to 12% for EasyJet.

Comment May 24, 2017 Economics A Tale of Two Tax Plans What Trump and Ryan Get Wrong By Alex Raskolnikov About the Author: My FA Anthologies ALEX RASKOLNIKOV is Wilbur H. Friedman Professor of Tax Law at Columbia Law School.   Read more by Alex Raskolnikov Facebook Twitter Email My FA Saved Articles Print Republicans have long panned the U.S. tax system; now they have a plan to change it. In fact, two plans. The first comes from Congress, the second from the White House. The congressional “Better Way” plan, championed by Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, and Kevin Brady, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, would create a business tax system that has never existed anywhere in the world. The White House plan would enact a massive tax cut, mostly for the wealthy. Each plan aims to reform both the individual and the business parts of the U.S. tax system. But although the two plans offer similar rate cuts for individuals, the proposed reforms are very different on the business side. The White House simply wants to slash taxes for all businesses. The Ryan-Brady plan would convert the current corporate income tax into a border-adjusted cash-flow tax—a tax on consumption rather than on income. Tensions over this idea among Republicans and businesses are running high. Exporters, such as Boeing and GE, have lined up behind it, whereas retailers and importers, such as Target and Walmart, are lobbying hard to stop it in its tracks. The White House tax plan threatens to explode the national debt and, as a result, impede economic growth. Although no official economic estimate of either plan is yet available, it is clear that the White House proposal threatens to explode the national debt and, as a result, impede economic growth. The Better Way plan is both more promising and more responsible than the White House’s outline. Still, the Ryan-Brady proposal would likely increase the national debt, disrupt global trade, harm some American companies and benefit others, cause financial problems abroad by dramatically raising the value of the U.S. dollar, and lead to pervasive and costly uncertainty. In the end, the Better Way plan is too disruptive and too risky for the United States to adopt. Nonetheless, it points tax reformers Get the best of Foreign Affairs delivered to you every day.

news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching video Eclipse 2017 news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching video Eclipse 2017 news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching video Eclipse 2017 Space.com Spaceflight Meet 'The Mars Generation': In Documentary, It's Red Planet or Bust By Elizabeth Howell, Space.com Contributor | May 23, 2017 02:23pm ET MORE A new featurette for the Netflix original documentary "The Mars Generation" — which explores the potential for today's teenagers to go to Mars in 20 years if humanity plays its cards right — highlights the legacy of Apollo in setting up aspirations for Mars. Clips from a famous John F. Kennedy speech in 1962 play over video of astronauts walking on the moon. "Many years ago, the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said, 'Because it is there,'" Kennedy said in the speech. "Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there." [Photos: Visions of Future Space Habitats & Artificial Ecosystems] Poster for "The Mars Generation," a new Netflix original documentary. Credit: Netflix Interspersed with that speech, former NASA astronaut Don Thomas and science communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson describe the trajectory of America's space program. You can watch the clip online here. "I've always been a closet space nerd, and I thought I knew a lot about space," the film's director, Michael Barnett, told Space.com. He is an Emmy-award winning filmmaker who has covered topics ranging from superheroes to American writer and intellectual Gore Vidal. Barnett's initial plan was to do a 3- to 5-minute web series about Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama, but upon visiting and interacting with the class of teenagers, he realized there was more to say about the future of space exploration, he said. "What I thought I knew about space was annihilated by their knowledge," Barnett said, adding that watching the campers interact with the experiments and discuss space history was inspiring. "They interpreted it and processed it differently, and they were unified in their frustrations of NASA and the bureaucracy of what's held us up in exploration." Criticizing NASA's path Barnett said he tried to be as ambitious as possible in the 1-hour, 40-minute documentary, which begins and ends with Space Camp, but also interweaves a brief history of space exploration — focusing on items the general public may not know, he said. For example, when talking about the early days of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, Barnett highlights that a pioneer of the U.S. rocketry program — Wernher von Braun — was a Nazi brought to the United States after the Second World War.  Once he arrived, Von Braun became an advocate for American spaceflight, talking about the future of space on the Disney Channel while designing several rockets for NASA, including the Saturn V rocket that brought astronauts to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s. [NASA's Mighty Saturn V Moon Rocket Explained (Infographic)] Apollo reached a high-water mark in 1969 when it landed the first astronauts on the moon, but, as the film shows, President Richard Nixon quickly shut down the program, because the U.S. public was more concerned about issues on Earth. (Clips from the documentary show scenes from the Vietnam War and riots, which are frequently cited by space historians as some of the pressing issues detracting attention from the space program.) "We had the staff in place and Saturn V could have got[ten] us there [to Mars]," Barnett said. "Then Nixon came in and decided he wanted to shut it down. He wanted to stop JFK's [President John F. Kennedy's] legacy and go in a different direction." After that, the documentary heavily criticizes the space shuttle program. Time magazine editor-at-large Jeffrey Kluger, co-author of the book "Apollo 13" (Mariner Books, 2006), is among the people in the documentary who say the shuttle program brought people into space merely to repeatedly circle the Earth, rather than pushing spaceflight forward.  Space advocate and Planetary Society CEO Bill Nye points out that the shuttle program was completed in 2011, with no other rocket designed to immediately succeed the shuttle. While the documentary does mention that SpaceX and Boeing have plans to launch humans into space from American soil, the film focuses on the fact that the Russians are the only ticket into space for NASA right now. "We don't have a ship that takes humans to space right now," Barnett told Space.com, adding that working with the Russians can be a "geopolitical nightmare." He added, "Ninety percent of the public thinks that NASA is closed. So it's a good film for this time to show that NASA is more important than ever." Mars aspirations The documentary also weaves in extensive discussion about going to Mars, saying that Von Braun envisioned it happening in the early 1980s. While that timeline may sound absurd today, experts say that in the context of the quickly moving Apollo program, a 1981 deadline seemed reasonable in 1969, when the moon program had brought humans to the lunar surface in less than a decade. [How Living on Mars Could Challenge Colonists (Infographic)] The film makes little mention of ongoing work at the International Space Station to study the effects of space on the human body, which NASA says is one crucial step needed before undertaking a mission to Mars. The film similarly fails to mention other research into Mars habitats. But the documentary does show one of the technological pieces for Mars missions coming together: Blue Origin's and SpaceX's self-landing rockets, which the documentary portrays as crucial steps in lowering the cost of space exploration. Meanwhile, footage from Space Camp shows the students working through several problems associated with space exploration, including launching and landing rockets, constructing heat shields and making robots to explore the Martian surface. The students in the film say they feel they could be the Mars generation, the first to explore the Red Planet in person, but add that they're concerned NASA's pace is too slow for them to get to Mars by the 2030s. "Mars is in the collective consciousness right now," Barnett said, but added that the program has several obstacles to overcome first, including putting together the technology and developing the political will. The Mars Generation is available now on Netflix in both the United States and Canada. (For other countries that carry Netflix, please verify on your local network.)

Students took the opportunity last week to harvest their produce, which included radishes, herbs, spices, tomatoes and other items. The students were helped throughout the year by the Clarendon Couty Master Gardeners and Marie Land. For the children of Manning Early Childhood Center’s first-grade classes, May 17 was the culmination of a year-long exercise. That was the day the students finally got to harvest the vegetables they had planted in their garden behind the school earlier in the year. Enterprise Learning Coach Kelli Bellant said that grants awarded to the school from vendors like Apple, Target, Lowe’s and Farm-to-School totaled more than $15,000 and allowed for the building and cultivation of raised garden beds, utilizing produce for their wellness program. Students grew tomatoes, herbs, radishes, flowers, spices and other items in accordance with the school’s wellness program, which the school operates year-round. “I am a 220 day employee, so I will be here at the school to tend to the gardens during the week,” said Bellant of the summer care of the garden. “Over the summer, we invite parents to the school, to harvest the crop and to take home the harvested fruit and vegetables for their kids.” Bellant said that the wellness program promotes year-round healthy eating habits and wellness education to MECC students. Through its partnership with organizations such as Clemson and the Future Farmers of America, the program affords kids opportunities to experience tasting experiments with the harvested fruits and vegetables. “Bonnie Plants of Manning has donated all the plants for the school’s raised garden beds,” Bellant said. “We have 17 raised beds and nine indoor hydroponic garden beds. And they contain assorted fruits and vegetables for the students to eat.” “We have planted a fall garden followed by a spring garden that runs throughout the summer.” Manning High School’s FFA students constructed the garden beds. The structural, raised garden beds help school gardening programs to thrive. The materials were purchased with the grants awarded to the wellness program, Bellant said. The plants themselves were donated by Bonnie Plants, along with grants from the Medical University of South Carolina and Boeing. “I had to think of a way to fund the garden program, so after applying for the grants that we were accepted for, the next venture was to find a way to build the garden beds,” Bellant said. “After purchasing all the materials with our grant money, we partnered with Future Farmers of America, and they built the beds and brought them to the school. They came over and filled the beds with soil then our students took over.” Bellant said that the Master Gardeners of Clarendon County and Marie Land have been a big help. Clemson Extension has helped but the kids are the ones who maintain the gardens. “We have recently received another grant from Lowe’s for $4,000 to replace our shed that was damaged during the floods,” she said. “Target has funded us to go to Adventure in Columbia at which our students will take advantage of their Farm-to-Table program. “Farming is a big part of our community and our hope is that the students will take gardening home with them,” Bellant said. “We want students to use their produce as an extra source of food but moreover to use the program as a tool to learn about nutrition.” Land said she took some of the produce home, washed them and prepared a salad, a strawberry cake and a tea for the children. “Some of them ate radishes, but some of them didn’t really like them,” she said.

By 2025, industrial robots are expected to perform 25 percent of tasks such as assembly, packaging, and material handling. "Instead of these old factories that are very laborious and have a lot of big machinery, manufacturing is going to look more like software, and have machines that are running off of digital files," said Jonathan Schwartz of Voodoo Manufacturing, a 3-D printing company in Brooklyn, New York. Schwartz and fellow co-founder Max Friefeld rely on 160 3-D printers to manufacture nearly 50 different projects, from key chains to T-Rex shower heads, all at once.

"3-D printing used to be 10 units, 20 unit prototypes. Now we do thousands for every order." The Rebirth of Manufacturing Bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. is a top priority for President Donald Trump, who has made "Buy American, Hire American" a key element in his pro-business agenda. However, the manufacturing industry is no longer what it used to be. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 4.9 million manufacturing jobs have disappeared in the past 20 years — in part because of increased automation. Industry executives say today's manufacturing is about collaboration with innovation, and learning to work hand in hand with robots. Helping to take Voodoo to the next level of a modern-day factory is Jim Allen, director of manufacturing. "I think they're gonna adapt," he said of traditional manufacturing businesses. "There are examples of companies that have been tool and die, automotive, and other industries where [now] they're using robotics." Robots Create Jobs Voodoo isn't the only manufacturing company taking the leap into 3-D printing. Big brands such as GE, Adidas, Boeing, Ford, Nike, Hasbro, and Hershey's are also integrating the technology into their products. The fear of robots replacing humans in the manufacturing industry is a growing concern for millions of unemployed Americans. But Allen says there is a silver lining that comes with technological advances. "Because of automation, we're increasing our productivity. We're able to get more products out there at a lower cost at higher quality. Being able to do that increases demand, increased demand creates more jobs — so it's a self-fulfilling cycle of creating more jobs," said Allen. "We have to be competitive with the other processes and other countries. And that enables us to create more jobs."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman El Al Israel Airlines Presented Today its Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2017 LOD, Israel, May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- El Al Israel Airlines (TASE: ELAL) announced today that operating revenues in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to approx. USD 418 million, compared to approx. USD 396 million in the first quarter of the previous year, indicating a growth of about 5.3%. The number of flight segments in the first quarter of 2017 increased by approx. 7.1% compared to the first quarter of the previous year; ASK-Available seat kilometer increased by approx. 1.3%; the Company's activity in terms of RPK (revenue-passenger-kilometers) increased by approx. 5.1%. Passenger Load Factor stood at approx. 83.7%, an increase of about 4% compared to the first quarter of the previous year. Average total income per RPK (Yield) increased by about 0.5% compared to the first quarter of the last year. El Al market share at Ben Gurion Airport stood at approx. 32.8%. during this quarter, the number of passengers carried by the Company increased by about 7%, whereas overall passenger traffic at Ben Gurion Airport rose by approx. 17%. Loss before taxes in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to approx. USD 39 million, compared to a loss before taxes of approx. USD 34 million in the first quarter of the previous year. Net loss in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to approx. USD 30 million, compared to a net loss of approx. USD 21 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase is mainly due to an increase in payroll costs (resulting mostly from the timing of one-time bonuses for 2016 and the shekel appreciation) and a rise in jet-fuel costs. Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to approx. USD 77 million compared to approx. USD 72 million in the first quarter of last year. EBITDA amounted to approx. USD 10 million, compared to approx. USD 11 million in the first quarter of last year. The Company's cash balances as of March 31, 2017 totaled approx. USD 228 million. David Maimon, El Al's CEO: "The Company presented impressive operating results for the first quarter, better than those of the first quarter of last year, and recorded a growth of about 5.3% in revenues, despite intensifying competition and expansion of Ben Gurion Airport's Open Sky Policy. The number of passengers carried by the Company rose by about 7%, the Company's seat availability grew by about 1.3%, its operations increased by about 5%, passenger load factor grew by approx. 4% to 83.7%, which is unusually high, particularly in a weak seasonal quarter. As part of the Company's route expansion strategy, we are preparing to launch the new route to Miami in early November this year. The Frequent Flyer Club, both in Israel and overseas, and in particular the FLYCARD credit card, serve as a significant growth engine, which is translated into an impressive expansion trend. The number of credit card holders currently stands at about 220 thousand. The number of EL AL's Frequent Flyer Club members also continued to grow, reaching more than 1.8 million members. The Company is in the final preparations for receiving of the Dreamliner aircrafts, the first of which is expected to arrive this August. These airplanes will provide our customers with ultimate comfort, customer experience and quality service, and will enhance the Company's ability to continue to successfully cope with market conditions in the face of intensifying competition." Dganit Palti, El Al's CFO, stated: "In the first quarter, the Company recorded an impressive growth in revenues and gross profit, along with a decline in operating profit, due to an increase in payroll costs, which resulted from the shekel appreciation compared to the dollar and the timing of bonus payments for the year 2016. In addition, fuel expenses increased as a result of a price increase which was partially offset by a positive effect of hedging transactions. The Company's operation generated positive cash flow from operating activities of approx. USD 77 million and with a cash balance of approx. USD 228 Million dollar. During the first quarter, the Company began making advance payments for the Dreamliner aircrafts, as part of its Aircraft Acquisition Program, totaling approx. USD 54 million dollar, part of which was financed by bank loans. The cash balances of the Company's reserve fund and its high cash flow from operating activities provide a solid foundation for investment promotion within the framework of the Company's long-term strategic plan."   Profit and Loss Results for the Three Month-Period Ended on March 31: 2017 2016 Change Operating revenues 418 396 5% Operating expenses (377) (362) 4% Gross profit 41 34 19% EBITDA 10 11 (6%) Loss before taxes on income (39) (34) 16% Loss for the period (30) (21) 40%   1.     Operating revenues – operating revenues increased in the reported period by approx. USD 21.2 million (about 5.3%) compared to the first quarter of 2016, whereas revenue from passengers increased by approx. 8.0%. Revenues were mainly affected by the rise in the number of passengers carried by the Company and in Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPK), mostly as a result of an increase in load factor and also somewhat due to the increase in Available Seat Kilometer (ASK). In addition, an increase of 0.5% occurred in the Company's passenger yield per kilometer. The Company's cargo revenues decreased by approx. 16.1%, as a result of a drop in Revenue Ton Kilometer (RTK) flown and in yield per ton-kilometer. 2.     Operating expenses – operating expenses increased in the reported period by approx. USD 14.7 million (about 4.1%) compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase mainly resulted from an increase in the Company's payroll expenses due to several factors, of which the main of them are: employee bonuses approved by the Company's competent organs in April 2017, for the year 2016, and recognized as expenses in the financial statements in the first quarter of 2017; the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar, as well as an increase in employee wages due to wage increases pursuant to the Company's wage agreements, including agreements signed with the pilot representatives, in December 2016 and February 2017. An additional factor for the increase in the Company's operating expenses is the growth in jet fuel expenses and depreciation expenses. The operating expenses increase was partially offset by the decline in ad hoc leasees of passenger and cargo aircrafts, compared to the first quarter of the previous year. It should be noted that in the current quarter, the operating expenses were also affected, among others, by disruptions in staffing of the company's flights. However, compared to the same quarter last year, this effect was smaller. 3.     Jet Fuel Expenses – the Company's jet fuel expenses, including hedging impact, rose by approx. USD 7.2 million (about 8.6%) compared to the corresponding expenditure in the first quarter of 2016, as a result of an increase in the price of jet fuel, which was offset in part by the impact of jet fuel hedging transactions and the decline in flight hours. 2017 2016 Change In USD millions Jet fuel expenses for the period (before hedging impact) 91.5 63.3 28.2 Impact of jet fuel hedging transactions on profit and loss (1.0) 20.0 (21.0) Total jet fuel expenses (including hedging impact) 90.5 83.3 7.2   4.     Selling Expenses – selling expenses increased by approx. 11%, partially due to an increase in payroll expenses as a result of wage increases under the employment agreement and the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar, and partially due to higher distribution expenses, inter alia, as a result of the growth in the number of sales transaction. 5.     General and Administrative Expenses - general and administrative expenses rose by approx. 29% compared to first quarter of the previous year. Most of the increase is attributable to the increase in payroll expenses, mainly due to the bonuses paid to employees and officers for the year 2016, which, as mentioned above, were approved by the Company's competent organs in April 2017. In addition, payroll expenses were affected by the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar, as well as by wage increases pursuant to the employment agreement. The rise in general and administrative expenses resulted also from an increase in professional services expenses. 6.     Financing Expenses - financing expenses amounted to approx. USD 5.0 million, compared to approx. USD 4.9 million in the first quarter of the previous year. 7.     Loss before taxes – loss before taxes in the reported period amounted to approx. USD 38.8 million, compared to a loss before taxes of approx. USD 33.5 million in the first quarter of the previous year. 8.     Tax Benefit – the tax benefit in the reported period amounted to approx. USD 8.8 million, compared to approx. USD 12.1 million in the first quarter of the previous year. The tax benefit in the first quarter of the previous year included an amount of approx. USD 3.8 million, as a result of the drop in the corporate tax rate, from 26.5% to 25%, commencing January 1, 2016. 9.     Loss for the Period – loss after taxes in the reported period totaled approx. USD 30 million, constituting about 7.2% of the turnover, compared to a loss after taxes of approx. USD 21.4 million, constituting about 5.4% of the turnover. Balance Sheet Data as of March 31, 2017: 1.      Current Assets - amounted to approx. USD 493.9 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 55.7 million compared to December 31, 2016. This growth resulted mostly from an increase in cash balances, compared to the cash balances at the end of 2016, and from a seasonal increase in Trade receivables balance, which were partially offset by a decrease in the Derivatives Financial Instruments item. 2.      Current Liabilities - amounted to approx. USD 887.2 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 83.9 million compared to December 31, 2016. This growth arises from a seasonal increase in unearned revenues from the sale of flight tickets, which was partially offset by a decrease in short-time borrowings and current maturities, mainly as a result of a refinancing agreement with a local bank. 3.      Working Capital – the Company has a working capital deficit of approx. USD 393.3 million compared to a deficit of approx. USD 365.1 dollar as of December 31, 2016. It shall be noted that a substantial part of the working capital deficit does not reflect short-term cash flows, as explained below. The Company's current ratio as of March 31, 2017 increased to approx. 55.7%, compared to 54.6% as of December 31, 2016. The working capital deficit as of March 31, 2017 consists of two substantial components which are included in the Company's Current Liabilities items and are characterized by current business cycle; however, the Company is not required to use cash-flow sources in the short term in order to repay these components: unearned revenues from the sale of flight tickets and from the Frequent Flyer Club, to be settled by providing future flight services, and liabilities to employees for vacation, which are expected to be paid over several years but classified as a short-term liability in accordance with accounting principles. Furthermore, current liabilities include loans for financing advance payments for the 787 aircrafts, whose source of repayment is based on a long-term financing provided upon receipt of these aircrafts. These amounts total approx. USD 497 million. 4.      Non-Current Assets – amounted to approx. USD 1,314.0 million, indicating an increase of approx. USD 32.1 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2016, mainly as a result of advance payments made for the 787 Boeing aircrafts acquisition, less current depreciation. 5.      Non-Current Liabilities - totaled approx. USD 674.7 million, indicating an increase of approx. USD 41.9 million, compared to their balance as of December 31, 2016. This increase is mainly attributable to the increase in the loan balance (see refinancing agreement above), which was partially offset by the decrease in deferred tax liabilities, mostly due to the loss before taxes for the period. 6.      Equity – amounted to approx. USD 246.0 million. The decrease of approx. USD 38.1 million, compared to equity as of December 31, 2016, mainly resulted from the loss for the period and the impact of the Company's hedging instruments on the capital reserve , in a negative, net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 9.2 million.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman El Al Israel Airlines Presented Today its Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2017 LOD, Israel, May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — El Al Israel Airlines (TASE: ELAL) announced today that operating revenues in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to approx. USD 418 million, compared to approx. USD 396 million in the first quarter of the previous year, indicating a growth of about 5.3%. The number of flight segments in the first quarter of 2017 increased by approx. 7.1% compared to the first quarter of the previous year; ASK-Available seat kilometer increased by approx. 1.3%; the Company’s activity in terms of RPK (revenue-passenger-kilometers) increased by approx. 5.1%. Passenger Load Factor stood at approx. 83.7%, an increase of about 4% compared to the first quarter of the previous year. Average total income per RPK (Yield) increased by about 0.5% compared to the first quarter of the last year. El Al market share at Ben Gurion Airport stood at approx. 32.8%. during this quarter, the number of passengers carried by the Company increased by about 7%, whereas overall passenger traffic at Ben Gurion Airport rose by approx. 17%. Loss before taxes in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to approx. USD 39 million, compared to a loss before taxes of approx. USD 34 million in the first quarter of the previous year. Net loss in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to approx. USD 30 million, compared to a net loss of approx. USD 21 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase is mainly due to an increase in payroll costs (resulting mostly from the timing of one-time bonuses for 2016 and the shekel appreciation) and a rise in jet-fuel costs. Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to approx. USD 77 million compared to approx. USD 72 million in the first quarter of last year. EBITDA amounted to approx. USD 10 million, compared to approx. USD 11 million in the first quarter of last year. The Company’s cash balances as of March 31, 2017 totaled approx. USD 228 million. David Maimon, El Al’s CEO: „The Company presented impressive operating results for the first quarter, better than those of the first quarter of last year, and recorded a growth of about 5.3% in revenues, despite intensifying competition and expansion of Ben Gurion Airport’s Open Sky Policy. The number of passengers carried by the Company rose by about 7%, the Company’s seat availability grew by about 1.3%, its operations increased by about 5%, passenger load factor grew by approx. 4% to 83.7%, which is unusually high, particularly in a weak seasonal quarter. As part of the Company’s route expansion strategy, we are preparing to launch the new route to Miami in early November this year. The Frequent Flyer Club, both in Israel and overseas, and in particular the FLYCARD credit card, serve as a significant growth engine, which is translated into an impressive expansion trend. The number of credit card holders currently stands at about 220 thousand. The number of EL AL’s Frequent Flyer Club members also continued to grow, reaching more than 1.8 million members. The Company is in the final preparations for receiving of the Dreamliner aircrafts, the first of which is expected to arrive this August. These airplanes will provide our customers with ultimate comfort, customer experience and quality service, and will enhance the Company’s ability to continue to successfully cope with market conditions in the face of intensifying competition.” Dganit Palti, El Al’s CFO, stated: „In the first quarter, the Company recorded an impressive growth in revenues and gross profit, along with a decline in operating profit, due to an increase in payroll costs, which resulted from the shekel appreciation compared to the dollar and the timing of bonus payments for the year 2016. In addition, fuel expenses increased as a result of a price increase which was partially offset by a positive effect of hedging transactions. The Company’s operation generated positive cash flow from operating activities of approx. USD 77 million and with a cash balance of approx. USD 228 Million dollar. During the first quarter, the Company began making advance payments for the Dreamliner aircrafts, as part of its Aircraft Acquisition Program, totaling approx. USD 54 million dollar, part of which was financed by bank loans. The cash balances of the Company’s reserve fund and its high cash flow from operating activities provide a solid foundation for investment promotion within the framework of the Company’s long-term strategic plan.” Profit and Loss Results for the Three Month-Period Ended on March 31: 2017 2016 Change Operating revenues 418 396 5% Operating expenses (377) (362) 4% Gross profit 41 34 19% EBITDA 10 11 (6%) Loss before taxes on income (39) (34) 16% Loss for the period (30) (21) 40% 1.     Operating revenues – operating revenues increased in the reported period by approx. USD 21.2 million (about 5.3%) compared to the first quarter of 2016, whereas revenue from passengers increased by approx. 8.0%. Revenues were mainly affected by the rise in the number of passengers carried by the Company and in Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPK), mostly as a result of an increase in load factor and also somewhat due to the increase in Available Seat Kilometer (ASK). In addition, an increase of 0.5% occurred in the Company’s passenger yield per kilometer. The Company’s cargo revenues decreased by approx. 16.1%, as a result of a drop in Revenue Ton Kilometer (RTK) flown and in yield per ton-kilometer. 2.     Operating expenses – operating expenses increased in the reported period by approx. USD 14.7 million (about 4.1%) compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase mainly resulted from an increase in the Company’s payroll expenses due to several factors, of which the main of them are: employee bonuses approved by the Company’s competent organs in April 2017, for the year 2016, and recognized as expenses in the financial statements in the first quarter of 2017; the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar, as well as an increase in employee wages due to wage increases pursuant to the Company’s wage agreements, including agreements signed with the pilot representatives, in December 2016 and February 2017. An additional factor for the increase in the Company’s operating expenses is the growth in jet fuel expenses and depreciation expenses. The operating expenses increase was partially offset by the decline in ad hoc leasees of passenger and cargo aircrafts, compared to the first quarter of the previous year. It should be noted that in the current quarter, the operating expenses were also affected, among others, by disruptions in staffing of the company’s flights. However, compared to the same quarter last year, this effect was smaller. 3.     Jet Fuel Expenses – the Company’s jet fuel expenses, including hedging impact, rose by approx. USD 7.2 million (about 8.6%) compared to the corresponding expenditure in the first quarter of 2016, as a result of an increase in the price of jet fuel, which was offset in part by the impact of jet fuel hedging transactions and the decline in flight hours. 2017 2016 Change In USD millions Jet fuel expenses for the period (before hedging impact) 91.5 63.3 28.2 Impact of jet fuel hedging transactions on profit and loss (1.0) 20.0 (21.0) Total jet fuel expenses (including hedging impact) 90.5 83.3 7.2 4.     Selling Expenses – selling expenses increased by approx. 11%, partially due to an increase in payroll expenses as a result of wage increases under the employment agreement and the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar, and partially due to higher distribution expenses, inter alia, as a result of the growth in the number of sales transaction. 5.     General and Administrative Expenses – general and administrative expenses rose by approx. 29% compared to first quarter of the previous year. Most of the increase is attributable to the increase in payroll expenses, mainly due to the bonuses paid to employees and officers for the year 2016, which, as mentioned above, were approved by the Company’s competent organs in April 2017. In addition, payroll expenses were affected by the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar, as well as by wage increases pursuant to the employment agreement. The rise in general and administrative expenses resulted also from an increase in professional services expenses. 6.     Financing Expenses – financing expenses amounted to approx. USD 5.0 million, compared to approx. USD 4.9 million in the first quarter of the previous year. 7.     Loss before taxes – loss before taxes in the reported period amounted to approx. USD 38.8 million, compared to a loss before taxes of approx. USD 33.5 million in the first quarter of the previous year. 8.     Tax Benefit – the tax benefit in the reported period amounted to approx. USD 8.8 million, compared to approx. USD 12.1 million in the first quarter of the previous year. The tax benefit in the first quarter of the previous year included an amount of approx. USD 3.8 million, as a result of the drop in the corporate tax rate, from 26.5% to 25%, commencing January 1, 2016. 9.     Loss for the Period – loss after taxes in the reported period totaled approx. USD 30 million, constituting about 7.2% of the turnover, compared to a loss after taxes of approx. USD 21.4 million, constituting about 5.4% of the turnover. Balance Sheet Data as of March 31, 2017: 1.      Current Assets – amounted to approx. USD 493.9 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 55.7 million compared to December 31, 2016. This growth resulted mostly from an increase in cash balances, compared to the cash balances at the end of 2016, and from a seasonal increase in Trade receivables balance, which were partially offset by a decrease in the Derivatives Financial Instruments item. 2.      Current Liabilities – amounted to approx. USD 887.2 million, reflecting a growth of approx. USD 83.9 million compared to December 31, 2016. This growth arises from a seasonal increase in unearned revenues from the sale of flight tickets, which was partially offset by a decrease in short-time borrowings and current maturities, mainly as a result of a refinancing agreement with a local bank. 3.      Working Capital – the Company has a working capital deficit of approx. USD 393.3 million compared to a deficit of approx. USD 365.1 dollar as of December 31, 2016. It shall be noted that a substantial part of the working capital deficit does not reflect short-term cash flows, as explained below. The Company’s current ratio as of March 31, 2017 increased to approx. 55.7%, compared to 54.6% as of December 31, 2016. The working capital deficit as of March 31, 2017 consists of two substantial components which are included in the Company’s Current Liabilities items and are characterized by current business cycle; however, the Company is not required to use cash-flow sources in the short term in order to repay these components: unearned revenues from the sale of flight tickets and from the Frequent Flyer Club, to be settled by providing future flight services, and liabilities to employees for vacation, which are expected to be paid over several years but classified as a short-term liability in accordance with accounting principles. Furthermore, current liabilities include loans for financing advance payments for the 787 aircrafts, whose source of repayment is based on a long-term financing provided upon receipt of these aircrafts. These amounts total approx. USD 497 million. 4.      Non-Current Assets – amounted to approx. USD 1,314.0 million, indicating an increase of approx. USD 32.1 million compared to their balance as of December 31, 2016, mainly as a result of advance payments made for the 787 Boeing aircrafts acquisition, less current depreciation. 5.      Non-Current Liabilities – totaled approx. USD 674.7 million, indicating an increase of approx. USD 41.9 million, compared to their balance as of December 31, 2016. This increase is mainly attributable to the increase in the loan balance (see refinancing agreement above), which was partially offset by the decrease in deferred tax liabilities, mostly due to the loss before taxes for the period. 6.      Equity – amounted to approx. USD 246.0 million. The decrease of approx. USD 38.1 million, compared to equity as of December 31, 2016, mainly resulted from the loss for the period and the impact of the Company’s hedging instruments on the capital reserve , in a negative, net-of-tax amount of approx. USD 9.2 million.
