Emirates airline to only fly Airbus A380s, Boeing 777s after retiring older planes Emirates is the largest customer for the Airbus A380. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Emirates has become the first airline in the world to only operate Airbus A380 superjumbos and long-range Boeing 777s in its passenger fleet. The Middle East carrier recently retired its last remaining Airbus A330 and A340 planes from active service. Emirates retired its last A330, registered A6-EAK after 14 years of service. The plane flew more than 60,000 hours and 45 million kilometres during that time. Emirates' A380s and 777s are relatively new planes with similar interiors, both feature a 3-4-3 layout in economy class. This means passengers on the narrower 777s get one inch (2.54 centimetres) less width for their seats. Seat pitch (legroom) varies from 32 inches to 34 inches on both aircraft types, depending on the location of the seat. See: Airline review - Emirates A380 economy class The airline recently announced it would start flying the world's shortest A380 route from December, a 379-kilometre hop from Dubai to Doha, Qatar. The A380's maximum range is more than 15,000 kilometres. Emirates is the largest operator of the Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft with 85 Airbus A380s and 160 Boeing 777s in its fleet. The airline has 150 orders on its books for the new Boeing 777X aircraft. It's is due to take delivery of its first 777X in 2020. The new version of the 777 is designed to compete with Airbus' A350. Boeing says the plane will be the largest and most efficient twin engine jet in the world. The interiors will feature some elements taken from the company's 787 Dreamliners, including larger windows and mood lighting. Emirates has grown rapidly over the past decade and in 2016 alone has taken delivery of 36 new aircraft – 20 Airbus A380s and 16 Boeing 777. However, the election of Donald Trump in the US may curb the carrier's ambitions in North America. The US aviation industry has been lobbying the federal government for some time about the influx of Middle-Eastern carriers – specifically Emirates, Etihad and Qatar – into the American market. The industry argues these carriers receive billions in unfair subsidies from their respective governments.

This aircraft along with the seventh aircraft which will be joining the fleet in the beginning of next year are on capital lease, while the first five were operationally leased, said a top official. The new Boeing 787 landed at Queen Alia International Airport straight from Boeing unit in Seattle and is the sixth 787 (Dreamliner) to become part of the airline fleet. RJ president/CEO Captain Suleiman Obeidat, who received the aircraft upon its arrival, expressed satisfaction with the addition of this new 787 to the currently operating five aircraft of the same type, which RJ introduced at the end of 2014 as part of the plan to modernize its long-haul fleet. The Dreamliners replace the Airbus 340s and 330s the company previously had; five aircraft of these two last models were phased out two years ago and two A330s will retire soon, stated Obeidat. He pointed out that the 787s paved the way for RJ to step into a significant new era, a step that pushes the national carrier forward in terms of inflight services and route network, enhancing its regional and international competitiveness. All new 787s, together with the operating A320 family and Embraer jets, help RJ meet its operational needs and leverage passengers’ experience. Today RJ’s fleet age does not exceed five years, a young, and modern, fleet when compared internationally, said Captain Obeidat. The wide-body, revolutionary aircraft is capable to fly long distances with full load non stop, making it a suitable choice for RJ to run it to North America, the Far East and Europe, he added. The state-of-the-art features and high specifications of the 787s offer higher levels of comfort and luxury to the RJ clients. The Dreamliners have improved ventilation and humidity levels onboard, taking the travel experience to a new level, offering passengers more comfort and significantly reducing jetlag. It is also designed to be able to monitor safety and inform the ground systems about the need of maintenance. Customers in all classes experience cabin environment improvements, such as LED mood lighting, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, lower cabin altitude and enhanced ventilation systems, among other features. The new planes also enable airlines to increase their cargo revenues by providing about 20 to 30 per cent more cargo capacity than the current airplanes of the same size.-TradeArabia News Service  Tags: Dreamliner | fleet | Royal Jordanian | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Enjoy two holidays in one with Qatar Airways Steigenberger marks one-year milestone with two top awards Ritz Carlton, Doha awarded prestigious ISO certification New F&B outlets are bucking the market trend, says expert Emirates, DCAA ink innovation MoU Emirates Palace gears up for 45th UAE National Day Symphony Style Hotel Kuwait welcomes new finance director City Centre Bahrain offers hotel guests new shuttle service Music legend Quincy Jones opens first outlet in Dubai Bahrain introduces two new visas Oman Air launches new flight training centre Bahrain mulls deployment of air marshals on flights Turkish Airlines to fly thrice to Cuba, Venezuela Dubai celebrates the opening of Bollywood Parks AirBaltic lowers checked-in baggage charges UAE National Day celebrations at Al Maryah Island Ramada Downtown Dubai launches new anniversary promotion Premier Inn ME deploys Ideas solutions for revenue growth SR Technics opens training centre in Abu Dhabi Dutch chef wins Etihad's 'Taste The World' title Dubai Miracle Garden all set to 'bloom' this winter ME airlines to spend $345bn to boost capacity Emirates offers LinkedIn Learning courses on ice Sharjah’s Al Bait Hotel $27m revamp on track WTM London 2016 most successful edition in event history Etihad, Hong Kong Airlines expand codeshare New executive chef for Alila Jabal Akhdar Rotana launches second hotel in Amman Etihad, Airbus to develop A380 MRO services Boeing to consolidate defence and space sites Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The aircraft, which landed on November 17 at the Queen Alia International Airport straight from Boeing manufactures in Seattle, is the sixth 787 to become part of the airline fleet, it said. RJ president/CEO Captain Suleiman Obeidat, who received the aircraft upon its arrival, expressed satisfaction with the addition of this new 787 to the currently operating five aircraft of the same type, which RJ introduced at the end of 2014. He said that the new aircraft along with the seventh aircraft, which will be joining the fleet in early 2017, are on capital lease, while the first five are operationally leased. The Dreamliners replace the Airbus 340s and 330s that the company previously had: five aircraft of these two last models were phased out two years ago and two A330s will retire soon. Obeidat said the 787s paved the way for RJ "to step into a significant new era", a step that pushes the national carrier of Jordan forward in terms of inflight services and route network, enhancing its regional and international competitiveness. He added that all new 787s, together with the operating A320 family and Embraer jets, help RJ meet its operational needs and leverage passengers’ experience.

The aircraft is built of carbon-fiber composite materials and has a powerful electrical system to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. It consumes 20 per cent less fuel than today’s similarly sized airplanes, enabling it to offer an exclusive eco-friendly performance. The new planes also enable airlines to increase their cargo revenues by providing about 20 to 30 per cent more cargo capacity than the current airplanes of the same size. //Petra//SS 19/11/2016 - 02:15:47 PM     Share |             Library   Facebook Google Plus Video Library Twitter You Tube       Our Services  Useful Links  Jordanian Embassies Weather   Currency Table                              Copyrights © 2016.

(AP/NASA/Neil Armstrong) Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession Space Business November 19, 2016 NASA’s scientific mission doesn’t make the US space agency immune to the politics of presidential transitions. After all, there are billions of dollars of programs and funding at stake. Witness the hand-off in 2008 from US president George W. Bush to Barack Obama: The future of an expensive plan known as the Constellation program, which would replace the Space Shuttle and return Americans to the moon by 2020 on a rocket built by Lockheed Martin, led to open arguments between the outgoing administrator, Mike Griffin, and the head of Obama’s transition team, Lori Garver. The Orlando Sentinel reported on a confrontation between the two at a book party—this is still NASA—that ended with Griffin telling Garver that “if you are looking under the hood, then you are calling me a liar.” Two years later, Obama would cancel the Constellation program, after $11 billion in spending, and abandon the goal of returning to the moon. Instead, NASA’s focus shifted toward more ambitious science missions into the solar system, and particularly to Mars. At the same time, the Space Shuttle’s low-earth orbit transportation work was handed to private companies, setting up SpaceX and Orbital ATK to fly cargo to the International Space Station, and launching a race between SpaceX and Boeing to become the first private company to fly humans in space. What will happen to those efforts under a Donald Trump presidency? One thing seems likely: Set aside Mars. Private companies are going to get a chance to do business on the moon. A question for the Trump transition team: Who will run NASA next? Trump had little to say about space during the campaign, but did drop some hints during an October campaign appearance on Florida’s space coast. “A cornerstone of my policy is we will substantially expand public private partnerships to maximize the amount of investment and funding that is available for space exploration and development,” Trump said. “I will free NASA from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low-earth orbit activity. Big deal. Instead we will refocus its mission on space exploration.” That’s a very Obama administration-like idea. Combined with an op-ed by two Trump advisers, economist Peter Navarro and aerospace-focused lobbyist Robert Walker, which praised the “vibrant companies” picking up the slack for NASA in low-earth orbit, the firms bidding to do NASA’s trucking may not need to fear a shift back to the old model, where NASA’s designs were realized by contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin at cost plus a guaranteed profit, rather than a fixed fee. Trump has otherwise said little about NASA’s other programs. And one very relevant question in this season of appointments is who he will tap to be NASA administrator. Within the rough and tumble transition, it’s still hard to say who will come out on top, but conversations with numerous current and former government officials, lobbyists, and space company executives offer a few ideas. Trump’s NASA transition leader, Mark Albrecht, is a longtime space-policy hand who chaired a now-defunct government organ called the National Space Council. This was during president George H.W. Bush’s administration, when he pushed initiatives to streamline NASA operations. It’s now thought that the NSC will be revived for a Trump presidency, led by US vice president Mike Pence. If so, it would be with the goal of uniting space policy across government, particularly on national security issues, but it also risks turf wars with NASA over what to prioritize. Both Albrecht and Walker are associated with Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House and Trump confidant, who has nursed a legendary obsession with space and promised to build a lunar colony during an abortive 2012 run for president. Those who see Gingrich as a driving force in Trump’s space policymaking expect that commercial space and a lunar focus will take the place of big government programs like the expensive Space Launch System and Orion, which is designed to bring astronauts to Mars, or even the International Space Station. The insider candidates Yet there are still voices advising Trump who might implement a more traditional, government-centered approach to space exploration. Griffin, the NASA administrator who kickstarted the Constellation program and clashed with Obama’s team, is mentioned for the NASA job but is seeking the role of Secretary of the Air Force, a role that would give him influence over the lucrative business of launching national security satellites—until a recently a monopoly held by Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Eileen Collins, a former astronaut who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July, also is a dark horse possibility. A likelier establishment candidate is Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now leads the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. Pace has criticized the Obama administration’s space leadership and its decision to cancel the Constellation program and has been skeptical of commercial space, but he represents a nod towards continuity. Indeed, he may have difficulty fitting him in with Trump’s burn-it-all-down crowd because of his establishment history, including backing Jeb Bush during the Republican primary and advising Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012. But like the Gingrich crowd, Pace still leans toward a lunar focus with international partners. “From a policy standpoint, I’m more in favor of a US-led international return to the moon with commercial partnerships,” Pace told Quartz in September. “A lunar return has more opportunities for international engagement, more opportunities for commercial partnerships and commercial service contracts. Mars is fine as a long-term goal and something to aspire toward; in terms of it being a realistic next step, I don’t know that would be my choice.” Who else could end up leading NASA? Oklahoma Republican representative Jim Bridenstine is an unabashed fan of Trump, lunar exploration, and commercial space, making him a possible choice if the administration is searching for an outsider who shares it goals. He, too, is up for consideration as a potential Secretary of the Air Force. But his appointment at NASA would likely be a tough sell to some of the agency’s scientists, since he is a prominent critic of research into how humanity is changing Earth’s climate. NASA and the politics of climate change Besides the expensive exploration programs, NASA’s efforts to track climate change using Earth-observing weather satellites are its most politically controversial work. Bridenstine and other Republicans have moved to cut funding from those areas. Whether or not Bridenstine becomes the administrator, it is likely that the Trump administration and a Republican Congress will succeed in reducing government funding to research climate change from space. But any resulting damage to the research program might be constrained in the short term, since many of the projects underway have substantial termination costs or have already been fully funded. Bridenstine’s exploration ambitions are clear. In a speech delivered the day before the election, he outlined his view that the US must create a permanent base on the moon. He argues that the moon’s resources, including water and metal oxides, could “profoundly alter the economic and geopolitical balance of power on Earth”—especially if China is the first to exploit them. In his view, the US “is the only nation that can protect space for the free world and responsible entities, and preserve space for generations to come.” With competition from China another likely theme of the Trump presidency, it’s easy to imagine the US space program’s return to the moon being built around that rivalry. Lunar hotels: The ultimate Trump space ambition? Under legislation backed by Bridenstine, NASA already has begun a pilot program with private companies to develop moon habitats. One of the companies participating is Bigelow Aerospace, founded by the billionaire Las Vegas real estate investor Robert Bigelow. The company has been developing inflatable space habitats for years. SpaceX flew one to the International Space Station earlier in 2016, where it was inflated so that astronauts could assess its performance. Bigelow’s dream is to build hotels in space. “It’s just real estate in a different location,” he told Bloomberg News in 2013. “So you can sell these space buildings; you can lease these space buildings; the person that you lease them to can sublet them. You just better be sure that you have a way of getting back and forth to it. Otherwise, you’re really screwed.” It’s easy to imagine the appeal of this idea to a real estate developer president with big ambitions and a taste for brash concepts. Climate change, exo-planets, and long-shot trips to Mars may ignite space geeks, but the idea of the world’s first space hotel may win out in Trump’s oval office.

Ajai Shukla reports from St Louis, Missouri. Following the lead of Swedish company Saab, Boeing has linked its offer to build a fighter aircraft in India with the promise of assistance in designing and building an Indian fifth-generation (Gen-5) fighter. In a presentation to the Indian media in St Louis, Missouri, where Boeing builds the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter, Boeing's Dan Gillian outlined a detailed road map from the Super Hornet to India's Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft, the Gen-5 fighter that the Defence Research and Development Organisation hopes to build. Boeing's plan involves first setting up an Indian factory and the aerospace ecosystem to build the Block II Super Hornet, which will then be improved into the 'Advanced Super Hornet.' That infrastructure and design capability would give Indian designers the instruments to build the AMCA. Boeing's India chief Pratyush Kumar hardly disguises his scepticism of Saab's promise to help India in designing the AMCA. "America is the only country that has actually designed and manufactured stealthy, Gen-5 fighters," points out Kumar. "Stealth design is not a science. It is an art that is developed only after years of trial and error. Boeing has actually mastered that art while co-designing the F-35 joint strike fighter." Boeing is not in direct competition with Saab, which is pitching to build 100 to 200 single-engine fighters in India. Instead, Boeing will compete with European manufacturers, Dassault, and Eurofighter, to establish a factory that will churn out a similar number of twin-engine fighters. The Indian Air Force has already solicited interest from global aerospace vendors in the single-engine category, and a similar request is expected soon for building twin-engine fighters. Kumar claims the F/A-18E/F, which was designed in the 1990s, is a decade more contemporary than its rivals like the Rafale and the Eurofighter Typhoon, which started being designed in the 1980s. "The Super Hornet is sometimes confused with the older F/A-18A/B Hornet fighter, which dates back to the 1970s. While they are superficially similar, the Super Hornet's brand new design incorporates a high degree of stealth." "For America, the Super Hornet was a stepping stone to the F-35, and it can be a stepping stone to the AMCA for India," argues Kumar. Boeing's new Super Hornet factory in St Louis is churning out two Super Hornets each month for the US Navy, which will continue inducting the fighter well into the 2020s. Each of America's 9-12 aircraft carriers (the final number will depend upon President Donald Trump's defence policy) will embark four squadrons of Super Hornets until 2028, when the F-35 Lightning II starts being inducted in significant numbers. By 2028, each carrier will have one squadron of the F-35, and by 2035 there will be two squadrons each of the Super Hornet and the F-35. "But the fighter will remain in service out to the 2040s and, until then, we will be developing upgrades every two years as part of a continuous development programme," says Gillian. The first improvement on the cards is an advanced cockpit system in 2018-2019. Also being developed, even without US Navy sanction and funding, are 'conformal fuel tanks' that will extend the fighter's 1,000-km strike range by 200 km; and a more powerful and fuel-economical F-414 engine that will increase the thrust by 18 per cent. Gillian says the Super Hornet is highly regarded by the US Navy not just because it is a capable and easy-to-maintain fighter, but also because it is the cheapest to operate in the entire US fighter fleet, even cheaper than the single-engine F-16. "The US Government Accountability Office rates the F/A-18E/F as the most economical fighter to operate on a cost per hour basis," says Gillian. The challenge for Boeing will be to build a supplier chain in India, like the one that feeds into the Super Hornet line at St Louis. This consists of 800 vendors in 44 states, which employ 60,000 people. Boeing's current Super Hornet vendors in India include Bharat Electronics Ltd, which builds electrical panels. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is building wire bundles and gun bay doors. Smaller companies are also joining the supply chain, including Rossell and SASMOS, which supply electrical equipment.

Hammond Jim Miles Paul Craig Roberts David Swanson Select Page Bringing Closure to the 9/11 Pentagon Debate By John D. Wyndham | Oct 7, 2016 | Essays, Science, US | 138 | Aerial view of the damage to the Pentagon occurring on 9/11 (US Navy/Public Domain) It’s time for the 9/11 truth movement to resolve its Pentagon debate by applying the scientific method. Doing so points conclusively to large plane impact. For over fifteen years the 9/11 truth movement and some of its most visible leaders have debated this question: Did a large plane, matching a Boeing 757 in general and Flight AA 77 in particular, hit the Pentagon on September 11, 2001? In the last several years a group of scientists and engineers have presented a number of scientific papers that answer both of these questions with a resounding “Yes.” A number of these scientists and engineers are affiliated with the organization Scientists for 9/11 Truth, which also fully supports the hypothesis that the impacts and resulting fires from the Boeing 767s crashing into the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers (WTC1 and WTC2) on 9/11 could not account for the destruction of these buildings. Building 7 (WTC7) was destroyed without being impacted by any plane. The evidence is clear that all three of these buildings were destroyed by some form of controlled demolition. While the 9/11 truth movement generally agrees on what happened in New York City, thus far there has been no closure on the Pentagon debate. As an organization, Scientists for 9/11 Truth has stood virtually alone in maintaining large plane impact at the Pentagon together with controlled demolition of the buildings in New York City. With the publication of three new works, cited below, there are now indications that the 9/11 truth movement may be ready to adopt this position also. See, for example, this article on the Truth Action Project website. Eyewitnesses and Physical Evidence The Pentagon question has divided the 9/11 truth movement, impeding its thrust toward truth and public credibility. Despite hundreds of eyewitnesses who saw a large plane fly towards the Pentagon and impact it, critics continue to claim otherwise, mainly because the crash scene was unlike those for other plane crashes. Few critics considered that for this unique event—a high-speed impact of a large plane with a building—preconceived expectations of the observed outcome are of little value. The plane largely penetrated the building, leaving many small fragments outside but relatively few large pieces. In a recent conversation with a “no plane impact” advocate, the advocate stated “We will only know for sure what hit the Pentagon when the people who know the answers come forward.” In fact, these “people” came forward a long time ago in video and audio recordings and in written statements, starting on 9/11 itself. Regrettably, the 9/11 truth movement at large either does not know about these hundreds of witnesses, or else has refused to listen to or believe them. Eyewitnesses affirm large plane impact, and the damage trail establishes the plane path before and after impact with a high degree of precision. The plane flew low from the southwest straight toward the Pentagon on a path making a 52-degree angle with the Pentagon’s west wall. It clipped a tree; downed five light poles; struck a fence, a generator-trailer, and a low concrete wall; and impacted the building at the first and second floors, creating an 18-foot wide hole atop a 96-foot gash in the façade. Outside, plane debris was strewn to the north near the Heliport because of the speed and angle of impact. The light poles’ separation gives a plane wingspan in the range 100 to 130 feet (a Boeing 757 wingspan is 124 feet 10 inches), while the low concrete wall and generator-trailer damage separation indicates an engine separation of approximately 43 feet (Boeing 757 engine separation is 42.5 feet). See Figure 1. Figure 1 – Aerial Photograph Showing Plane Path Inside the Pentagon, the plane was increasingly fragmented by the steel and concrete columns, creating a fluid-like flow of solid debris. This flow of material destroyed or damaged many internal columns, defining a continuation of the outside path, and ultimately created an exit hole in the C ring wall. Debris, including plane parts, spilled into the AE Drive in the direction of the original plane path. Internal columns were bowed and abraded in the flight path direction and much of the first floor suddenly filled with debris. The first floor ceiling beyond the collapsed portion of the building remained intact. These elements all confirm a flight path that is supported by eyewitness accounts, the radar data and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) data, which was released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). There are over 62 documented eyewitnesses who saw the plane impact. Fourteen (14) witnesses saw one or more of the light poles struck. Four witnesses saw the right engine/wing hit the generator-trailer, while one witness saw the left engine hit the low concrete wall and break apart. Multiple witnesses traced the passage of the plane as it flew from the Sheraton Hotel (last radar reading) to impact at the Pentagon. There were some initial problems reading the last frame of the FDR data, but the properly decoded FDR data traces the plane’s path all the way from take-off at Dulles Airport to impact at the Pentagon. Applying the Scientific Method Such a confluence of physical, eyewitness, and other evidence provides an overwhelming case for a large plane—a Boeing 757 and specifically Flight AA 77—impacting and penetrating the Pentagon on 9/11. The initial hypothesis of large plane impact, when examined for its consequences as shown by the eyewitness testimony, physical damage, and other supporting evidence, survives the scientific method test and becomes a theory that explains virtually all the observations. No other hypothesis, such as impact by a missile or pre-planted bombs, has even ventured to explain all this evidence. This illustrates the difference between a hypothesis and a theory, and the application of the scientific method in solving physical problems. Those who deny large plane impact offer only criticisms or alternative hypotheses, not a theory. A complete theory examines the consequences of a hypothesis, compares these consequences with the evidence, and discards the hypothesis if it leads to results that do not match the evidence. Figure 2 illustrates the flow of analysis using the scientific method. Figure 2 – Analysis Flow Using the Scientific Method The Large Plane Impact Hypothesis and Theory Ask a Question Let’s begin with the topmost oval in Figure 2 and ask a question: What caused the damage and deaths at the Pentagon on the morning of 9/11? Do Background Research To answer this question, we first do some background research. Eyewitnesses: According to eyewitnesses, a large plane flew (in about six seconds according to FDR data) from the vicinity of the Sheraton Hotel at the west end of the Navy Annex and impacted the Pentagon west wall. It flew above Columbia Pike, crossed the clover-leaf intersection of Columbia Pike with S. Washington Boulevard (Route 27), clipped a tree and impacted five light poles, a fence and a generator-trailer and a low concrete wall, all before hitting the Pentagon façade and then largely disappeared inside the building. Plane parts rained down on the Pentagon lawn and the highway that runs parallel to the west wall. Those who observed this fleeting event from outside the Pentagon, from the standstill traffic on route 27, from the vicinity of Arlington Cemetery, and from nearby buildings, are in substantial agreement that impact by a large plane occurred. Some witnesses identified the plane from its silver color and red and blue markings as an American Airlines plane, a Boeing 757, or both. Witnesses to the aftermath of plane impact who did not see the plane hit, saw many small pieces of plane “confetti” as well as some large pieces of silver fuselage. Some witnesses did not see any large plane parts, and did not recognize the confetti for what it was. Critics have seized upon these latter accounts to try to prove that there was no plane. These accounts cannot negate the many positive observations of others as well as the abundance of photographic evidence. There are also photographs and a significant number of witnesses who described seeing plane parts in the interior of the building and in the AE Drive. Photographs and Videos: Photographs taken outside and inside the Pentagon show many small pieces of silver fuselage with AA colored markings, plane and engine parts, landing gear and a tire. Abraded and bent interior columns show the direction of flow of fragmented plane parts, aligning with the known outside path to within a few degrees. Much of the first floor area under the non-collapsed ceiling suddenly filled with debris. Outside the C ring hole, debris and plane parts were strewn in the AE Drive in alignment with the flight path. Radar and FDR Data: Figures 3 and 4 show the plane’s path from takeoff at Dulles Airport to a point close to the Sheraton Hotel (radar data) and to impact at the Pentagon (FDR data). Figure 3 – [Figure 6 from Frank Legge’s letter “The 9/11 Attack on the Pentagon: the Search for Consensus“ published in the Journal of 9/11 Studies]. IAD, PLA, QBE, and QHY are radar tracking stations. Figure 4 – [Figure 7 from Frank Legge’s “The 9/11 Attack on the Pentagon: the Search for Consensus“]. The course of AA 77 from the FDR data closely matches the radar data.The continuous radar data matching the FDR data indicates that assertions of tampering, as well as suggestions that a plane swap took place, are mistaken. There is no reason to doubt that Flight AA 77 traveled from Dulles to its impact at the Pentagon. The radar track of AA 77 is continuous from Dulles to the vicinity of the Sheraton Hotel and is supported by the FDR data. From there, the FDR data and many eyewitnesses tracked the plane all the way to impact at the Pentagon. The eyewitness and physical evidence fully support impact by a large plane with dimensions matching a Boeing 757. Pentagon Security Videos: Recent work on the video from two Pentagon security cameras shows that they captured images of the approaching, low-flying plane. In his paper “The 85 Pentagon Area Surveillance Cameras,” Ken Jenkins explains the images, how the date error came about, and the likely origins for the trailing white smoke. There is no evidence at this time that the government is withholding other images of the event captured by the surveillance cameras. Ken Jenkins and David Chandler also recently took pairs of sequential images from the Pentagon surveillance video cameras, putting them together as you would see them in what is called a blink comparator. In this way, the image of the plane “pops out.” If you watch the image cycle a few times, the details of the plane are clearly visible. You can find the blink comparisons on David Chandler’s website, 911SpeakOut.org. Construct Hypothesis Based on the above background research, we propose and test the hypothesis that the Pentagon was struck by a large plane matching a Boeing 757 and most probably Flight AA 77. Test with an Experiment Many physical hypotheses can be tested by experiment in a laboratory using relatively simple equipment. In the case of the Pentagon 9/11 event, costs to test and/or reproduce some features of the event would be prohibitive. Fortunately, there are prior relevant tests, airplane incidents and other evidence that are pertinent to the event and that support the large plane impact hypothesis. The F4 Experiment: In the F4 Phantom jet experiment, a plane was propelled at high speed on a rocket sled into a massive and impenetrable concrete wall. The plane was completely fragmented into small pieces. This experiment supports the fragmentation of the Boeing 757 plane parts that did not enter the building. Ground Effect: Because of what is known as ground effect, it is claimed by critics that the plane could not have flown closer to the ground than 56 feet, so it would have impacted at the fourth and fifth floor levels. Some experienced pilots have supported this objection. The physical evidence, such as the five downed light poles, confirms that a large plane did fly low. In addition, many witnesses actually reported that they saw a large commercial jetliner, identified as a Boeing 757, fly low and close to the ground. Actual experience confirms this behavior. For example, at an air show in Portugal, Evora 2007 (Figure 5), an Airbus A310, similar in size to a Boeing 757, repeatedly flew low, sometimes with the gear down and full flaps but with at least one pass at a relatively high speed, with no concern about any ground effect. The height of the plane above the runway was little more than the diameter of the fuselage. Engineers and scientists working in the aerospace field feature an article which explains that, because of the high speed and low angle of attack, ground effect is not a relevant factor, particularly with an aircraft that is under automatic control, as was likely the case for Flight AA 77 at the end. According to Jeff Scott, “ground effect would have been quite small on Flight 77 given its high rate of speed and small angle of attack.” See Aerospaceweb.org and the answer by Jeff Scott, “Pentagon & Boeing 757 Ground Effect.” Figure 5 – [From a video at Portugal, Evora 2007] TAP Airbus A310 flying very low at high speed [Figure D-6 from the paper by Victoria Ashley et al., “The Pentagon Event: The Honegger Hypothesis Refuted,” ScientficMethod911.org.]Further Analysis of Corroborating Physical Evidence: Several items of physical evidence can be further analyzed to see if they comport with a large plane hitting the Pentagon. Clipped Tree: One witness described the plane as “picking off trees and light poles.” Photographs show that the starboard (right) engine of the plane did clip a tree. Jon Cole has shown experimentally that it is possible for the leading edge of an engine to cut the tree. Cole compared this action with similar-looking ragged branches cut with a heavy brush cutter with heavy, thick dull blades rotating at a lesser speed than the airplane that cut the woody branches of the Pentagon tree (See Figure 6). Branches ingested by the right engine can explain the smoke trail from the right engine from that point on, as seen in the security camera videos and in this simulation. Figure 6 – Sheared Tree Branches [From “The 85 Pentagon Area Surveillance Cameras” by Ken Jenkins, 9-11TV.org.]Downed Light Poles: Many witnesses saw the plane hit light poles. In all, five light poles were torn from their bases and broken into pieces. Pole pieces had considerable curvature as if hit by a blunt force at high speed, such as the moving wing of a plane. One pole piece pierced the windshield of a taxi driven by Lloyde England. The back seat of the taxi was pierced indicating how the pole piece was supported at that end and stuck out through the windshield. The separation and positions of the downed light poles indicate a plane wingspan of more than 100 feet, but less than 130 feet. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 124 feet 10 inches. Rotated Generator-Trailer: Several witnesses saw the right plane engine and/or wing strike one end of a very heavy generator-trailer. The trailer was found to have rotated about the other end toward the building. In addition to the damaged end, there was a gash in the trailer top corresponding to the position of the first flap “canoe” beyond the right engine of a Boeing 757. The location and direction of the gash was consistent with the canoe’s position on the wing and the plane’s flight path. Gouge in Low Concrete Wall: One witness saw the left engine hit a low concrete wall and break apart. The wall shows a curved gouge consistent with impact by an engine. The distance between the wall and the struck end of the generator-trailer is approximately 43 feet, matching the engines’ separation of a Boeing 757 of 42.5 feet. When the left engine hit the wall it was a few inches above ground level at that point. The wall sits on a high point, and this explains why the engine did not gouge the surrounding lawn as it traveled over the lawn. Some nearby, upright wooden spools were not struck as they were positioned between the plane fuselage and the low-slung left engine. Debris by the Heliport Area: There was a noticeable amount of plane debris, mostly small pieces, at the Heliport area north of the impact hole. This is in accord with the plane’s path which made a 52-degree angle with the Pentagon west wall as it approached from the southwest. This distribution of debris is entirely to be expected since, after fragmentation, debris that remained outside the building would have a significant velocity component causing it to travel in a northerly direction. The Impact Hole and Façade Damage: Many claims have been made that the impact hole was too small for a plane the size of a Boeing 757 to have entered the building. None of these claims have merit. The fuselage of a Boeing 757 is 12.33 feet wide and 13.5 feet high and the corresponding hole was about 18 feet wide. Early photographs were obscured by spray from fire hoses and hid a long gash of about 96 feet in the first floor façade. There were many missing outer support columns. Thus the plane’s fuselage, both engines, and the heavier, inner parts of the wings had sufficient room to penetrate the building. According to witnesses and the FDR data, the plane had rolled about 5 degrees counterclockwise when it hit the wall. Façade markings, such as a long gash made by a wing, confirm these observations. Critics frequently point to the absence of a clear vertical gash that they contend should have been made by the vertical portion of the tail. There are, as shown by Jim Hoffman, markings in the area where the tail might have hit. It is possible that the tail was blown off and fragmented, and did not reach the wall intact. One witness described seeing the fuel explosion while the tail was still visible. Many witnesses saw the tail, and this criticism cannot overturn the other evidence of plane approach and impact. Internal Column Damage: Figure 7 taken from The Pentagon Building Performance Report depicts internal column damage. At the top, red and blue squares depict missing and severely damaged columns. Green and yellow squares show columns with less damage. The width of the damage at the west wall (top) is about 100 feet, which is consistent with the impact of the fuselage, engines, and the heavy parts of the wings of a Boeing 757. As the fuselage moved into the building, it was shredded and scattered to the sides along its path, but a cone of decreasing width of material maintained enough focus to break through and make a hole in the C ring wall. The dark shaded area of the figure is where the building collapsed about 30 minutes after impact. The first floor area with damage but no collapse filled up with debris without the first floor ceiling collapsing. All these observations support the impact with the façade and passage of a large plane through the building primarily at the first floor level. Figure 7 – Pentagon Building and Performance Report Figure 7.9 It is noteworthy that April Gallop, who has been extensively interviewed and quoted as an important witness, had an office in wedge 2 over 150 feet from the impact hole. Gallop’s office structure did collapse and the lights went out but Gallop was too far away to smell jet fuel. She, with her child and others, exited through a window near the Heliport. Once outside, Gallop collapsed, was apparently unconscious, and was moved to the outer lawn area, and then to a hospital. Gallop had no opportunity to see aircraft debris inside or outside the building. C Ring Exit Hole: The C ring exit hole can be understood as resulting from the impact of many pieces of plane debris. This process and the false assertion that workers created the hole as a way to access the building interior are fully discussed in the papers listed below. The exit hole lines up with the plane path that made a 52-degree angle with the Pentagon west wall. This fact in itself points to the hole’s origin since the exact plane path was not known until some days or weeks after the event. There is no evidence that any part of the crash scene was staged to imply a non-existent plane crash. All the physical and eyewitness evidence points to actual large plane impact. Debris in the AE Drive: Debris strewn outside the C ring exit hole was in line with the direction of the plane’s motion and included a plane tire and a wheel rim consistent with a Boeing 757. See Figure 8. Figure 8 – C Ring Hole, Plane Parts and Debris Angle Figure 8 shows a large remnant of a tire outside the C Ring Hole (2). Also shown is a wheel rim (1). The debris angle (3) is also clearly visible. A single doorway lies in the direction pointed to by (4). Analyze Results – Draw Conclusion Both the background information that includes the eyewitnesses and the detailed examination of the plane path and damage presented above support the large plane impact hypothesis. The conclusion drawn is that a large plane matching a Boeing 757 and most probably Flight AA 77 struck the Pentagon on 9/11. Hypothesis is True The hypothesis of impact by a large plane matching a Boeing 757 and Flight AA 77 is true. The next step in the scientific method is to report the results. Report Results Among the first to report the results of a scientific analysis of the Pentagon 9/11 event were Jim Hoffman and Victoria Ashley. Subsequently, scientists affiliated with Scientists for 9/11 Truth, with additional authors such as engineers and computer scientists participating, produced a substantial number of papers. These papers, all listed in the Additional Reading section below, include the three new works mentioned above and listed here, together with a new article: (a) “The Pentagon Plane Puzzle”, a video by Ken Jenkins on the Pentagon eyewitnesses, (b) “Going Beyond Speculation: A Scientific Look at the Pentagon Evidence” a talk by David Chandler. (c) “The Pentagon Event: The Honegger Hypothesis Refuted” a paper by Victoria Ashley, David Chandler, Jonathan H. Cole, Jim Hoffman, Ken Jenkins, Frank Legge, and John D. Wyndham. Except for Victoria Ashley and Jonathan H. Cole (Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice), all of the foregoing individuals are members of Scientists for 9/11 Truth. See also the article “Why Not Use a Plane?” by Frank Legge and Ken Jenkins on the Scientists for 9/11 Truth website. Other Pentagon Hypotheses Since the Pentagon 9/11 event, many individuals have tried to prove that a large plane did not impact the Pentagon. These individuals often point to testimonies by witnesses who did not see the plane impact. For example, an aftermath witness might not see recognizable plane parts and claim or imply that there was no plane involved. Some Pentagon workers inside the building inferred a bomb, since to them whatever happened sounded like a bomb. But an expert witness with military experience, who also saw the plane tail just before impact and following fireball, stated that it sounded like a “2000 lb” bomb. While many witnesses reported that they smelled the odor of jet fuel, a smaller number thought they smelled cordite, an explosive that has not been in use since WWII. Although at least 14 witnesses saw the plane hit the light poles one second or less before impact, some critics claim this could not have happened without the wings being visibly damaged or destroyed. Even though the event occurred in broad daylight and was viewed by hundreds of people, scores of whom were stuck in traffic on route 27 with a clear view, critics have dismissed witness accounts by claiming these to be fraudulent. However, there is not a single case where a Pentagon witness has been shown to have deliberately lied. On the contrary, there has been an attempt by some to manipulate witnesses years later and lead them to a different conclusion about what they saw at the Pentagon. This is the case with those who postulate the “North path” approach in which the physical damage could not have been done by the plane. While the advocates of a “North path” approach claim the plane flew over the Pentagon, there is not a single, unequivocal witness to this scenario, and many of the very few North path witnesses affirm that the plane impacted the building. Based on these criticisms, a number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed. Although often termed theories, these hypotheses do not rise to the level of theories because they have not been subjected to the discipline of the scientific method. It is instructive to subject these alternative hypotheses to analysis according to the scientific method steps of Figure 2. Alternative Hypotheses Analyzed According to the Scientific Method The Bombs (Pre-planted Explosives) Hypothesis Those who hypothesize that there was no plane impact attribute all damage and deaths to pre-planted explosives or bombs. These researchers include Barbara Honegger in her “Behind the Smoke Curtain” presentation and the Citizen Investigation Team (CIT). Their assumption is that the approaching plane seen by many flew over the Pentagon. Honegger has modified her hypothesis in the last several years to postulate that a white plane was destroyed with some sort of explosives outside the Pentagon near the Heliport area without any debris hitting the Pentagon wall. For these “no plane impact” hypotheses, the next step in the scientific method, Test with an Experiment, raises immediate problems. The first major problem is the scores of eyewitnesses who saw the plane impact the Pentagon west wall. To solve this problem, many critics simply ignore or attempt to discredit the witnesses, claiming they are lying, incoherent, or manipulated by insiders to tell a false story. These criticisms fail for lack of proof. The witnesses cannot be explained away in any credible fashion. The second major problem is how to explain the plane debris seen by witnesses and in photographs. No credible explanation has been offered as to how the large volume of plane debris was planted and distributed outside the Pentagon, inside the Pentagon, and in the AE Drive, except by a plane crash. Honegger’s “white plane destroyed” hypothesis appears to be an attempt to explain the plane debris near the Heliport, but it does not explain the plane debris found inside the Pentagon building or in the AE Drive. The third major problem is a failure to explain, using bombs, the observed damage. This damage includes the clipped tree, the five downed light poles, the generator-trailer that was damaged and rotated toward the Pentagon, the gouge in the low concrete wall, the shape and nature of the façade damage, the internal bowed and abraded columns, the sudden appearance of internal plane debris, the C ring hole and the debris strewn in the AE Drive. There is no credible evidence for Honegger’s “white plane.” The plane’s supposed destruction without its fragmented parts hitting the Pentagon west wall violates laws of physics, specifically the law of the conservation of momentum. The center of gravity of the combined fragments would still be moving toward the wall at the plane’s pre-explosion speed. There is nowhere near enough plane debris outside the wall near the heliport to account for an entire plane. The bombs-only hypothesis fails the test of the scientific method in major ways, and the analysis shows the hypothesis is false. However, although the evidence is scant or nonexistent, it is still possible that there were some internal bombs timed to explode at the same time as large plane impact. The Small Plane Hypothesis Some investigators claim that a small plane hit the Pentagon on 9/11. These include Massimo Mazzucco in part 2 of his film September 11 – The New Pearl Harbor, and David Ray Griffin, author of many books on the events of 9/11. Griffin has publicly endorsed Mazzucco’s work, including that on the Pentagon. This hypothesis immediately encounters major problems. The great majority of over 180 eyewitnesses to the approach of the plane and its impact with the Pentagon west wall described a large plane. Only a very small number (six or less) of witnesses described a small plane, and most of these viewed the plane at a great distance, making size judgments difficult and unreliable. Of the large plane witnesses, many described it as a silver American Airlines plane, a Boeing 737 or 757. One knowledgeable witness, Tim Timmerman, an airlines’ pilot, recognized it unequivocally as a Boeing 757. Secondly, a small plane could not have created the observed physical damage. The downed light poles require a minimum wingspan of 100 feet, while the generator-trailer and low concrete wall separation gives the separation of the engines as about 43 feet, closely matching the actual separation of Boeing 757 engines at 42.5 feet. Given that wingtips of a plane are very light and might easily break off, a small plane would be unlikely to create a 96-foot gash in the first floor. The small plane hypothesis fails the test of the scientific method and the analysis shows the hypothesis is false. The Missile Hypothesis The missile hypothesis cannot explain the spatial characteristics of the physical damage. The light poles were effectively 100 feet apart, and the generator-trailer and low concrete wall were effectively 43 feet apart. These objects could not all have been impacted by a missile. The shape and size of the impact hole precludes a missile, the damaged internal columns were spaced apart over a wide area, and the bowed and abraded columns could not have been rendered in such a condition by a missile. A missile could possibly have created the C ring hole, but only plane parts were found in the debris in the AE Drive. Donald Rumsfeld alluded to a missile, and eyewitness Mike Walter spoke of a missile, but in the metaphorical sense of a plane acting as a missile. These comments fueled the missile hypothesis. But no witnesses claimed to have seen a missile. Witnesses overwhelmingly described a large plane. The missile hypothesis fails the test of the scientific method and the analysis shows the hypothesis is false. Conclusion Despite the clear evidence and its analysis using the scientific method of large plane impact, a substantial portion of the 9/11 truth movement, including accepted leaders and those involved in major organizations, continues to publicly endorse, adhere to, or promulgate talks, writings and films on false Pentagon hypotheses. Some simply offer criticisms and reject or ignore evidence that would bring closure to the argument. There is clear evidence by way of disintegrating truth groups that these endorsements and communications are injurious to the movement. Public feedback shows that the false Pentagon hypotheses undermine public acceptance of other highly credible scientific findings, such as the demolitions of the Twin Towers and Building 7 (WTC7) in New York City. Most rank and file members of the 9/11 truth movement take their cues on the Pentagon from well-known speakers, writers, and acknowledged leaders of the movement. The quickest way to end the ongoing damage to the movement’s credibility and bring closure would be for these prominent individuals to publicly repudiate their former endorsements, views, and statements on the Pentagon event and acknowledge the scientific method and its conclusion of large plane impact. In the absence of public repudiations, the damage caused by false Pentagon hypotheses is likely to continue indefinitely, even if those who fueled their spread cease to promote them. Consequently, the surest way to end the debate and enhance the credibility of the movement is for each individual to study, without bias or prejudice, the evidence for themselves. The recent papers by scientists, engineers and others showing large plane impact at the Pentagon have been collected together on a website that invites feedback and discussion. Comments can be sent to the Scientific Method 9/11 website which specifically invites feedback on many of the papers listed below.

There’s as much reality in this piece as in “Night At the Opera.” But if I can manage to see ONE of those 80 videos that the FBI confiscated of the actual event, and it shows a plane, then, yes, I’ll change my mind. Where’s the video? Uh…what’s that you say? MrKoenig Hundred of recorded eyewitness accounts, damage path consistent with an large airliner, aircraft debris and even DNA doesn’t convice you? Then thumbs up to your ignorance! MyWikiDisQus Yes, plenty of circumstantial evidence to be sure. The nagging question is, where are all the closed circuit video/audio recordings that surround the Pentagon on that fateful day? Why is the government withholding the full motion videos that capture the airplane descending from the sky and hitting the building? Jeremy R. Hammond Well, that meaningless little anecdote clearly outweighs the mountains of incontrovertible evidence that, yes, a plane did hit the Pentagon. MyWikiDisQus You side stepped to consider my question, where are the full motion closed circuit Pentagon videos? Why is the FBI not making them all public? Jeremy R. Hammond The question isn’t relevant to the point. Assuming such videos exist, the fact they aren’t released hardly belies the incontrovertible evidence of a plane impact. The logic “they haven’t released the videos, therefore there was no plane impact”, needless to say, is a non sequitur. MyWikiDisQus I’m still waiting for your thoughts regarding the discrepancy between the flight 11’s wing outline impact seen in the Fireman’s video verses the hole in the Pentagon that shows no evidence of either wing impacting the face of the building. Jeremy R. Hammond There is no such discrepancy. The wing impact on the Pentagon was actually very clearly observable. Brian Rogers Can you provide this clear wing impact evidence? Yeah, because my fellow pentagon researchers and I have never discovered these images in over 12 years of research. Thanks. Jeremy R. Hammond It is hard not to see the wing impact damage in photos of the Pentagon. It must take a great deal of effort not to. MyWikiDisQus There is no evidence of a wing impacting the building. It only exists in the script you’ve been reading. Jeremy R. Hammond The impact from the wings is clearly visible in images taken prior to the collapse, e.g.,: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/65d4407fe677a35df93c937b45f6447fa81dba72a35c9341de3f22436a3bc141.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b809c65aad5dd36137f2e3f98d37d07accd930803b2bc0788ba7dd6248fddf53.jpg Brian Rogers lol MyWikiDisQus Uh huh, “clearly visible” you wrote. And after the “plane’s impact”, the wings were found where exactly, because I don’t see any remains of any wings in any photographs, anywhere. No wing debris was every recovered, not spars, ribs, ground spoilers, leading edge flaps, flap track fairings or any aileron components. Surely there must have been some part of the wings that didn’t mysteriously disappear into the building to confirm the official hoax. Not even a piece of aluminum skin from a wing laid on the ground. I don’t believe a wing from a commercial aircraft could strike a solid object such as a building wall and stay completely intact without loss of any wing material. You’re going to have provide other proof that phenomenon is possible. Jeremy R. Hammond Just open your eyes and you can clearly see where the wings impacted the Pentagon. It also must take an extraordinary effort not to see the debris. MyWikiDisQus Yes, my eyes are open and I clearly see fragments of rubble but none that can be positively identified as parts of a commercial aircraft. Look closer (see: http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/pentagon/debris-small-2.jpg ). Even closer (see: http://911research.wtc7.net/mirrors/guardian2/pentagon/debris-small.jpg ). I feel sorry for you Mr. Hammond, that you continue to spew the government’s coverup story about the attack on the Pentagon building. 1. There is no conclusive evidence American flight 77 hit the west wing of the Pentagon. 2. That it was flown by a Saudi Arab terrorist who had absolutely no flight time or hands-on experience flying a 100 ton commercial aircraft, no training whatsoever on IFR rules or knowledge of the Boeing 757’s myriad of dials, switches, knobs and levers of the instrumentation panels and how to correctly operate them or how to successfully navigate through Class Bravo airspace. The story is profoundly unbelievable and so are you. Jeremy R. Hammond The question of who was piloting the plane is an entirely other matter, and for my take on that, you can read my piece “Al Qaeda’s Top Gun”: http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/04/17/al-qaedas-top-gun/ Sticking to the topic at hand, you haven’t presented any other explanation for the damage to the Pentagon (including impact damage from the wings) and the debris. Moreover, there was clearly identifiable plane wreckage in the debris, as well as remains of the victims: http://911review.com/errors/pentagon/nodebris.html http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/prosecution/thumbs/P200030.jpg http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/prosecution/thumbs/P200042.jpg http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/prosecution/thumbs/P200045.jpg http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/prosecution/thumbs/P200047.jpg http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/prosecution/thumbs/P200048.jpg The persistent ignorance of the incontrovertible evidence of the plane hitting the Pentagon by your ilk have done untold harm to the cause of truth with respect to what really occurred on 9/11 and why. MyWikiDisQus The pictures you provided show a component of some aircraft as well as the remains of the deceased who perished on that fateful day. All of which were found somewhere inside the west wing of the Pentagon, not outside on the lawn. Is it possible the aircraft part was not from flight 77? Is it possible the charred remains were Pentagon civilian and military personnel and not passengers of the same plane in question, given the fact that 125 of the dead worked inside the Pentagon? Of course that is a plausible explanation but you chose to lay it out as further prima facie evidence of the existence of the commercial airplane. Certainly taints your objectivity, doesn’t it, Mr. Hammond? I read your editorial about Hani Hanjour, alleged pilot of flight 77 (see: http://www.deepjournal.com/p/7/a/en/2659.html ). Your last sentence read, “And whichever the case, the conclusion is inescapable that the 9/11 Commission deliberately attempted to deceive the public about the piloting capabilities of Hani Hanjour.” One would think a respected journalist such as yourself would pursue the end truth based on the premise that someone else piloted an airborne vehicle that hit the Pentagon. But you haven’t; you let it go and accept the basic story created by the perpetrators of this massive crime against the American people. Your curiosity has gone cold and betrayed your investigative instincts. As far as your suggestion that, ” … you haven’t presented any other explanation for the damage to the Pentagon …”, that is a correct statement. I do not have access to the full-motion videos the U.S. military has in its possession that would conclusively show what hit the Pentagon on 9/11. But given all the holes in the official explanation of what occurred on that day for which even you have acknowledged with your “Top Gun” piece should make you question everything the government has told us: everything. We can continue to go back and forth but it serves no purpose. You believe the main version of the 9/11 tale given by the media and the government whereas I don’t. You see, Mr. Hammond, it’s the U.S. Government we are conversing about; a haven for half-truths and outright lies. Are you familiar with the national debt clock (see: http://www.usdebtclock.org/ )? See how all the numbers spin about that total the amount of debt the American people are saddled with? Now imagine the numbers are not dollars but lies the government tells the world. I’m sure you get where I come from. Jeremy R. Hammond I agree that the objectivity of one of us is “tainted”. You are of course welcome to present another hypothesis to explain the overwhelming evidence that the plane hit the Pentagon. I would merely observe how you haven’t done so. Your comments regarding my article on Hanjour are curious. How do you propose I should have gone about investigating who was actually piloting the plane? Also, I do question everything the government tells us (hence my Hanjour piece, along with pretty much all of my other writings). In this case, the evidence just so happens to be incontrovertible that the plane did hit the Pentagon — regardless of who was actually piloting it. MyWikiDisQus Again you throw the narrative back to me to prove the commercial airline did not hit the building. I have no way to prove otherwise since the government has all the contrary evidence safely secured away from public scrutiny and the press. In criminal law, a defense attorney through the discovery process has access to all evidence in possession of the district attorney. But that is not the case here even though multiple capital crimes have been committed. You wrote, “Your comments regarding my article on Hanjour are curious. How do you propose I should have gone about investigating who was actually piloting the plane?” I can’t do that since I don’t believe American flight 77 hit the Pentagon. However all it takes is a forensic examination of one aircraft part that does not belong to American Airlines to expose the whole story. For example, look here at a short you tube video of the inside of a typical flight data recorder (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlY5W7be5jU ). At the 45 second mark you find the airline name stamped on a plate (e.g., Property of Delta Air Lines). You might want to start there. But as I wrote earlier, the full motion videos of all the CCTV cameras outside (and inside) the DOD would clear up the matter. Perhaps your numerous contacts in Washington, DC could point you towards the individual(s) who have pieces to this government created rebus. Another interesting point is that out of all the civil litigation against American Airlines for flight 77 passengers, about 30 or so have filed civil cases in federal court so far (see: http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/09/18/sept.11.lawsuits/index.html?_s=PM:US ). Another one for Asia Cottom is pending. It seems odd only half the families have pursued legal recourse or settled via the 9-11 Compensation Fund for their loss, doesn’t it, Mr. Hammond? Jeremy R. Hammond No, I did not ask you to prove a negative. I welcomed you to provide a hypothesis that better explains the evidence. And now I’m noting that you’ve declined to do so, which I take to mean that you can’t. MyWikiDisQus Of course I can’t. How could I or anyone else (including yourself) offer an alternative and plausible explanation as to what hit the Pentagon since the government has in its possession all the video evidence that tells the true story about this horrific crime? You showed photographs of human remains and assume the bodies are flight 77 passengers while disregarding the 125 Pentagon employees who perished in the west wing as well. How does that fact reconcile with your close minded opinion? You showed photographs of aircraft parts and assume they’re from flight 77 when no eye witness reported seeing the aircraft registration number that identified flight 77. None of that is conclusive proof because it can’t be tied back to the plane, there is no clear chain of custody. There were many eye witness accounts but the one that stands out in my mind is Penny Elgas. If you read her statement it reads like a short novella instead of the typical person who shockingly witnessed an aircraft impacting a government building (see: http://amhistory.si.edu/september11/collection/supporting.asp?ID=30 ). Her recall of the event was too detailed and used a style of prose that suggests she embellished her rendition to add drama and suspense. She wrote phrases such as, “In that split second, my brain flooded with adrenaline and I watched everything play out in ultra slow motion …” or “In my adrenaline-filled state of mind, I was overcome by my visual senses.” or even this one, “The plane seemed to be floating as if it were a paper glider and I watched in horror as it gently rocked and slowly glided straight into the Pentagon.” Yes, ‘watched in horror’, ‘slowly glided’, like she was in a dream even though the reality was the aircraft speed was over 500 mph at impact. Perhaps she will find her niche as a freelance writer with Reader’s Digest. You ask me to offer a different explanation as to what flew into the Pentagon. You believe it was flight 77 because the government and the media says it was, even though no major aircraft components were found outside the Pentagon such as the tail, wing, etc. Here is a photograph of an Airbus A310 crashing into a building in Russia (see: http://www.planecrashinfo.com/w20060709.htm ). The plane was moving at high speed when it impacted the building and burst into flames yet the tail and other identifiable parts e.g., fuselage, wing, etc. did not disintegrate unlike the complete disappearance of flight 77. So if flight 77 didn’t crash into the Pentagon then what did and where did the plane and its passengers go? I suggest you ask the U.S. Department of War because they know the truth. As for me, the real story is the hoax sold to the American people and you. Jeremy R. Hammond No, I not “believe it was flight 77 because the government and the media says it was”. Anyone even remotely familiar with my work exposing government and media lies — including the lie that fire caused the free fall collapse of WTC 7 — will recognize what a ludicrous suggestion that is. I know it was Flight 77 because the evidence that this was so is incontrovertible. It’s enough to observe that you are unable to present any alternative hypothesis that better fits the available evidence — which is to say you reject the scientific method. MyWikiDisQus The author of the article glossed over the “Test with an Experiment” step of the SM (Scientific Method) relative to the fighter plane experiment and the commercial aircraft flyover to brazenly suggest commingling characteristics and similarities of the two examples was sufficient to support his ‘large plane hit the Pentagon’ hypothesis. It is flawed and here is why: Understandably he could not duplicate what he believed happened in a controlled test so In order to properly correlate his explanation to a similar event, he would have had to pick a historical aircraft crash that represented a large plane flying through the air at high speed, approximately 4 feet off the ground when it terminated its flight by impacting a 77 foot high solid object. The physical evidence of such an event would have supported his theory. Obviously he was unable to that. He or a staff associate searched and found the F4 video shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=–_RGM4Abv8 . The F4 Phantom in terms of size and mass as compared to a Boeing 757-223 is significantly less. To suggest that both aircraft traveling at relatively the same speed (~500 knots) would result the same with respect to observable destruction and debris is not valid as it is clearly bias. The concrete wall moved in the video whereas the Pentagon wall did not which means the difference does not conform to the requirement that one variable must be constant in the test (see: http://teacher.nsrl.rochester.edu/phy_labs/appendixe/appendixe.html ). The airbus A310 flyover is shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26H-WzIe858 . The author chose this video to demonstrate how low a commercial aircraft can fly however it is not an acceptable test as the plane never dropped anywhere near the altitude that allegedly flight 77 did (~4 feet) prior to impact as you can see at the four second mark. Again, we see bias in this step which invalidates the author’s attempt to convince us he adhered to the SM. Large passenger airplanes are mostly hollow, they are not capable of punching through 300 feet of reinforced concrete and making a round hole at the end as we are led to believe occurred in the ‘C’ ring of the Pentagon. It has not been proven by anyone including the author of this article that it happened either by experiment or by any mathematical calculus. Therefore the idea the evidence is ‘incontrovertible’ is also false no matter how may times it is repeated as there are many questions left unanswered as to what really struck the Pentagon on 9/11. Brian Rogers there is no chain of custody for that evidence, and the fact of minimal wreckage actually really hurts your position, and you don’t even realize it. lol Brian Rogers you keep playing fast and loose with that term ‘incontrovertible’, do you know what that means Jeremy? And his logic makes much more sense than the ‘Honey Pot’. They played the towers videos being hit by the planes all day and then for weeks after and we still have video of it. Why not show the video of your non existent 757 hitting the Pentagon? No, if it were they’d have shown it over and over. peakchoicedotorg Why should they release more evidence — they had so much fun watching some of the truthers discredit themselves … hundreds of people saw the plane go into the building, hundreds more plucked plane parts, luggage, bodies from the rubble. http://rigorousintuition.blogspot.com/2005/05/cynical-sophisticated-and-subtle.html … consider the Pentagon crash, and the confiscation of the video from the service station security camera. That the video has never been released is regarded by many as damning evidence that authorities are trying to hide the true nature of the crash: that the video must reveal that it wasn’t Flight 77 but a missile, or a fighter jet. But think: perhaps the video remains hidden because some people are quite happy to mindf*ck the conspiracists and perpetuate an erroneous line of inquiry. Would they want to lay to rest a mistaken hypothesis, when it misdirects the efforts of so many? It may be that the question is not What have they got to hide? but rather, Why do they want us to think that they’re hiding something? Jeremy R. Hammond Your argument is a non sequitur. The evidence of a plane impact is incontrovertible (and, yes, I know what that word means; hence my repeatedly using it). Brian Rogers Actually the minimal wreckage ‘evidence’ actually hurts your case, and you didn’t even know it. Paul You clearly don’t understand the definition of “incontrovertible.” And, there are not “mountains” of evidence. There’s a piece or two of wreckage easily carried by one man. Where did the wings go? Jeremy R. Hammond incontrovertible (adj): not able to be doubted or questioned The evidence is incontrovertible that the plane hit the Pentagon. Do you expect that the wings would have just sheared off and been laying there intact on the ground in front of the Pentagon? Paul It’s not that a plane didn’t hit (it probably did) but it certainly was not a 110 foot wide plane, there’s no doubt about that whatsoever. MrKoenig Plane wreckage inside and outside the Pentagon, skin sheets in the color of American Airlines, also including engine/landing gear parth, the both flight recorders, and even found passenger DNA, THAT is just “circumstancial evidence” for an airliner impact? Wow! How do you know, that the Government withholding more than what it has already released, including the two gate cams recorded at 1 fps? Do you really think that the Pentagon has all its CCTV cams pointed on to the fly path of the attacking aircraft? That would be odd, don’t you think? The problem with most of the no-airliner propoents is, that they usually do all ignore the photographic and testimonial evidence because it contradicts their belief. Explain to me how a missile, truck bomb or a Global Hawk can leave such wreckage, plant DNA and create the photographically recorded damage path outside and inside the building, and fooling of hundreds of witnesses! MyWikiDisQus All the discussion is around the 85 or so external cameras that surrounded the Pentagon that were confiscated by the FBI. The external short blurred video provided to the public does not show anything conclusive that a commercial aircraft hit the building. Do you honestly believe that’s the best the Department of Justice can show us? What about the multitude of internal CCTV cameras inside the complex? Surely there are some installed on every floor that captured video evidence of a large body moving rapidly through the rings.The military refuses to release any of them, what are they covering up? If you believe the published report of the 9/11 commission regarding the destruction of WTC 1, 2 and 7 then there is no point in challenging the Pentagon incident or the Shanksville PA “let’ roll” story either. But if you suspect the government is lying about this monumental epic in American history, then you have to be skeptical about everything we have been told, everything. andy No Planer Alert!!!! We’re skeptical that you graduated from Middle School. Just to make it easy for you,tiger:The Pentagon was made of far stronger stuff than Tower 1’s outer sheath. Do yourself a solid: https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/introduction Brian Rogers you mean the limited wreckage footage with no chain of custody evidence? It hurts your case. And stop saying hundreds of witnesses, only very very few claimed to be impact witnesses so …stop that propaganda. Paul Why remove a frame from the security camera footage that was released? it’s been proven, they removed a frame, and the only frame that would show the object. Seems highly suspicious. The burden of proof is on those making the extraordinary claim, and the claim that a plane hit the Pentagon is very extraordinary (never happened before or since). Their proof is very lackluster, considering we’re still seriously arguing about it 15 years later. They should have at least one photo by now, be it from a surveillance camera or a satellite, they should have *something.* The fact they don’t seem to have anything, other than a single video with the key frame mysteriously missing, is proof enough that either it wasn’t a 767, or they are intentionally goading the 911 truth movement into believing that it wasn’t. It’s ridiculous to think they accidentally removed that frame and they accidentally didn’t have any other cameras pointing at the most important public US military structure in the world. They were even renovating that side, and had dozens of contractors on base, you really think they didn’t have cameras on the workers? Where are the video tapes? Please. Also, small pieces of wreckage on the lawn isn’t really proof since there were multiple credible reports of men in suits showing up and tampering with the physical site within minutes of the event. There were no items found that I’m aware of that were too heavy to be lifted by one man, which is rather odd for a wreck in which the wings had to break off since they couldn’t fit in the initial hole. What the men in suits were doing exactly (removing stuff, leaving false evidence, etc.) isn’t agreed upon, but there is agreement that they were there and they were messing with the scene. Anything found is contaminated. We need a photo or video, and they must have one. Jeremy R. Hammond Even if we accept your claim that a frame was removed from the video, so what? Do you have another hypothesis that better explains all the other evidence? No, you don’t. Are you trying to suggest that the debris was hurriedly planted there? Paul Not that hurriedly. But yes. andy WikiDiki,produce the witness or pipe down.Personally,I think you’re full of it. MyWikiDisQus “Pffft” You know what that is? It’s the onomatopoeic sound for bug spray. You’re a bug, now go away. andy That’s your response to my request for you to produce a witness known only to you,Buggy? Where is this person and why have they never been produced for a video clip or a paper? MyWikiDisQus Pffft, Pfttt, Pfttt. Apparently you’re a persistent bug that needs a greater dose of sarcasm. andy I rest my case! Brian Rogers lol, If you’ve studied the Pentagon issue you’d know there are not a hundred impact witnesses, not even close to 30, and there’s even problems with those. And then leaving out the more credible north path witnesses is deplorable. This was dealt with back in 2006, just a regurgitation of a failed theory. Why would they do this? To seem more relevant, could be…but that makes zero sense. To actually use the scientific method, you can’t ignore evidence, you have to make sense of all of it. Have a good day, thumbs down to your name calling. BrotherPatriot What a bunch of rubbish. Once you actually take the time…research…and learn…it becomes obvious jet fuel didn’t cause the towers to come down and it wasn’t Tim Osman (*cough* I mean Osama Bin Laden *cough*) who masterminded the false flag attack upon us on that fateful day. Awaken faster America & people of the world… HOOYAH & God Bless. andy It was massive impacts and jet fuel ignited fires,you blithering idiot. And don’t even start with your cult’s lying talking points about #7,which was smashed into by the collapse of #1 and burned uncontrollably for hours before the FDNY knew it was a goner and created a perimeter. BrotherPatriot You are a completely daft… #1…did NOT smash into #7. The fires in #7 did minor damage. Nice try but apparently you fail at research as well as making a valid point. It was….”Pulled.” ^^ That terminology is used with controlled demolition… You have much to learn, grasshopper. andy You and your miserable controlled demolition cult are a raft of daft. ‘Pull’ is NOT slang for explosive demolitions but literally means to pull down with steel cords the damaged carcass of a building no more than 4,5,6 stories. This is where Jew hating Holocaust denier Eric Hufschmid,the Godfather of your cult,led you wrong with the abject lie about ‘pull’.Clever guy,he. Larry Silverstein was clearly referring to the perimeter created by the FDNY when they knew the building would eventually collapse.Everyone was pulled back and away from a dangerous situation. As the FDNY stated,the building was “fully involved” in fires and had developed a bulge in its north face where beams and debris from the collapse of #1 had smashed into it.It was emanating the creaks and groans only a compromised structure would How do you think all the fires started anyway,Captain Bugs? BrotherPatriot Just continue spewing your rubbish…fewer and fewer people are believing your kinds lies & deceit. A reckoning is coming…and it won’t be the “culling” that you all are expecting. Wasting no further time with you. andy Fine with me,I’ve already clobbered your cult and linked you to all the evidence and testimony you’ll need to remove yourself from the clutches of such malarkey. This will help as well: andy Actually,fewer and fewer people are buying what you’re selling after they look in depth at both arguments.Your quasi-spiritual mumbo-jumbo about a ‘reckoning’ is one of the many things that has rendered the 9/11 truth stuff to the margins of public discourse. Particularly #7 has been shown to not be what you insist and not least the controlled demolition of the nutty ‘no-plane hit the Pentagon’ crowd which can be seen here in this paper. Jeremy R. Hammond The topic of this thread is the Pentagon. Please keep your comments on topic. andy It’s perfectly OK for your sad “BrotherPatriot” to spew the racist tripe about Larry Silverstein but I’m off base talking about the issue. The fact that you are silent in the face of such a vile argument while getting all snippy with me speaks volumes about yourself Jeremy R. Hammond My comment goes for both of you. As for racist tripe, if I see it, I will ban the commenter. In this case, BrotherPatriot didn’t even mention Silverstein. Rather, it’s you who brought up his name and falsely attributed to BrotherPatriot “racist tripe” — which is just another example of how you’ve gotten yourself banned from this site for violation of the terms of use of the comments section. Troll elsewhere. Jeremy R. Hammond As NIST itself pointed out, the impact from debris from the collapse of WTC 1 was not a contributing factor in the collapse of WTC 7. As for its claim that fires caused the free fall collapse, their report in this regard is riddled with scientific fraud. Free fall means no energy was available to do the work of buckling the columns, as required by their fire-induced collapse hypothesis. andy The impacts created the fires and gouged a hole 15 stories high and despite what NIST says a bulge had developed in the area of the north face where debris and beams from #1 crashed into it. You seem to think that the FDNY is part of a scientific fraud.Their testimony clearly proves that the building collapsed from something other than unduly quiet explosives. Jeremy R. Hammond I defer to my previous comment. If you’d like to discuss WTC 7 further, do so on any of the articles at FPJ about that subject. This thread is about the Pentagon. Jerry Hamilton What a marvelous but ridiculous attempt at deception by the author. I can only believe he knows full well he is lying as only a nincompoop could think it is true. Give us a break. Save it for children’s hour. MrKoenig Refute his arguments or stop the ad hom and shut up! Jerry Hamilton What a horrible little man you are. If you want to believe in fairy stories… You are welcome to. Just don’t force them on others. Now bog off. MrKoenig Your name calling doesn’t change that fact. andy Endgame for 9/11 “truth” saps.They are now in the final stages and have become total self-caricatures. Exhibit A,Jerry,who’s such a bozo that it’s entirely plausible that he’s a disinfo operative tasked with making “truthers” look like imbeciles. Jerry Hamilton Americans are now deciding who to vote for, not that an honest outcome is expected. Do you still not get it? Voting for the lesser of two evils is still evil. Brian Rogers Trump “Bombs were in the buildings” …pretty clear to me ‘not evil’ but insightful. mydogsays There is so much evidence that disputes the AA Flight 77 impact conclusion from the words of U.S. Army Major General Albert Stubblebine to the extensive research of Barbara Honegger, to the eyewitnesses in the CIT presentation to all of those at Pilots for 9/11 Truth, I have to snicker at the author’s unabashed bravado. Freedom or death What a bunch of crap, this story. Show one video of a plane crashing into Pentagon.There was Zero indication a plane crashed there, zero. And it has been proven that the plane could not have maneuvered that way. MrKoenig Your comment is a good indication of your lacking in-depth research into this issue. Freedom or death Explain MrKoenig Explain why the article above is crap first. Trashing baselessly someone’s work then demanding an explanation why the trashing is baseless. That’s bold, my friend. Freedom or death You are absolutely full of it. They have none of that stuff from the plane. So many camera and not one clear video. I’m not going too argue with you. You are either an operative or one dumb son of a bitch andy Andy Warhol once said: “Paranoid,I don’t even know the meaning of the word”. Brian Rogers Start with the CIT response to Chandler/Cole. Which Chandler childishly refuses to deal with. So sad. Paul No, the article itself shows lack of in-depth research. Look into the discrepancies between the two pentagon security cameras which have had their footage released. It is clear that whatever hit the Pentagon was taken out of the video that should have shown it clearly. A frame was removed, and that is conclusively proven. Why remove a frame? Why remove the one frame that would show what hit the Pentagon, if it was a 767? Jeremy R. Hammond Show us that this frame was removed, as you claim. Brian Rogers I hope that my humble paper can shine some light on why the official story is simply to incredible to be true, and that the pushers of this theory do NOT use the scientific method because they ignore other evidence to reach their conclusions. https://www.facebook.com/notes/brian-rogers/going-beyond-speculation-the-pentagon-official-govt-story-and-some-truthers-prea/10153613242615049/ or https://docs.google.com/document/d/139gLphbSuOklnO6fsxEDz__bBmIrF-TmeLfV4-KEiPU/edit https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0d44ddea468413a10fca03c201732599d4676b3ab8a8ac78e783d7a8ae7b7ecc.jpg Michael Atkinson Regardless of the Pentagon debate, 9-11-01 was an obvious inside job.

Jeremy R. Hammond What amazes me is that people within the “Truth” movement persist in this untenable position that no plane hit the Pentagon. This claim has done untold harm to the movement by seriously undermining its credibility. The evidence of the plane impact is incontrovertible. Brian Rogers Jeremy has used ‘incontrovertible’ fast and loosely dozens of times on this thread. :/ Jeremy R. Hammond I have used the word “incontrovertible” very precisely here. Brian Rogers precisely without warrant or evidence yes. Jeremy R. Hammond Precisely according to its meaning: “not able to be doubted or questioned”. Except by the willfully ignorant, of course. peakchoicedotorg Always has been incontrovertible. The no plane hoax was debunked from the start by some of the best 9/11 truth researchers, notably John Judge. It was a clever hoax to distract, nothing more. Sorry anyone thinks it’s worth anything to debunk a decade and a half later, old story at this point. Meanwhile, how many “truth” activists know about Alec Station, the plane into building exercise near Dulles that morning, the FBI, CIA and DIA lower level agents who tried to stop the attacks, the non response of the NSA warning system during the attacks, to cite a few areas that might yield more results. andy Great points! The controlled demolition cult and this garbage have forever ruined the work of serious people regarding that day. Buried in BS,the real dirt is now egg all over a million faces. A truly sad thing to watch unfold. peakchoicedotorg The “no plane” hoax was debunked from the start. Glad some people finally admit it was bogus – a decade and a half later – but there was never any evidence the plane crash did not happen and lots that it did. The first person to hint a “missile” hit the Pentagon was War Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, whose lack of sincerity should be obvious. A bigger question is why some “truth” seekers were unable to admit they were snookered. Meanwhile, the suppressed warnings, Air Force stand down and Alec Station are ignored by most of the 9/11 Half Truth Movement. Brian Rogers the missile slip from Rumsfeld was anything but evidence. peakchoicedotorg It was a setup, not a slip. — Just because someone says the government is lying does not mean they are telling the truth.” — John Judge http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/JohnJudge/PAandAAF77.html The Pentagon Attack and American Airlines Flight 77 by John Judge “Hundreds of people saw the plane from windows of nearby buildings, from cars along the nearby highways, and some ducked because it flew over so low. Pentagon employees and construction workers at the site saw the events unfold before their eyes. Hundreds more took part in the clean-up operation and saw the wreckage. It is not difficult to find eyewitnesses to the event in DC. … “Families of victims and others who work at the airlines, as well as many witnesses I have spoken to, are offended and shocked by these unfounded speculations. Those willing to do a modicum of investigative work here in DC will be quickly disabused of this disinformation. “There are many legitimate unanswered questions about the events of September 11, 2001, its sponsorship, and the official version of events. We benefit from serious research and the issues raised by victim’s families seeking accountability. Not the least of these is the apparent lack of standard FAA/NORAD response to these emergency events. Rather than use our time proving and belaboring the obvious, or focusing on areas of total speculation that can only hurt our public credibility, I encourage serious researchers to focus on the historical context of the event, the alleged conspirators, the funding, and the government response or lack of it.” http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/JohnJudge/notAllCequal.html Not all conspiracies are created equal by John Judge Brian Rogers ///it was setup not a slip //// sounds suspiciously like unfounded opinion, how do you carnac that? peakchoicedotorg http://www.ratical.org/ratville/JFK/JohnJudge/f77FoF.html Flight of Fantasy: 23 October 2002 …. There is no question that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon. Remaining agnostic on this point also gives ammunition to the perpetrators of the stand-down and serves to discredit the other good work that continues to be done about the reality of what happened that day. It is my feeling that this thesis was actually part of an intentional disinformation campaign that spreads red herrings to discredit the real findings. “These conspiracy theorists will believe anything” say our detractors. Let’s discover and present the hard facts and force the coincidence theorists to come up with plausible explanations instead of spewing out speculations we cannot back up and leaving ourselves on the defensive. Brian Rogers from that article you posted, I couldn’t get past 8 seconds in reading before the same lies from 2006… Ahahahahahahahaaahahahahahaha. //////We know the plane hit here in DC, because people saw it, hundreds of them.///////////// Again, like in my paper, here are the sources of the witness list, which is btw, unverified, and therefore UNRELIABLE, but we’ll go there for sake of argument. You people really need to stop lying. https://www.facebook.com/notes/brian-rogers/pentagon-witnesses-911-various-sources/10153625485875049 peakchoicedotorg A post on facebook does not invalidate anything, sorry. Of the six witnesses I personally know of, only one had their observations on line. It’s hard for someone spouting “truth” to admit having been fooled. Get over it. Meanwhile, who points out the suppressed warnings before the attack and the wargames during the attack that confused the air defense response? andy Not to mention how al-Midhar and al-Hazmi weren’t rolled up well before that day or the destruction of all records of the Able Danger program. Or,how in hell Moussaoui’s laptop remained unopened despite qualified FBI people screaming and yelling that they were sure he was part of an imminent hijacking operation. peakchoicedotorg Well, if the FBI had been allowed to look at his laptop before the attack then the New Pearl Harbor / American Reichstag Fire could not have happened … andy Agreed. Brian Rogers Refutation of Chandler … https://www.facebook.com/notes/brian-rogers/going-beyond-speculation-the-pentagon-official-govt-story-and-some-truthers-prea/10153613242615049 Brian Rogers if you notice on google, if you search Going Beyond Speculation, you’ll see I’m listed right under Chandlers Presentation lol, and it’s a facebook note!! lol. Constantly getting questions about my paper ..’why won’t chandler respond to colleagues within the movement?’ My answer, he’s unprofessional. Did some great work on the towers, but on the pentagon, he’s jumped the shark. jayr. Unlock the grip on the photos at the scene and all of this argument should be cleaned up in no time. But there are powers that want this to remain in the dark. Ha and they call us conspiracy theorists. . Jeremy R. Hammond You comment as though there wasn’t incontrovertible forensic evidence proving that the plane hit the Pentagon. There is. Brian Rogers you know, saying “incontrovertible” over and over doesn’t make it so Jeremy, tell us again about the hundreds of impact witnesses… Jeremy R. Hammond You know, denying the incontrovertible evidence of a plane impact over and over doesn’t make it any less of a proven fact. Brian Rogers are you aware of how little wreckage you have and the images seem to indicate fbi and others walking the parts from the emergency building out TO THE LAWN, and others milling around on the lawn with parts in hand minutes after the so called impact. They didn’t want to help with body removal?? Gotta get them parts placed for good photo ops immediately. Where’s your chain of custody? Even the witness list is unverified and you only have very few impact witnesses even though Chandler lies and says hundreds, you and he should be ashamed of yourself for supporting this unscientific drivel. https://www.facebook.com/notes/brian-rogers/going-beyond-speculation-the-pentagon-official-govt-story-and-some-truthers-prea/10153613242615049/ Jeremy R. Hammond What is unscientific drivel is denying the incontrovertible evidence of a plane impact, including the impact damage, identifiable plane debris, and remains of the victims. adamsyed What horrible scholarship. For a real serious counter to this sorry paper, watch the Pentagon chapter of Massimo Mazzucco’s film “The New Pearl Harbour” for a thorough refutation regarding the arguments in favor of the physical evidence being sufficient for a 757 crash. You see, Wyndham, Hoffman, Legge, Chandler, and Cole use the same arguments that “debunkers” use when arguing in favor of the physical i.e. photographic evidence being consistent with the 757 crash. And Mazzucco’s film is unique in that it shows us what the “debunkers'” arguments are with every aspect of 9/11 Truth, and why those arguments and claims miss the mark. And worst of all, Wyndham does not even mention the “North of the Citgo” flight path evidence that had been uncovered between 2006 and 2009 by Citizen Investigation Team or CIT. The paper accepts, at face value, the official account that the plane flew south of Columbia Pike, south of the Navy Annex and finally south of the Citgo and hit the 5 specific light poles seen in photos and video. The paper alarmingly accepts, at face value, the story of cab driver Lloyde England, even though there are several serious inconsistencies within Lloyde’s own tellings of the story, not to mention external contradictions from other witnesses who swear to a northerly flight path, inconsistent with the light pole vector, and finally not to mention that Lloyde’s story about himself and a ‘silent stranger’ removing the pole from the car and placing it on the pavement is not corroborated by any other witness. His story is also physically implausible, both the pole impact and the removal of. Also omitted is the testimony of Pentagon officer Roosevelt Roberts Jr., who was at the edge of the Pentagon’s interior when the huge explosion [presumably the crash] rocked the building, and within “ten seconds tops” he was outside at the loading dock, and saw the approach plane, a “commercial aircraft,” flying over the south parking lot, just above the light poles, AWAY from the Pentagon. These are just a few of many more omissions and face-value acceptances of official evidence. Obviously, evidence pointing towards staged physical damage [light poles] and a plane flying away from the building points to a total Inside Job at the MIHOP [made it happen on purpose] level. Wyndham’s omission of these facts is deliberate and conscious, because himself, Chandler, Legge and rest of them have been well aware of it since 2009. Brian Rogers It is a truly tragic paper on many levels, I’m surprised they didn’t do ‘due diligence’ to review it for these errors and exclusions. It’s like a term paper done the night before it’s due after a drinking binge. Jeremy R. Hammond If you think the article contains errors, you are welcome to point out what you think they are. Jeremy R. Hammond What horrible scholarship. You are welcome to point to any errors you think exist in the piece. I would merely note you haven’t done so. Please also familiarize yourself with the terms of use of the comments section. And worst of all, Wyndham does not even mention the “North of the Citgo” flight path evidence that had been uncovered between 2006 and 2009 by Citizen Investigation Team or CIT. On the contrary, the article does mention the CIT’s hypothesis and notes how untenable it is. These are just a few of many more omissions and face-value acceptances of official evidence. You are welcome to provide us with Roberts’ full statement. reallysearching And Jeremy, you are welcome to remember that pretty much the only things that are conclusive on this planet are taxes and death. You might want to knock that chip off your shoulder and join reality. You don’t have a market on the truth, the gov’t doesn’t have a market on the truth, and quite frankly, pretty much *everyone* that comes here is going to think that between you and I, one of us is an a**, but we are BOTH going to get votes in that direction. Nice of you to point out adamsyed’s comment obviously strikes a nerve, though ;) Jeremy R. Hammond I take from your comment that you, too, maintain that the above article is in error, but would merely observe that you’ve also declined to present an argument to support that view. I advise you, too, to familiarize yourself with the terms of use of the comments section. andy The usual flailing from another nutty wing of the controlled demolition cult. Nice job with this important article,Jeremy. Jeremy R. Hammond Andy, this discussion here isn’t about the WTC buildings, but the Pentagon. Yes, a plane hit the Pentagon; but, yes, the three WTC collapses were the result of controlled demolition. andy I disagree about demolitions and have responded elsewhere on this thread. andy Imagine Adam Syed,tyhe regular riot of truth talking about “willfully ignored evidence”! This is the same goof who assiduously refuses to do the simple research of the oral testimonies of the FDNY,which definitively and irrefutably prove that his sacred Building 7 was not blown up and collapsed after sustaining severe damage and raging uncontrollable fires. The only question that remains is this doofus on the same payroll as nutjobs like Les Jamieson and Alex Jones. Jeremy R. Hammond The free fall collapse of WTC 7 means no energy was available to do the work of buckling columns, as required by the fire-induced collapse hypothesis. But the topic here is the Pentagon. Please keep your comments on topic. andy I’ll just respond to you and the others and then let it go. I could easily prove you wrong,particularly about #7 as the proof is contained in the oral testimonies of the FDNY. If you care to engage privately,here or on another thread,I’m game. There was only a brief period of free fall and it certainly didn’t fall into its own footprint. Again,let me prove it to you civilly,as you are demonstrably in error. Thanks Jeremy R. Hammond The laws of physics were not suspended on 9/11. You are welcome to search FPJ for articles on the subject of WTC 7 and discuss that subject there. The subject of this thread is the Pentagon. andy Blowhard nutjob Adam Syed is so obsequious and useless that he needs Jeremy Hammond to respond to his critics. Being a self appointed cult “leader” (we’re certain he magnanimously refers to himself as a “facilitator”) he’s not able to handle real questions and strong rejoinders. The 9/11 “truth” movement in a nutshell! Or should we say,a husk of its former shell. Jeremy R. Hammond Since you’ve seemed so intent on getting yourself banned for violating the terms of use of the comments section of this site, I’ve granted your wish. whatwaysup All due respect to the panel, but “Beyond Reasonable Doubt” is not achieved. Certainty is not achieved. Probability is not achieved by this ‘closure’ motion. It is an Official narrative/position, backed by STATES evidence. Well or ill presented. Until ALL evidence is properly adjudicated – cross-examined – contested – in a courts of Law, under oath, and on -the-record, this remains a highly polished, published, but open, narrative. Given the fact that 911 is a fantastically sophisticated false flag operation as already established by the building behaviour forensics; that the Pentagon would not be, can be argued as against the flow of probability. Either way, until ALL evidence is made available for proper (due diligence) contest, ALL differing evidence chains remain, untested, and viable . Especially NOC. You cannot bring closure to an issue that remains open by virtue of the fact. andy The 9/11 “truth” movement is straight out of the Three Stooges,throwing haymaker after haymaker and hitting only themselves in the face. When you consider that they are actually still stuck in the LaBrea Tarpits like some demented woolly mammoth regarding the collapse of #7,it’s a wonder they haven’t all dried up and blown away like a bunch of tumble weeds. Dollars to donuts that if we scroll down these comments we’ll find the usual cast of idiots rattling on about Larry Silverstein pulling the tower and then scamming his insurance companies over the settlements.You just cannot make up stuff as stupid as that crowd. Jeremy R. Hammond The free fall collapse of WTC 7 means there was no energy available to do the work of buckling columns as required by the fire-induced collapse hypothesis. andy The FDNY knew it would collapse by 2 PM and created a perimeter.Since it is inconceivable that the oral testimonies were faked or that the FDNY is part of a conspiracy I urge you to look at the paper I linked (wtc7lies) and carefully investigate what the the real experts on burning buildings,the FDNY,say about #7. Jeremy R. Hammond Proof of foreknowledge of the collapse of WTC 7 hardly belies the fact that its free fall collapse means there was no energy available to do the work of buckling columns as required by the fire-induced collapse hypothesis. This thread is about the Pentagon. If you wish to discuss WTC 7, search FPJ for any of the articles on that topic and comment there. andy As I said to you earlier,Mr. Hammond,I merely wanted to respond to responses to my comments,among them are some from you.Curious that you fire off an argument in response to my points and then lecture me about not arguing the point. I’ve made my points and don’t plan to continue.However,if someone responds over the next days to anything I’ve said I trust that you will allow me to respond. The argument against/for demolitions at WTC are related to this thread,by the way,so I don’t really get your narrow definition of boundaries. By the way,the building had only a brief period of free-fall during its 15 second global collapse,which can be explained by the unusual construction of the building. Thanks. Jeremy R. Hammond Please stay on the topic of the Pentagon. If you’d like to continue the discussion of WTC 7, do so on one of the articles on that subject. andy That’s the fourth time,are you a robot? Jeremy R. Hammond If you have something intelligence to add to the discussion of the Pentagon, you are welcome to do so. As you seem disinclined to, you are on notice for trolling. Final warning. andy What could I add to John Judge or Mr. Wyndham? The pathology that they expose and the #7 rubbish are part and parcel of the problems inherent in this issue. Jeremy R. Hammond Anyone wishing to learn more about the controlled demolition of WTC 7 can find more here: http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/?s=wtc+7 Jeremy R. Hammond Great, then we agree you’ve had nothing intelligent to add to the discussion. Glad to come finally to a resolution. Jeremy R. Hammond Wow. What a fantastically juvenile strawman argument. I didn’t say that the energy went away. I said “The free fall collapse of WTC 7 means there was no energy available to do the work of buckling columns as required by the fire-induced collapse hypothesis.” So let me reiterate for you what that means: it means that all of the building’s potential energy was converted to kinetic energy. And, since you obviously don’t have a clue about simple high school physics, let me explain further what that means: An object in free fall can do no work, as all of its gravitational potential energy is being used in accelerating the object toward the ground. Conversely, if the mass of WTC 7 had been doing the work of buckling columns, it wouldn’t have been in free fall. So, once again (and perhaps this time you’ll be able to comprehend): The free fall collapse of WTC 7 means there was no energy available to do the work of buckling columns as required by the fire-induced collapse hypothesis. The laws of physics were not suspended on 9/11. Now, if you’d like to discuss the subject of WTC 7 further, please search FPJ and find one of its articles on that subject and comment there. The topic of this thread is the Pentagon. andy I have no doubt that you’ll eventually “comprehend” that the FDNY testimony obviates all of the computer modeling that biased scientists proffer.It’s actually a no-brainer. And,why is it OK for you to argue the demolition case but not OK for us? Jeremy R. Hammond The only computer modeling that biased scientists have proffered that I’m aware of is NIST’s. If you’d like to discuss WTC 7, do so on one of the FPJ articles about that topic. The topic being discussed here is the Pentagon. Last warning. andy Puh-leeze Mr. Fennerman! I’ve been banned from every 9/11 website,from the ridiculous (Infowars) to the sublime ( Russ Baker’s site) in my efforts to sound an alarum that the controlled demolition stuff is a dead end and easily dismissed by a general public alerted by more substantial stuff.Quite simply,it’s a cult and has the perspective of a fruit fly.It has no awareness of the plethora of evidence and arguments that render it useless and self-immolating.The sheer amount of dunces who actually still trot out the “Larry said to pull it” boggles the mind.Something tells me you’re on board that racist train. Hell,even Richard Gage subscribes to that malarkey. Like every other self appointed “leader” of the discussion of these important issues you have every attribute of the Bhagwan Shree Rashneesh’s security staff,who helped keep his saucer eyed followers from the information that he was banging every sannyasin in sight,criminally importing hash by the truckload and spending all you and your folks’ hard earned donations buying a fleet of Rolls-Royces. The fact that you keep arguing the issue while feigning stringent moderation coins you as everything that’s wrong with the 9/11 movement.A movement which has crab-walked itself into a corner and metamorphosized into the nutty,dead-enders Controlled Demolition Cult. Not only is it beyond ridiculous that you utterly reject the testimony of the firemen who were there that day,it is truly sad that you have so little confidence in the serious information that has been dug up over the past 15 years which hasn’t been argued against,much less debunked. A lack of confidence so profound that you lurch absurdly towards the least provable and,indeed,the most easily disproven,speculative plank that has poisoned the movement for years. If you think I could give a hoot about your hapless,weak minded warning then you really don’t have a clue. Since only a paltry few still tune into sites like yours,911truth or 911blogger etc. I understand that I’ve already hit the few dozen here with all the nutritious beef stew (‘wtc7lies’ paper and “WTC Not a Demolition” video on youtube and the oral testimonies of the FDNY concerning #7) they will need to extract themselves from the morass you all are in. You can threaten me with Soviet style censor all you want,all it does is show your slip and reinforce the reputation of the “truth” movement as a nutty bunch who drove themselves over to the outskirts of the lunatic fringe. The only thing I have to say to you is that your pretentious butt can take a flying fuck at a rolling donut and you should spend more of your time disabusing the numerous schnooks from the absurd,anti-Semitic powered argument about your cult’s Sacred Tower 7. Jeremy R. Hammond Well, now you’ve gone and gotten yourself banned, here, too, for violating the terms of use of the comments section. andy You’re not aware of much except the moldy rotting talking points that have been amply shown to be misinformation,when not disinformation. Take a hike,son. Threaten your kittens and goldfish and threaten Richard Gage for the major malfunction of falling for the “pull it” slander,numbnuts. Paul Large plane, perhaps. 767 or 757, definitely not. You don’t need to look past the initial photographs to tell that, unless the plane had exotic weaponry directed at it, a 767 could not have crashed there. The hole is too small for it to fit, and the debris outside is too sparse to make up for it. Jeremy R. Hammond That’s simply wrong. Free e-Book!

US House votes to kill Boeing and Airbus sales to Iran 24/7 Wall St. 2 days ago Paul Ausick This has not been a particularly good week for Boeing. On Tuesday, one of its largest customers, United Continental Holdings announced that it will defer delivery of 61 Boeing 737-700s and substitute four 737-800s in its order for delivery next year. The announcement triggered a sell-off in Boeing stock, and the share price dropped about $5 as of the end of trading on Thursday. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 146.35 +1.02 +0.70% United Continental Holdings Inc UAL ▲ 68.29 +0.43 +0.63% Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc SPR ▼ 55.51 -0.47 -0.84% Then on Wednesday the company said it will chop 500 jobs over four years in its defense division and close two plants, shifting about 2,500 employees to new work sites. But the week wasn't over yet. Late Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill blocking the sale of Boeing and Airbus commercial jets to Iran. Both Boeing and Airbus had plans in place to sell or lease about 200 planes to Iran, but the passage of the House bill forbids the Treasury Department from issuing licenses for the sale, and that means that U.S. banks will not be able to help finance any sales. Although Airbus is based in France, it is affected by the ban because at least 10% of its airplanes' components are made in the United States. The House bill is unlikely to become law in the waning days of the Obama administration, but when the new Trump administration takes over in January, with Republican control of both the Senate and the House, such a restriction might well be pushed through. Trump is also on record as opposed both to Boeing's plan to build an assembly plant in China and to the nuclear deal struck with Iran that lifted sanctions against the Islamic Republic and enabled the country to ramp up its oil exports and do business with companies like Boeing and Airbus. Boeing does nothing to help its cause by announcing that it plans to fire 500 workers. The President-elect's campaign promise to make the country great again depends on his ability to create more U.S. jobs, not jobs in China and Mexico for U.S. companies and their shareholders to profit from while American workers are left behind. As for the event that started Boeing's awful week, the United Continental deferral of delivery on new 737-700s and switching four orders to the larger 737-800s, this might have been good, rather than, bad news for Boeing. As Scott Hamilton at Leeham News points out, the switch to the larger plane and eventually to the 737 MAX family, Boeing stands to earn more profits than from the selling the smallest commercial jet it makes. Hamilton also notes that swapping one model for another is "routinely included [in] contract provisions." In the short run, Boeing has plenty of orders for the 737, and United's deferral simply means pulling some orders forward. That should present no problem for the company. And company that makes the 737 fuselage, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, has actually seen its share price rise after dipping briefly following the United Continental announcement. That doesn't sound like Boeing is making plans to trim production of the plane. In Friday's premarket session, Boeing shares traded up about 0.1% at $145.45, after closing Thursday at $145.33. The stock's 52-week range is $102.10 to $150.59, and the consensus 12-month price target is $151.00.

The firm recently introduced its Focus names list of stocks, and in their words: All of the 23 Franchise Picks are part of this list, but many more are included as well and these are institutionally relevant stocks where Jefferies analysts have observed elevated investor interest in their views, and the analysis around these stocks is often differentiated. Many of them are top picks. We screened this list by sectors to find top companies that are not only favorites at Jefferies, but that also may fare well in the new era of Trumponomics. We think the industrials should fare very well under the new administration, with defense and aerospace standing out. We found five outstanding picks on the focus list, and of course, all are rated Buy at Jefferies. Boeing This top aerospace industrial is finally up slightly for 2016 after some rough going earlier in the year. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services, and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight, and launch systems and services worldwide. Top analysts have noted that the commercial aerospace business is cyclical, and there are some indications that airlines may have expanded their wide-body fleets too aggressively in recent years, suggesting a period of weaker demand going forward. In addition, the fall in oil prices reduces the incentive to upgrade to the most fuel-efficient planes. Boeing is launching refreshed versions of the 737 and the 777 in the next couple of years. The company was recently awarded a $478.79 million contract for engineering manufacturing and development of a Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System for the F-15 Eagle fighter jet. With Donald Trump’s pledge to rebuild the military, a positive for the aerospace and defense sector, the stock looks like a solid valuation play at current levels. Boeing investors are paid a solid 3% dividend. The Jefferies price target for the stock is $165, and the Wall Street consensus price target is $151. The shares closed trading on Thursday at $145.33. General Dynamics This company, like other major defense prime contractors, had a very solid year and also makes the Focus list at Jefferies. General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE: GD) is a worldwide aerospace and defense company, and it has over 96,000 employees worldwide. General Dynamics operates through four business groups: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology. The U.S. government is its largest customer, which should continue to bode well as Congress remains in Republican hands after the recent elections. The U.S. Coast Guard recently awarded General Dynamics Mission Systems a $125.6 million follow-on contract to provide Rescue 21 program management, system support and maintenance and sustainment engineering support for the U.S. Coast Guard Command, Control and Communications Engineering Center. Shareholders are paid a 1.83% dividend. Jefferies has a $175 price target, while the consensus estimate is set at $175.94. The stock closed most recently at $165.63 a share.

The timeline for the proposed rulemaking was included in a regulatory update on OMB’s website, as our Lauren Gardner reports for Pros. Story Continued Below Under a microscope: Lauren notes that both lobbyists and Republican lawmakers are closely watching any moves the administration makes on new regulations before President-elect Donald Trump enters office. While the new Trump DOT could simply rescind a proposed rulemaking, like the pending voice calls one, it would take an act of Congress to reverse a rule that gets finalized. In other rules: FAA has slated its “drones-over-people” rule for December. And FRA is supposed to issue a final rule (decried by freights but praised by labor) establishing requirements for the minimum sizes of train crews in January. But, as Lauren reports, it’s uncertain whether members of Congress would try to overturn the final rule if it comes before Inauguration Day.

HOUSE PASSES ‘MIDNIGHT RULES’ BILL: While we’re on the topic of last-minute rules, the House voted largely along party lines Thursday to pass legislation that would allow lawmakers to bundle regulations issued in the last year of a presidential administration and challenge them all at once. Republican supporters of H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act, said it would prevent the legislative branch from getting bogged down with Congressional Review Act resolutions, as Pro Energy’s Alex Guillén reports. The White House has threatened to veto the bill. … AND A BILL ON PLANE SALES TO IRAN: Speaking of legislation the president would veto, the House passed a bill Thursday to ban the Treasury Department from granting the kinds of licenses to banks that are necessary for finalizing passenger aircraft sales to Iran. Two months ago, Airbus and Boeing received the OK to sell commercial aircraft to Iran. Iran Air has struck deals with Airbus and Boeing to buy and lease a total of over 200 planes, as The Associated Press reports. Those agreements are estimated to be worth billions of dollars. Democrats who voted against the bill, H.R. 5711, said the Boeing and Airbus deals would lead to more jobs. But GOP lawmakers argued that Iran has sponsored terrorism and defied United Nations resolutions. PELOSI AND PENCE TALK INFRASTRUCTURE: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she and Vice President-elect Mike Pence discussed infrastructure during their meeting Thursday on Capitol Hill. “We had a straightforward conversation about how we can work together on infrastructure” and other issues, Pelosi said during the photo-op that came after her meeting with Pence. Pence said that he, incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are “beginning to discuss areas that we might move forward on together,” including coming up with ways to “revive our economy” and “improve American lives.” ** A message from the National Association of Manufacturers: It’s time for America to come together. The National Association of Manufacturers believes moving forward means #BeTheSolution. Investment in infrastructure, including ways to advance energy infrastructure, is a promising place to start. Learn more about the NAM’s infrastructure initiative, “Building to Win,” and how, together, we can build economic growth. http://www.nam.org/buildingtowin ** DELANEY DEFENDS HIS INFRASTRUCTURE, TAX IDEAS: Rep. John Delaney shot down the idea of using repatriated revenues to fund tax cuts on Thursday, saying the money should be used for investing in infrastructure. Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, including Chairman Kevin Brady, have shown a lack of enthusiasm for using repatriated funds for infrastructure upgrades. But Delaney, who’s introduced legislation on creating an infrastructure bank and overhauling international taxes, told our Tanya Snyder that Democrats are more likely to come on board if infrastructure is involved. “Why wouldn’t you do two good things rather than just one? Our proposal is more stimulative,” he said. “You’re giving each side a win. When you do international tax and then you cut domestic rates you’re giving two wins to Republicans and nothing to Democrats, so it’s not bipartisan.” A CR IS LOOKING LIKELY, FOLKS: House Speaker Paul Ryan said during a Republican Conference meeting Thursday that GOP leaders and the inbound Trump administration are getting close to agreeing on a plan to push forward a continuing resolution that will fund the federal government at current levels through March. “The short-term patch is aimed at giving Trump a say in next year's funding priorities and preventing President Barack Obama from putting his mark on a massive spending deal,” POLITICO’s Rachael Bade, Burgess Everett and Kyle Cheney report. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seems to be coming on board with Ryan, even though he preferred to wrap up funding the government through fiscal 2017. But the road ahead won’t be the easiest. “A short-term CR isn’t as simple as it sounds,” the POLITICO trio notes. “Lawmakers from both parties as well as the Obama administration will want to include a host of policy or funding tweaks, known as ‘anomalies,’ to ensure that federal operations continue unhindered.” UPTON: FLINT AID LIKELY TO GO IN CR: An aid package to help Flint, Mich., deal with contaminated drinking water will probably be included in a spending bill instead of the Water Resources Development Act, House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton said Thursday. As Pro Energy’s Annie Snider reports, lawmakers have cast doubt on whether the House and Senate can work out the differences between their WRDA bills before the end of the year. “We’ll see how this plays out, but the thought is at this point that we’ll do a CR through the end of February or so,” Upton said Thursday. “Our goal is to have it in that. If not, it will be in the omnibus. It will be in one of the two, and our preference is that it be in the CR.” AUTOMAKERS TO STATES: BACK OFF: The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers will express frustration with state efforts to regulate autonomous vehicles on their own in its forthcoming comments on NHTSA’s new guidance for self-driving cars. In the comments — provided exclusively to POLITICO — the Auto Alliance says NHTSA contradicts itself on whether states should wade into this area. As Tanya reports for Pros, 34 states and the District of Columbia have taken a stab at passing their own guidance on driverless cars, prompting concerns from automakers about a “patchwork” of state regulations that the federal guidance was supposed to prevent. The Auto Alliance will tell NHTSA that “clarifying this ambiguous area is critical in the next few months to avoid a mishmash of differing state laws that delay the benefits of emerging technology.” DONALD THE DISRUPTER: Trump is a “disruption” for the aerospace industry, an Airbus executive told POLITICO Europe’s Joshua Posaner and Alberto Mucci. In an interview with Marwan Lahoud, the company’s vice president for international strategy and public affairs, our EU colleagues asked: “Reports claim a Donald Trump presidency could be good for Airbus, as China threatens to shift contracts from Boeing under a protectionist U.S. administration. Do you see it as an opportunity?” Lahoud said: “First, no one knows what a Trump presidency means, except Trump himself, and I have not asked him. If we judge from what we heard during the campaign, and we need to take that with caution, there are some questions about protectionism. Aviation is about open space and free trade. One can say that the Trump election is a wake-up call for many people. We need to think about what will happen to us and how the world will change in the next months. It's not just business as usual. Mr. Trump is a disruption.” IT’S ALL PART OF THE PLAN: The European Commission plans to release a “masterplan” for driverless and connected vehicles on Nov. 30, Joshua Posaner reports for POLITICO Europe. “The so-called Connected Driving (CIT-S) Masterplan will lay out a technical roadmap for the deployment of new car technology and set out a plan for ensuring adequate internet connectivity,” Josh reports. “A hybrid-communication system will be proposed using Wi-Fi and cellular connections like 4G, and eventually 5G, for linking up internet equipped car systems.” AMTRAK REPORTS RECORD HIGHS IN NOVEMBER: Amtrak posted a banner year in fiscal 2016, reporting record-breaking ridership numbers, aggregate ticket revenues and operating loss (that one’s a new low), as our Lauren Gardner reports for Pros. The government-backed company’s $227 million operating loss represented a 25 percent drop from last year’s — though the older figure was at least partially inflated by the costs Amtrak incurred because of the fatal May 2015 derailment in Philadelphia. The passenger railroad served 31.3 million passengers in fiscal 2016, a 1.3 percent bump from the previous year. Some semantics: Amtrak also made nearly $2.14 billion in unaudited ticket revenue, a $12 million jump over fiscal 2015. But that new record reflects adjusted ticket sales — so accounting for things like private car revenues and cross-commuter benefits — whereas gross revenue hovered around $2.19 billion, seeing a slight increase over fiscal 2015 by $6.7 million. Why the distinction? In past years, Amtrak reported just the gross revenue figure, but switched to the adjusted number in Thursday’s announcement. A spokeswoman said the company is changing the way it communicates the figures “to more closely align with our public financial statements.” ACC: DON’T STOP NOW, STB: As we mentioned in Thursday’s MT, the Association of American Railroads is calling on the Surface Transportation Board to hold off on big rulemakings until the new administration begins and all the seats on the board are filled. The American Chemistry Council responded later Thursday by telling MT there’s “no good reason for the STB to wait any longer to update our nation’s antiquated freight rail policies.” The group argues that current regulations are “shielding the rail industry from the free market.” AAR and ACC are at odds over STB’s proposed “reciprocal switching” rule. ACC claims the rule would “promote greater competition amongst rail carriers,” while freight railroads prefer the status quo. “Last week’s election was clear proof that Americans want change, and the STB needs to act sooner rather than later on removing regulatory barriers to growing our economy,” ACC said. SHIFTING GEARS: Deborah Chase Hopkins will join Union Pacific’s board of directors in January, after she retires as CEO of Citi Ventures. Hopkins previously worked at Boeing, Lucent Technologies, General Motors, GM Europe, Unisys and Ford. Eric Butler has been appointed executive vice president and chief administrative officer at Union Pacific. Butler is replacing Diane Duren, who will retire in February and serve as senior vice president and corporate secretary in the meantime. Beth Whited is succeeding Butler as executive vice president and chief marketing officer. Kari Kirchhoefer is taking Whited’s place as vice president and general manager of chemicals. All will officially start their new roles Dec. 1. Boeing’s chairman, president and CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, was elected as the new chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association’s board of governors. Muilenburg will replace Marillyn Hewson, the chairman, president and CEO of Lockheed Martin. Thomas Kennedy, the chairman and CEO of Raytheon, will be the board’s new vice chairman. SLICE OF PI: Over 100 executives in the travel industry were in town Thursday for a board meeting of the U.S. Travel Association. They discussed “working with the new administration, especially on infrastructure issues such as airport modernization,” our friends at POLITICO Influence report. “The group’s lobbying team has briefed the Trump campaign and transition team.” THE AUTOBAHN: — "Donald Trump takes credit for helping to save a Ford plant that wasn’t closing." The New York Times. — “VW’s chief faces long road to overhaul automaker.” The Wall Street Journal. — “Tesla, SolarCity merger gets shareholder approval.” The Wall Street Journal. — "Trump-size idea for a new president: Build something inspiring."

The Washington Post. — "At the Los Angeles Auto Show, an industry ponders its digital future. The New York Times. THE COUNTDOWN: DOT appropriations run out in 21 days. The FAA reauthorization expires in 315 days. Highway and transit policy is up for renewal in 1,415 days. ** A message from the National Association of Manufacturers: Great nations build and invest in great infrastructure. When communities have greater access to economic opportunities and when manufacturers have efficient ways to move goods to market, the quality of life rises, productivity soars and societies thrive. Current U.S. infrastructure, however, is in an alarming state of disrepair and in urgent need of strong investments. Manufacturers want to #BeTheSolution. So as we call for healing and moving our country forward, we are calling for a major investment in renewing our transportation systems and advancing energy infrastructure. Americans are demanding a stronger, more inclusive economy. And that’s why infrastructure can be part of the answer. Historical data indicates that previous significant investments in infrastructure have aligned with high levels of growth and more aggressive economic activity. That starts with sending WRDA to the President’s desk this year. In 2017,the President-elect and Congress must act boldly.

November 20, 2016 0601 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:172310 Publish Date: Fri, 18 Nov 2016 14:47:15 GMT Service: Business Trade war with China would be bad news for Boeing Throughout his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump railed against China and its trade practices, saying it has sucked jobs out of the US. His prescription: To prosecute trade cases against the country for its ‘unfair subsidy behavior’ and slap tariffs as high as 45 percent on its exports. According to Bloomberg, If Trump makes good on his threat to spark a trade fight, chances are that the largest exporter in the US — Boeing — will be one of its first casualties. “China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,” wrote Global Times in an editorial on Nov. 13. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus.” Of course, Boeing wouldn’t be the only company to take a hit in the ensuing trade war. Sales to China of everything from American autos and iPhones to soybeans and corn would likely be curtailed or halted in retaliation, according to Global Times. But no company is poised to take it on the chin harder than the Chicago-based aerospace giant. This year alone, Boeing stands to reap an estimated $11.03 billion from 164 plane deliveries to China. Most of those sales are for narrow-body 737 jets, the company’s most profitable model. Since 2000 the manufacturer has delivered 967 aircraft to China, worth about $60.2 billion at 2016 prices, according to FlightGlobal data crunched by Bloomberg Intelligence. Boeing is also locked into long-term contracts worth about $1 billion a year with several suppliers in China. Any US tariffs on those contractors would raise Boeing’s production costs, possibly hurting its competitiveness against European archrival Airbus Group. To bolster its standing in China, Boeing recently announced plans to open a plant there to install seats on 737s being delivered to Chinese carriers — a move Trump also has denounced. “Boeing has to be as worried as anyone,” aerospace consultant Kevin Michaels says of the trade tensions. “It would be horrible and a huge boon to Airbus, which already has an assembly facility there.” Booming Chinese demand for jets is helping drive up 737 production, which is expected to rise by 12 percent to 47 jets a month next year, and 57 planes a month by the end of the decade. Longer-term, a trade war could cause Boeing to lose a chunk of the estimated $1 trillion market for airplane sales in China over the next 20 years. “Boeing would win more than 50 percent” of that market if past ordering patterns held true, says David Wireman, managing director for aerospace and defense at consultant AlixPartners. China has an almost insatiable demand for passenger jets as its growing middle class takes to the skies, so it’s unlikely to completely turn away from the US plane maker. Beijing has been adept at playing Boeing and Airbus against each other in a competition to provide it with the lowest-priced jets. But even if it continues to order Boeing’s planes, China could inflict pain by taxing the air frame components the US manufacturer imports from suppliers like Aviation Industry Corp. of China. Or it could sporadically postpone deliveries of Boeing planes — but not Airbus gear — and blame current market conditions for the delays, said George Ferguson, senior air transport analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “That could hurt,” he said. So far, Boeing hasn’t pushed back aggressively against Trump’s rhetoric. “We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to ensure that US companies can compete, win, and grow our economy to provide good jobs to US workers; as well as preserve American leadership in national security,” Boeing said in a statement. One consolation prize for Boeing of a Trump presidency could come if he carries out his threat to require European nations to shoulder more of the financial costs of NATO. Boeing, the second-largest US defense contractor, stands to profit from any increase in arms sales to Central and Eastern European nations nervous about NATO’s future. Until more details of a Trump administration trade policy are made public, any impact on Boeing will remain uncertain. Trump’s trade advisers have suggested that the president-elect could use targeted tariffs to avoid creating conflict with the World Trade Organization. Others have speculated that Trump’s protectionist talk was aimed mainly at whipping up voter support, or perhaps gaining the upper hand in future talks. “We have seen a lot of candidates bashing China when they are running for office but end up at least toning down their rhetoric after taking office,” said Bai Ming, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a think tank under China’s Ministry of Commerce. For now, Boeing and other exporters can only hope that a Trump administration recognizes that a fracas may yield unintended results. “It would be nice to say the tariffs would have the impact of bringing jobs back home,” Wireman said. “In reality those jobs could well go to another low-cost region.”         KeyWords Trade war China Boeing   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Armenia seeks to ease trade with Iran Senior Nalco executives to visit Iran next month Germany's Linde gets go ahead for major Iran LNG projects Chinese plane makers should meet int'l standards to sell aircraft to Iran: Minister Iran: Oil may rise to $55 if all producers cooperate Lloyd's to open branches in Iran Qazvin-Rasht railway operational by August 2017 Gas deal with India's ONGC likely by January Inequality and its discontents Eurozone growth recovers to pre-crisis level Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report US students leave schools to join anti-Trump protests 66,000 to march on Washington a day after Trump inauguration Sanders popular policies could have made him president: Analyst Protests erupt in Cincinnati after mistrial in police shooting of black male Hate crimes against Muslims surged by 67% in US: FBI US students walk out of class to protest Trump election Senator Boxer wants to abolish Electoral College after Trump victory www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0769 sec

By 243-174 vote on Thursday, lawmakers passed legislation that would prohibit the Treasury Department from issuing the licenses U.S. banks would need to complete the transactions. The House bill seeks to counter the department’s decision in September to grant aviation giants Boeing and Airbus permission to sell the passenger planes to Tehran. The bill must now clear the Senate, where the measure would face stiff opposition from Democrats. President Barack Obama would veto the bill if it reached his desk, according to the White House. The proposed sales may involve the purchase and leasing of more than 200 aircraft, which could generate thousands of new jobs, according to Democrats who opposed the legislation. Republicans, however, decried the sale of aircraft to a country they say is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and has flouted United Nations resolutions by testing ballistic missiles. Iran’s nuclear deal with the U.S. and other world powers ended international economic sanctions against Tehran and specifically allowed for the sale of commercial aircraft and spare parts. The Treasury Department said the licenses granted to Boeing and Airbus contained “strict conditions to ensure the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred to a designated entity.” But Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., called the aircraft sales a “scandal.” He harshly criticized Boeing and Airbus for seeking to do business with Iran. “We need to make sure that the American financial system is not complicit in this deal,” Roskam said. “We need to make sure that American taxpayers are not subsidizing this deal.” Although Roskam is from Illinois, where Boeing is headquartered, the airplanes the company proposed selling to Tehran are built in Washington state. Democrats cast the legislation as another Republican attempt to undermine last year’s Iran nuclear agreement and embarrass the Obama administration. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the House Intelligence committee, said the bill plunged the House again into the “dreary and dangerous ritual” of considering a measure that would cause the United States to violate the nuclear accord that took years to forge with world powers, including China and Russia. Himes also argued denying the aircraft sale could cause 100,000 jobs to not be created. Ahead of the vote, the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement Monday that the legislation would “contravene U.S. commitments” in the nuclear deal and undercut American credibility with its allies. National carrier Iran Air signed agreements in January to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth $25 billion. Iran later reduced the number of planes to 112. Though based abroad, Airbus needed Treasury’s approval because at least 10 percent of the manufacturer’s components are of American origin. Under Boeing’s deal, Iran Air is slated to buy 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s, raising the potential total value of the deal to $25 billion. But Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, doubted that Iran has the money for so many new planes. The country’s economy, rife with corruption and patronage, is in poor shape, he said. Third party lenders also are likely to be leery of underwriting such large transactions because Tehran is not party to an international agreement called the Cape Town Convention that guarantees financiers can repossess the jets in the event of bankruptcy, he said. “In the here and now, Iran maybe has the ability to absorb and finance at most a quarter of the aircraft,” said Aboulafia, adding that Tehran would likely have to settle for used and leased planes. ___ Follow Richard Lardner on Twitter: http://twitter.com/rplardner Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » WIVB.com provides commenting to allow for constructive discussion on the stories we cover.

News China hits back fast on perceived U.S. trade slights, past shows (c) 2016, Bloomberg China's stance on U.S. trade can be illustrated by one of Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion: For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. From steel to solar, Beijing has responded in kind to what it deemed as trade slights from Washington. It also has sought World Trade Organization protections, and with some success. That's something for President-elect Donald Trump to weigh as he decides whether to honor his proposal for tariffs on the world's largest trading nation, which had $627 billion in U.S. trade in 2015. A Communist Party newspaper this week gave a flavor of what could come, suggesting "tit for tat" retaliation should a trade tiff erupt. "Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus," the Global Times said in an editorial. "U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted." Here's how history could be a guide: - Steel The latest U.S. anti-dumping action against Chinese steel was a preliminary ruling in September on imported stainless steel sheets and strips from China, after American tariffs of 266 percent on Chinese cold-rolled steel imports were announced in May. In October, China extended anti-dumping tariffs on U.S. exports of caprolactam, a material used in textiles. Beijing also scored a victory over the U.S. at the WTO in a dispute over U.S. duties imposed on 13 imported Chinese products--three years after Beijing first filed the case. - Tires, Chicken Chronology sometimes says more than causality. In 2009, the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese tires. In 2010, China announced charges on U.S. poultry. The U.S. filed a WTO complaint in 2011. Beijing's broiler chicken duties of as much as 105.4 percent hurt about 300,000 workers and farmers, the U.S. said at the time. In 2013, after the WTO upheld the U.S. on tire tariffs, China renewed its investigation into American poultry. In 2015, the U.S. announced duties on Chinese tires in June after a year-long investigation. China said later in August the same year that it would keep current countervailing duties on U.S. broiler chickens and relaunch a subsidy investigation. In August, the U.S. again imposed duties on truck tires. In September, China extended anti-dumping duties on U.S. chicken for five years, raising them as much as 73.8 percent. - Aircraft Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, has long been a key bellwether for trade relations. China Southern Airlines threatened in 1995 to pull the plug on $2 billion of orders based on progress in talks over copyright law, then didn't. The next year, Boeing said strained trade ties would hurt sales after China gave Airbus Group SE its biggest-ever order for $1.5 billion. While China doesn't sell its own commercial aircraft, yet, trade tension could still arise. President Xi Jinping gave Boeing a $38 billion order last year on a plant visit in Seattle. - Solar In July, the U.S. raised anti-dumping duties on photovoltaic products from China. Two months later, China imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on distiller's dried grain, a byproduct of ethanol and animal feed, from the U.S. In 2014, China hiked tariffs to 57 percent for U.S. exports of polysilicon used in solar cells. That rippled through to small manufacturers like REC Silicon ASA in Moses Lake, Washington, and Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. in Hemlock, Michigan. The dispute with China, the biggest market for materials used in solar panels, pressured U.S. producers to cut output and prices. - Technology China stepped up efforts to shift to domestic technology companies after 2014 revelations of widespread spying by U.S. intelligence agencies using American electronics to snoop. It complicated life for U.S. firms like Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. Meanwhile, Chinese regulators pursued antitrust probes against Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. Microsoft's China offices were raided, Windows software banned from government PCs, procurement of Apple Inc. iPads was blocked. Now, foreign tech firms must give Beijing unprecedented access to their systems under a new law. Trump's tariff plans could hurt U.S. buyers too. Cellphone imports are now duty free, but such tariffs would raise the average price by $90.08 per phone, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. - Fishing China's counter-punches haven't been restricted to responding just to commercial actions. Norwegian salmon exports to China plunged after the country's parliament awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. In 2010, when a Chinese fishing boat and a Japanese Coast Guard vessel collided in contested waters, China stopped giving Japan export licenses for rare earth metals, needed for cars and electronics. Licensing resumed days later after Japan released the boat captain. - With assistance from Christopher Anstey and Jeff Kearns Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 31°

The Republican-controlled chamber voted 234-174 to prohibit the deals that could provide American aerospace giant Boeing billions of dollars in sales. France's Airbus was also awarded licenses to deliver planes to Tehran under an Obama administration order in September. The U.S. agreed to allow Iran to purchase commercial passenger aircraft to update its aging passenger fleet under the internationally brokered Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The sales were a prominent demand from Tehran to complete the accord and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told Iranians shortly after it was inked, "From today, we will have safe planes". The proposed multibillion dollar deal between Boeing and Tehran would allow Iran Air to buy 80 passenger jets as well as receive the company’s help in leasing 29 new Boeing 737s. Airbus separately wants to sell 118 aircraft to Tehran, which has said it wants to buy up to 500 aircraft during the next decade in the wake of the nuclear accord. The House legislation, however, would prohibit the Treasury Department from issuing the necessary licenses for banks to finalize the deals. And it would nix authorities that were previously issued to facilitate the sales. It will now head to the Senate where its passage would send it to President Barack Obama who is almost certain to issue a veto, effectively killing it. Congress could override the move, but doing so would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers, and so far the House vote has fallen far short of the required 287 votes. Legislative maneuvering could change that tally, but that would be a major undertaking for an outgoing Congress. Critics have said the sales threaten a boost in support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, citing Iran’s alleged air lifts to support him. Republican lawmaker Peter Roskam, a leading opponent of the Iran deal, lauded the House's move. "Happy to see the House take a principled stand as #Iran continues to use commercial aircraft to support Assad and its other terror proxies," he wrote on Twitter.

The legislation also prohibits the Export-Import Bank from providing any assistance either directly or indirectly to Iran or associated entities. (Photo: Mauritz Antin/EPA /Newcom) House Republicans voted Thursday to block the sale of aircraft to Iran, a move GOP lawmakers and some Democrats said would protect taxpayer dollars from being used to finance the export of airplanes to Tehran. The House voted 243 to 174 to pass legislation sponsored by Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., prohibiting the secretary of the Treasury from authorizing a transaction from a U.S. bank or financial institution related to the export of aircraft to Iran. The White House said it would veto the bill, as it could be viewed as a violation of the Iran nuclear deal. In September, the Treasury issued licenses to aviation giants Airbus and Boeing that permitted the sale of planes to Iran Air, the country’s state-owned airline. The agency also allowed U.S. banks to finance the sale of those aircraft to Tehran. “This bill would keep Americans’ deposits away from a country that the president’s own State Department calls ‘the foremost state sponsor of terrorism,’ and which Treasury has designed as a ‘jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern,’” Huizenga said today on the House floor. The legislation also prohibits the Export-Import Bank, or Ex-Im, from providing any assistance either directly or indirectly to Iran and associated entities, including its state-run airline. Ex-Im provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products. “We need to make sure that the American financial system is not complicit in this [Iran nuclear] deal,” Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., said on the House floor Thursday. “We need to make sure American taxpayers are not subsidizing this deal.” Over the last year, Roskam has been an ardent opponent of the Iran deal and has pushed to prohibit Iran and its state-run entities from benefiting from U.S.-backed financing. Though Ex-Im’s charter prohibits the agency from extending taxpayer-backed financing to Iran, Roskam and GOP lawmakers cautioned a loophole could allow Tehran to purchase U.S. products or services from third-party intermediaries that received funding from the 82-year-old bank. It’s now possible for U.S. corporations to do business with Iran following the Obama administration’s historic nuclear deal with the Islamic regime. The pact, which the U.S. and five other world powers secured last year, was designed to ensure Iran doesn’t obtain a nuclear weapon in the near future. Nearly a year after negotiations with Iran concluded, lawmakers learned that Boeing, one of Ex-Im’s biggest beneficiaries, had been engaging in ongoing discussions with government-run entities in Iran over the possible sale of aircraft to the country. In May, Roskam and fellow Illinois Republican Reps. Robert Dold and Randy Hultgren sent the Chicago-based aerospace giant a letter urging it not to do business with Iran. One month later, Boeing confirmed it signed a deal to sell $25 billion worth of planes to Iran Air. According to initial reports, Boeing planned to sell approximately 80 commercial airliners to Iran Air and secure the sale of another 29 planes to a third party, which would then lease the aircraft to Tehran. The company’s deal marked the first time since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 that American aircraft were sold to Tehran. The Obama administration previously sanctioned Iran Air after the airline used passenger and cargo planes to fly rockets and missiles to Syria and other nations. The weapons were sometimes disguised as medicine or spare parts, according to past reports. Under the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama administration dropped economic sanctions against Tehran. “We now have American companies who are saying, ‘You know what? Let’s do business with a terrorist regime. How’s that? Let’s just go make a buck,’” Roskam said of Boeing during his floor speech Thursday. “That’s the scandal of this. The scandal is there are American companies, international companies, Boeing, Airbus, that are now making their own names linked with terror forevermore.” In addition to Boeing, Airbus also signed an agreement with Iran to sell the regime aircraft. Though Boeing didn’t previously disclose whether it would seek Ex-Im financing to help fund the sale of the jets to the third party, lawmakers worried the company would attempt to secure taxpayer-backed loans and loans guarantees for the transaction. Ex-Im, however, can’t currently approve transactions of more than $10 million because of vacant seats on its board of directors. The five-member panel currently lacks a quorum of three members, and all transactions topping $10 million, which primarily benefit Ex-Im’s biggest beneficiaries like Boeing, have been stalled.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon A Liberal government proposal to buy Super Hornet fighter jets as a replacement for the air force’s aging CF-18s is back on the table. But whether it will move ahead is still unclear. In June the government proposed the purchase of Boeing Super Hornets as an interim measure, but that option disappeared as it faced intense criticism from the aerospace industry and opposition MPs. Aerospace industry officials say they believed the Liberals were moving towards an open competition for a fighter replacement. But the option to buy the Super Hornets on a sole source basis and forgo a competition until around 2030 has again resurfaced, industry sources now say. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office, with advice from Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, has been pushing the option, despite opposition from some leaders in the Royal Canadian Air Force, sources add. Jordan Owens, a spokeswoman for Sajjan, said Thursday that no decision has been taken yet on replacing the CF-18s. Sajjan has repeatedly stated there is a need to immediately replace the CF-18s but his comments have been undercut by air force officers who point out the aircraft can keep flying until at least 2025.

Boeing preps legal challenge after Denmark rejects Super Hornet for F-35 John Ivison: By sole-sourcing Super Hornets, Liberals now look identical to Tories on fighter-jets file The acquisition of an interim fleet of 20 Super Hornets would push off the need to acquire a new fleet of fighter jets for more than a decade. Such a deal, if it proceeds, would give breathing room to the Liberals. During last year’s election campaign, Trudeau promised Canada would not purchase the controversial F-35, an aircraft he said was unnecessary for the country’s needs and too expensive. Trudeau promised his government would hold a competition. By moving ahead with a sole source purchase of Boeing Super Hornets – and promising a competition in the late 2020s — the Liberals will still be able to claim they kept their election promise, industry sources say. In July, the government asked for initial information from fighter jet manufacturers so it could determine how to proceed with a replacement program. Five companies responded. Boeing submitted information on its Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin provided information on the F-35A, Dassault responded with the data on the Rafale, Eurofighter with the Typhoon, and the Saab Group offered details on the Gripen aircraft. The re-emergence of the proposal to sole source the Super Hornets appears to have caught industry off guard. Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin’s CEO, was in Ottawa Tuesday at an aerospace conference highlighting both the F-35 and Canada’s participation in the project. She pitched the aircraft as a way to bring more jobs to Canada. “Since the beginning of the program in 2001, more than 110 Canadian companies have contributed to the development and production of the F-35, bringing advanced technology and engineering work to Canada,” Hewson told the audience. “Today, Canadian-built components are on every F-35 produced. Canadian industry has been awarded over $1 billion in industrial work to date, and I’m confident the F-35 will bring significant economic benefits for decades to come.” In August, two U.S. Air Force F-35s travelled to Canada to highlight the capabilities of the aircraft. At the time, Lockheed Martin officials said it looked like a competition would be held and their aircraft would be invited to take part. But Trudeau is not a fan of the F-35. When the National Post first reported on the Liberals’ proposal in early June to proceed with a sole source deal for the Super Hornets, Trudeau responded to criticism in the Commons by slamming the F-35. He dismissed the F-35, claiming the jet “does not work and is far from working.” But a short time later the U.S. Air Force declared the jet as ready for combat. Conservative defence critic James Bezan said in an email Thursday that “the Liberals have completely politicized this purchase by promising in the election they would exclude the F-35. “Justin Trudeau and his friends are not fighter jet experts. Only an open and fair competition will clear-up the political mess they’ve created,” Bezan wrote. Sajjan has said a decision on how the government will proceed on replacing the CF-18s will be made shortly, suggesting it could come by the end of the year. The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded the commitment and later agreed to buy 65 of the planes. The program was dogged by controversy and the aircraft faced numerous technical problems. Aerospace industry officials say the declaration that the F-35A is ready for combat is good news for the aircraft program. But others point out that more development of the plane is needed. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

From steel to solar, Beijing has responded in kind to what it deemed as trade slights from Washington. It also has sought World Trade Organisation protections, and with some success. That’s something for President-elect Donald Trump to weigh as he decides whether to honour his proposal for tariffs on the world’s largest trading nation, which had US$627 billion (RM2.75 trillion) in US trade in 2015. A Communist Party newspaper this week gave a flavour of what could come, suggesting “tit for tat” retaliation should a trade tiff erupt. “Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus,” the Global Times said in an editorial. “US auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and US soybean and maize imports will be halted.” Here’s how history could be a guide: Steel The latest US anti-dumping action against Chinese steel was a preliminary ruling in September on imported stainless steel sheets and strips from China, after American tariffs of 266 per cent on Chinese cold-rolled steel imports were announced in May. In October, China extended anti-dumping tariffs on US exports of caprolactam, a material used in textiles. Beijing also scored a victory over the US at the WTO in a dispute over US duties imposed on 13 imported Chinese products — three years after Beijing first filed the case. Tires, chicken Chronology sometimes says more than causality. In 2009, the US imposed tariffs on Chinese tires. In 2010, China announced charges on US poultry. The US filed a WTO complaint in 2011. Beijing’s broiler chicken duties of as much as 105.4 per cent hurt about 300,000 workers and farmers, the US said at the time. In 2013, after the WTO upheld the US on tire tariffs, China renewed its investigation into American poultry. In 2015, the US announced duties on Chinese tires in June after a year-long investigation. China said later in August the same year that it would keep current countervailing duties on US broiler chickens and relaunch a subsidy investigation. In August, the US again imposed duties on truck tires. In September, China extended anti-dumping duties on US chicken for five years, raising them as much as 73.8 per cent. Aircraft Boeing Co, the largest US exporter, has long been a key bellwether for trade relations. China Southern Airlines threatened in 1995 to pull the plug on US$2 billion (RM8.78 billion) of orders based on progress in talks over copyright law, then didn’t. The next year, Boeing said strained trade ties would hurt sales after China gave Airbus Group SE its biggest-ever order for US$1.5 billion. While China doesn’t sell its own commercial aircraft, yet, trade tension could still arise. President Xi Jinping gave Boeing a US$38 billion order last year on a plant visit in Seattle. Solar In July, the US raised anti-dumping duties on photovoltaic products from China. Two months later, China imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on distiller’s dried grain, a byproduct of ethanol and animal feed, from the US. In 2014, China hiked tariffs to 57 per cent for US exports of polysilicon used in solar cells. That rippled through to small manufacturers like REC Silicon ASA in Moses Lake, Washington, and Hemlock Semiconductor Corp in Hemlock, Michigan. The dispute with China, the biggest market for materials used in solar panels, pressured US producers to cut output and prices. Technology China stepped up efforts to shift to domestic technology companies after 2014 revelations of widespread spying by US intelligence agencies using American electronics to snoop. It complicated life for US firms like Cisco Systems Inc, Intel Corp and Hewlett-Packard Co. Meanwhile, Chinese regulators pursued antitrust probes against Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc. Microsoft’s China offices were raided, Windows software banned from government PCs, procurement of Apple Inc iPads was blocked. Now, foreign tech firms must give Beijing unprecedented access to their systems under a new law. Trump’s tariff plans could hurt US buyers too. Cellphone imports are now duty free, but such tariffs would raise the average price by US$90.08 per phone, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. Fishing China’s counter-punches haven’t been restricted to responding just to commercial actions. Norwegian salmon exports to China plunged after the country’s parliament awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. In 2010, when a Chinese fishing boat and a Japanese Coast Guard vessel collided in contested waters, China stopped giving Japan export licences for rare earth metals, needed for cars and electronics. Licensing resumed days later after Japan released the boat captain. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Japanese etiquette taught to tourists Sabah quake: Donations flood crowdfunding site in memory of ‘heroic’ mountain guide Homeless guides — a ‘hidden’ Barcelona Travel guidebooks are still alive and well Take a guided tour with a street expert: the homeless Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Norwegian Air suspends summer Las Vegas flights Today in the Sky Ben Mutzabaugh , USA TODAY 4:08 p.m. EST November 17, 2016 750 Shares This undated file photo shows a Norwegian Air 787 Boeing Dreamliner.  (Photo: Norwegian Air) Aside from casinos and nightlife, hot weather is one of the things that lures tourists to Las Vegas. But the Las Vegas summers apparently are too hot for one budget airline. European low-cost carrier Norwegian Air will suspend its four Las Vegas routes in March, saying hot weather there has created performance issues for its heavily loaded Boeing 787 aircraft. “This is not something we’ve had happen anywhere else,” Norwegian spokesman Anders Lindström told the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the first newspaper to report the story. “It didn’t happen that often, but it was enough times to make us realize that it was (an) issue and we didn’t want to keep delaying our customers.” BOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news Lindström confirmed the development to Today in the Sky. He said Norwegian’s Las Vegas routes had been performing well, but that the carrier has decided to adjust its schedule there rather than risk continued operational delays during the summer months. Flights operating on Norwegian Air's summer schedule typically operate from March through November. “Norwegian Air is making our Las Vegas routes seasonal for 2017 as the planes’ ability to take off during high-temperature periods was limited at times this past summer,” Lindström said in a statement to Today in the Sky. “This unfortunately led to a few delays earlier this year, which is something we do not want to repeat during the summer of 2017." Norwegian Air flies to four European destinations from Las Vegas. The airline began flying from the city last year with nonstop flights to both Copenhagen and Stockholm. The carrier expanded its schedule there with routes to London Gatwick and Oslo, Norway, that launched within the past three weeks.

The issue occasionally becomes a concern for airports in the U.S. Southwest, though that typically only becomes an issue when temperatures are well into the 110s and are threatening local records. USA TODAY Ask the Captain: Can it be too hot or cold to fly? For Norwegian, however, the issue is compounded by the carrier’s high-density seating configurations that add extra weight to its planes. Norwegian packs 291 seats on to its Boeing 787 -8 models and 344 on to its bigger 787-9s. By comparison, United's 787-8 and 787-9 Dreamliner models seat 219 and 252 passengers, respectively. “Given the weight of those additional Norwegian passengers and all that accompanies them, the airline this summer found close to 300 people on board, including crew, and its planes’ ability to take-off during high-temperature periods was sometimes limited,” Las Vegas airport spokesman Chris Jones said to the Review-Journal. With that extra weight, Norwegian has calculated that its Dreamliners shouldn’t take off if ground temperatures hit 104 degrees (40 Celsius). Norwegian declined to tell the Review-Journal how many heat delays it took this summer, though the newspaper notes “temperatures soared to 104 degrees and higher in Las Vegas on 60 days this year, according to the National Weather Service.” Norwegian offers less-than-daily service on all four of its Las Vegas routes. For now, Norwegian will convert its Las Vegas routes from year-round to seasonal service. Going forward, the carrier says it’s looking at options – including flights that operate off during cooler hours of the day – that would allow it to resume a full-year schedule in 2018.

The new facility was officially inaugurated by HE Darwish Bin Ismail Al Balushi, the Honourable Minister of Finance and the Chairman of Oman Air. The launch took place at a ceremony which was held at the centre and attended by government ministers, Oman Air’s Board of Directors, senior airline managers, senior representatives of the Public Authority for Civil Aviation (PACA), Oman Airport Management Company (OAMC) and members of the media. At the heart of the facilities provided at OAFTC will be cutting edge flight simulators. In addition to being a requirement under international flight safety regulations, flight simulator training is essential to the provision of high quality training programmes for flight deck crew. The flight simulators are being supplied by one of the world’s best-known simulator manufacturers, Canada-based TRU-Simulation and Training Company. Based at Oman Air’s headquarters in Muscat, OAFTC offers Oman Air the opportunity to provide its pilots and cabin crew with the highest standards of in-house training, in line with both civil aviation regulations and industry good practice. Furthermore, the innovative technology that is integral to OAFTC, together with its strategic location, enhances the high level of efficiency to which Oman Air is required to work. And by operating world-class training facilities in-house, and offering its services to commercial partners, Oman Air is able to make substantial cost savings which can subsequently be invested to the benefit of its customers. Advertisement Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Oman Air’s Chief Executive Officer, Paul Gregorowitsch, said: “Oman Air is pleased and proud to be opening this outstanding new facility. The Oman Air Flight Training Centre will enable Oman Air to continue operating to the highest safety standards and with absolute professionalism. Furthermore, Oman Air’s investment in this training facility – the first of its kind in Oman - will add an important milestone in the airline’s contribution towards the development of the Sultanate. “I would like to thank His Excellency the Chairman, and his colleagues on Oman Air’s Board of Directors for their unwavering support. I would also like to express my gratitude to Captain Ali Hassan Sulaiman, Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, his colleagues and all at Oman Air whose hard work and commitment have ensured that this training centre has been completed within a very tight timeframe.” Development of OAFTC was announced in November 2015 and by September 2016 the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was able complete both its Compliance Monitoring System and Simulator Audits. Captain Ali Hassan Sulaiman added: “OAFTC offers one Full Flight Simulator for Airbus 330 training, and another one for Boeing 737 training. In addition, one Flight Training Device for Boeing B737 training has been installed as a training tool for cadet training programmes. “The centre also includes the facilities needed to train Oman Air’s cabin crew. These include A330 and B737 mock-ups, along with a B787 door trainer. Each of these is designed to enable crew to train for, and practice, all the emergency procedures required as part of our cabin crew training and qualification courses. “Furthermore, having the flight simulator trainers close to Oman Air’s premises will support Oman Air’s strategy to ensure cost-effectiveness in all areas of its operations by avoiding expensive excessive training expenses overseas. We also have the option of offering our facilities to commercial partners, creating an additional revenue stream for Oman Air.” Oman Air places the highest importance on safeguarding and maintaining the safety of all its passengers and crew, and the Oman Air Flight Training Centre underlines this commitment. Furthermore, the benefits delivered by OAFTC to the Sultanate of Oman as a whole include employment opportunities for Omanis, maintenance of the country’s impressive safety records, improvement of national aviation standards, and the continued achievement of the regulatory requirements of PACA. The opening of OAFTC represents the latest step in Oman Air’s ongoing investment in training and capacity building. In addition to intensive training for all cabin crew, Oman Air has provided practical and financial support for Omani citizens to train as airline pilots and join the Oman Air workforce. -Ends- © Press Release 2016 © Copyright Zawya.

Jon Talton / Columnist Dilemma of playing to the ‘working class’ Originally published November 19, 2016 at 8:00 am Updated November 19, 2016 at 2:17 pm Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant has made helping the working class the centerpiece of her time on the council. (Johnny Andrews/The Seattle Times) Republican President-elect Trump and Socialist Alternative Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant don’t have much in common. But the billionaire and the professional activist both claim to be fighting for the working class. Share story Republican President-elect Trump and Socialist Alternative Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant don’t have much in common. But the billionaire and the professional activist both claim to be fighting for the working class. It’s become widely accepted that Trump won the election (although not the popular vote) by besting Hillary Clinton in some critical states of the industrial Midwest, specifically those with a disaffected white working class. All the factors that swayed this election — including anti-establishment sentiment, the “third-term curse,” low Democratic turnout, WikiLeaks, Russian intelligence and the media’s obsession with Clinton’s email server — may not be fully assessed for months or even years. But the working class narrative undoubtedly carries weight. Sawant has made helping the working class the centerpiece of her time on the City Council, including pushing the $15 minimum wage, rent control and numerous other progressive policies. She also called for demonstrations large enough to shut down Trump’s inauguration.

So here’s the dilemma: What is the working class, and who speaks for it? And of course, we should be cautious about whisking all individuals into oversimplified baskets. One of America’s most cherished myths is that we’re a classless society. Historically, this was true for most white people, compared to the stratified societies of Europe or Latin America. But economic interests have always divided Americans. This proved a critical element in detonating the Civil War. In the Great Depression, as President Franklin Roosevelt experimented to help suffering average Americans, his fellow toffs considered him “a traitor to his class.” The United States did create the largest middle class in history. This is a bragging right so treasured that even many wealthy people consider themselves middle class. And with this went economic mobility and a modicum of equality. But according to a Gallup survey last year, 51 percent of respondents said they were middle or upper-middle class, down from an average of more than 60 percent in polls from 2000 to 2008. On the other hand, 48 percent said they were “working or lower class,” compared with 33 percent in 2000. The Pew Research Center confirms that the middle class (meaning households earning from two-thirds to twice the median household income) has lost ground across the country, including in metro Seattle. Many blue-collar workers proudly consider themselves middle class, not necessarily “working class.” I knew and spoke with many of them when I was working for newspapers in Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio. The same is no doubt true of Boeing’s well-paid machinists and other workers in the Puget Sound region. And many such voters went for Trump, and not just in the Midwest. One is Cynthia Cole of Bellevue, who was featured in a Times postelection roundup. She’s retired from Boeing and the former head of its engineering union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace. “He really hit a lot of people who thought the government was not listening to their needs,” she said. “The people who are Trump supporters got tired of being told they were stupid and they’re racist or bigoted if they were supporting Trump.” If we take such voters at their word, Trump’s promise to keep and return good manufacturing jobs and sharply limit immigration helped seal the deal. In a perceptive article in the Harvard Business Review, Joan Williams noted that the white working class doesn’t dislike the rich, but does hold antipathy toward professionals. And why not? Their interactions (often distasteful) are usually with managers, not millionaires. Williams, a professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, comes from a blue-collar background. To her, Trump tapped into a blue-collar appreciation of “straight talk” (no matter the facts) and white-male resentment of lost status, especially being the primary breadwinners. She also cautions that writing off white working-class resentment “as nothing more than racism is intellectual comfort food, and it is dangerous.” Most provocatively, she argues that this working class doesn’t see its interests aligned with the bottom 30 percent of families. Yet this lowest third is a working class, too, and the one most represented by Sawant and often championed by Democrats. Williams writes, “ ‘The thing that really gets me is that Democrats try to offer policies (paid sick leave! minimum wage!) that would help the working class,’ a friend just wrote me. “A few days’ paid leave ain’t gonna support a family,” she continues. “Neither is minimum wage. (White working class) men aren’t interested in working at McDonald’s for $15 per hour instead of $9.50. What they want is what my father-in-law had: steady, stable, full-time jobs that deliver a solid middle-class life …” She doubts that Trump will deliver, but credits him with understanding what these voters desire. One problem is that many of those good jobs were done in by the greed and financial machinations that the president-elect and his party embody. Many of those jobs moved out of the Midwest to the South, not always to Mexico. And how many were killed by the white working class’s love affair with Wal-Mart, whose business model set a template for lowering wages, union busting and importing products? Another problem is we can’t really escape from the racial divide. A good number of Trump supporters believe brown people are getting things they don’t deserve. This anger is heightened when the economic pie is growing so slowly that life seems like a zero-sum game. Now the new team has its chance. But the working class, whoever they are, should remember that the Southern gentry kept poor whites and blacks down for a century by playing them off against each other.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 19, 2016 at 10:13AM On Oct. 15, 2016, the U.S. Navy commissioned its largest gun-toting surface warship since battleships prowled the seas: the USS Zumwalt (DDG 1000). The USS Zumwalt sports two powerful "advanced gun systems" (the two pillboxes up front) -- but has fewer than 90 bullets between them. Image source: U.S. Navy. Technically a destroyer, Zumwalt is actually bigger than the Navy's current fleet of Ticonderoga-class cruisers -- weighing in at 14,800 tons to the Tico's 9,800. It also carries more powerful guns than the Navy's big cruisers: two 155-mm Advanced Guns System (AGS) cannon, each capable of firing a 225-lb. Long Range Land-Attack Projectile (LRLAP) and striking a target 80 miles distant with pinpoint accuracy. There is, however, one small problem with these guns... They have no bullets. Bullets for battleships Well, they have almost no bullets. Although in 2015, Congress approved $113 million in funding for 150 rounds of LRLAP ammunition for the Zumwalt and her two sister ships (not yet commissioned), as of today only 90 rounds  have actually been purchased -- and some of those have already been used in testing. Worse news for Zumwalt: Earlier this month the Navy confirmed that it has decided to halt purchases of LRLAP ammunition entirely. The reason: While by all accounts, LRLAP has worked admirably in testing, the fact is that it was designed to be produced in bulk to arm a fleet of more than two dozen Zumwalt-class destroyers. As plans evolved, though, the Navy ultimately cut its anticipated purchases of Zumwalts to just three ships. The corresponding reduction in volume of ammunition needed means that LRLAP producer Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is unable to produce the ammunition at scale, unable to cut prices accordingly, and must charge the Navy somewhere between $800,000 and $1 million per each round of ammunition. Million-dollar bullets $1 million. That's nearly as much as the Navy pays to buy Harpoon missiles from Boeing -- and Boeing's Harpoons carry 500-pound warheads, 20 times the size of the 24 pounds contained in the LRLAP. This being the case, the Navy is probably making the right decision to cancel further purchases of the LRLAP. It does, however, leave open the question of what to load into those big, beautiful AGS cannon instead. Desperately seeking ammunition What's the alternative? And which company might ride to the Navy's rescue (from what's looking like a real PR nightmare) to suggest this alternative? Currently, two options seem most likely. Given that accuracy was the defining characteristic that made LRLAP so attractive to the Navy, Raytheon's (NYSE:RTN) uber-accurate Excalibur howitzer round might make for a good substitute. True, at $70,000 a pop, Excalibur is not what you'd call a "cheap" bullet. But it's a durned sight cheaper than $1 million, and Raytheon has proven in real-world testing that Excalibur can strike targets 30 miles distant -- and hit within two meters of what it was aiming at. Even better, as a 155-mm round, Excalibur should slide right into the AGS' borehole -- albeit its smaller size will probably necessitate changes to other aspects of the weapons system (such as for loading). A second alternative, and one that's been talked about for years, is the Hyper Velocity Projectile (HVP) that BAE Systems (NASDAQOTH:BAESY) has been developing for use in the Navy's experimental electromagnetic railgun program. BAE says that HVP is the right size for use in Zumwalt's AGS cannon. What's more, its potential use as the projectile of choice for future railguns, and its suitability for firing from the 5-inch guns mounted on Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyers (of which we have dozens), means that manufacturing HVPs in volume and at low cost should never be a problem. Who will win? Which alternative the Navy ultimately will elect on remains to be seen. Ultimately, though, if the Navy has decided not to buy Lockheed Martin's LRLAP for its AGS, it simply must choose a different bullet -- or render the AGS useless, and its Zumwalt-class destroyers disarmed. One way or another, Lockheed Martin's loss must turn into Raytheon's or BAE Systems' gain. Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

(NYSE: BA) currently expects to deliver about 745 to 750 commercial aircraft to its customers this year. Through the end of October the company had delivered 617 planes. In October Boeing delivered 54 new commercial jets. If it can maintain that pace — or something near it — the company should easily meet its sales target. The bad news is that orders for the first 10 months of the year total just 457. Ideally, Boeing would like a 1-to-1 book-to-bill ratio, but in late September the company said it is angling for 535 new orders in 2016. Even that total may be out of reach given the recent vote in the U.S. House of Representatives killing the company’s opportunity to sell planes to Iran. Of the 617 planes delivered so far this year 402 have been the stalwart 737. The company has delivered 117 models of the 787 Dreamliner and 80 of the 777 series. It has delivered 10 of its 767 planes so far this year, all to FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX). It has also shipped eight of the venerable 747 jumbo jets. Boeing’s order backlog as of October 31 totaled 5,635 aircraft, including 4,321 single-aisle 737s; 29 jumbo 747s, of which 20 are freighters; 96 dual-aisle 767s; and 728 Dreamliners. For the first 10 months of the year, here are the 10 Boeing customers who received the most new planes: Ryanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ: RYAAY): 49 planes, all 737s Southwest Airlines Corp. (NYSE: LUV): 27 planes, all 737s Turkish Airlines: 26 planes, 20 737s and 6 777s American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL): 25 planes, 16 737s, 2 777s, and 7 787s China Eastern Airlines Corp. Ltd. (NYSE: CEA): 24 planes, 17 737s and 7 777s Air Lease Corp. (NYSE: AL): 22 planes, 15 737s, 5 777s, and 2 787s GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS): 21 planes, 17 737s and 4 777s Alaska Air Group Inc. (NYSE: ALK): 18 planes, all 737s Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL): 16 planes, all 737s Norwegian, Air China, United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL): 15 deliveries each The U.S. Navy also received 16 767s this year. These are being adapted for the KC-46A tanker fleet. Of the 228 new airplanes delivered to Boeing’s top commercial customers, 195 (86%) were 737s. Of Boeing’s total backlog, about 77% are 737s. Another way of looking at Boeing’s top customers is to see which have the most orders in the aircraft maker’s backlog. Here are the 10 customers with the most orders waiting to be filled: Southwest: 229 planes, all 737s Lion Air: 214 planes, all 737s Ryanair: 205 planes, all 737s Emirates: 178 planes, 28 777-300ERs and 150 777Xs Air Lease Corp.: 176 planes, 118 737 MAXs, 11 737-800s, 3 777-300ERs, 30 787-10s and 14 787-9s United Airlines: 173 planes, 99 737 MAXs, 37 737-700s, 4 737-800s, 14 777s, and 19 787s Norwegian: 148 planes, 108 737 MAXs, 21 737-800s, and 19 787-9s American Airlines: 146 planes, 100 737 MAXs, 24 737-800s, and 22 787s GECAS: 133 planes, 95 737 MAXs, 16 737-800s, 2 777-300ERs, 10 787-10s Qatar Airways: 105 planes, 10 777-300ERs, 5 777Fs, 60 777Xs, and 30 787-9s United Airlines last week shifted an order for 65 of Boeing’s 737s, switching four that are scheduled for delivery next year from 737-700s to 737-800s, and deferring the delivery of the other 61, which are a mix of 737-700s and 737 MAXs. This was interpreted as bad news for Boeing, but it was actually pretty good, as we discussed on Friday. One last list: the airlines that have flown the most Boeing planes in the 100-year history of the aircraft maker. According to Boeing’s bookkeeping, and including McDonnell Douglas (MD) aircraft, the company’s best customers over the years have been: United Airlines: 1,550 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1959 American Airlines: 1,207 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1958 Delta: 1,172 Boeing and MD aircraft, including 286 from Northwest; first delivery in 1959 International Lease Finance Corp.: 763 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1978 Southwest: 712 Boeing 737s; first delivery in 1971 GECAS: 522 Boeing aircraft; first delivery 1995 Ryanair: 426 Boeing 737s; first delivery in 1999 Japan Air Lines: 374 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1960 All Nippon Airways: 364 Boeing aircraft; first delivery in 1964 Eastern Airlines: 342 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery in 1960 British Airways: 341 Boeing aircraft; first delivery in 1965 Lufthansa: 322 Boeing and MD aircraft; first delivery 1960 Boeing has delivered a total of 21,318 commercial airplanes to its customers, beginning with just 8 in 1958. In 2015 the company delivered 762 new planes, the most in its history.

Oman Air Flight Training Centre (OAFTC) was officially inaugurated by Darwish Bin Ismail Al Balushi, the Minister of Finance and the chairman of Oman Air, at a key ceremony held in the presence of government ministers, Oman Air’s board of directors, senior airline managers, representatives of civil aviation department and Oman airport authorities. Based at Oman Air’s headquarters in Muscat, OAFTC offers Oman Air the opportunity to provide its pilots and cabin crew with the highest standards of in-house training, in line with both civil aviation regulations and industry good practice. At the heart of the facilities provided at OAFTC will be cutting edge flight simulators being supplied by  Canada-based TRU-Simulation and Training Company, one of the world’s best in the field, said a statement from Oman Air. In addition to being a requirement under international flight safety regulations, flight simulator training is essential to the provision of high quality training programmes for flight deck crew, it stated. Speaking at the launch, Oman Air’s chief executive Paul Gregorowitsch, said the training centre will enable Oman Air to continue operating to the highest safety standards and with absolute professionalism. "Furthermore, Oman Air’s investment in this training facility – the first of its kind in Oman - will add an important milestone in the airline’s contribution towards the development of the sultanate," he noted. Development of OAFTC was announced in November last year and by September, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was able to complete both its compliance monitoring system and simulator audits, he added. Captain Ali Sulaiman Hassan, the executive VP and chief operations officer, said: "OAFTC offers one Full Flight Simulator for Airbus 330 training, and another one for Boeing 737 training. In addition, a flight training device for Boeing B737 training has been installed as a training tool for cadet training programmes." According to him, the centre also boasts key facilities needed to train Oman Air’s cabin crew. "These include A330 and B737 mock-ups, along with a B787 door trainer. Each of these is designed to enable crew to train for, and practice, all the emergency procedures required as part of our cabin crew training and qualification courses," he noted. "Furthermore, having the flight simulator trainers close to Oman Air’s premises will support Oman Air’s strategy to ensure cost-effectiveness in all areas of its operations by avoiding expensive excessive training expenses overseas," stated Hassan. "We also have the option of offering our facilities to commercial partners, creating an additional revenue stream for Oman Air," he added.-TradeArabia News Service Tags: airbus | Boeing | Oman Air | Pilots | Flight training | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Enjoy two holidays in one with Qatar Airways Steigenberger marks one-year milestone with two top awards Ritz Carlton, Doha awarded prestigious ISO certification New F&B outlets are bucking the market trend, says expert Emirates, DCAA ink innovation MoU Emirates Palace gears up for 45th UAE National Day Symphony Style Hotel Kuwait welcomes new finance director City Centre Bahrain offers hotel guests new shuttle service Music legend Quincy Jones opens first outlet in Dubai Royal Jordanian adds 6th Dreamliner to its fleet Bahrain introduces two new visas Bahrain mulls deployment of air marshals on flights Turkish Airlines to fly thrice to Cuba, Venezuela Dubai celebrates the opening of Bollywood Parks AirBaltic lowers checked-in baggage charges UAE National Day celebrations at Al Maryah Island Ramada Downtown Dubai launches new anniversary promotion Premier Inn ME deploys Ideas solutions for revenue growth SR Technics opens training centre in Abu Dhabi Dutch chef wins Etihad's 'Taste The World' title Dubai Miracle Garden all set to 'bloom' this winter ME airlines to spend $345bn to boost capacity Emirates offers LinkedIn Learning courses on ice Sharjah’s Al Bait Hotel $27m revamp on track WTM London 2016 most successful edition in event history Etihad, Hong Kong Airlines expand codeshare New executive chef for Alila Jabal Akhdar Rotana launches second hotel in Amman Etihad, Airbus to develop A380 MRO services Boeing to consolidate defence and space sites Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds
International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Companies Is the iconic commercial aircraft Boeing 747 being retired? Boeing's iconic aircraft is set to be retired, with better technology arriving on the scene. Aditya Bhat   November 19, 2016 09:29 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares Several airlines are retiring their 747 fleet. In Picture: British Airways Boeing 747-400 takes off from London Heathrow Airport, England.Wiki Commons/Adrian Pingstone One of the most iconic US aircraft, the Boeing 747, dubbed a symbol of American ingenuity, is facing retirement. Boeing has announced that it may not produce any more of these jumbo jets, 45 years after it was first deployed in service. Reason The huge commercial jet is finding few buyers now, since it guzzles more fuel. Also, with improvement in engine technology, two engines are considered more economical than the four engines found in the 747. Why advertise with us?

Two of the biggest commercial airliners in US -- United and Delta -- have said they will be retiring their 747 fleet. United announced on November 17 that it would retire all 20 of the 747s in its fleet by October 2018. Delta too has said that it would be retire 747 by the end of 2017. Cathay Pacific has also given similar indications.  History Started as a military project, the 747 was promoted by Juan Trippe, the then president of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). The development of the aircraft was a technical and financial challenge and those on the project were billed "The Incredibles." Boeing had to build an assembly plant for the giant airliner. The first aircraft was rolled out in September 1968, with the first flight of the new aircraft taking place in February 1969. Boeing rolled out its first 747 aircraft in September 1968.

It was one of the fastest airliners in the world, reaching Mach.92. One of iconic images has been the modified 747, carrying NASA space shuttle piggyback style. The aircraft could seat over 300 passengers and featured four prominent engines. The US president's Air Force One uses a modified version of the commercial 747-8. What would be flown instead of the 747s? United airlines would be flying the newer Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Boeing 777 models. Delta would be using the new Airbus A330s that have been delivered to it and also the new Airbus A350s. Now only a few airlines are ordering the 747s. Marketplace quoted Scott Hamilton, an aviation consultant, as saying that Lufthansa and Korean airlines are among those who are still ordering it. The order is about 30 or 40 planes between them. Apart from the above airlines, UPS, world's largest package delivery company, has ordered 14 Boeing 747-8 cargo freighters and took an option for another 14. Hence, it may still be some years before the Boeing shuts down its 747-8 production line.

The 25 777-200s based at London Gatwick will see an increase in capacity from 280 to 332 from early 2018. The main change is going from nine abreast to 10 abreast in economy, increasing seats at the back of the aircraft from 216 to 252. The number of business-class seats will also reduce from 40 to 32 and the number of premium economy seats will double from 24 to 48. The Gatwick-based subfleet serves a more leisure-oriented set of destinations than those operating from London Heathrow, notably to the Caribbean. At a capital markets presentation earlier in November, the slide containing the details of the new, denser configuration stated the configuration would give a “lower cost/seat than the Norwegian 787.” Low-cost carrier Norwegian has been ramping up flights to leisure destinations from London Gatwick with its rapidly growing fleet of the Boeing twin-aisle aircraft. In a statement, BA said, “We are flying more customers than ever before ... To meet this demand we are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors.” The increased seat count “will allow us to offer even more low fares.” A BA spokeswoman was unable to say by how much seat width would be reduced to allow the move to 10-abreast. As part of the re-configuring of the aircraft, larger inflight entertainment screens will be fitted in economy. The UK flag carrier has previously announced it will increase the number of seats in its short-haul fleet for the second time in four years—Airbus A320s will go from 168 to 180 seats from winter 2017, while A321s capacity will rise from 205 to 218 from summer 2018. In another cut to onboard amenities, BA announced plans in October 2016 to stop serving free food and drink on its short-haul fleet. Perhaps significantly, when the move to purchased food and drink was announced, BA offered price comparisons for onboard victuals with LCCs such as easyJet.

The first aircraft has already been delivered to Sharjah for a C4 check. The companies announced the partnership in August 2015, when Volga-Dnepr Gulf performed an A check on one of UTair’s 737-400s. Volga-Dnepr Gulf, a member of Russia´s Volga-Dnepr Group, was established in 1996. It started as a service provider for Soviet-built aircraft, but in 2014 it gained certification for Airbus A320 and Boeing 737/747 aircraft.

It’s true that the shorter time horizon that most retirees adopt in their investing calls for more conservative asset allocations, but especially in today’s low-rate environment, retirees can’t count on fixed-income assets like bonds to produce enough income to get by. That’s why dividend stocks have gotten so popular, and it’s why turning to stocks like PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP), Altria Group (NYSE: MO), and Boeing (NYSE: BA) can be a great way for retirees to stay invested in dependable stocks with reliable income payouts. Below, we’ll take a closer look at these three stocks to show how they could keep you invested after retirement. Continue Reading Below Image source: Getty Images. PepsiCo serves up strong growth From an income investor’s perspective, PepsiCo has been a great stock over the long run. The maker of soft drinks and the company behind the Frito-Lay snack brand currently has a 3% dividend yield, and it has given investors dividend increases in each of the past 44 years. Moreover, that dividend growth has been substantial, with its most recent boost coming in June and adding 7% to its previous payout. Dividends have played a vital role in serving up average annual returns of nearly 14% over the past 30 years. More From Fool.com Looking forward, some have been concerned about PepsiCo’s exposure to the carbonated sugary soft drink market, which has come under fire for potentially causing health problems. Yet even though its namesake beverage has faced challenges, PepsiCo more broadly has embraced the move toward healthier food offerings. By branching out and offering other beverages as well as innovative snack offerings to appeal to food-conscious consumers, PepsiCo has stayed ahead of the curve and has good prospects to add to its past successes with future growth. Altria keeps smoking Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Consumer stocks are often appealing to income investors, and Altria arguably has the best past performance of any dividend stock in the market. The company has given investors average annual returns of nearly 20% over the past 45 years, and the stock currently pays a yield of almost 4%. Altria isn’t recognized among the prestigious list of Dividend Aristocrat stocks because of various spinoffs during its corporate history, but when you adjust for those corporate events, the tobacco giant has rewarded investors with higher dividends for 47 straight years. Many investors fear that long-term secular trends against smoking will eventually be the death knell for Altria’s primary business. Yet Altria has fought successfully against those trends for decades. Moreover, its efforts to move forward with reduced-risk product development have been encouraging, and the movement toward alternatives like electronic cigarettes and heat-not-burn technology looks like a potential growth avenue in the future. Add in the company’s nearly 10% stake in beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Altria looks like it’s poised to keep defying skeptics. Boeing flies higher The aerospace industry has been extremely strong in recent years, and Boeing has been one of the primary beneficiaries of demand for aircraft. The airplane manufacturer has seen massive orders for both its newest models and its updated versions of tried-and-true aircraft, and that has produced impressive backlogs that show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. It’s true that airlines have started to see some deterioration in key revenue metrics, and the big decline in fuel prices boosted profits in what’s likely to be a one-time way. However, Boeing now has the prospects of higher defense-related spending bolstering the military side of its aerospace business. For income investors, Boeing has been aggressive in boosting its dividend in recent years. It doesn’t have the long-term history that Altria and PepsiCo do, but the company has more than doubled its quarterly payout in just the past three years, including a 20% boost at the beginning of 2016. With a 3% yield and a payout ratio of just over 60%, Boeing’s growth could continue to reward investors of all ages. Dividend stocks can be a good solution for retirees looking to stay invested in retirement and get the income they need. Take a closer look at Boeing, Altria, and PepsiCo as promising stocks that could fit the bill for your portfolio.

(Associated Press File) Many U.S. House members who bemoaned the loss of good U.S. manufacturing jobs, while campaigning this fall, voted Thursday to kill some of the very best U.S. manufacturing jobs. By a vote of 243-174, the House approved a bill that would prevent the sale of U.S. commercial aircraft to Iran. Under the 2015 agreement by which Iran agreed to halt its nuclear power development, six Western powers, including the United States, agreed to lift economic sanctions. Iran since then has negotiated about $42 billion worth of preliminary deals to buy or lease at least 200 new commercial jets from U.S.-based Boeing and Europe’s Airbus Industries. Airbus also assembles its A321 aircraft in Alabama and buys about 10 percent of its parts from American manufacturers. The bill would preclude the Treasury Department from issuing licenses that banks need to finance international transactions, and would apply to Boeing and Airbus. Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee who opposes the bill, said it would adversely affect about 100,000 jobs throughout the commercial aircraft industry and its long supply chain. To complete the deals, Iran would have to comply with several international protocols for multinational financial transactions. So the bill not only would diminish U.S. manufacturing but preclude Iran’s movement toward global diplomatic and financial norms. The Senate should reject the bill. If it does not do so, President Obama should veto it.

According to Reuters, the bill passed the Republican-led House by 243-174 largely along party lines. Eight Democrats joined Republicans in favor.  All 174 “no” votes were from Democrats. President Barack Obama and other western countries lifted sanctions on Iran in a trade for compliance with nuclear weapons restrictions.  The lifting of the sanctions made it possible for western-based corporations to do business there, but they have not moved quickly to do that. The Washington Examiner notes the corporations' reluctance could lead to Iran walking away from the deal, since it has not gained the benefits it expected. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said the bill would violate the deal's terms and accused the GOP of passing bills they know will be vetoed now while Obama is in office. “Perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that in two short months, they will no longer have the luxury of legislating without consequences,” Waters said, according to The Washington Examiner. The measure would bar U.S. Treasury Department from issuing licenses that U.S. banks would need to finance sales of commercial aircraft, the latest in a series of efforts by congressional Republicans to counteract the international nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and other world powers. The deals by Airbus and Boeing to sell or lease over 200 jets to IranAir would help modernize and expand the country's elderly fleet, held together by smuggled or improvised parts after years of sanctions. Although Airbus is based in France, it must have the U.S. Treasury Department's approval for the sale because at least 10 percent of the aircraft's components are American-made, according to Reuters. Reuters notes that the measure is unlikely to become law during the current Congress. It would need to pass the Senate, where it would face stiff opposition from Democrats. And the White House said Obama would veto the measure even if it did pass the Senate.  The administration believes the legislation would be a violation of the nuclear pact, in which Iran agreed to curtain its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. However, the climate for the nuclear pact could change once Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office on January 20.  Trump was harshly critical of the nuclear agreement during his campaign.

    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News House Votes to Forbid Civilian Aircraft Sales to Iran Bill Headed to Probable Veto If Senate Passes It by Jason Ditz, November 17, 2016 Print This | Share This In a vote heavily along party lines, the House of Representatives today voted 243-174 to forbid all sales of civilian passenger planes to Iran. The bill is aimed at derailing major contracts signed by Boeing and Airbus to modernize Iran’s airliner fleet. Iran sought to replace its old fleet, which is ailing and increasingly not serviceable, with two roughly equal contracts from the two major global supplies. Though only Boeing is actually a US company, Airbus’ offerings contain US parts, which would make it very difficult for them to try to work around such sanctions. The possibility that Airbus could do so, and make totally “US-free” planes to sell to Iran, is particularly concerning to Boeing, which has warned that Iran is such a large near-term customer that losing their share of the deals to Airbus could put them at a long-term competitive disadvantage, costing US jobs. The House bill is unlikely to become law, with still no timeline for a Senate vote. Even if the Senate approves the same bill, President Obama is expected to veto it, and it will not have a veto-proof majority, meaning the vote is largely symbolic.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration NASA realizes SLS and Orion are too expensive, opens door to competitors In a "request for information," NASA seeks ideas to cut its rocket and spacecraft costs. by Eric Berger - Nov 18, 2016 1:46 am UTC Login to bookmark 130 Artist concept of the Space Launch System. NASA/MSFC With a new presidential administration promising to review its human spaceflight activities, NASA on Thursday continued to signal a willingness to consider alternatives to its exploration systems—the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, and related ground systems developed at Kennedy Space Center to support their launch later this decade and in the 2020s. In its latest request for information (RFI) released Thursday afternoon, NASA seeks solutions from industry and academia to maximize "the long term efficiency and sustainability" of its of exploration systems programs. Essentially, NASA wants ideas on how best to cut the production and operations costs for its SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, which presently consume more than $3 billion annually in development costs. However, the RFI also offers respondents the opportunity to submit ideas about rockets and spacecraft that might compete with NASA's own vehicles for exploration funds. Specifically, the document requests responses about: "Competing exploration services in the mid-2020s timeframe and beyond if the market demonstrates such services are available, reliable, and consistent with NASA architectural needs." Ars understands this to mean that if private competitors such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, United Launch Alliance, or other companies produce less expensive rockets and spacecraft within the next five to seven years, NASA will consider using them in lieu of SLS and Orion. Fixed costs NASA's preference would be to fly the rocket and spacecraft it is developing under an agreement reached by President Obama and the US Congress in 2011. This plan called for development of a large rocket, based upon space shuttle engines, and a capsule larger than the Apollo spacecraft that carried astronauts to the Moon. However, these vehicles (managed by NASA and built by Boeing and Lockheed Martin, respectively) have proved costly. NASA has very little money left over to use for actual exploration. In an interview this summer, the engineer who oversees the development of SLS and Orion for NASA, Bill Hill, acknowledged that the vehicles were too costly now to be practical. “We’re just way too expensive today,” Hill told Ars. “It’s going to take some different thinking and maybe a little bit more risk taking than what we’re wanting to do today.” NASA hopes to reach a flight rate of one SLS and Orion launch per year by the year 2023. As it moves into this operational phase, Hill has set an annual target for these "production and operations" costs to build, test, and fly the vehicles. “My top number for Orion, SLS, and the ground systems that support it is $2 billion or less,” Hill said. “I mean that’s my real ultimate goal. We were running at about three-plus, $3.6 billion during the latter days of the space shuttle. Of course, there again, we were flying six or seven missions. I think we’re actually going to have to get to less than that.” Cutting costs RFIs are a common method used by the government to solicit public input. They do not seek specific proposals, but rather the ideas received may be used to inform future acquisition strategies. The new RFI from the space agency, which requires a response from interested parties by December 23, seeks replies across a broad number of areas to get costs down. For example, it welcomes ideas on new contracting methods, such as fixed-price contracts, block buys of materials or systems, and suggestions for changing government requirements that unduly raise costs. NASA's RFI also lays out a "baseline" of missions the agency expects to fly in the coming decade or so, from Exploration Mission-1 in 2018 through EM-10 in 2030. Nearly all of these missions will take place in the "proving ground," an area of deep space near the Moon where NASA believes it can safely test rockets, spacecraft, and habitation modules for eventual human missions to Mars in the 2030s. Ostensibly, the RFI seeks replies for how it can make its SLS and Orion production more efficient, and it may simply be a tactic to pressure the agency's primary contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to reduce costs. Yet, as Ars exclusively reported last week, NASA officials are open to new ideas from competitors of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. “This is NASA taking a breath and looking at alternatives,” one source told Ars at the time. “Part of why they also did it is they are signaling to the next administration that they may be willing to look at alternatives.” Alternatives Indeed, there are hints of this openness to alternatives in the new RFI. Not only does it solicit "competing exploration services" in the mid-2020s, it also seeks "synergies between current (SLS, Orion, and/or EGS) and future systems that can reduce total exploration costs." This indicates a willingness to augment NASA's exploration fleet with private vehicles—if those rockets and spacecraft are available and will cut costs. For example, both SpaceX and Blue Origin (with the Falcon Heavy and New Glenn boosters, respectively) are deep into development of heavy lift rockets in the same class as the SLS launcher. United Launch Alliance is also developing the Vulcan rocket with an upper stage being optimized for use in NASA's "proving ground" between the Earth and Moon. These are all expected to cost significantly less to fly than the SLS. NASA envisions evolving its SLS rocket to the powerful Block 2 variant by 2029. Note the solid rocket boosters on the side. NASA The RFI allows for other possibilities, too, such as using private components to lower the cost of NASA's vehicles. Presently the SLS relies on large solid rocket boosters manufactured by Orbital ATK to give the rocket a powerful kick off the launch pad. However, there are no other uses for these boosters, so if NASA wants to use them for the SLS it must pay a few hundred million dollars each year just to keep the production line open. A company like SpaceX might offer its Falcon 9 rocket as an alternative, strap-on booster. Since the rocket is already being used commercially, NASA would not have to pay any fixed costs for its use. It's difficult to read too much into the document, which seems like a product of its times. Yes, NASA is acknowledging that it is spending too much on SLS and Orion. Yes, the agency is concerned about the Trump administration and the desires of some members of its transition team to further privatize NASA and push the agency toward lower-cost reusable rockets. If America's new president considers himself a negotiator, it seems that NASA is now saying it is willing to negotiate, too. Expand full story Promoted Comments Statistical Ars Praefectus et Subscriptor jump to post You can't make the SLS economical. This is why so many advocated against it to begin with. You can't take expensive engines, hydrogen first stage, and solid rocket booster, then launch it only once a year (or less), throw it all away and expect it to be cheap. There is no tinkering around the edges which would make it viable. I would say it is 'flawed' at its core but honestly it is working exactly as intended. The Orion is a fairly good lunar command module. Spacecraft aren't pickup trucks where one design can work across a variety of missions. The problem with Orion is NASA being forced to use it as some general purpose starship when it IS a lunar command module, nothing more, nothing less. For anything else it is either way over engineer or insufficient for the mission. If NASA wants a general purpose capsule it should be limited to a space taxi. Something like Dragon or Starliner would be a good starting point. Small, lightweight, launcher agnostic, highly survivable, and solely intended to get the crew from the surface to orbit and back again. Then have it dock with a hab that has been purpose built for the current mission. The hab & propulsion requirements for a trip around the moon will be vastly different than what is required for a 3 year ground mission on Mars so don't try to build that into the capsule specs. Of course NASA doesn't need an RFP for this. They already know this. 8831 posts | registered 9/27/2010 Reader comments 130 You must login or create an account to comment.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other Atlas V successfully launches with GOES-R advanced weather satellite November 19, 2016 by William Graham An Atlas V rocket has successfully deployed a next-generation weather satellite for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Saturday evening. The United Launch Alliance (ULA) rocket launched from SLC-41 at Cape Canaveral at the end of a one hour-long window at 18:42 local time (23:42 UTC). GOES-R Launch: The GOES-R satellite, which rode aboard Saturday’s launch, begins a new fifth generation of geostationary weather satellite for the United States. It is the first of four satellites in its class which are expected to launch over the next eight years. GOES-R is part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) program, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). GOES consists of two operational satellites in geosynchronous orbit over the United States, providing images and data for weather forecasting across the western hemisphere. One satellite is located at a longitude of 75 degrees West – a station designated GOES-EAST – covering the Eastern United States, the Central and West Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. The second satellite, designated GOES-WEST, is positioned at 137 degrees West and covers the western States – including Alaska and Hawaii – as well as the Eastern and Central Pacific. At present, the GOES-EAST slot is occupied by GOES 13, while GOES-WEST coverage is provided by GOES 15. These satellites launched in May 2006 and March 2010 as GOES-N and GOES-P respectively. The GOES 14 satellite, formerly GOES-O, has served as an on-orbit spare since its launch in 2009 and has occasionally been called into service to cover outages as GOES 13 begins to show its age. In addition to weather forecasting, the GOES satellites are used to study space weather phenomena and conduct research into the Earth’s magnetosphere and radiation environment. Before launch, GOES satellites are designated with a letter to identify their place in the program’s launch order. Upon successfully reaching orbit this is replaced with a sequential number. GOES-R will become GOES 16 after a successful launch, following GOES-P which became GOES 15. Numbers are only given to satellites that launched successfully; GOES-G would have become GOES 7 but was lost in a launch failure, so GOES-H instead became GOES 7 after its launch the following year. There was no GOES-Q satellite; the designation was assigned to an option in the contract for the GOES-N class satellites, which was not exercised. The GOES program evolved from the NOAA’s earlier Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (SMS) series, which consisted of two prototype spacecraft launched in May 1974 and February 1975 atop Delta 2914 rockets. With the success of these missions, the NOAA began the GOES series with three satellites – GOES 1 to 3 – manufactured by Ford and based on the SMS design, launched between October 1975 and June 1978. These early satellites were spin-stabilised with spin-scan radiometers to image the Earth as the satellites spun. After their retirement as weather satellites, GOES 2 and 3 were used as communications satellites over the Pacific Ocean, with GOES 2 operating until 2001. As its orbital inclination increased naturally over time, GOES 3 became an important communications relay for the Amundsen-Scott research station at the South Pole which does not have a line-of-sight to geostationary satellites. GOES 3 operated in this role until it was decommissioned on 29 June this year, thirty-six years after launch. The second generation of the GOES constellation consisted of five satellites constructed by Hughes based around the HS-371 bus. These were launched by Delta 3914 rockets between September 1980 and February 1987. Like their predecessors these satellites were spin-stabilised, with an improved imaging payload over the first-generation. The series initially consisted of four satellites plus a ground spare. The fourth satellite, GOES-G was lost at launch on 3 May 1986, after the Delta rocket’s first stage engine cut out 71 seconds after liftoff. Even before the failure, the ground spare had been called up to launch due to delays with the procurement of the next generation of satellites. Because of the delays to the third generation – or GOES-I series – satellites and the loss of GOES-G, the retirement of GOES 4 in November 1998 left the NOAA with no spare satellites in orbit. When the imaging payload aboard GOES 6 failed three months later, the agency was left with no satellite to cover the West Coast of the United States. GOES 7 was moved from the Eastern slot to a more central position where it could cover the continental US, and in 1992 NOAA leased Europe’s spare Meteosat-3 satellite, allowing GOES 7 to move further West. Third-generation satellites finally began to launch in April 1994, with an Atlas I carrying GOES 8 into orbit. Following on-orbit testing it entered service at the GOES-EAST position in 1995, allowing Meteosat-3 to be returned to the European Space Agency for decommissioning and GOES 7 to move west again into the regular GOES-WEST position resuming the constellation’s normal service. GOES 7 was relieved by GOES 9, which launched in May 1995. Like GOES 2 and 3, GOES 7 was used as a communications satellite over the Pacific following the end of its operational service. It was finally decommissioned in 2012. GOES 10 was launched as an on-orbit spare in April 1997. A year later it swapped roles with GOES 9 after a fault was identified in the latter’s attitude control system, although GOES 9 would later be leased to the Japan Meteorological Agency to replace its failing Himawari-5 satellite. Two further third-generation GOES satellites, GOES 11 and 12, were launched in 2000 and 2001 by Atlas IIA rockets. The more powerful rockets allowed the satellites to carry additional fuel, allowing a greater potential for extended operations after the end of their normal service lives. GOES 12 carried an additional space weather instrument, the Solar X-Ray Imager (SXI). The third-generation satellites were built by Space Systems Loral, and were the first GOES spacecraft to be three-axis stabilized. The contract for two fourth-generation GOES satellites, the GOES-N series, was awarded to Hughes in February 1998 along with options for two further satellites, one of which was exercised. The satellites were manufactured by Boeing following its 2000 purchase of Hughes’ satellite manufacturing division and launched atop Delta IV rockets between 2006 and 2010. The three third-generation satellites, GOES 13, 14 and 15, are now the only operational GOES spacecraft following the decommissioning of GOES 12 in 2013. GOES-R is the first of four GOES-R-class satellites that form the fifth generation of the GOES constellation. Constructed by Lockheed Martin and based on the A2100A satellite bus, each satellite has a dry mass of 2,857 kilograms (6,299 lb) which increases to 5,192 kilograms (11,466 lb) when fully-fuelled at launch. The spacecraft measure 6.1 by 5.6 by 3.9 meters (20 x 18 x 13 feet) and have fifteen-year design lives; expected to consist of ten years of operational use and up to five years of storage as an on-orbit spare. GOES-R carries six scientific payloads and a data relay payload. Its nadir-pointing – Earth-facing – instruments are mounted on the side of the satellite which will be pointed towards Earth in orbit. Solar-pointing instruments are located on the arm which holds the satellite’s solar array; to provide power to the spacecraft this arm must track the sun, allowing its instruments to make near-constant observations. Further sensors will allow the satellite to study its surrounding environment. The primary instrument aboard GOES-R is its Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), built by Harris Corporation of Florida. Producing images across sixteen spectral bands from visible to infrared, ABI can achieve a spatial resolution of 500 metres (547 yards) at its primary visible-light wavelength of 0.64 nanometres and 2,000 metres (2,187 yards) in the infrared; roughly twice the resolution of the imager aboard the GOES-N series, which only operates in five spectral bands. The imager can be used to produce full-disc images of the Earth or more targeted regional scans – including of the continental United States or in a mesoscale imaging mode that allows it to image a square box with sides of one thousand kilometers (621.4 miles, 540.0 nautical miles). In normal operation, the spacecraft will take four full-disc images, twelve scans of the continental United States and up to 120 mesoscale images every hour. Unlike the previous two generations of satellite, GOES-R does not carry an atmospheric sounding payload. One was to have been included as part of the Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES), a set of additional instruments which were part of the spacecraft’s original design but were removed in 2006 after proving too complicated to develop. Instead, data which would have been provided by the sounder will be interpolated from ABI’s images. The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) is a new instrument for the GOES-R series, a near-infrared sensor designed to detect and capture sudden visual events across the area it is monitoring. GLM will record and map lightning activity over the Americas, the West Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean. GLM is expected to improve forecasters’ ability to predict storms as they develop, giving advance warning of severe weather activity. The Solar Ultraviolet Imager, or SUVI, is one of two payloads which will study the Sun. It is designed to capture full-disc images in the extreme ultraviolet. SUVI will be used in space weather forecasting, monitoring activity across the face of the sun and eruptions and solar flares. SUVI is the successor to the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) that was introduced with the GOES 12 satellite. The second Solar-monitoring payload, the Extreme Ultraviolet and X-Ray Irradiance Sensors, or EXIS, consists of two instruments. Its Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor (EUVS) contains three grating spectrographs which will be used to measure variations in three particular spectral emission lines – from Helium, Hydrogen and Magnesium – in light coming from the Sun. These lines correspond to emissions from different regions of the Sun and can be used to model the Sun’s entire ultraviolet spectrum. The X-Ray Sensor (XRS) is a successor to an X-ray monitoring payload that has been carried on all GOES satellites since the beginning of the program, which is used to measure solar irradiance and characterize solar flares. XRS uses silicon photodiodes to measure incident radiation within two spectral bands: 0.05 to 0.4 nanometres and 0.1 to 0.8 nanometres. The Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS) consists of five sensor packages to study and characterize the space environment in which GOES-R will operate. Its Energetic Heavy Ion Sensor (EHIS) will measure the flux of larger energized particles both within the magnetosphere and incident from solar or cosmic sources. Two Magnetic Particle Sensors, MPS-Hi and MPS-Lo, will measure proton and electron flux; the former monitoring high-energy particles while the latter will study particles at lower energies. Two identical Solar and Galactic Proton Sensor (SGPS) packages complete the suite, measuring the incidence of Protons into Earth’s magnetosphere from the Sun and from cosmic sources. The final scientific payload, a magnetometer, is mounted at the end of an extendible boom which GOES-R will deploy once in orbit. The magnetometer will be used to characterize activity in the outer region of Earth’s magnetosphere. In addition to its scientific instruments, GOES-R carries a communications payload which is mounted on the solar array arm alongside the solar research payloads. Unique Payload Services, as this is named, consists of transponders to relay data for the GOES Rebroadcast (GRB), Data Collection System (DCS), Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN) and Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) projects. GOES Rebroadcast allows anyone with a compatible receiver to downlink observational data directly from the satellite. DCS collects data from unmanned environmental research stations and relays it back to a ground station. EMWIN is used to make weather forecasting data and warnings available for emergency management, while SARSAT is a worldwide program using satellites in low and geostationary orbits to detect distress signals from land, ships and aircraft and relay them to rescue services. GOES-R was launched by United Launch Alliance (ULA), using an Atlas V rocket. The vehicle, with the tail number AV-069, flew in the 541 configuration, with a five-metre (16.4-foot) payload fairing, four AJ-60A solid rocket motors augmenting a Common Core Booster first stage, and a single-engine Centaur upper stage. Saturday’s launch was the sixty-seventh flight of an Atlas V, and the fourth for the Atlas V 541. The Atlas V was developed by Lockheed Martin under the US Air Force’s Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, and first flew in August 2002 deploying Eutelsat’s Hot Bird 6 satellite. Boeing developed the Delta IV – which has made 33 flights to date – under the same program and Saturday’s launch was the one-hundredth between the two rockets. Since December 2006 both the Atlas V and Delta IV – along with the older Delta II rocket – have been operated by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The launch of GOES-R took a little over three and a half hours from liftoff to spacecraft separation, with the satellite expected to be deployed into a geosynchronous transfer orbit with a perigee of 8099 kilometres (5032 miles, 4373 nautical miles), an apogee of 35,286 kilometres (21,926 miles, 19,053 nautical miles) and 10.6 degrees inclination to the equator. ULA had a one-hour window in which to launch GOES-R on Saturday, which began at 17:42 Eastern Standard Time, or 22:42 UTC. Weather forecasts ahead of the launch were optimistic, with a 10% probability of unacceptable conditions predicted. However, a technical hold, followed by a Range issue, resulted in the launch moving to the end of the window. The launch took place from Space Launch Complex 41 (SLC-41) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A former Titan launch complex which was originally constructed in the 1960s, SLC-41 has been the East Coast home of the Atlas V since it was introduced in 2002. Atlas vehicles are assembled atop a mobile launch platform in the nearby Vertical Integration Building and rolled to the launch pad shortly ahead of launch. AV-069 was moved to the pad Friday morning.

The CCB is powered by a single RD-180 engine, manufactured by NPO Energomash of Russia, which burns RP-1 propellant oxidized by liquid oxygen. Igniting 2.7 seconds ahead of the planned liftoff, the RD-180 is the rocket’s principal source of thrust during the early stages of flight as Atlas climbs through Earth’s atmosphere. At liftoff, four Aerojet Rocketdyne AJ-60A solid rocket motors (SRMs) will ignite to provide additional thrust. Following first stage ignition, it took a few seconds for the RD-180 to reach launch thrust. Liftoff occurred at about 1.1 seconds after the zero mark in the countdown, when the force generated by the main engine and solid rocket motors exceeds the weight of the loaded vehicle. AV-069 began her ascent away from Cape Canaveral, beginning a series of pitch and yaw maneuvers 5.2 seconds after launch. The rocket flew along an azimuth of 100.7 degrees, taking it East and slightly South over the Atlantic Ocean. Thirty-five and a half seconds after liftoff, Atlas’ velocity reached Mach 1, the speed of sound. The rocket experienced maximum dynamic pressure – or Max-Q – 10.7 seconds later as it continued to climb. The SRMs burned out around 85 to 90 seconds into flight and separated in pairs; the first pair detaching at 110.4 seconds after liftoff and the second pair a second and a half later. At three minutes and 29.9 seconds after launch, the payload fairing separated from around GOES-R at the nose of the rocket. By this stage, Atlas was at an altitude in excess of 100 kilometers (62 miles, 54 nautical miles), above the denser regions of the atmosphere which would damage the spacecraft if it were unprotected. Because the five-metre fairing encapsulates not just the satellite but also the Centaur upper stage, it must be jettisoned before the first stage can separate. First stage flight ended with Booster Engine Cutoff, or BECO, four minutes and 21.8 seconds after liftoff. The spent stage separated six seconds later. Following staging, the Centaur’s single RL10C-1 engine began a prestart sequence ahead of its ignition ten seconds later. Powered by the combustion of liquid hydrogen propellant, oxidized by liquid oxygen, the Centaur made three burns during Saturday’s mission. From separation, the first burn lasted seven minutes and 37.8 seconds. Following a nine-minute, 43-second coast phase, the Centaur restarted for a five-minute, 38-second burn that raised its orbital apogee towards geosynchronous altitude. Following the burn, Centaur coasted towards its apogee, with its third burn eighteen-tenths of a second short of three hours later. The third and final burn lasted 93.3 seconds, raising the orbit’s perigee and reducing its inclination; decreasing the amount of propellant GOES-R will need to burn to reach its final geostationary station. Spacecraft separation occurred 69 seconds after the end of the third burn, at three hours, 31 minutes and 54.9 seconds mission elapsed time. Following separation GOES-R will use its LEROS-1C apogee motor to perform a series of orbit-raising maneuvers. Upon arrival in geostationary orbit, the satellite will undergo around a year of test and checkout operations. It is currently expected to replace GOES 13 in the GOES-EAST slot late next year, with GOES 13 becoming an additional on-orbit spare. GOES-R is designed for up to ten years of operational life plus five years of on-orbit storage; it is currently scheduled to be replaced by GOES-T in late 2025. Saturday’s launch was the seventh of eight Atlas V missions planned for 2016, coming just eight days after the launch of the WorldView-4 commercial imaging satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base, a mission which had been delayed from September by brush fires around the launch site. One further launch is planned before the end of the year, which will fly from Cape Canaveral in mid-December with the EchoStar XIX communications satellite. For United Launch Alliance, who have also conducted three Delta IV launches this year, it was the tenth flight of the year. ULA’s next launch will be on 7 December when the last Delta of the year will carry a Wideband Global Satcom spacecraft into orbit. The next GOES satellite, GOES-S, is currently scheduled for launch aboard another Atlas V in 2018. Before then, the NOAA’s next low-orbit weather satellite, JPSS-1, is expected to launch atop a Delta II next March. (Images via NSF member SaxtonHale, ULA, NOAA, Lockheed Martin and NASA).

Follow us on Home Oman Region World Opinion Sports Business Features Videos About us Archives Blogs First commercial flight training centre inaugurated in Oman Muscat Daily staff writer November 19, 2016 Muscat -  H E Darwish bin Ismail bin Ali al Balushi, Minister Responsible for Financial Affairs and the Chairman of Oman Air inaugurated the Oman Air Flight Training Centre (OAFTC) last week. The state-of-the-art facility will enable pilots and cabin crew to train realistically for operating Boeing and Airbus aircraft. The launch ceremony was attended by ministers, Oman Air’s Board of Directors, senior airline managers, senior representatives of the Public Authority for Civil Aviation, Oman Airports Management Company and members of the media. At the heart of the facilities provided at OAFTC will be cutting edge flight simulators. In addition to being a requirement under international flight safety regulations, flight simulator training is essential to the provision of high quality training programmes for flight deck crew. The flight simulators are being supplied by one of the world’s best-known simulator manufacturers, Canada-based TRU-Simulation and Training Company. Based at its headquarters in Muscat, OAFTC offers Oman Air the opportunity to provide its pilots and cabin crew with the highest standards of in-house training, in line with both civil aviation regulations and industry best practices. The innovative technology that is integral to OAFTC, together with its strategic location, enhances the high level of efficiency to which Oman Air is required to work. And by operating world-class training facilities in-house, and offering its services to commercial partners, Oman Air is able to make substantial cost savings which can subsequently be invested to the benefit of its customers. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Paul Gregorowitsch, CEO, Oman Air said, “Oman Air is pleased and proud to be opening this outstanding new facility. OAFTC will enable Oman Air to continue operating to the highest safety standards and with absolute professionalism. Furthermore, Oman Air’s investment in this training facility - the first of its kind in Oman - will add an important milestone in the airline’s contribution towards the development of the country. “I would like to thank His Excellency the Chairman, and his colleagues on Oman Air’s Board of Directors for their unwavering support. I would also like to express my gratitude to Captain Ali Hassan Sulaiman, executive vice president and chief operations officer, his colleagues and all at Oman Air whose hard work and commitment have ensured that this training centre has been completed within a very tight timeframe.” Captain Sulaiman added, “OAFTC offers one full flight simulator for Airbus 330 training, and another one for Boeing 737. In addition, one flight training device for Boeing B737 has been installed as a tool for cadet training programmes. “The centre also includes facilities needed to train Oman Air’s cabin crew. These include A330 and B737 mock-ups, along with a B787 door trainer. Each of these is designed to enable crew to train for, and practice, all the emergency procedures required as part of our cabin crew training and qualification courses. “Furthermore, having the flight simulator trainers close to Oman Air’s premises will support Oman Air’s strategy to ensure cost-effectiveness in all areas of its operations by avoiding expensive excessive training expenses overseas. We also have the option of offering our facilities to commercial partners, creating an additional revenue stream for Oman Air.” Similar content Oman Air to build training centre First commercial flight training centre inaugurated in Oman RAFO to get C295 flight simulator PDO launches simulation centre to train oil well drillers MUSCATDAILY POLL Do you support new taxes on sugary drinks and fast food?  Yes  No Contact us  Privacy policy Sitemap  RSS feeds  To subscribe Ⓒ​  2014   Apex Press and Publishing ,  PO Box 2616,  Ruwi 112, Muscat,  Sultanate of Oman   Telephone: +968-24799388, Fax : 24787573

The deal is expected to be finalized at a Nov. 23 board meeting. “The new, yet-to-be named airline will have a market share in the Germany/Austria/Switzerland leisure business of 35%,” a source involved in the negotiations told ATW. “The transaction will be completed within the next weeks. The airline will be a completely new company on the market.” The source said the current project name of the company is Blue Sky. TUIfly employees have also agreed to the latest development and are now confident the new airline will offer future growth potential. On Oct. 6, TUIfly had to cancel flights and decided to completely shut down flight operations after many aircraft crew called in sick on short notice. The action followed concerns about the merger between the two companies. The source said the new holding company is expected to be based in Austria, with Etihad 25% and TUI taking a 24% stake. The remaining 51% is expected to be held by an Austrian foundation, to ensure Austrian majority ownership and maintain international traffic rights. The airline is planning a fleet of 14 Boeing 737s (currently operated by TUIfly for airberlin under a wet-lease agreement), 27 TUIfly 737NGs, as well as 17 Airbus A320 family aircraft from Austrian airberlin subsidiary FlyNiki, total 58 aircraft. But the airline plans to operate 60 aircraft initially. “However, the new owner will then decide on a future harmonized fleet (either Airbus or Boeing). But this is not our decision [for TUI Group] anymore. For now, both companies will operate separately in their own identities. The transformation [bringing both companies together] will take some time and will be a slow process,” the source said. In addition, the airline will have its own independent marketing and distribution system.  TUIfly is part of TUI Group, which has a portfolio of six European airlines and around 140 aircraft, a distribution network of more than 1,800 travel agencies and online portals, around 300 hotels and 14 cruise liners. “We, the TUI Group, have ambitious growth plans to add more hotels and cruise liners [to the portfolio],” the source said. The TUI Group handles 20 million guests annually. ATW understands the other TUI Group airlines are not part of the deal. These comprise UK-based Thomson Airways (63 aircraft), Sweden’s TUIfly Nordic (eight aircraft), TUI Airlines Belgium (21 aircraft), TUI Airlines Netherlands (10 aircraft) and France’s Corsair International (seven aircraft).

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out travel Search Destinations Themes News Travel Troubles Cruising Snow Kiwi Traveller Flight test: Auckland to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific on the new Airbus A350 SIOBHAN DOWNES Last updated 05:00, November 20 2016 CHRIS MCKEEN/Stuff.co.nz The world's newest airliner - the Airbus A350 - has landed at Auckland International Airport. We tested out the world's newest aircraft, Cathay Pacific's jetlag-beating A350.  THE AIRLINE: Cathay Pacific. THE ROUTE: Auckland to Hong Kong, an 11-hour flight. We were scheduled to leave at 2.50pm, but delayed because of the late arrival of the aircraft. We took off shortly after 4pm, landing in Hong Kong just before 10pm (local time). SUPPLIED Cathay Pacific flies the A350 daily from Auckland to Hong Kong. THE PLANE: The new generation Airbus A350-900. Cathay Pacific is the first airline to operate the aircraft to New Zealand, and Auckland is its third long-haul A350 destination, after Dusseldorf and London Gatwick. The A350 competes with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, and boasts all sorts of snazzy features. There's special LED lighting which is meant to recreate sunrise and sunset to make sleeping easier and reduce jet lag. There's advanced air conditioning, with cabin air recycled every three minutes. It's supposed to be 25 per cent more fuel efficient than other aircraft in the fleet, and so quiet that passengers are able to talk in a whisper. THE LOYALTY PLAN: The Marco Polo Club. Cathay Pacific also has an alliance with Air New Zealand for the Auckland to Hong Kong route, which means if you book through Air New Zealand and end up travelling on Cathay Pacific, you can still earn Airpoints. Siobhan Downes Economy seats on the Cathay Pacific A350. UP THE BACK OR AT THE POINTY END: Somewhere in the middle. I was seated in economy, in row 41 - just behind the premium economy cabin. By some great stroke of luck, I ended up having the whole row to myself. THE SEAT STUFF: Economy seats have an 81cm pitch, 46cm seat width and 15cm recline. The new headrests can apparently be adjusted six ways - up, down, and angled at the sides - but I couldn't figure out how to do this, so just left mine as it was. Other new features include a tablet holder, cup holder and USB port. The tray table seemed a little bit smaller than usual. BAGGAGE ALLOWANCE: 23kg for checked baggage, and 7kg for carry on. COMFORT FACTOR: The new pillows and blankets were lovely and soft. Of course, it helped that I had the whole row to stretch out in, but my seat did feel wider than other economy cabins. Ad Feedback THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT: There was an 11-inch touchscreen TV on the back of the seat in front which worked like a dream - it responded to the lightest touch without lagging. There was a mixture of Western and Asian inflight movies, and I was surprised by the number of Kiwi offerings - Taika Waititi's Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in the Shadows, as well as The Lord of the Rings. You can also watch satellite TV news, and inflight wi-fi is available for a fee. THE SERVICE: Overall it was friendly and efficient, except for a hiccup at the check in desk at Auckland Airport. We were lined up waiting for the counters to open, but when they did, we were rather haphazardly directed to self service kiosks. All of the machines ended up crashing, so we had to be shepherded back into the line for the "human" counters. The staff seemed frazzled, and it made for a bit of a stressful experience. FEEDING TIME: In economy, we were handed a dining menu before takeoff, which was a nice touch. Lunch was served shortly after, with a choice of three meals. I had whiting fish with hot bean sauce and rice, followed by New Zealand ice cream. It was tasty and I polished off the lot - and I can never usually finish all of my plane food. Teatime was about halfway through the flight - this time there were two choices, and I got the black pepper beef and rice, followed by mango mousse cake. Again, I managed to eat it all. I think the portion sizes are on point, but if you get peckish, there are also cup noodles available as a snack throughout flight. ONE MORE THING: I have to mention the facial moisturiser in the bathrooms. Usually I come off a long-haul flight with my face resembling a pizza, but this time my skin stayed miraculously clear, and I think it was because of this magical moisturiser (unfortunately, Cathay Pacific are unable to tell me exactly what the brand is). I liked that it was freely available for anyone to use - usually that sort of luxury is reserved for the business class amenity kits.  THE VERDICT: I can report that I felt well-rested and fresh at the end of my flight. But it's hard to know if that was because of the A350's whizz-bang technology, or if my body was just being kind to me on that particular day. For the record, I was upgraded to business class on the way back, and felt rotten the whole time. No matter how good the plane is - or your seat, for that matter - sometimes travelling simply takes its toll. FREQUENCY: Cathay Pacific flies the A350 daily from Auckland to Hong Kong.

The TBAL facility, a joint venture between the Tata Advanced Systems Ltd and Boeing, is expected to start operations next year. Fuselage is the central body of an aircraft, to which the wings and tail assembly are attached and accommodates the crew, passengers, and cargo. Apache is a twin engine multi-mission attack helicopter. India has ordered 15 heavy-lift helicopter Chinook and 22 Apaches, which are expected to be delivered in 2019. More than 50 per cent of the Apache helicopters currently in operation are used by the US defence forces. "The building is being erected right now and we expect our first Apache fuselage to be delivered in the second quarter of 2018 for the US army. "So, our strategy for this factory is not to only build fuselages for the Indian Apaches. The plan is to build them for every Apache from 2018 on wards in our factory in Hyderabad," said Dave KooperSmith, Vice President, General Managar Vertical Lift of Boeing and board member of the TBAL. "We are in the middle of negotiating over 240 aircraft for the US Army and 450 aircraft for all customers. From 2018 onwards all of those fuselages will be built in India," said KooperSmith.

November 20, 2016 0602 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:172355 Publish Date: Sat, 19 Nov 2016 09:56:50 GMT Service: Iran US wrapping up sale of 104 warplanes to Qatar, Kuwait The US State Department has authorized the sale of 104 F-15 Strike Eagle and F/A-18 warplanes to Qatar and Kuwait, a move that Washington says is aimed at bolstering foreign policy interests. With an estimated cost of $21.1 billion, the deal with Qatar would include 72 F-15s together with “weapons and related support, equipment, and training,” said the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency in a statement. “This proposed sale enhances the foreign policy and national security of the United State by helping to improve the security of a friendly country and strengthening our strategically important relationship,” the agency added. American officials claim that the sale of the multi-role fighters would not affect the military balance of the Middle East, which is already struggling with years-long foreign-backed militancy and Western intervention. Additionally, America’s “defense readiness” would not take a hit from the deal, the statement further noted. The deal would benefit American aerospace giant Boeing the most, but other companies like Lockheed Martin and Britain's BAE Systems would benefit too. If Congress approves the deal, Boeing would be allowed to extend the aircraft’s production line. The company had earlier warned that it was going to shut down both production lines by the end of this decade due to excessive costs and inadequate demand. Saudi Arabia and Israel are two other regional customers for the twin-engine aircraft. The State Department has also authorized a deal with Kuwait, another Arab state in the Persian Gulf region, which had put an offer for 32 F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets worth $10.1 billion. Each F/A-18 Hornet, and its upgraded version, the F/A-18 Super Hornet, costs at least $57 million, making it "the most cost-effective aircraft" in the US aviation fleet, costing less per flight hour than any other in the US forces inventory, the Navy says. The massive deals came as Middle Eastern nations had been experiencing budget pressure due to the plummeting oil prices. A number of US senators have been building up pressure on the administration of President Barack Obama to approve the deals, although some government officials had initially opposed them, saying they would risk Israel’s security.     KeyWords US wrapping Qatar   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran ready to help Iraq hold Arba’een rituals: First VP Iran sympathizes with India over fatal train derailment Iranian snatch six world taekwondo medals Martial skills fetch Iran four Taolu World Cup medals Iran dives to take third title out of Japan's water Iran finishes fourth at Asian Water Polo Championship Jahangiri: Iran on the side of Iraqi nation and govt. in anti-terror fight Iran's referees judged best by AFC Iran urges ICC to address reasons behind member states’ withdrawal Iran: Oil may rise to $55 if all producers cooperate Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0642 sec

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French US wrapping up sale of 104 warplanes to Qatar, Kuwait Fri Nov 18, 2016 10:48PM Home US Military A US Air Force F-15 Strike Eagle fighter jet (file photo) The US State Department has authorized the sale of 104 F-15 Strike Eagle and F/A-18 warplanes to Qatar and Kuwait, a move that Washington says is aimed at bolstering foreign policy interests. With an estimated cost of $21.1 billion, the deal with Qatar would include 72 F-15s together with “weapons and related support, equipment, and training,” said the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency in a statement. “This proposed sale enhances the foreign policy and national security of the United State by helping to improve the security of a friendly country and strengthening our strategically important relationship,” the agency added. American officials claim that the sale of the multi-role fighters would not affect the military balance of the Middle East, which is already struggling with years-long foreign-backed militancy and Western intervention. Additionally, America’s “defense readiness” would not take a hit from the deal, the statement further noted. The deal would benefit American aerospace giant Boeing the most, but other companies like Lockheed Martin and Britain's BAE Systems would benefit too. If Congress approves the deal, Boeing would be allowed to extend the aircraft’s production line. The company had earlier warned that it was going to shut down both production lines by the end of this decade due to excessive costs and inadequate demand. Saudi Arabia and Israel are two other regional customers for the twin-engine aircraft. The State Department has also authorized a deal with Kuwait, another Arab state in the Persian Gulf region, which had put an offer for 32 F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets worth $10.1 billion. An F/A-18 fighter jet on an aircraft carrier (file photo) Each F/A-18 Hornet, and its upgraded version, the F/A-18 Super Hornet, costs at least $57 million, making it "the most cost-effective aircraft" in the US aviation fleet, costing less per flight hour than any other in the US forces inventory, the Navy says. The massive deals came as Middle Eastern nations had been experiencing budget pressure due to the plummeting oil prices. A number of US senators have been building up pressure on the administration of President Barack Obama to approve the deals, although some government officials had initially opposed them, saying they would risk Israel’s security.

Last time we met you had just launched Natalie a fragrance. Honored in honor of your mom and sell. Just tell me where you are now you have actually now continue Ed and because you know an entrepreneur. It's very big east from the spring to now I have never been so busy in my whole life. We had such an amazing response to the fragrance and people were so excited about it. That we decided to work on it can't all. Am I Hearst's role on I change the packaging to make it a little more. I'm specific to my mom and the gold of her name and the guard Kenya. And then coincidentally her the book that I had been working on admin Alan Bowman came out in October. So and working on new fragrance effort twine the seventeen. You had some never before seen as a mountain cracked. Yes so we have this gigantic storage room. That's been sitting there for sort of thirty years and we haven't. Spent a lot of time going through it and them. When Manila Boeing bombing came to my dad and my apps talk about the Spock. I took him into the storage for him and he couldn't leave how how many photographs were there. And it was helpful to have somebody that wasn't as close to it. You look through everything. And then we decided together which as we showed to the public because there are so many every time and our family. And I think that her fans really want to see another side of this now lifestyle brand that you had lunged from the refused to them opt to pick candles. On Spain. You're preserving the memories of your Hmong. And Tammy if you own and I got NA can make me emotional just talking about it because. My memories of her are still.

NorthwestMilitary.com Menu Home News Military Life Vets Restaurants Music & Culture Travel Guides PROMO View Full Site Back to News New book on World War II shares first-hand accounts Twelve Washington residents share their memories of WWII By Gail Wood on November 18, 2016 This is their story, their chilling, first-hand experiences of fighting in World War II. In a page-turning account, from a paratrooper, a fighter pilot, an engineer and a man with Japanese parents who enlisted in the Army, these local residents reflect on their days during a war that saved the world from tyranny. Twelve people, all residents of the state of Washington, talk about their memories in a new book, Washington Remembers WWII. Each of them share their experience in WWII, giving a detailed, first-hand account of a troubling time in America's history. Joe Moser talks about being held prisoner by the Germans after bailing out of a crashing Lockheed P-38 Lightning, which was the fastest twin-engine fighter of its time. He survived eight months in the hellish Buchenwald concentration camp. He was set free just days before his rumored execution. Fred Shiosaki talks about how he was working on his homework and listening to the radio in his Spokane home. Suddenly, an alarming announcement was made over the radio. It was Dec. 7, 1941. The Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor. Shiosaki enlisted and joined the storied 442nd Regimental Combat Team, one of the most decorated units in U.S. Army history. Regina Tollfeldt of Olympia did what she could by working in a Boeing factory, helping build bombers and fighter planes. As one of the last surviving of the famous "Rosie the Riveters," Tollfeldt worked eight hours a day, seven days a week. Arnold Samuels talks of how his family escaped the Nazis in 1937 and how he returned as an Army GI, helping liberate those imprisoned at the concentration camp at Dachau. After the war, Samuels served with the Counter Intelligence Corps and searched for military criminals. During this time, Samuels worked with a 22-year-old sergeant named Henry Kissinger, who later became the U.S. secretary of state under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and received the Nobel Peace Prize. Bob Hart reflects on his decision to volunteer as a paratrooper in 1943, saying he made that decision because he thought he wouldn't have to walk as far. On his first jump in combat, Hart broke his foot and was forced to walk 50 miles in southern France. Hart talks about his involvement in the Battle of the Bulge and how his outfit helped stop Adolph Hitler's desperate bid to counter the ally attack. Robert Graham, who lives in Olympia and was a seven-term state auditor, was a flight engineer on cargo planes during WWII. The C-54s in his squadron carried everything from C-rations to atomic bomb parts. On return flights from the South Pacific, Graham talks about how the planes were filled with wounded men. "Our motto was we always delivered the goods," Graham said. Last year in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII, an exhibit at the Karshner Museum in Puyallup opened. The exhibit, the "Veterans Night at the Museum," is open from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. until February.

NASA NASA is asking the private space industry how to make its future Mars vehicles more affordable. The agency released a Request for Information Thursday afternoon, looking for ideas that could maximize the “long term efficiency and sustainability” of its Exploration Systems Development (ESD) programs. Those include NASA’s next big rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), and the Orion crew capsule — the vehicle that’s supposed to take astronauts into deep space and on to the Red Planet someday. For now, Boeing is the primary contractor for the SLS, and Orion is being built by Lockheed Martin, with NASA overseeing production of both systems. But this year alone, NASA was given more the $3 billion to fund the projects, a sizable chunk of its $19.3 billion budget. And that’s a lot for a rocket and crew system that’s only supposed to fly once a year. In the RFI, NASA lays out all the missions it expects to do with the SLS and Orion between now and 2030, showing just one flight annually starting in 2023. For comparison, NASA says the average cost of launching the Space Shuttle was $450 million. Ideas that could maximize “long term efficiency and sustainability” Now it seems the agency is looking for ways to reduce the amount of money it needs to sustain SLS and Orion, perhaps through workflow and management changes or different ways of acquiring materials. But as Ars Technica points out, NASA may not just be looking for ways to cut production costs. There is some phrasing in the RFI that suggests NASA is open to cheaper alternative hardware, too. The document calls for “competing exploration services in the mid-2020s timeframe and beyond,” which could indicate that the agency is willing to hear ideas for vehicles that could replace both the SLS and Orion. For instance, heavy-lift vehicles being developed by the private sector, such as SpaceX’s soon-to-be launched Falcon Heavy or Blue Origin’s future New Glenn rocket, could prove to be adequate substitutes for the SLS at much lower costs. It makes sense that NASA is looking to cut spending right now, especially since it’s about to go through an administration change. The agency will get entirely new leadership, and it looks like it’ll be getting a new direction too — one that isn’t exactly keen on big spending and redundancies. Former congressman Bob Walker, who wrote President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed space policy during the campaign, told The Verge that the focus of NASA’s leadership under the new administration should be to “make sure our spending of space assets is being done efficiently and we’re not duplicating efforts unnecessarily.” Walker, however, will not be involved with the NASA transition team, he confirmed to The Verge.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Nov 18, 2016 at 10:52AM Many retirees think that they should sell off their stock portfolios after they retire. It's true that the shorter time horizon that most retirees adopt in their investing calls for more conservative asset allocations, but especially in today's low-rate environment, retirees can't count on fixed-income assets like bonds to produce enough income to get by. That's why dividend stocks have gotten so popular, and it's why turning to stocks like PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP), Altria Group (NYSE:MO), and Boeing (NYSE:BA) can be a great way for retirees to stay invested in dependable stocks with reliable income payouts. Below, we'll take a closer look at these three stocks to show how they could keep you invested after retirement. Image source: Getty Images. PepsiCo serves up strong growth From an income investor's perspective, PepsiCo has been a great stock over the long run. The maker of soft drinks and the company behind the Frito-Lay snack brand currently has a 3% dividend yield, and it has given investors dividend increases in each of the past 44 years. Moreover, that dividend growth has been substantial, with its most recent boost coming in June and adding 7% to its previous payout. Dividends have played a vital role in serving up average annual returns of nearly 14% over the past 30 years. Looking forward, some have been concerned about PepsiCo's exposure to the carbonated sugary soft drink market, which has come under fire for potentially causing health problems. Yet even though its namesake beverage has faced challenges, PepsiCo more broadly has embraced the move toward healthier food offerings. By branching out and offering other beverages as well as innovative snack offerings to appeal to food-conscious consumers, PepsiCo has stayed ahead of the curve and has good prospects to add to its past successes with future growth. Altria keeps smoking Consumer stocks are often appealing to income investors, and Altria arguably has the best past performance of any dividend stock in the market. The company has given investors average annual returns of nearly 20% over the past 45 years, and the stock currently pays a yield of almost 4%. Altria isn't recognized among the prestigious list of Dividend Aristocrat stocks because of various spinoffs during its corporate history, but when you adjust for those corporate events, the tobacco giant has rewarded investors with higher dividends for 47 straight years. Many investors fear that long-term secular trends against smoking will eventually be the death knell for Altria's primary business. Yet Altria has fought successfully against those trends for decades. Moreover, its efforts to move forward with reduced-risk product development have been encouraging, and the movement toward alternatives like electronic cigarettes and heat-not-burn technology looks like a potential growth avenue in the future. Add in the company's nearly 10% stake in beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Altria looks like it's poised to keep defying skeptics. Boeing flies higher The aerospace industry has been extremely strong in recent years, and Boeing has been one of the primary beneficiaries of demand for aircraft. The airplane manufacturer has seen massive orders for both its newest models and its updated versions of tried-and-true aircraft, and that has produced impressive backlogs that show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. It's true that airlines have started to see some deterioration in key revenue metrics, and the big decline in fuel prices boosted profits in what's likely to be a one-time way. However, Boeing now has the prospects of higher defense-related spending bolstering the military side of its aerospace business. For income investors, Boeing has been aggressive in boosting its dividend in recent years. It doesn't have the long-term history that Altria and PepsiCo do, but the company has more than doubled its quarterly payout in just the past three years, including a 20% boost at the beginning of 2016. With a 3% yield and a payout ratio of just over 60%, Boeing's growth could continue to reward investors of all ages. Dividend stocks can be a good solution for retirees looking to stay invested in retirement and get the income they need. Take a closer look at Boeing, Altria, and PepsiCo as promising stocks that could fit the bill for your portfolio. Dan Caplinger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Candidate Trump called China a "currency manipulator" and threatened to put into place 45 percent tariffs on Chinese imports. He also threatened trade with Mexico, including getting rid of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA deal, which would have serious implications for agriculture and other industries. "The current uncertainty diminishes the appetite foreign businesses have to investment in U.S. businesses," said Rabobank Food & Agribusiness Research and Advisory in a report released this week. According to Rabobank, the U.S. food and agriculture industries are "one of the main drivers of global agriculture and trade." Ag exports from the U.S. approached $127 billion in the latest year, and besides being the world's top corn exporter, the U.S. is a major seller of soybeans globally with about half of the crop going overseas to customers such as China. Ag exports to China have grown more than 200 percent in the past decade and last year topped $20 billion. U.S. soybean exports to China have been strong this year, but the sharp rhetoric on trade from Trump during the campaign now is translating into tough talk from the communist nation about possible retaliation if the new administration imposes tariffs. "If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed," Global Times, a Chinese state-run news agency, wrote Sunday. "China will take a tit-for-tat approach then," it added, mentioning everything from Boeing orders to agricultural imports such as U.S. soybeans and corn. Jessica Rinaldi | The Boston Globe | Getty Images Meantime, candidate Trump called NAFTA the "worst trade deal in history" and may push to renegotiate the 22-year-old agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Overall, Mexico and Canada represent nearly one-third of the total U.S. agricultural exports. "Any change to U.S. agricultural trade agreements will not only affect global prices and trade dynamics but also U.S. farmer margins," according to the Rabobank report. At the same time, Rabobank said there are NAFTA implications in terms of currency fluctuations such as the Mexican peso. It expects Mexico's exports to the U.S. might benefit from the depreciation of the peso, and Brazil, a major agricultural competitor on the global market, could become more attractive than the U.S. Then again, others suggest the weak peso and strong dollar is making some U.S. ag products more expensive for Mexico. "There is concern that corn shipments to Mexico will fall off a little bit due to it costing more for Mexico to buy corn," said Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst for Futures International in Chicago. Nearly one-fifth of total U.S. food and agriculture exports go to Mexico. Elsewhere, President-elect Trump's plans to crackdown on undocumented immigrants may complicate efforts to attract domestic migrant farm workers. Trump has said he will deport millions of undocumented immigrants and build a "big beautiful wall" at the U.S.-Mexico border. The ag and food sectors, whether fresh produce, livestock or food service companies, are "highly dependent on migrant labor," according to Rabobank. There's also been a trend of rising labor costs, which the bank's report blames on the stricter immigrant laws and increased opportunities in other sectors. The ag industry has been asking for immigration reform to deal with undocumented workers and to help alleviate the farm labor shortage. The labor shortage has been widely recognized in fruit and vegetable production but it is increasingly being found in other ag areas such as dairies and poultry operations. Some farmers rely on the foreign guest farmworker visa program to hire help during harvest time. However, there have been delays in the paperwork processing reported in California and at least a dozen other states. "The current process has so many limitations on it that a lot of folks end up with their crops literally rotting in the field because they don't have anybody to pick the crop," said Dale Moore, executive director of public policy for the American Farm Bureau Federation in Washington, D.C. The Farm Bureau official added, "We know it will be necessarily tied into the broader process of immigration reform." Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Soybeans are harvested Princeton, Illinois, Meantime, the agricultural industry also is looking to the incoming Trump administration for regulatory relief. Specifically, the ag industry wants policy changes with regard to water and environmental reforms, including federal land grazing permit reforms. One area sought is a rollback of the controversial Water of the U.S. rule, known as WOTUS, which was outlined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Several states have challenged the WOTUS rules, which broadened the definition of such things as "tributary" and also toughens controls over "adjacent waters." In some cases, farmers could lose ranch or farmland, which some have called a regulatory overreach. "This water regulation is not just affecting farmers and ranchers but it affects a lot of different industry sectors," said Moore.

Iran News ... 11/18/16 U.S. Lawmakers Vote To Bar Commercial Aircraft Sales To Iran Source: RFE/RL U.S. lawmakers have passed legislation that would ban the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, a move aimed at halting sales by aerospace giants Boeing and Airbus that outgoing President Barack Obama's administration has already approved. By a vote of 243-175, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives on November 17 passed the bill that would bar the Treasury Department from granting licenses required for U.S. banks to finance the commercial aircraft deals with Iran. The move is the latest in a broader effort by Republicans in Congress to push back against the landmark deal between Iran and major world powers, which lifts some sanctions against Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. Obama considers the deal a signature achievement of his presidency, while President-Elect Donald Trump has pledged to tear it up or renegotiate the accord to squeeze greater concessions from Iran. The bill, however, is unlikely to become law under the current Congress, where it would likely face substantial resistance from Democrats in the Senate. The purchase of aircraft and parts is expressly allowed under the Iran nuclear accord. Copyright (c) 2016 RFE/RL, Inc.

General Abdul Wahab al-Saidi said this morning. “The Iraqi forces aim to take complete control of the city’s Tahrir area and from there move into the adjacent Muharabeen district,” AP adds. Moving into Tahrir puts Iraqi forces in about a dozen of Mosul’s 50 or so neighborhoods, Reuters reports from the city’s edge, where the Golden Division is deploying drones to surveil the streets and alleyways for possible surprise suicide attacks. Nearby, “a Friday prayer sermon referring to ‘mujahideen’, or holy war fighters, could be heard coming from a mosque under control of the jihadis in the vicinity. An armed man, possibly a sniper, was in the minaret of the mosque.” Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. Iraq’s air force has reportedly just received four new F-16s, bringing their total to 14 out of 36 Baghdad agreed to purchase from the U.S. ISIS put out a release Thursday admitting it has lost some territory around Mosul; but don’t get too excited—they still have lots of suicide bombers ready to go. Kurdistan24 news has more, here. Citizens of Mosul are calling into a talk radio program “to unload on suicide bombers and errant airstrikes” and to ask what to do about “the lack of food and medicine,” the Washington Post reports. “They [also] have questions about when to wave white flags and what to do with bodies in the rubble.” So what is this station? Radio Alghad, and its “founder is a 30-something tech entrepreneur who calls himself ‘Mohammad of Mosul’ in interviews because he does not want to be targeted by the Islamic State or its supporters. He also insists on keeping the location of his station and most of the names of its hosts secret. He is concerned about car bombs. He will allow a reporter to say only that the operation is in the Kurdish area of Iraq.” Worth the click, here. A suicide car bomb killed a dozen Iraqis at a Sunni wedding near Baghdad, Reuters reports this morning. In response to similar attacks across the country, Iraq has reportedly imposed new curfews on three towns—Haditha, Baghdadi, and Hit—out of fear that ISIS will reprise its counterattacks in Kirkuk and Rutbah. Hospitals bombed in Syria. Doctors are scrambling today in the northern city of Aleppo after bombs hit “several hospitals and [sent] the chief of a pediatrics clinic in a frantic search for a place to move his young patients,” AP reports, noting, “So far, more than 100 people have been killed across northern Syria since Tuesday… Many hospitals and clinics in the besieged area [of Aleppo] have moved their operations underground after months of relentless bombings and airstrikes. The World Health Organization said in 2016, it recorded 126 attacks on health facilities, a common tactic in the war in Syria.” And in case you need reminding, AP writes that “Russia and the Syrian government deny targeting hospitals in airstrikes.” More here. Brush up on your French and learn how France’s Directorate of Military Intelligence is helping pick ISIS targets in their Raqqa stronghold, via this report from France 2 TV. Turkey wants to get its hands on Russia’s S-400 air defense system, Reuters reports. But Ankara’s Defense Minister Fikri Isik said Turkey is also in talks with other countries for a similar system as well. More, but not a lot, here. President-elect Donald Trump’s Pentagon transition will likely begin today, the Pentagon announced late Thursday. According to Defense News, Trump’s defense transition team is reportedly “being led by retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, with former Pentagon official and Boeing executive Mira Ricardel, also listed as ‘defense’ under him, and retired Army Brig. Gen. Michael Meese listed as the transition head for Veterans Affairs.” Retired Generals Jack Keane and James Mattis could be on deck for the Defense Secretary gig, Bloomberg reports this morning, citing a single anonymous source. Meantime, Mike Flynn has officially been tapped to become Trump’s National Security Advisor, meaning he’ll have to drop his ties to the consulting firm that bears his name, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday evening. Trump has also reportedly selected Kansas Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA. For what it’s worth, here’s Pompeo on Twitter just yesterday: “I look forward to rolling back this disastrous [Iran nuclear] deal with the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism.” And Guantanamo Bay will get a new commander, Miami Herald’s Carol Rosenberg reported Thursday. The new guy: “Rear Adm. Edward Cashman, 51, is due to assume command of the downsizing detention center early next year, replacing Rear Adm. Peter Clarke, a submariner whose onward assignment has yet to be disclosed. No exact date was provided in the Department of Defense announcement. Cashman’s assignment was already in the Pentagon pipeline before the presidential election.” For what it’s worth: “As of Thursday, the detention center had 60 captives, 20 of the men approved for release with security assurances that satisfy Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, and a staff of around 1,900 troops and civilians.” More here. With Sen. Jeff Sessions now selected as Trump’s attorney general, will Sen. Tom Cotton become SecDef? “Mr. Cotton could be called a Trumpian conservative — eager to spend billions of dollars more on the military, virulently opposed to the Iranian nuclear deal and determined to bomb the something out of the Islamic State,” The New York Times writes. “But he also wove a careful line in an interview on Thursday, warning about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.” Many of Trump’s political enemies during his campaign run “have become the objects of his attention as he considers them for cabinet positions,” NYTs reports in this transition team roll-up. Apropos of nothing: Check out the new cover from the latest edition of The Economist. How the troops feel: A new survey suggests 75 percent of U.S. servicemembers are not worried that PEOTUS Trump “may issue orders that violate military rules or traditions,” according to a new poll from Military Times. The positive takeaways: “More than 60 percent said they think the new president will be able to work with Congress to find a solution to defense spending caps, and 56 percent said they believe Trump will improve troops’ pay and benefits. In addition, 54 percent of troops surveyed believe Trump will be able to address the threat posed by Islamic State militants in the Middle East.” The negatives: “More than 27 percent said that having Trump as commander in chief will negatively affect their military job or mission. Among officers, 39 percent expressed those concerns. Among women, 55 percent worry their jobs will be adversely affected.” More here.

Ally update: NATO Sec-Gen Jens Stoltenberg, trying to get on Trump’s schedule for a phone call, nevertheless says, “I am absolutely confident that President Trump will maintain U.S leadership in the alliance.” That from Reuters, which reminds us that the president-elect “questioned during his election campaign whether the United States should protect allies that have low defense spending, raising fears that he could withdraw funding for the alliance at a time of greater tensions with Russia.” Meanwhile, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared Trump a “trustworthy leader” after a Manhattan meeting. Again, Reuters: “Trump had fanned worries in Tokyo and beyond with comments on the possibility of Japan acquiring nuclear arms, demands that allies pay more for keeping U.S. forces on their soil or face their possible withdrawal, and his opposition to the U.S.-led 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade pact.” Cleared for take-off: The U.S. has finally approved more than $31 billion in fighter jet sales to MidEast allies, IHS Janes reports this morning. The Thursday announcement from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency lays out “the approval of 40 Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets for Kuwait and 72 Boeing F-15 Advanced Eagles for Qatar, valued at USD10.1 billion and USD21.1 billion respectively.” In that number: The two deals nearly equal the $33.6 billion in arms sales the Obama administration approved globally in fiscal 2016, Defense One’s Global Business Editor Marcus Weisgerber writes. ICYMI: Nixon’s SecDef and former Wisconsin Republican Rep. Melvin R. Laird passed away Wednesday from heart failure at the age of 94 in Fort Myers, Fla. Laird presided over the height of the Vietnam war and oversaw the change from the draft to an all-volunteer force. The Washington Post has a remembrance of “Mel,” here. Lastly this week: The plane in a bag. Yesterday we asked readers if they had ideas what aircraft was concealed in this photo transiting somewhere in the continental U.S. on a trailer with no license plates. The overwhelming response: an F/A-18. Replied one reader: Why assume it’s an aircraft? It could be this. Added another: “It almost has to be a Rebel Alliance X wing fighter, along with various service modules and attending droid attachment pods. The guys and girls at Groom Lake have been refurbishing them in anticipation of Trump’s promised assault on the Immigrant Death Star approaching from the south.” Thanks for playing along, gang.

Built based on Boeing B737, the aircraft has been modified by adding latest maritime surveillance and attack capabilities. The Australia Government has committed to procure 15 P-8A Poseidon aircraft in total, with 12 already contracted to be delivered by March 2020. These new aircraft will 'strengthen our existing comprehensive maritime surveillance capability, helping secure Australia’s borders, play a vital role in the fight against people smugglers and providing state of the art anti-submarine defences', the Australian Department of Defence said in a statement. The P-8A Poseidon has been designed by the US Navy for use in anti-submarine warfare and it will work in collaboration with existing Australian Border Force assets to protect the nation's border. Powered by two CFM56-7 engines, the aircraft can fly up to 41,000ft and travel up to 490k. "The P-8 can fly in all flight regimes and can self-deploy up to 4,500 miles from base without refuelling." Designed for 25 years/25,000 hours in the harshest maritime flight regimes, including extended operations in icing environments, the P-8 can fly in all flight regimes and can self-deploy up to 4,500 miles from base without refuelling, Boeing said in a statement. The aircraft is capable of controlling unmanned air vehicles (level 2 control-receive) to extend sensor reach. It can carry 30% more sonobuoys than any maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft currently flying, the statement said.

(read more) The Editorial Board / Published: November 18, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Many U.S. House members who bemoaned the loss of good U.S. manufacturing jobs, while campaigning this fall, voted Thursday to kill some of the very best U.S. manufacturing jobs. By a vote of 243-174, the House approved a bill that would prevent the sale of U.S. commercial aircraft to Iran. Under the 2015 agreement by which Iran agreed to halt its nuclear power development, six Western powers including the United States agreed to lift economic sanctions. Iran since then has negotiated about $42 billion worth of preliminary deals to buy or lease at least 200 new commercial jets from U.S.-based Boeing and Europe’s Airbus Industries. Airbus also assembles its A321 aircraft in Alabama and buys about 10 percent of its parts from American manufacturers. The bill would preclude the Treasury Department from issuing licenses that banks need to finance international transactions, and would apply to Boeing and Airbus. Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee who opposes the bill, said it would adversely affect about 100,000 jobs throughout the commercial aircraft industry and its long supply chain. To complete the deals, Iran would have to comply with several international protocols for multi-nation financial transactions. So the bill not only would diminish U.S. manufacturing but it would also preclude Iran’s movement toward global diplomatic and financial norms. The Senate should reject the bill. If it does not do so, President Barack Obama should veto it.

Peach signed an agreement to buy 10 A320neo aircraft and three A320ceo planes, it said in a statement today. The carrier plans to expand its fleet to at least 35 planes by 2020 and to 100 later, chief executive officer Shinichi Inoue said today at a briefing in Tokyo that was also attended by Airbus Group chief operating officer Fabrice Bregier. The order for A320neos, with the first scheduled to be handed over in 2019, is a bright spot for a plane model whose deliveries have been plagued by engine issues. Peach, backed by ANA Holdings Inc, started operations four years ago and is buying more planes as demand for low-cost travel in Japan spurs growth. The carrier plans to set up a base at Sendai airport next year and at Sapporo’s Shin-Chitose airport in 2018, Inoue said. Peach operates 18 Airbus A320s and competes against Jetstar Japan Co, the budget carrier backed by Qantas Airways Ltd and Japan Airlines Co, and other low-cost airlines. The A320neo has a list price of US$107.3 million, while the A320ceo is priced at US$98 million. Discounts are common in the industry. Airbus won its first order from Japan Airlines three years ago. ANA, which already operates the single-aisle A320, ordered widebody A380s earlier this year. ANA is Peach’s largest shareholder with 39 per cent, followed by First Eastern Aviation Holdings Ltd with 33 per cent, and Innovation Network Corp of Japan with 28 per cent. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Two more Airbus 350s for Malaysia Airlines by 2018 Delta goes for Airbus in US$14b order for new jets Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Maybe IndiGo and Vistara look at this option in the future," said an industry insider. NEW DELHI: With budget airlines controlling almost 65% of domestic skies, it is now the turn of foreign low-cost carriers (LCC) with wide-body planes to eye the lucrative long-haul traffic to-and-from India. Singapore Airlines' (SIA) long-haul LCC Scoot wants to operate its Boeing 787 Dreamliners on Singapore-India-Europe/Gulf routes under something known as "fifth freedom" of aviation. Under this freedom, an airline can fly from its home country to a second nation and take passengers from there to a third country and same on return. "There is a market for long-haul LCCs to come into India or be based here. If allowed, our fare (basic, with everything else like baggage check-in, meals, beverages and Wi-Fi costing extra) could be Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 on Delhi-London and Delhi-New York, respectively, one-way," said Bharath Mahadevan, India head of Scoot. The LCC flies from Amritsar, Jaipur and Chennai to Singapore. It will soon merge SIA's short-haul LCC Tiger into it and then fly from eight Indian cities to Singapore. However, airlines from Singapore have used up the bilateral (flying rights) with India, while Indian carriers are still using about half of their share. So, an increase in bilateral that could enable Scoot to have low-cost flights to Europe may not happen in a hurry. Lufthansa is also planning for some time to have its long-haul LCC flights to India. "If the bilateral are increased, we can look at Singapore-Delhi/Mumbai/Chennai/Kolkata-Europe/Gulf flights. We can fly to places like Zurich, Paris, Manchester (not London), Amsterdam, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. There is a huge pent-up demand for international travel from India and it needs to be tapped at the right price point. The demand is very strong in tier II cities," Mahadevan said. But whether India allows this remains to be seen as its long haul players — Air India and Jet — will be badly affected. "Under UPA-I and II, Dubai and Abu Dhabi became the hubs of Indian international travellers. Allowing foreign long-haul LCCs to fly between India and West will be disastrous for us," said a senior official of a full-service Indian carrier, adding, "Indian carriers may do this on their own in some time." At present, Indian budget airlines — IndiGo, AI Express and SpiceJet (GoAir will begin overseas flights shortly) -- fly their single aisle Airbus A-320s and Boeing 737s to neighbouring places like Gulf and Southeast Asia. Airbus has for years been trying to sell it's twin aisle A-330s to Big Boy Indian LCC IndiGo — which controls 40% of domestic market — that can be used to fly medium to long haul, means places like Europe and one-stop to even Americas. "The cost structure of AI and Jet is too high to sustain low fares of a long haul LCC. Maybe IndiGo and Vistara look at this option in the future," said an industry insider.

Home World news Japan’s Peach Aviation orders 10 Airbus A320neo jets, three older models Japan’s Peach Aviation orders 10 Airbus A320neo jets, three older models Japan's Peach Aviation said it had ordered 10 fuel-efficient Airbus A320neo passenger jets and three older versions of the jet, for a total of $1.3 billion at list prices, as part of its business expansion plans. By: Reuters | Tokyo | Published: November 18, 2016 10:21 AM The Japanese budget carrier in a press release said it will begin introducing the new planes from 2019. It currently operates 18 older A320s. (Reuters) Japan’s Peach Aviation said it had ordered 10 fuel-efficient Airbus A320neo passenger jets and three older versions of the jet, for a total of $1.3 billion at list prices, as part of its business expansion plans. The Japanese budget carrier in a press release said it will begin introducing the new planes from 2019. It currently operates 18 older A320s. The order will help Airbus in its race against Boeing in Japan, where the latter is a bigger player with its strong ties to local aerospace firms such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries that build significant portions of its jetliners. The deal is, however, smaller than some had expected. On Thursday, industry sources told Reuters that Airbus had spent months trying to sell dozens of A320neo passenger jets to Peach Aviation. Peach Aviation, which is 39 percent owned by ANA Holdings , Japan’s biggest airline, began flying in 2012 from Kansai in western Japan. Last year it started flying to Tokyo’s Haneda airport and plans to open services to Sendai in northeast Japan in the business year starting April and to the northern island of Hokkaido in the following twelve-month period. “The A320neo will be used as a part of the introduction of new aircraft for Peach’s business expansion,” the company said in the release on Friday. The order from Peach Aviation will take Airbus nearer to its target to sell 670 planes this year in the global market that is seen as somewhat oversupplied with jets. At the end of October, Airbus was 85 aircraft short of its aim. Please Wait while comments are loading...

The carrier plans to set up a base at Sendai airport next year and at Sapporo’s Shin-Chitose airport in 2018, Inoue said. Peach operates 18 Airbus A320s and competes against Jetstar Japan Co., the budget carrier backed by Qantas Airways Ltd. and Japan Airlines Co., and other low-cost airlines. The A320neo has a list price of $107.3 million, while the A320ceo is priced at $98 million. Discounts are common in the industry. Airbus won its first order from Japan Airlines three years ago. ANA, which already operates the single-aisle A320, ordered widebody A380s earlier this year. ANA is Peach’s largest shareholder with 39 percent, followed by First Eastern Aviation Holdings Ltd. with 33 percent, and Innovation Network Corp. of Japan with 28 percent.

REUTERS/Issei Kato TOKYO Japan's Peach Aviation said it had ordered 10 fuel-efficient Airbus A320neo passenger jets and three older versions of the jet, for a total of $1.3 billion at list prices, as part of its business expansion plans. The Japanese budget carrier in a press release said it will begin introducing the new planes from 2019. It currently operates 18 older A320s. The order will help Airbus in its race against Boeing in Japan, where the latter is a bigger player with its strong ties to local aerospace firms such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries that build significant portions of its jetliners. The deal is, however, smaller than some had expected. On Thursday, industry sources told Reuters that Airbus had spent months trying to sell dozens of A320neo passenger jets to Peach Aviation. Peach Aviation, which is 39 percent owned by ANA Holdings, Japan's biggest airline, began flying in 2012 from Kansai in western Japan. Last year it started flying to Tokyo's Haneda airport and plans to open services to Sendai in northeast Japan in the business year starting April and to the northern island of Hokkaido in the following twelve-month period. "The A320neo will be used as a part of the introduction of new aircraft for Peach's business expansion," the company said in the release on Friday. The order from Peach Aviation will take Airbus nearer to its target to sell 670 planes this year in the global market that is seen as somewhat oversupplied with jets. At the end of October, Airbus was 85 aircraft short of its aim.

Is billionaire medical doctor Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, buying the Culver City Sanitation Station and causing the sanitation employees of Culver City to lose their jobs? We don't know. Rumor is that Dr. Soon-Shiong has expressed distaste for the smell and general appearance of the sanitation facility. In addition, it is rumored that he wants to purchase the sanitation land for millions and turn it into retail shopping and dining, in order to attract the many visitors to Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook at Hetzler and Jefferson Blvd. Faithful employees, many who have worked over 10 - 15 years for Culver City Sanitation, will lose their jobs, pensions and benefits. Is this the way Culver City wants to treat devoted employees? Culver City Sanitation is one of the few city agencies that actually makes money for Culver City; the fire and police do not make money for the city, yet they are not being closed and given to private companies. If the rumor is true the move to close Culver City Sanitation is just plain unfair and wrong. Do you think an unmanned car is hot stuff? Well, neighbor, the Boeing Company has been working on an unmanned submarine called Echo Voyager. It’s 51 feet long and designed to stay underwater for months at a time. Does everybody remember reading or hearing on television that Governor Brown projects a budget of $122 billion dollars? The $64,000 question is, “Why do we need to raise taxes?” The answer is that our county supervisor, Mark Ridley-Thomas, the father of your assembly member, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, wants us to vote to increase the sales tax by a half cent for rail and freeway improvements. Butt for the poor or those on fixed incomes, the higher sales tax is the worst idea. I remember top crackerjack defense lawyer, F. Lee Bailey, who was part of the dream team who defended O.J. Simpson. Mr. Bailey has perhaps experienced some business reversals, because he declared bankruptcy over a $5 million disagreement with the I.R.S. I hope Mr. Bailey wins, but with the I.R.S. . . . Over the Labor Day weekend Theodorsia and I attended a block party in Inglewood where we renewed our friendship with a truly remarkable person – their mayor, James Butts. He left Inglewood as a lieutenant to become the Santa Monica chief of police, and from there to be the Los Angeles International Airport assistant police chief. When he retired he ran for and was elected mayor. The transformation this far has been dynamic and in the years to come, well, golly! The City of Albuquerque, New Mexico settled for $142,000 with someone suspected of car theft, who said, he was the victim of excessive force. Anybody heard anything about former NASA contractor Edward Snowden, or former Culver City City Attorney Norm Herring? Mayor Bill Finch of New Haven, Connecticut got the endorsement a while back of the local Democrats in his bid for a third term. Finch has been facing a strong challenge from a former mayor, Joseph Ganim, who is making a comeback after serving seven years in prison for corruption. Senator James Lankford (R-OKLA) recently released information on government grants: 1. The National Science Foundation $1.2 million grant to teach robots how to pick out outfits for and how to dress the elderly. 2. The $48,500 National Institutes for Health grant to study the use of tobacco in Russia. 3. The Defense Department $288, 000 grant to study the gnatcatcher in California. The Senator is also trying to pass his Taxpayers’ Right to Know Act, which would establish a central database of all financial data of every federal program. Mother always said, “Neil, remember money doesn’t grow on trees,” and was she ever right. Frankly speaking, if I was in the Department of Justice, we would have the first co-ed cell block for the thieves who worked at the local branches of Wells Fargo, and the guilty big shots would go to Sing Sing. Yes, I read the bank was fined $185 million or so, but when you make billions, their fine was small potatoes. Move all your assets to a safe place and start sleeping well again.. When you drive through Beverly Hills be sure to cruise Carolwood Drive and stop at Barbra Streisand’s former estate at 301. Listed for only $150 million, it may have been sold by now. It has 38,000 square feet, a water wall, a lounge, wine room, movie theater, a separate valet entrance for guests with parking for more than 50 vehicles, and a garage for another ten cars. The master suite is approximately 5,300 square feet including a private heated covered patio. Don’t worry if you are short a million or two – you can always get a 30-year fixed mortgage at Wells Fargo bank. Officials in New Jersey say 7,827 criminal cases are now in question after a lab technician with the state police allegedly faked the result in a drug case. The technician, Kamalkant Shah, was suspended but never charged with any crime, per the August/September 2016 Reason Magazine. Want to know more about the spies of the CIA and KGB, then read the Phantom Menace starting on page 26 of the November 2016 issue of the Smithsonian. It was very frightening, to say the least.

Still, the ambitious plan could translate into more jobs in the private sector from coast to coast. It could include work not only in building new fighter jets and missiles, but in shipyards in Virginia and elsewhere. Quotes in the article General Dynamics Corp GD ▲ 166.62 +0.99 +0.60% Science Applications International Corp SAIC ▲ 79.49 +0.44 +0.56% BAE Systems PLC BA. ▼ 593.50 -3.50 -0.59% Mantech International Corp MANT ▲ 43.50 +0.13 +0.30% "The Trump plan — at least what we know of it so far — is probably so positive for defense overall that there's probably many more winners than there are individual losers," said Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst at Cowen. Still, some industry observers suggest the new administration might place more emphasis on controlling costs by stressing the need for better terms, which would save the Pentagon money but could work against the defense contractors. Analysts estimate Trump's defense plan, which was disclosed during a national security policy speech in Philadelphia on Sept. 7, could add upwards of $250 billion more to U.S. military spending over the next four years, with a portion coming from freeing up funds from nondefense programs. Trump said he will ask Congress to repeal sequestration, which is a relic of a debt ceiling compromise reached in 2011. "Republicans are divided on the budget caps," said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. "You have defense hawks who want to increase defense spending and then you've got fiscal hawks who want to keep spending low." Harrison said the Trump defense plan is "somewhere between 3 percent and 6 percent annual growth above inflation" and at the high end would be in line with the defense buildup we saw in the early 1980s under Ronald Reagan. Trump hasn't offered much detail on his defense plans beyond his September address. Here are five major things we know now and how it could potentially impact different defense-related companies: More ships: Trump's Navy plan calls for 350 surface ships and submarines, up from 276 today and above the Pentagon's current target of 308 ships over the next 10 years. "Clearly shipbuilding is one sector that will benefit," said Cowen's Schweizer, a former acquisition professional with the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship program. The analyst said the companies with the biggest potential exposure to Trump's planned ship build-up are major defense contractor General Dynamics (GD), shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls (HII) and BWX Technologies (BWXT), a maker of nuclear reactors for aircraft carriers and submarines. An acceleration of Navy shipbuilding also could result in tens of thousands of new private-sector jobs created in shipyards on both coasts. It's unclear how many of the new submarines would be created, but the Navy's current submarine fleet stands at just over 50 and had been projected to fall to 41 boats in 2029, according to the Congressional Research Service. As for carriers, the Navy has 10 in service and the $13 billion USS Gerald Ford will soon joining the others. "We believe the U.S. should have 13 carriers to meet our security obligations," said Tom Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant general and director of the Heritage Foundation's Center for National Defense. More aircraft: Trump's Air Force would consist of at least 1,200 fighters, up from the present 1,113. Trump pointed out the average age of the current Air Force fleet is around 27 years and includes B-52 bombers, which were introduced in the 1950s. All indications are the B-21 long-range strike bomber that went to Northrop Grumman (NOC) is safe. The Air Force lifted its stop-work order on the $80 billion stealth bomber in February after the government denied a protest from Boeing (BA). Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a fifth-generation fighter program costing nearly $400 billion, is the most advanced aircraft in the U.S. military. Yet Trump hasn't always been a big fan of the program. Last year, he criticized the F-35 as "not very good." Lockheed has been having meetings with Trump's transition team to discuss the F-35 and head off any attempts to downsize the program. Other partners on the F-35 program are Northrop and BAE Systems (BA.-GB). "If you pull the plug on that (F-35 program) it's going to be 15 years before we have something else to put in its place," said David Ochmanek, senior defense research analyst at the RAND think tank and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in two presidential administrations. "That would be a seismic thing to disrupt." More troops: Trump's Army would consist of around 540,000 active-duty troops, a figure he indicated the Army's chief of staff has sought. "We now have only 31 brigade combat teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready," Trump said in September. The Marine Corps also would be expanded under the Trump plan, going from 23 battalions today to 36, or around 10,000 more Marines. That's a figure the billionaire said the Heritage Foundation indicated was the minimum number needed to comfortably "deal with major contingencies." "The funding increases would pay for soldiers and not equipment, and would therefore be of minor benefit to hardware manufacturers," said Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. Still, the analyst believes there's some upside for larger munitions firms such as General Dynamics and Orbital ATK (OA'WI), as well as for missile companies such as Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing. Trump also pledged in his Philadelphia address that he would "seek to develop a state-of-the-art missile defense system" and modernize the Navy's cruisers with ballistic missile defense capability. He charged that under the previous two Democratic presidents the nation's "ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded." Cyberwarfare: There's also a pressing need to "invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists," according to Trump. The president-elect wants to make new investments in the cyber area that will both modernize the military's capabilities as well as lead to new job creation in the private sector. This could help IT and cyber-related government service companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), ManTech (MANT) and Science Applications International (SAIC). Trump also indicated that one of his first directives after taking office will be to ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff and some other departments to conduct reviews of cyberdefense capabilities for the purpose of identifying all vulnerabilities. Burden sharing: Another defense issue Trump has addressed several times is the desire to have allies share more of the financial burden for security rather than American taxpayers. The U.S. has various treaties such as NATO and arrangements with Asian countries that provide for help against possible aggression. Yet some believe the current arrangement of helping with weapons sales may actually reward the U.S. with economies of scale. Raytheon is considered one of the most exposed major defense contractors in terms of international military business. "These same agreements allow for sales of major weapons systems which lowers the average cost to the U.S. military," said Howard Rubel, a defense industry analyst at Jefferies. "Based on current rhetoric, the new administration does not understand this subtle benefit, nor the benefit of interoperable weapons from radios to warplanes."

It is a step up from its predecessors, which take 30 minutes to image the hemisphere and are not capable of carrying out multiple tasks at the same time. “This is a quantum leap,” Sandra Cauffman, deputy director of Earth Sciences at NASA, said at a news conference on Thursday. “It will truly revolutionize weather forecasting.” The satellite rests on top of an Atlas 5 rocket developed by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. The heart of the new satellite is a high-resolution camera, designed and built by Exelis Inc, a subsidiary of Harris Corp. . It can see in 16 wavelengths, compared with the five available with the current system. GOES-R, developed by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has four times better resolution and can take images five times faster than its predecessors, NOAA program scientist Steven Goodman said. The satellite‘s capabilities go beyond weather forecasting. The sharper view will enable forecasters to see waves in clouds, for example, so that pilots can avoid turbulence and give airline passengers smoother rides.

GOES-R is the first of four satellites in a system upgrade that will cost $11 billion, including launch fees, said NOAA Assistant Administrator Stephen Volz. The next satellite is slated for launch in 2018. GOES, along with a second, polar-orbiting weather satellite network operated by NOAA, has faced cost overruns and program delays due to technical issues and mismanagement, according to a December 2015 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. Once in orbit, the new satellite will undergo about 11 months of testing before it joins the operational fleet, which now numbers three units, NOAA said. © 2016 Thompson Reuters Report an error Cape Canaveral GOES-R satellite NASA nasa satellite Outer Space rocket launch satellite launch weather satellite Editor's Picks Consumer How Trump's immigration crackdown could raise food prices for Canadians Politics Trudeau Liberals ‘trampling’ on women’s rights with new CPP regime: opposition Money Here's how much mortgage payments will go up as banks hike rates Consumer Text message fraud cost Canadians half a million dollars so far in 2016 Investigations Ontario schools are missing ‘perfect opportunity’ to address mental health amid rash of youth suicides Health Drugs aren’t tested on women like they are on men, and it could have deadly consequences Investigations How mental health should be taught in Canadian schools FLYERS More Weekly Flyers Comments Popular Now Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump starts to feel pressure of presidency in 'SNL' cold open 54719 Tucson Roadrunners captain collapses on ice shortly before game against Manitoba Moose 27141 Sabra hummus products recalled across Canada, US for listeria concerns 24108 Moose found frozen in lake in the middle of a fight 10802 Justin Trudeau, APEC leaders meeting a direct response to Trump's anti-trade rhetoric 8731 Sponsored content Popular Videos CNN’s Anderson Cooper malfunctions in ‘SNL’ ‘Westworld’ parody WATCH NOW Chris Rock makes SNL cameo to mock white liberals shocked by Trump win WATCH NOW WATCH: Road rage incident caught on camera WATCH NOW 10-year-old saves mom after witnessing violent attack: ‘I saw his footsteps under the door’ WATCH NOW Vice President-elect heckled at ‘Hamilton’ show in New York City WATCH NOW Jump to a Region BC Calgary Edmonton Halifax Lethbridge Montreal New Brunswick Okanagan Regina Saskatoon Toronto Winnipeg Connect Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest RSS Contact Us Global News About Us Privacy Policy Principles & Practices Terms & Conditions Copyright Corus Entertainment Advertise Branded Content Open Data © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

No, Milwaukee has not landed nonstop service to Dubai or some other hub where the hometown airline flies the superjumbo jet. Instead, this A380 is in Milwaukee for two weeks of engine testing. Milwaukee airport officials tell Today in the Sky the aircraft is there for cold-weather testing with the new Rolls Royce Trent XWB97 engine that is being developed to power the new A350-1000. BOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news | VIDEO: A380 landing at Milwaukee USA TODAY Watch: How long does it take Emirates to repaint an A380? The A350-1000 is the latest and biggest variant of Airbus’ new A350 model, which began flying passengers for the first time just in January 2015. The A350-1000 variant of the jet is expected to enter commercial passenger service sometime next year. Airbus’ double-decker A380, of course, is the world’s biggest passenger aircraft. Most airlines that fly the A380 have configured the cabin to seat between 400 and 520 passengers. Emirates – by far the largest operator of the plane – flies some of its A380s in a "high-density" configuration with 615 seats, though most of the carrier's superjumbo jets have fewer. As for the A380's appearance in Milwaukee, planespotters take note. "For a great view of the aircraft while it is parked here, check out the sixth floor of the parking garage on the north end," General Mitchell airport says via its Facebook page.

Two of our top contributors offer up reasons you should and shouldn't buy these two companies. Jason Hall (TMFVelvetHammer) Nov 19, 2016 at 9:41AM Image source: Alcoa.  Since Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) was spun out of Arconic Inc. (NYSE:ARNC) on Nov. 1, the market has responded in an unexpected way, bidding up shares of the pure-play metals company, while shares of Arconic, which was expected to be the more in-demand investment, haven't fared nearly as well: AA data by YCharts. What should investors do? We reached out to two of our contributors and asked them to break things down. Here's what they had to say.  Arconic looks interesting; Alcoa may be ahead of itself Jason Hall: Count me among the many people surprised by how far Alcoa's shares have run, and so quickly after being spun out as a pure-play bauxite miner and alumina/aluminum producer. This is particularly astonishing considering that absolutely nothing has happened in the past couple of weeks to support this quick run-up.  Let's start with the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, which corresponds with the vast majority of Alcoa's stock gains. The catch? Trump's "Make America Great Again" platform, which is largely pro-American industry, may not offer much value for Alcoa, which actually does very little production in the U.S. The vast majority of the world's bauxite reserves are outside North America, and the primary alumina refining is done near the mines. In other words, some of the potential economic benefits that domestic manufacturers could get under a Trump administration just may not carry over to Alcoa in the same way.  Furthermore, as Alcoa is a primary producer of aluminum and its precursor materials, its fortunes are largely tied to commodity prices. There's some potential good news on that front, as global production has been in a deficit in 2016, with demand growth outpacing production. There's a good chance this will lead to higher prices, but so far that hasn't happened. Put it all together, and Alcoa's stock looks like it's gotten ahead of the fundamentals that will drive its results.  Arconic, on the other hand, is pretty appealing. Not only -- as Tyler discusses below -- does it seem to be trading for what could be a big discount today, but there's a very strong long-term tailwind that should at the very least support steady profits over the next decade-plus. Demand from the aerospace industry alone could be massive, with Boeing and Airbus having a combined $1.6 trillion order backlog for more than 12,000 aircraft.  The caveat? Arconic took on a substantial amount of debt in the spinout of Alcoa, but also retained just under a 20% stake in the aluminum producer. I'd like to see Arconic monetize that Alcoa stake and pay down its debt. Furthermore, I'm of the opinion that until we have a couple of quarters of financial and operating results in, it's not completely clear what the corporate costs will be for these now-stand-alone companies.  Between the two, Arconic seems to be the safer bet to be a winning investment from here. But I'd prefer to see a quarter or two of financial and operating results from the stand-alone companies before taking a big stake in either.  Alcoa's international mining and refining operations will still be driven by commodity prices. The market may have gotten ahead of this fundamental thing. Image source: Alcoa.  No rush to buy now Tyler Crowe: I'm not saying that it's a bad idea to buy Alcoa's or Arconic's stock, because there are plenty of reasons to like them both. Alcoa is one of the premier aluminum producers globally, and Arconic has developed an impressive portfolio of high-end manufactured products for the aerospace and automotive industries. Rather, I think the best course of action regarding these stocks is to take a wait-and-see approach until we get a couple of quarters of financial reports from the two companies before making any real investment decisions. I can totally understand why investors might want to get in early, because the market might not realize the value of these stocks. Let's start with Arconic. Today, the company trades at 0.9 times sales and 1.2 times tangible book value. That seems like a steal when you consider that another engineered-product manufacturer -- Precision Castparts -- was bought at a price of 3.3 times sales. That would suggest that the current price of Arconic is undervalued.  As tempting as jumping in may sound, it's worth waiting for some issues to resolve. Arconic ended up taking the lion's share of the debt during the split in hopes of breathing new life into the legacy mining and smelting business. This could be a big drag on Arconic for some time, while Alcoa will likely continue to suffer from low commodity prices even with a cleaner balance sheet. But these are all assumptions; until we actually see reported financial results over the next few quarters, there's a lot of guesswork involved that some investors may not be completely comfortable with. Once we get at least a quarter or two of financial results to see how these two separate entities handle being on their own, it's probably best to take a wait-and-see approach.  Jason Hall has no position in any stocks mentioned.

​​ Singletrack Mountain Bike Magazine Subscribe Buy Issue 109 Home Magazines Forums Reviews Columns Partners Shop Trail Guide Subscribe Gorgeous Custom Titanium From Lithuania If ever there was a type of metal that we could eat, it would be titanium. Undoubtedly the most delicious of all metals, there is something so alluring and exotic about titanium that just seems to get us salivating every time we see it. And what about when we actually get the chance to touch it? Best we keep that to ourselves… Looking to sate cyclists appetite for titanium, Wittson is a bespoke frame manufacturer based in Lithuania that only builds with European Grade 9 Ti. Our attention was first brought to the Wittson name when the company launched a drop-dead gorgeous welded titanium rigid fork. In addition to that striking piece of art, Wittson also produces a full mountain bike hardtail frame, called the ‘Bestia’. Whilst being equally as lovely, there’s actually a lot of features on the Bestia that aren’t so common with titanium mountain bike frames. It may be expensive and niche-y, but that doesn’t stop us from wanting one BAD! Firstly though, some background. Wittson is still a relatively new name in the cycling scene, but its master frame builder, Vidmantas “Vitas” Zukauskas is not. Having previously worked with the likes of Colnago, Argon 18 and a host of other high-end companies, Vitas has over two decades of experience with building titanium road, cyclocross and mountain bike frames. Vitas has such a reputation amongst high-end Ti frame builders, because it’s the only material he chooses to work with. Full-length integrated seat tube on the Bestia. It’s like looking at the back of an aggravated cat. Most of the frames that Wittson produces are custom numbers, but the Bestia is a stock mountain bike frame that’s available with 27.5in wheels (Small, Medium, Large) and 29in wheels (Medium, Large, X-Large), and is designed around a 100mm travel suspension fork. Like all of Wittson’s frames, the Bestia is made from Grade 9 Titanium that’s welded up in their small Lithuanian-based workshop. “All of the frames are made of European Grade 9 Ti supplied by a Swedish company called VSMPO Titan Scandinavia“, states Vitas. “This is one of the world’s number-one titanium suppliers. It’s the same titanium that BOEING and AIRBUS use. The key difference to Chinese suppliers is that VSMPO don’t use recycled titanium, so that means better alloy characteristics.” The hand brushed finish on the Bestia is an exercise in subtlety. Some other brands could learn a thing or two here…   The Bestia is built as a purist XC race machine, and has the geometry to match. For 2017, Wittson has actually sharpened the head angle to 70.5-degrees, and shortened the top tube length, which would appear to be going against current trends. But Wittson don’t care. The new frame also features Wittson’s wishbone seat stays, which is a very unique feature for a titanium frame, as it requires quite a complex process to achieve. At the rear wheel you’ll find a 142x12mm Syntace screw-in axle, along with US-made Paragon dropouts. Possibly the most striking feature of the Bestia is that full-length integrated seat mast Go full race-spec with a carbon rigid ENVE fork. The Wittson Bestia Features: XC hardtail race bike 27.5in or 29in wheels Grade 9 Titanium Oversized externally and internally butted headtube for conical 1.5″ fork Bi-ovalized toptube Hydroformed curved downtube Integrated seatpost with an support on toptube/seatsatays cross section Ti seatmast with ti bolts Hydroformed wishbone seatstays Hydroformed chainstays Internal brake and gear routing PressFit 30 bottom bracket Made in USA PARAGON x SYNTACE X-12 thru axle dropouts Hand brushed finish Custom sandblasting Ti headbadge Anodized bolts Max tyre clearance: 2.25in Claimed weight: 1870 grams (size M / seattube uncut) Includes: Chris King InSet 7 headset, Wittson seatmast (grade 9 ti), removable Syntace alloy hanger, 142x12mm Syntace thru-axle RRP: €2489 Oooh, well that is quite lovely. Single-piece seat stay assembly that uses a wishbone junction up at the seat tube. Wittson claims this adds more ‘spring’ to the back of the Bestia, but it looks incredible too. Big cowled PMW dropouts from the US, and a Syntace X-12 screw-in axle locking it down. Elegant post-mount brake tabs too. Hydroformed downtube, chain stays and seat stay provides curves in all the right places. Along with full custom butting, the Bestia highlights Vitas’ years of experience of working with titanium. While the Bestia is a stock frame, there are multiple custom features available. Rather than the stock PF30 bottom bracket shell, you can get a new T47 BB, and you can even spec Boost 148x12mm dropouts too. Want a belt drive? Maybe you want the frame built with a Pinion gearbox? Wittson will do that for you, and they’ll even build the Bestia around a longer travel suspension fork. So be prepared to waste A LOT of time choosing options! Head to wittson.com for more info.

Dislike with a passion bent downtubes, they look particularly worse on Ti frames though. Curious as to how the integrated seatpost works. oceandweller said on November 19, 2016 OK. Who do I hafta kill? akira said on November 19, 2016 Chop seatpost to length and fit clamp on top, measure repeatedly before chopping I imagine. footflaps said on November 19, 2016 Wow – that is gorgeous! A bit pricy mind… bedmaker said on November 19, 2016 Stealth dropper routing? singletrackwil said on November 19, 2016 @bedmaker – Yup, and there’s a lot load of other options too. You can get a singlespeed-specific frame, internal or external routing, PF30 bottom bracket or T47 bottom bracket, 142x12mm or 148x12mm dropouts, setup for longer travel forks etc. It appears to be a long list! tang said on November 20, 2016 We have them at Bespoked show, lovely guys.

 The 'trickiest' part of Elon Musk's Mars spaceship — a giant black orb — just passed a critical test Dave Mosher Nov. 16, 2016, 12:57 PM 50,493 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk wants to colonize Mars with SpaceX. Getty Images/Shutterstock/NASA; illustration by Dave Mosher/Business Insider SpaceX announced on Wednesday that it had successfully completed a critical test of a huge piece of its Mars spaceship — a giant and potentially explosive black orb. Elon Musk in September shared his audacious plan to launch a million people to Mars — just in case some apocalyptic calamity dooms Earth. Called the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), the 400-foot-tall rocket and spaceship aims to ferry 100 to 200 people to the red planet at a cost of less than $200,000 per ticket sometime this century. (And following Donald Trump's election, there's apparently a lot of interest in a ride.) SpaceX has been pretty mum on its progress with ITS' systems. In October, however, Musk revealed during an "Ask Me Anything" session that the most essential part of his giant Mars spaceship is an enormous, 40-foot-wide carbon-fiber tank, shown below. "This is really the hardest part of the spaceship," Musk said at his September 27 talk during the International Astronomical Congress (IAC). "The other pieces ... we have a pretty good handle on, but this was the trickiest one. So we wanted to tackle it first." Musk also told redditors that his engineers would haul the prototype out to sea and "take it up to 2/3 of burst pressure" in the coming weeks. SpaceX is now saying that test not only happened, but that it went swimmingly. "Successfully tested the prototype Mars tank last week. Hit both of our pressure targets – next up will be full cryo testing," the company wrote on Twitter, sharing a photo of the experiment: SpaceX/Twitter And if you're wondering how in the heck they got the tank on the barge, wonder no more: SpaceX posted a time-lapse video of the process to its Instagram account: Moving the prototype Mars tank in preparation for testing out at sea. A video posted by SpaceX (@spacex) on Nov 16, 2016 at 9:09am PST on Nov 16, 2016 at 9:09am PST 'The hardest part of the spaceship' The tank is the spaceship's core structure, which has to withstand incredible pressures and stresses at blisteringly cold temperatures from liquid oxygen propellant — otherwise it might leak or even explode. Musk originally shared images of the massive structure toward the end of his IAC talk. And it's huge, standing several stories tall and dwarfing its designers and builders: Elon Musk/SpaceX When user nalyd8991 asked Musk for more information about it in the r/SpaceX subreddit, Musk said the gargantuan carbon-fiber tank "was really the big news" of his IAC talk — or at least "for those that know their stuff." In short, the entire spaceship will be built around such a tank — so getting it right is crucial. Here's where the latest designs place the tank in the spaceship, which will sit atop a rocket booster that's more than 250 feet tall: Elon Musk/SpaceX; Business Insider Carbon-fiber tanks for spacecraft aren't a new concept — Boeing and NASA began work on a huge one in 2014. However, we've never seen one this enormous. Here's what it looks like from the inside: SpaceX/YouTube And another inside shot: SpaceX/Elon Musk Engineers most likely chose carbon fiber because that material is lighter, shrinks less, and is stronger than the metal alloys that many cryogenic tanks are made out of. So it will presumably make for safer transport to Mars while using less propellant (though at a considerably higher cost of construction). The material isn't easy to work with, though, as Musk explained during his IAC talk: "Even though carbon fiber has incredible strength-to-weight, when you want one of them put super-cold liquid oxygen and liquid methane — particularly liquid oxygen — in the tank, it's subject to cracking and leaking and it's a very difficult thing to make. "Just the sheer scale of it is also challenging, because you've gotta lay out the carbon fiber in exactly the right way on a huge mold, and you've gotta cure that mold at temperature, and then it's ... just really hard to make large carbon-fiber structures that can do all of those things and carry incredible loads." During his Reddit AMA in October, Musk dropped a few bits of new information about the tank as well: "The flight tank will actually be slightly longer than the development tank shown, but the same diameter," Musk said. He also said it was "built with latest and greatest carbon fiber prepreg," or carbon fiber that's pre-impregnated with a resin to make it tougher. "In theory, it should hold cryogenic propellant without leaking and without a sealing linker," he said. "Early tests are promising." Prior to the barge pressure test in early November, Musk said SpaceX performed "initial tests with the cryogenic propellant" that "actually look quite positive." "We have not seen any leaks or major issues," he added. If the company has already pumped liquid oxygen into the spherical tank before, it stands to reason that it will try again to get even more data on its performance for incorporating into a flight version. Business Insider asked a SpaceX representative for more details on the upcoming "full cryo test", which is presumably when the carbon-fiber tank will be pumped full of a liquid oxygen propellant or liquid methane fuel. However, the company declined to tell us more about that test, when it would occur, or what cryogenic liquid it'd be using. Whatever the case, the fact that it's happening on ocean barge is telling: It says there's a chance the device could not just merely leak but burst or explode. If no one is around and it does, the shrapnel (and possibly flames) can't hurt anyone. After all, SpaceX does have a history of testing its gear on ocean barges, sometimes with catastrophic effect: Rebecca Harrington contributed additional reporting to this post.

The billionaire businessman won the presidency after a tumultuous and divisive election, partly by blaming what he called bad trade deals for massive job losses in U.S. manufacturing. As a result, the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a 12-nation free-trade zone that, combined, accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world’s economic output, is essentially dead in Congress. Scrapping TPP may be a missed opportunity for the United States, says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University in Japan. “There are already concerns around Asia about the reliability of the United States as an ally,” Kingston said. “Clearly, Trump’s election will amplify those concerns and anxieties. And I think that this means that there’s going to be a significant decline in American influence in Asia.” “If we don’t take the lead in writing the rules for the economy of East Asia, the Chinese will, and we are not going to like the outcome,” said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, referring to President Barack Obama’s argument for creating a level playing field for Pacific trade. China, the world’s second-largest economy, is already capitalizing on the U.S. Congress’ failure to vote on a Trans-Pacific trade deal. It has announced plans to propose a rival trade pact at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit in Peru that would create a Beijing-led regional trade zone in Southeast Asia excluding the United States. Trade war potential Trump, who once called China “a cheat” and a currency manipulator, has threatened to raise tariffs on Chinese-made goods by 45 percent to correct the trade deficit between the two countries. Beijing responded quickly with its own threats, raising the possibility of an all-out trade war. Galston said the possibility of a damaging trade war has never been higher, and he outlined a number of options China could take. “To start, they could cancel the orders they placed with Boeing and redirect those orders to Airbus, and that would have a large effect on the economy of the Pacific Northwest,” he said. Beijing could also impose tougher regulations on companies that do business in China, or severely limit iPhone sales, for example, to Chinese customers. “The idea that this is a one-way street, that we can threaten China and China can’t threaten us back, I think, is too simple,” Galston said. If a trade war were to break out, Galston said, there would be no winners. However, given the asymmetry between Chinese exports to the U.S. and American exports to China, Galston said Trump might be gambling that both sides would have enough to lose to come to the table to work things out. Other trade agreements Trump has also signaled his intention to renegotiate what he called “the worst trade deal ever,” NAFTA, the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Analysts say such a move is unlikely to create new jobs. Despite its flaws, Galston credits NAFTA for helping to create a continental supply chain that has made the U.S. auto industry among the most competitive in the world. “If that relationship were to be disrupted, then it could have serious consequences. And it’s not clear to me that it would have the effect of bringing auto jobs back to the United States,” he said. Given Trump’s protectionist rhetoric, European Union Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom thinks a pending U.S. free-trade deal with Europe — TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership — is probably not moving forward anytime soon. “There is strong reason to believe that there would be a pause in TTIP, that this might not be the biggest priority for the new administration,” Malmstrom said. Labor unions have been among the most vocal critics of free trade. The AFL-CIO blames NAFTA for the loss of nearly a million jobs and claims those who manage to find new jobs earn on average about 23 percent less than they used to. Labor groups insist any future free-trade agreements must include protections and a larger retraining budget for laid-off American workers.

That's where the Army figures out exactly what they are looking for. Milestone B is the point at which an RFP or Request for Proposal is sent to companies. According to the timeline shown at the conference, Milestone B is set for FY24, giving five years to work on the project.  Right now the Army is conducting the Joint Multi-Role/Technical Demonstration or JMR/TD, which is used to demonstrate the technologies that will be used in FVL. The work done on JMR/TD will be folded into FVL, which will save time and money.  There are two entries in the JMR/TD, Bell's V-280 Valor, which is a tilt-rotor and the Boeing/Sikorsky SB-1 Defiant. Valor is a tilt-rotor, while Defiant is a unique push-prop/helicopter.  But as with any major project, budget uncertainty is dominating thinking right now. According to Ross Guckert, the acting deputy for PEO Aviation, that's something that influences Future Vertical Lift, especially as they try to possibly move the program faster.  "Its really going to depend on what the budget ends up being next year, and where the priorities lie within the Army and the department to be able to put more money against that program and move it to the left", he said.  The presentation which was part of the AAAA's Aircraft Survivability Equipment Symposium, and it continues with the Joseph P. Cribbins Aviation Product Symposium that runs until Thursday.  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily! Your notification has been saved.

To help ease the transition, NASA issued a request for information Friday asking for ideas on how to cut development and production costs of its SLS rocket and Orion crew capsule and ideas on competing spacecraft. “NASA is transitioning from design and development to long-term affordability and sustainability within a broader exploration framework.” The Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion crew vehicle are the backbone of NASA’s plan to launch a manned Mars mission sometime in the 2030s. [Image by NASA/MSFC] The space agency would prefer to use the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft it has been designing and building at the cost of some $3 billion annually, but admits the construction effort has been costly. In August, the Government Accountability Office audited the space agency and released a report saying NASA probably won’t complete the SLS or Orion on time or on budget. A few weeks later, the NASA engineer responsible for the production of the SLS and Orion told Ars Technica the development of the spacecraft was getting to be too expensive for the agency to handle. “We’re just way too expensive today. It’s going to take some different thinking and maybe a little bit more risk taking than what we’re wanting to do today.” NASA receives 0.5 percent of the national budget, and building such an expensive spacecraft has left little room for actual exploration. Their funding levels probably won’t increase once Donald Trump takes office. [Image by NASA] Shortly before Trump won the election, he outlined a plan to move NASA away from being an Earth-monitoring agency and focus it on exploring space. He plans to use the reconstituted National Space Agency to manage federal, military, and commercial activities to eliminate redundant programs. In this request for information, NASA has signaled its willingness to consider alternatives provided by its commercial partners if that means costs will be cut. SpaceX is hip deep into development on its Falcon Heavy rocket, and Blue Origin is working to build its New Glenn boosters, both of which are in the same class as the SLS and cheaper to fly. The United Launch Alliance is also building its own Vulcan rocket with a reusable first stage and a second stage designed to stay permanently in orbit where it will ferry cargo shuttled up by other spacecraft. It would feel good to have an official American spaceship, but with cheaper commercial spacecraft probably available for government contract work in the coming years, it’s easy to see why Trump would consider ditching the SLS. [Image by Tony Landis/NASA] Boeing and Lockheed Martin are building the Orion and its SLS rocket, but NASA’s request for information also covers the possibility of using components from different companies if that makes construction cheaper. Anyone looking to respond to NASA has until December 23 to respond. Since the heyday of the space program, when Kennedy told NASA to beat the Soviets to the moon, the agency has struggled with funding and changing goals, USC astronautics professor Mike Gruntman told the International Business Times. “The main problem is that we do not have a clear long-term goal for the national human spaceflight program. Being rudderless does not help in bringing public excitement and support.” Trump’s plan to coordinate civilian, federal, and military efforts to explore space may be the alternative to increased funding for the space agency.

"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," the Nikkei Asian Review reported, citing a source. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Apple declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. However, Apple has long said the barrier to moving iPhone production to the U.S. is expertise, in addition to cost. "Foxconn follows a strict company policy of not commenting on any matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products," a company spokesperson told CNBC via email. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Pegatron assemble iPhones in China. The news comes following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The Republican president-elect has been vocal about how U.S. companies should be building their products in America. "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries," Trump said in a speech in January.

But Beijing has hit back: In an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned that iPhone sales and other American goods could suffer if such a plan were to go through. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Manufacturing the iPhones abroad allows Apple to maintain a strong margin on its product. Apple is Foxconn's biggest customer but Chairman Terry Gou is worried about the rising production costs of such a move, the Nikkei reported, citing a source saying that costs will double. It's important to note that the discussions began in June, five months before Trump won the election. Analysts said it is still hard to quantify what such a move would mean for Apple's finances, but warned that there will be an impact. "If the world moves to a more nationalistic approach 'made in America, by Americans, for Americans' or 'made in China, by Chinese, for Chinese'... these variable conditions will likely impact margins, growth and suppliers exposed to the globalization trend of the last decade," wrote Neil Campling, head of global technology, media, and telecoms research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, in a note on Friday. "The same will likely make global tech a tougher place to invest in 2017," he said.

For nearly an hour, the aircraft, identified as IRON99, circled the city in an oval shaped pattern before heading to Oklahoma. Thousands of people concerned about the strange sighting called local news station Denver 7 to report what they were seeing. The station reached out to the Denver Airport, local military bases, and government agencies, but was able to learn nothing. © YouTube/The Denver Channel Mysterious Plane Circles Over Denver, No One Seems to Know Why “Further research into the plane's title of IRON99 turned up bases in the northeastern part of the nation that frequently give out the title of IRON to their military flights, however the title is usually reserved for T-38 aircraft, which are distinctly black,” the station reported, noting that this plane was white. On Thursday, the Navy responded to the station confirming that the plane was in a holding pattern over Denver the day before, but stated that the mission is classified. Lieutenant Leslie Hubbell, the assistant public affairs officer for Commander Naval Air Forces detailed that the IRON99 is a Navy E-6B Mercury jet aircraft, created by Boeing at a cost of $141.7 million per unit, Denver 7 reported. © Flickr/ Nelson Pavlosky Cosplay in the Surveillance State: DARPA Tests Radiation Detection SystemThe planes are designed to be airborne command and control centers capable of controlling the launch of nuclear missiles around the US. "The overall mission of the E-6B is command, control and communications abilities to direct and employ strategic resources," Hubbell said. The aircraft was flying a holding pattern over Denver, at the instruction of the Federal Aviation Administration en route to Tinker Air Force Base, where it is stored. Though they were unable to get an on-the-record statement from the US Navy about the mission, a source reportedly told the station that the aircraft was on a Department of Defense training mission, focused on electronic surveillance. ...

In addition to the multirole fighters, Qatar will also receive associated weapon packages, ground support, training materials and maintenance equipment. In a statement released by the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation agency, government officials say the sale is intended to bolster foreign policy interests. The proposed sale is intended to improve Qatar's ability to meet air-to-air and air-to-ground enemy threats and improve homeland defense capabilities. The U.S. State Department's approval comes just weeks after the British government released a statement upgrading Qatar's terrorism threat from "underlying" to "general". U.S. officials say the sale will not affect the basic military balance in the Middle East. Aerospace giant Boeing has been listed as the prime contractor for the sale, with additional support from Elbit Systems, BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin and others. The Boeing-made F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine fighter designed for multi-role capabilities. Additional customers in the Middle East include the governments of Saudi Arabia and Israel.

TrendsViral The presence of the military plane in the Denver skies caught the attention of many planespotters curious to find out why the large aircraft was hanging over the city in a holding pattern. Why is such a large #MILITARY plane flying over the US & no one seems to know who or what it was doing?? Mystery flight circles over Denver— SL (@SLandinSoCal) November 17, 2016 After the ships who disappeared now you have the circling plane that no 1 knows anything about https://t.co/6ApuazbRuw@mylesartltd@hl10pm— AudreyA. (@AudreyAurus1) November 17, 2016 Local news outlet Denver7 tracked flight IRON99 as it traveled from the west coast to Oklahoma. The plane eventually landed at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma city after an hour loitering above Denver. The news station’s initial attempts to find where the plane originated proved fruitless as officials from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and a dozen Air Force Bases could not confirm the flight. The next day, however, the Navy confirmed that the mysterious aircraft was in fact one of its E-6B Mercury planes, known as the ‘Doomsday plane’, and was simply returning to its homebase. These planes, created by Boeing at a cost of $141.7 million per unit, have the capability to launch nuclear missiles and communicate with nuclear submarines. The overall mission of the E-6B is to provide “command, control and communications abilities between the National Command Authority (NCA) and U.S. strategic and non-strategic forces.”   The US Navy has a total of 16 of these powerful military aircraft in its fleet. "Mysterious" plane circling over Denver was "just" an E-6B Mercury "doomsday” plane https://t.co/SqJlBkdIqgpic.twitter.com/oE0BBWrhFL— The Aviationist (@TheAviationist) November 17, 2016 No further details of this particular mission were disclosed, however Denver7 reported that a high-ranking federal official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the plane was involved in a classified training mission organized by the Department of Defense. The officer claimed this was a multi-agency operation regarding electronic surveillance and that these training missions were not unusual, nor were they typically made known to the public. A video of the incident shows the white four-engine plane glide across the Denver sky leaving lengthy contrails in its wake.

Story Continued Below “They will discuss NAFTA issues, vis-à-vis the big elephant in the room,” the Mexican official said, referring to Trump’s threat to withdraw from the agreement unless Canada and Mexico agree to renegotiate it. The two leaders plan to talk more often on their NAFTA strategy in the months to come, following Trump’s pledges to renegotiate or withdraw from the deal within the first 200 days of his presidency if certain demands are not met, Reuters reported Thursday from Ottawa. "The two men will run through a number of scenarios in Lima and talk about how to address them," Reuters quoted a source close to the matter saying. The source added that it was too soon to say what the leaders’ strategy would be given that they are unclear on what exactly Trump intends to do as president. IT’S FRIDAY, NOV. 18! Welcome to Morning Trade, where we’re wondering if news outlets should be thinking about setting up Trump Tower bureaus. Got anything to share on the trade front? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi. TRUMP CAMP PREPS NAMES FOR ECONOMIC TRANSITION: The Trump transition team is expected to send to the White House today the list of people who will be working with both the White House and various economic agencies to facilitate the transition. The names included on the so-called landing team for the economic agencies will then go live on the transition team’s website Monday morning, Republican National Committee chief strategist Sean Spicer said during a conference call with reporters on Thursday. The agencies included are the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Department of Treasury, Department of Commerce, Small Business Administration, the Federal Communications Commission and the Social Security Administration. A USTR spokesman told Morning Trade on Thursday that the Trump transition team had not yet been in touch about the transition. DIAZ-BALART: CUBA REGS TO BE UNDONE ‘PRONTO’: President Barack Obama’s steps to normalize relations with Cuba may not last long under a Trump administration, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, an outspoken critic of lifting the embargo, said on Thursday. Asked which Cuba policies he expected the Trump administration to reverse, Diaz-Balart replied: “All of them.” “All of these things that the president has done as unilateral concessions to the Castro regime, the days are numbered to all of those,” Diaz-Balart told reporters. “I expect it to happen pronto.” Pushed on the idea that rolling back flights could prove difficult, given that commercial flights have already started, the Florida Republican said it would be “very easy,” given that “the law states very clearly that tourism is illegal.” And on the idea that these flights are for reasons other than tourism? “All you have to do is with a wink and a nod say, ‘Oh, I’m going there to dance salsa, smoke cigars and drink rum on the beach, but I’m doing it as a religious spiritual endeavor,” Diaz-Balart said. “So you just literally have to check off a box. The next administration is going to follow the law. And that’s all that this takes.” TRANSITION KICKS INTO HIGH GEAR: Trump’s transition team kicked things up a notch after filing the last pieces of necessary paperwork late Thursday afternoon that enable it to start receiving briefings and to go into federal agencies. The document, called the Memorandum of Understanding or “MOU,” basically kicks off the transfer of power from one presidency to the next and lets the incoming Trump administration begin to think through its plan for the federal government. "The president has identified a smooth transition to the next administration as a key priority for his final year in office," said White House spokesman Brandi Hoffine. "Accordingly, administration officials across the government have been preparing for months to welcome the incoming administration and deliver to them the materials and resources they need to hit the ground running." "The president-elect's team has now completed the necessary steps for an initial group of authorized individuals to begin receiving briefings and other materials from our transition teams at select agencies across the government. We expect to receive additional names for a wider range of agencies from the president-elect's team as the transition work continues, and we will facilitate those requests on a rolling basis.” PORTMAN: MAKE NAFTA GREAT AGAIN: Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said the U.S. should update NAFTA rather than walk away from it and other trade agreements. Like Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, Portman advocated for a number of areas to be improved given the age of the pact, which went into effect in January 1994. "When it was negotiated, there was no e-commerce, as an example, which is a significant chapter now in all of our trade agreements," Portman said on CNN on Thursday. "It did not have the environmental or labor standards we now have in all of our agreements. ... And what these trade agreements let you do, if they're good agreements, is knock down barriers to our farmers and our workers." Brown had also called for stronger labor and environment rules, in addition to taking out investor-state dispute provisions and tightening rules of origin. Portman may also be amenable to those changes since he announced his opposition to the TPP on the grounds it did not have enforceable rules against currency manipulation and because its automotive rules-of-origin were too weak. Trump has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA unless Mexico and Canada agree to renegotiate it on terms more to his liking. Trump hasn't laid out his ideas in great detail, although he has zeroed in on Mexico's valued-added tax as one target of a renegotiation. HOUSE PASSES BILL BANNING IRAN AIRCRAFT SALES: House lawmakers on Thursday approved by a vote of 243-173 legislation that will prevent the Treasury Department from issuing licenses to finance aircraft sales to Iran. The bill also prevents the Export-Import Bank from facilitating transactions either directly or indirectly. “The Islamic Republic has a history of using commercial aircraft to transport weapons, missiles, troops, and cash to the Assad regime in Syria and its other terror proxies around the world,” said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), who first introduced the measures. “The rogue state recently signed memoranda of understanding with both Airbus and Boeing to buy over 200 new planes, even as it continues its ballistic missile program and support for international terrorism.” But not everyone was happy with the bill’s passage. Rep. Denny Heck (D-Wash.) said the president would surely veto the legislation if it makes it to his desk because it could violate the terms of the Iran agreement, but he couldn’t guarantee that Trump wouldn’t eventually unravel the whole deal. “Part of the Iran deal was allowing Iran to purchase U.S.-made commercial airplanes if they are meeting the benchmarks of the agreement. If we walk away from this commitment, we are creating an unsafe and unstable situation not only in the Middle East but the entire world,” said Heck. “I don’t know how people sleep at night knowing this would place American manufacturing at a disadvantage, thereby allowing foreign competitors to take away these jobs, but also because we are telling Iran that the nuclear deal is off. When I ask the supporters of H.R. 5711 what their plan is to protect our nation after unraveling all the peaceful and productive progress we’ve made, all I hear are crickets.” FARM BUREAU CHIEF: TRUMP IS A TRADE PRESIDENT: American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said he doesn’t think Trump will abandon pursuing new trade deals — and the nation’s biggest farm lobby is even hopeful TPP could be revived. ICYMI, Duvall sat down with Pro Agriculture’s Catherine Boudreau for an interview. Here’s what he said on trade: “I think Trump knows the importance of trade, and his advisers that I talk to have said they understand how important trade is to agriculture. But agriculture always wins in trade treaties. What I heard was that Mr. Trump wants fair trade treaties that help all Americans, not just one segment. So I think Mr. Trump will be a trade president, but whatever he thinks is wrong with the deals we’ve got, I’m sure he’ll try to fix them. “Most trade treaties that are up for a vote when the administration is changing are taken up by the next administration. They change what they perceive as wrong with it and it’s moved along. Deals with Colombia, Panama and South Korea took five years after they were finished. TPP is a year old. So it is not out of the norm for it to be a long period of time to make it happen. “Trump is a businessman, and he didn’t want rural America to crumble. If agriculture crumbles, rural America will crumble.” How Burlington fired up an energy revolution: The newest installment of POLITICO Magazine's "What Works" series explores how Burlington — a former logging port on the shore of Lake Champlain — transformed itself into a global trendsetter in sustainable practices in power generation and food production.

"The first of 17 airplanes that the US Treasury Department has allowed to be sold to Iran will be handed over to us in the coming two months," Managing Director of Aviation Parts Holding Company of Iran Javad Hashemi Tehrani said. He noted that an A321 Airbus will be delivered to Iran Air, Iran's national flag-carrier airline, and said, "Airbus A321 is a narrow-body, mid-range jet." The Iranian officials had earlier announced that the country would receive 9 planes from Airbus before the end of the current Persian calendar year (21 March 2017) in case the obstacles for delivering the planes were removed.   Airbus announced in September that it had received the US Treasury Department’s approval to sell aircraft to Iran. The company – together with its American rival Boeing – had earlier this year sealed deals with Iran to sell some 200 planes to Iran. The announcement over the expected delivery of an Airbus plane to Iran came as lawmakers in the US are preparing to raise a bill at the chamber which would block the sales of planes to Iran. The House of Representatives is expected to take up, and pass, the measure as soon as this week. However, it is not expected to get through the Senate, where it would need Democratic support to advance. The measure would bar the Secretary of the Treasury from authorizing a transaction by a US financial institution related to the export, or re-export, of commercial aircraft to Iran. And it would revoke any authorities enacted before the bill passed, such as those that allowed the Boeing and Airbus sales, it noted. It would also limit the role of Export-Import Bank financing of sales to Iran. On Tuesday, the US administration announced that President Barack Obama is set to veto an upcoming legislation to block sales of passenger planes to Iran on the grounds that it would breach a landmark nuclear agreement sealed with the country last year.         Related News Official: Airbus, Boeing Grant Iran Maintenance, Repair Rights  Japan's Mitsubishi Emerging as New Rival for Boeing, Airbus in Iran's Aviation Industry  Official Says 10 Airbus Planes to Be Purchased  Official: Iran to Finalize Contract to Purchase Airbus, ATR Planes Soon  Official: German, French Banks to Finance Iran's Purchase of Airbus, ATR Planes  LATEST STORIES (45) Holy Karbala: World Shiite Muslims Commemorate Arbaeen Iran Extends Condolences to New Delhi on Death of Nearly 100 Indians Iran, Morocco Keen to Bolster Mutual Cooperation Civilians Risk Their Lives to Flee Terrorist-Controlled Areas in Eastern Aleppo Iran, Japan Ink MoU on Inspectorate Cooperation German Company Mulls Investment in Iran's Projects Terrorists Agree to Hand over West Ghouta Stronghold to Syrian Army 7 Schoolchildren Killed in Militant Shelling of Government-Held West Aleppo Syrian Soldiers Engage in Tough Clashes with ISIL Invaders in Deir Ezzur Slovenian President Due in Tehran on Tuesday ISIL Fails to Prevail Over Gov't Forces' Positions East of Syria's Homs Iran, Armenia Opt for Boosting Economic Ties Syria: Hundreds of Army Soldiers Arrive in Eastern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Launch Massive Military Operations in Lattakia, Hama Provinces Nusra Centers across Dara'a Province Receive Sever Blow in Syrian Army Attacks Holy Karbala: World Shiite Muslims Commemorate Arbaeen TEHRAN (FNA)- Millions of Shiite Muslim Pilgrims from across the world, including Iran, congregated in Iraq's Western city of Karbala to mourn the 40th day after the martyrdom of Shiite Islam's third Imam and his 72 companions over 13 centuries ago.

By Weston Williams, Staff November 17, 2016 Save for later Saved Physicist Stephen Hawking sits on stage during an announcement of the Breakthrough Starshot initiative with investor Yuri Milner in New York April, 12, 2016. Lucas Jackson/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking said in a speech at Oxford University Union that humanity only has about 1,000 years left of viable existence if it doesn't leave the planet and colonize the stars. The professor argued that humanity is unlikely to survive all of the different crises we will face over the next millennium. But humans can avoid extinction, he said, if we have colonized other planets by that time, giving humanity a fighting chance away from our "fragile" Earth. Dr. Hawking's prediction may seem gloomy, but much of his speech took an optimistic tone. After all, a thousand years is a long time to figure out how to colonize space, and plans are already underway for humans to visit Mars with an ultimate goal of colonizing the red planet. Scientists continue to discover potentially habitable exoplanets elsewhere in the galaxy that could potentially be new homes for humans – if we can make it there. Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! During his speech, Hawking noted that the biggest and most immediate challenge for humanity will come in the next century, with threats such as potential nuclear terrorism, climate change, and the rise of artificial intelligence potentially outcompeting humans foremost in his mind, according to The Washington Post. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend "Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next 1,000 or 10,000 years," Hawking said in the speech. "By that time we should have spread out into space, and to other stars, so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race." NASA has already discovered thousands of exoplanets using telescopes like Kepler, which can detect planets based on fluctuations in light created by planets passing between their stars and the telescope. While only a few are potentially habitable, and almost all are out of the reach of current technology, a rapid increase in our ability to detect Earth-like planets and the development of new propulsion methods could one day lead us to multiple new worlds for future generations to inhabit. While large-scale colonization of space still feels like a goal rooted more in science fiction than science fact, Elon Musk, the founder and chief executive officer of Tesla and SpaceX, unveiled a plan last September to begin colonizing Mars by 2024, beating NASA's timetable for such a task by 10 years, as the Christian Science Monitor's Lonnie Shekhtman reported: Mars' first colonists will contend with unprecedented obstacles. First there's the hefty price tag. Under current conditions, Musk estimates that a trip to Mars would cost about $10 billion per person. (By comparison, NASA pays $70 million per seat to fly on a Russian spacecraft to the International Space Station). By some projections, it  would cost NASA around $100 billion over 30 years to send astronauts there and bring them back. Other predictions have attached a $500 billion price tag to the trip. As of today, there isn’t a rocket in operation that can transport humans even to the moon, which is 200 times closer to Earth than Mars. To make colonization sustainable, Musk says, would require reducing the cost to about $200,000 per person, or approximately the median cost of a house in the United States. Achieving that would involve making rockets reusable and increasing capacity and efficiency of the Mars journey. Musk estimates that SpaceX initially would need to build a fleet of about 1,000 ships, carrying 100 people, departing from Earth every 26 months to make the venture economically viable. "The key is making this affordable to anyone who wants to go," Musk said.   While exploration farther into space stalled after the end of the cold war, the growing role of private space companies in recent years has created a new kind of space race between corporations such as Boeing, Blue Origin, and SpaceX. The commercial nature of corporate space programs ensures a cash flow that traditional government agencies can't always count on. Private companies often collaborate with NASA to facilitate many of the government agency's more ambitious projects, including the co-development of NASA and Boeing's  Space Launch System, a heavy-lift rocket for deep space exploration, as the Monitor previously reported. This kind of collaboration might allow humanity to spread out into space before we hit Hawking's expiration date in 1,000 years. "Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet," Hawking said, according to The Independent. "Try to make sense of what you see, wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up." Next up Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz!

"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," the Nikkei Asian Review reported, citing a source. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Apple declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. However, Apple has long said the barrier to moving iPhone production to the U.S. is expertise, in addition to cost. "Foxconn follows a strict company policy of not commenting on any matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products," a company spokesperson told CNBC via email. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Pegatron assemble iPhones in China. The news comes following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The Republican president-elect has been vocal about how U.S. companies should be building their products in America.

But Beijing has hit back: In an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned that iPhone sales and other American goods could suffer if such a plan were to go through. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Manufacturing the iPhones abroad allows Apple to maintain a strong margin on its product. Apple is Foxconn's biggest customer but Chairman Terry Gou is worried about the rising production costs of such a move, the Nikkei reported, citing a source saying that costs will double. It's important to note that the discussions began in June, five months before Trump won the election. Analysts said it is still hard to quantify what such a move would mean for Apple's finances, but warned that there will be an impact. "If the world moves to a more nationalistic approach 'made in America, by Americans, for Americans' or 'made in China, by Chinese, for Chinese'... these variable conditions will likely impact margins, growth and suppliers exposed to the globalization trend of the last decade," wrote Neil Campling, head of global technology, media, and telecoms research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, in a note on Friday. "The same will likely make global tech a tougher place to invest in 2017," he said.

News Local news Clout Street Morning Spin: Why Chicago top cop Johnson is in Rome with Emanuel Rahm Emanuel, Eddie Johnson Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson on May 26, 2016. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson on May 26, 2016. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune staffContact Reporter Privacy Policy Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Topspin Chicago’s 80-strong, Mayor Rahm Emanuel-fronted delegation to see Archbishop Blase Cupich’s elevation to cardinal in Rome counts the city’s top cop Eddie Johnson among its number. Including Johnson with the political donors and dignitaries taking the charter flight for the ceremony underlines the importance of the moment -- and reflects the personal relationship he shares with Cupich, according to a Johnson spokesman. But it also could end up being bad political optics for the mayor and the superintendent if violence grabs headlines in Chicago while they’re touring St. Peter’s Basilica. Emanuel has the fight against crime at the forefront of his agenda, trying to overcome the city’s notorious national reputation and repair relations with residents who live in neighborhoods where they don’t feel safe or trust police. Time and again, he has pointed to Johnson’s tireless work as key to that turnaround. Being out of town at crucial moments has been an issue for Emanuel before. When his school board closed dozens of public schools in 2013, he was vacationing with his family at a ski area in Utah, a fact not lost on his critics. And when a Chicago police officer shot and killed teenager Quintonio LeGrier and mother of five Bettie Jones on the West Side last December, Emanuel was in Cuba on a family trip. Emails released months later showed the mayor contacting staff from there to keep close tabs on the public fallout from the shootings. In this case, Johnson’s inclusion in the Rome trip will not compromise the decision-making at CPD, according to department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. The superintendent is checking in via phone regularly with First Deputy Superintendent Kevin Navarro and other department officials, Guglielmi said. “There won’t be any breakdown,” Guglielmi said. “The department is bigger than any one individual.” (John Byrne)   What's on tap *Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Gov.

Iran recently agreed to purchase 200 new planes from Boeing and Airbus, prompting Roskam to push for the ban. It also prevents the Export-Import Bank from financing such sale agreements.

Read more Trump-led US could become Syria’s ‘natural ally’ if it fights terrorism – Assad Thursday’s 243-174 vote passed a bill prohibiting the US Treasury Department from licensing the manufacturers and US banks that would finance the commercial aircraft sales to Iran Air. All of the “No” votes were cast by Democrats, but eight Democrats did vote “Aye” with an undivided Republican Party, which has a majority in the House of Representatives. The bill is expected to face stronger opposition in the US Senate, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto it even if it passed there. Under an incoming President-elect Donald Trump, however, the bill has a better chance of becoming law. The commercial deals involve sales or leases of more than 200 jets, which would boost IranAir’s fleet after years of relentless sanctions. Boeing is an American company while Airbus is French, but it is still affected since 10 percent of its planes’ parts are made in the US.

Opposition to the bill said tens of thousands of jobs were at stake in the deals estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars. The Treasury Department assured that the licenses were under "strict conditions to ensure the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred to a designated entity," the Associated Press reported.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents Chile & Airbus to Collaborate on Defense & Aerospace | EDA Gets Budget Increase Ending Six Year Freeze | SK Investigating DAPA on Suspicion of Intel Leak Nov 18, 2016 00:58 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas An agreement has been signed between Airbus and the Chilean government to pursue collaborative business development in the defense and aerospace industry. Both sides will cooperate on manufacturing and maintenance for future projects while exploring further possibilities. The Airbus deal is one of several agreements Chile has made with defense firms which includes a contract with Lockheed Martin to produce spare parts for C-130 aircraft. Middle East & North Africa The Turkish Defence Minister Fikri Isik stated that the first two of a batch of 24 more Lockheed Martin F-35 aircraft will be delivered in 2018. 24 of the Joint Strike Fighter will be ordered over the next three years, of which six, including the two expected in 2018, had already been ordered. Ankara has committed to procuring a total of 115 F-35s. Europe Greece has taken delivery of three second-hand CH-47SD heavy-lift helicopters. The transfer of the ex-National Guard Chinooks was completed on November 11. Seven more are expected by the end of 2017 as part of a $120 million deal with the US. European Defense Ministers agreed to raise the budget of the European Defence Agency (EDA) ending a six-year freeze. While small, the increase will see 2016’s $32.7 million increased to $33.1 for 2017’s activities. All 27 EU members gave their resounding support for the measure and will use the extra funds to develop and procure additional aircraft and other defense materials. Spain’s Air Force has received its first A400M transporter from Airbus. Aircraft MSN44 carried out its maiden flight from Airbus’s Seville final assembly site in September, and is the first of 27 examples on order for Spain. The delivery came days after Airbus announced that two A400Ms had successfully demonstrated the in-flight transfer of fuel using a fuselage-housed hose-and-drum unit. Asia Pacific South Korean investigators have raided the offices of the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). An official from DAPA is suspected of leaking confidential information on military equipment to BAE Systems during a mismanaged project to upgrade the KF-16 fighter jet. The 2011 modernization award with the company has since been dissolved. Boeing is eager to sell its KC-46A aerial refueling tanker to India. The Indian Air Force has yet to procure a capability to refuel its C-17 and P-8I aircraft, and New Delhi has eyed up the Pegasus to fill such a role. A laborious search has been underway to fill a six multi-role tanker capability soon to be vacated by their aging IL-76 aircraft. Earlier attempts to procure Airbus A 330 MRTT never came to fruition. The first flight of India’s Rustom-II UAV has been successfully completed. Conducted by India’s Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), the drone accomplished all main objectives during the test, including takeoff, bank, level flight, and landing. While this marks a good milestone for the program, officials maintain that a lot more evaluation and testing needs to be done before operational evaluation and eventual entry into service with India’s military branches can take place.

The powerful jet was spotted on Wednesday but multiple military officials failed to identify the plane’s origin or even its flight destination sparking panic among some onlookers. ABC News 2 A mystery jet spotted by thousands in the skies over Denver has been identified as a E-6B mercury Now the plane has been identified as an E-6B mercury – a US Airforce mobile command centre used to launch nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. According to the Navy’s website, the E-6B is a high-tech and large plane, each of which is equipped with an airborne launch control system that can reliably launch intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). It would be called into action if the States was ever dragged into another world war. Local news began tracking the top secret flight – codenamed IRON99 – as it moved over the Pacific, reports the Daily Star. Mystery aircraft confirmed to be secret 'doomsday' NUKE plane   Related Stories A QUICK DEATH Russia developing hypersonic 'defence-dodging' NUKE which can travel at 4,000mph and reach UK in 23 minutes SURGICAL STRIKE US and South Korean elite troops prepare to wipe out Kim Jong-Un's nukes APOCALYPSE NOW? Could Putin's 'Satan 2' Russian super-nuke wipe out London, Manchester or Birmingham? HELLBENT ON WAR North Korea will never ditch its nukes, intelligence expert warns After circling the skies for over an hour it eventually landed at Tinker Airforce base in Oklahoma. Top officials at nearby Buckley Air Force base added to the plane's mystery when they claimed the aircraft never checked in with its traffic control towers. Denver International Airport staff also confirmed no such plane came into contact with them. Although the Navy later said the plane simply was flying from its forwarding base back to home base, a high-ranking federal official who wasn't authorised to speak on the matter said the plane was involved in a classified training mission organised by the Department of Defense. The training mission reportedly centred around electronic surveillance and involved several agencies which aren't likely to comment on the mission, the source said. AFP 2 The state-of-the-art communications planes can harness the awesome power of the US nuclear weapons The source said the mission wasn't out of the ordinary despite its size, noting the public isn't usually aware of such training missions. And top military organisations including The North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) said they couldn’t locate the mysterious flight or even confirm it existed. The planes from the ground up look a lot like Boeing 707 units because the plane is modelled off the old Boeing product. Often painted bright white to look nondescript, the planes have more than six hours of loiter time in the air and have a range of just over 7,500 miles.

By the Editorial Board Nov 18, 2016 (…) Charles Sykes Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump arrive at a benefit at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in May. Ivanka currently serves as a boardroom judge on her father's show "The Apprentice." Happy 31st birthday, Ivanka! Baubles, bangles and beads The presidency of the United States is not only the most powerful office in the world, but think of the marketing potential! Usually the president and his relatives wait until after leaving office to cash in, but not always. Billy Carter hawked beer. Hugh and Tony Rodham, brothers of first lady Hillary Clinton, hawked hazelnuts. The various arms of Trump Enterprises will have a big challenge separating the public from the private, as President-elect Donald Trump has always aggressively traded on his name as his brand. Right out of the box on Monday, after Trump and his family had been interviewed on “60 Minutes” Sunday night, an aggressive marketeer at Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry company sent out a “fashion alert” noting that Ivanka Trump has worn “her favorite bangle” (an $8,800 to $10,000 bracelet) on the CBS News show. "Please share this with your clients …" the email said. This was an embarrassment to Ivanka Trump, whose company president explained that the message "was sent by a well-intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol, and who, like many of us, is still making adjustments post-election." Can the Trump companies go from “customary protocol” — cashing in relentlessly — to standing idly by and letting the greatest marketing opportunity in the world go unexploited? Don't bet your favorite bangle on it. A dish served cold The first week of the Trump transition also featured a kind of dark and vengeful family subplot normally associated with Shakespeare or “The Sopranos.” Three days after Trump’s election, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, after having run the Trump campaign’s transition planning effort, was sacked in favor of the vice president-elect, Mike Pence. Three advisers who Christie had brought along also were summarily shown the door. Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s husband and one of Donald Trump’s most trusted advisers, had wreaked revenge. Back in 2005, as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, Christie had sent Charles Kushner, Jared’s dad, to federal prison. The elder Kushner, a prominent donor to Democratic politicians in New Jersey, pleaded guilty to illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering. Jared Kushner always thought his father had gotten a raw deal and that Christie, who used the case as a springboard to becoming New Jersey’s Republican governor, had been politically motivated. Christie, who may have legal troubles of his own in the wake of the convictions of two top aides in his governor’s office in the “bridgegate” scandal, was kept around the Trump campaign as long as he was useful. But when it came time to reap the spoils of war, Jared Kushner sprang the trap door under him. Chicago-style politics has nothing on Jersey-style politics. Above it all People who aren’t shopping at a luxury jewelry store or interviewing for a position in Donald Trump’s administration may want to avoid New York City’s Fifth Avenue near the southeastern corner of Central Park. A major thoroughfare through Manhattan, Fifth Avenue is one of the world’s most prestigious shopping destinations and home to Trump Tower, where the president-elect lives in a penthouse suite. While New York City police and Secret Service agents are establishing a security zone around Trump, business near the tower is grinding to a halt. Shoppers headed to Gucci and Tiffany stores in Trump Tower were allowed in recently after they were questioned and their bags were searched, according to The New York Times. Presidents have always had second homes, but not in midtown Manhattan. Trump is reported to be a homebody who likes to wake up in his own bed, and is certainly free to live where he wants. A piece of advice for dealing with this president, who is not like any others, is to buckle up. Just don't plan on buying your buckles from Gucci or Tiffany. She'll be missed Gwen Ifill was a standard-bearer for fair journalism, covering the White House, Congress and national campaigns for 30 years for two major newspapers and two television networks. President Barack Obama called Ifill a friend at a news conference on Monday shortly after her death at age 61. Obama said Ifill, the daughter of an African Methodist Episcopal minister, “always kept faith” with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession: To ask tough questions, hold people in power accountable and defend a strong and free press. Ifill broke ground as a black woman in a field dominated by white men when she began her journalism career after graduating from Simmons College in Boston in 1977. She was known as a tough and thorough reporter, dependably gracious and with a lively sense of humor. Ifill was an inspiration for women in her field, as one half of the first all-woman anchor team on a nightly network news show, PBS’s “NewsHour.” Ifill died of complications from uterine cancer at a hospice in Washington. Pride of place  Boeing is banking on St. Louis, moving 500 jobs to the company’s North County campus from Huntington Beach, Calif. The aerospace giant’s Defense, Space & Security division is already headquartered in St. Louis, and Boeing officials decided that expanding here would help them maximize profit and get the most from their workforce. This was a solid business decision, made for all the right reasons. St. Louis’ low cost of living and accessible urban lifestyle make it an attractive place to live. Living in Huntington Beach is 135 percent more expensive than living in St. Louis. Boeing knows the region’s charms, and other companies are going to recognize the area offers a lot that other cities find hard to match.

EST November 18, 2016 Photo: NASA CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST We may soon be adding Internet provider to the list of things SpaceX offers. Elon Musk's space company, best known for its ambition to privatize space travel, has asked the Federal Communications Commission for approval of its plan to launch 4,425 satellites into orbit. The goal of the satellites would be to provide Internet access for "residential, commercial, institutional, governmental and professional users" around the world, according to the FCC filings. The initial deployment would see the launch of 1,600 satellites. After 800 satellites are launched the company would turn on the service, which could cover the "contiguous United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands," say SpaceX's filings, submitted earlier this week. Once fully operational, the system would encompass "virtually all parts of the Earth’s surface and therefore, in principle, have the ability to provide ubiquitous global service," the filings say. The "constellation" of satellites would be 1,110-1,325 kilometers, or roughly 690-823 miles, above the earth. This would put them into low-earth orbit, similar to weather satellites and much closer to the earth than GPS satellites, which are approximately 20,200 km, or 12,550 miles, away. By operating closer to earth, the system could theoretically offer faster speeds that would rival, or even surpass, the cable and fiber optic broadband speeds available today. Once fully deployed, SpaceX says the system would be able to provide speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second.In its latest "State of the Internet" report earlier this year, network provider Akamai Technologies found the average global Internet speed to be 6.1 megabits per second, exponentially slower than SpaceX's potential service. SpaceX says the satellites weigh about 850 pounds and are roughly the size of a car. Each satellite will have an expected lifespan of 5-7 years, although no timeline was provided for when SpaceX would seek to launch the satellites. This satellite broadband project is part of Musk's $10 billion global broadband delivery plan, announced last year. Google and Fidelity have since invested a combined $1 billion, in part to help with the launch of the program according to The Washington Post. SpaceX is just the latest company looking at aerial means of expanding global high-speed Internet coverage. Google's parent company Alphabet has been exploring Internet delivery through drones and balloons while airplane maker Boeing has been pursuing a similar satellite-based delivery system utilizing around 1,400 satellites. OpenWeb, a group backed by Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs, plans to launch its own, global high-speed satellite Internet service in 2018.

Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls By the light of a waning moon, a Russian rocket carrying a veteran cosmonaut, a French flight engineer making his first flight and America’s most experienced female astronaut blasted off and streaked smoothly into orbit Thursday, the first step in a two-day rendezvous with the International Space Station. The workhorse Soyuz-FG rocket roared to life with a torrent of fiery exhaust and climbed away from its pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 3:20 p.m. EST (GMT-5; 2:20 a.m. Friday local time), quickly accelerating through a cold, cloudless sky and flying directly into the plane of the space station’s orbit. Live television views from inside the Soyuz MS-03/49S ferry craft showed commander Oleg Novitskiy strapped into the center seat, flanked on the left by European Space Agency flight engineer Thomas Pesquet and on the right by Peggy Whitson, making her third flight to the station. “The crew is feeling fine,” Novitskiy reported as the rocket accelerated toward space. Eight minutes and 45 seconds after launch, the Soyuz MS-03 spacecraft was released from the booster’s upper stage to fly on its own. Moments later, the ferry ship’s two solar arrays and antennas unfolded and locked in place as as the crew set off after the station. This is the third flight of an upgraded MS-series Soyuz, featuring improved communications, navigation and propulsion systems. As with the first two flights in July and October, the MS-03 crew will take two days to catch up with the space station, giving Russian engineers and flight controllers time to continue tests of the upgraded systems. But if all goes well, Novitskiy and Pesquet a former Air France pilot, will oversee an automated approach to the station Saturday, moving in for a docking at the Earth-facing Rassvet module around 5:01 p.m. The linkup will come 18 years to the day after launch of the Russian Zarya module, the station’s first component. “This was a perfect evening,” said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. “When we talk about the journey to Mars and the way we’re bringing nations of the world together, this is the epitome of that. It’s a great night … getting three more crew members up there.” Standing by to welcome Novitskiy and his crewmates aboard will be Expedition 50 commander Shane Kimbrough, Soyuz MS-02 commander Sergey Ryzhikov and flight engineer Andrey Borisenko, who were launched to the station Oct. 19. They’ve had the lab to themselves since Oct. 30 when three other crew members — Soyuz MS-01 commander Anatoly Ivanishin, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins departed and returned to Earth. Whitson, Novitskiy and Pesquet are seen through a quarantine glass Wednesday during a prelaunch press conference. Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls With the arrival of the MS-03 crew, the station’s crew will be back up to six, allowing a full slate of research. Whitson, 56, holds a doctorate in biochemistry. She is America’s most experienced female astronaut, veteran of two long-duration stays aboard the station in 2002 and 2007-08 totaling nearly 377 days aloft. She served as commander of the station during her second visit and was the first non-military pilot, and first female, to serve as chief of NASA’s astronaut office at the Johnson Space Center. During her third space flight, Whitson will set a new record for total time in space by a U.S. astronaut. On April 24, she will surpass the 534-day mark set in September by astronaut Jeff Williams. With a landing in mid May, her time aloft over three flights will total about 555 days, moving her up to ninth in the world. Like Whitson, Novitskiy is a veteran space station crew member, serving as a flight engineer during a 144-day visit in 2012-13. Pesquet, an aerospace engineer and veteran Air France pilot, is making his first flight. Before launch, Pesquet said flying with veterans like Novitskiy and Whitson was a definite bonus, joking that Whitson “built the space station by herself.” “It’s really a long process for me to learn from these two guys, and I think we’re in good shape now,” he said. “It’s going to be exciting.” During their stay aboard the station, the expanded crew will welcome a Russian Progress cargo ship on Dec. 3 and a Japanese HTV freighter on Dec. 13. The HTV will be carrying six state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries that will replace 12 aging power packs in one set of the station’s solar arrays. The batteries will be installed during at least two spacewalks in January. Additional spacewalks are tentatively planned in the March-April timeframe to attach a short tunnel-like pressurized mating adapter to a port on the forward Harmony module that eventually will be used by commercial crew ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX. One such port already is attached to the front of the station. Along with routine research and spacewalk planning, the station crew also hopes to welcome two SpaceX Dragon cargo ships, one in January and one in March, along with a Progress supply craft in January and an Orbital ATK Cygnus cargo ship in February. SpaceX, however, is still recovering from a Sept. 1 launch pad explosion, and while the company hopes to resume launchings in December, it’s not yet clear when the Dragon cargo missions will actually fly. “Some of those fine details we don’t know yet,” Whitson said. “But we’re an adaptable crew, we’ll be able to do whatever it is they give us to do, and we’re looking forward to it. We have an incredible number of scientific investigations, some are already on board, some will be arriving while we’re up there, and we’ll be able to continue to conduct research no matter what the shuffle is.” Baikonur Cosmodrome European Space Agency Expedition 50 Expedition 51 Human Spaceflight International Space Station Oleg Novitskiy Peggy Whitson Roscosmos Russia Soyuz Soyuz MS-03 Thomas Pesquet Related Articles News Lost Philae lander found on comet September 5, 2016 Ariane 5 Europe’s satellite navigation fleet gets big boost from Ariane 5 rocket November 18, 2016 Mission Reports Soyuz lands in Kazakhstan, bringing three station crewmen back to Earth December 11, 2015 News Headlines Photos: Atlas 5 launches new weather observer November 20, 2016 Atlas 5 launches the most advanced U.S. weather satellite in history November 20, 2016 Video: GOES-R departs Earth atop Atlas 5 rocket November 20, 2016 Photos: Station crew suits up, blasts off on Soyuz rocket November 18, 2016 Live coverage: Atlas 5 countdown and launch journal November 18, 2016 Home News Launch Schedule Mission Reports Antares Ariane 5 Atlas 5 Delta 4 Falcon 9 H-2A Soyuz Space Station Subscribe Members Astronomy Now Store © 1999-2016 Spaceflight Now Inc.
