Aeromexico: slightly higher 2017 capacity growth as confidence of Delta JV approval remains high CAPA > Aviation Analysis > Aeromexico: slightly higher 2017 capacity growth as confidence of Delta JV approval remains high 6-Nov-2016 Tweet © CAPA Mexico’s largest airline, Aeromexico, plans slightly higher capacity growth in 2016, mostly driven by added frequencies to its long haul markets in Asia and Europe. Its preliminary guidance shows an ASK increase in the low single digits versus 8% growth in 2016. Similarly to 2016, much of Aeromexico’s capacity should be deployed to international markets as the airline sheds three Boeing 777 widebodies and adds five 787-9s to its fleet. Aeromexico and Delta continue to believe US regulators will approve their immunised cross-border joint venture by YE2016, and are planning to increase their combined daily flights between the two countries by 43% during the next two years. The joint venture is a major pillar of Aeromexico’s transborder strategy going forward as Delta prepares to exert more influence over Aeromexico’s strategy. Some of Aeromexico’s and Delta’s rivals are lobbying for the two airlines to relinquish more slots at Mexico City Juarez, which could become a factor in the government’s final decision. In the near term Aeromexico’s outlook is relatively stable, despite continuing challenges from the depreciation of Mexico’s currency. The airline’s revenue generation for the 9M ending Sep-2016 was favourable, driven by increases in yields and load factors. NOTE: This report was prepared before the DoT issued its decision in the Aeromexico-Delta joint venture Aeromexico plans low double-digit capacity growth in 2017 as more widebodies arrive Aeromexico recently offered preliminary capacity guidance of growth in the low double digits for 2017, compared with an 8% increase in 2016. Between 2013 and 2015 Aeromexico’s average annual ASK growth was 9.6%. Aeromexico Group annual ASKs: 2013 to late 2016 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and airline group reports. The company ended 3Q2016 with 131 aircraft and plans to grow its fleet to 140 aircraft by YE2017. Aeromexico is expanding its Boeing 787-9 widebody fleet by five aircraft and shedding three Boeing 777s as part of a fleet simplification programme.

Note: This profile only uses data sourced from majority-owned subsidiaries Aeromexico plans to bolster frequencies on long haul international routes in 2017 Aeromexico has estimated its domestic capacity growth should increase in the high single digits in 2017, with the bulk of its capacity being directed to international markets. The airline plans to increase frequencies in several long haul markets to Europe and Asia, beginning in the summer of 2017. From Mexico City to London Heathrow and Amsterdam Aeromexico is increasing weekly frequencies from three to six, and adding two weekly frequencies to Madrid for a total of 12. In Asia Aeromexico plans to grow weekly frequencies from Mexico City to Tokyo Narita from five to seven, and is increasing its weekly frequencies from Mexico’s capital to Shanghai from three to five. Aeromexico debuted long haul flights to Amsterdam and Tokyo Narita in 2016, and has served the other routes with planned frequency expansions for a number of years. So far Aeromexico has plans to add just a single long haul market in 2017, which is three weekly flights to Seoul in the second quarter of the year. Seoul is a hub for Aeromexico’s fellow SkyTeam member Korean Airlines, so presumably Aeromexico should have the capability to market beyond destinations from Seoul through a partnership with Korean. Aeromexico has the advantage of its stature as the only Mexico-based airline offering long haul flights from Mexico to Europe and Asia, and its expansion into those regions during the past couple of years reflects the airline’s efforts to create blanket network coverage. International routes are a major driver of Aeromexico’s revenue growth, and its growing long haul network is a significant component of its international revenue. During 3Q2016 Aeromexico’s international revenues grew nearly 17% year-on-year, and represented 51% of the company’s total revenues. Volaris ups competition with Aeromexico on transborder routes from Mexico City in 2017 Aeromexico’s planned new transborder routes for 2016 include service from Mexico City Juarez to Austin and Monterrey to Detroit – a hub for its SkyTeam partner Delta. Aeromexico is uncontested on service to Austin, and is operating alongside Delta on services between Monterrey and Detroit. The company is the largest US transborder operator among Mexican airlines, holding a 57% passenger market share from Jan-2016 to Aug-2016.

Both US and Mexican airlines are working to take advantage of a new bilateral between the two countries that lifts the restrictions on the number of airlines operating on certain routes. Aeromexico executives were recently queried about the changing competitive dynamics due to the loosened bilateral. The company concluded that a lot of additional capacity was being deployed from leisure markets, including Cancun, Los Cabos and Puerto Vallarta. But Aeromexico’s rival Volaris is taking advantage of the new bilateral to enter into more contested transborder markets during early 2017. The ULCC plans to introduce service from Mexico City Juarez to Miami, New York JFK, Houston Intercontinental and San Francisco. Aeromexico operates in all those markets and holds a majority seat share in two – JFK and San Francisco. The Mexican hybrid airline Interjet also operates from Juarez to Miami, JFK and Houston. American operates from Juarez to Miami, United operates flights from Mexico City to its hubs in Houston, and San Francisco and Delta offers flights between Mexico City and JFK. See related report: Mexican ULCC Volaris makes a pivot into it transborder strategy – into more contested markets Volaris is injecting ULCC competition on those routes, and with its sub-USD6 cent unit costs excluding fuel can likely offer ultra-low fares for a long period of time, which could pressure overall fares in those markets. Aeromexico and Delta have stated for months that they expect the US DoT to approve their proposed transborder joint venture by YE2016, and Aeromexico continues to stick to that message. Mexico’s largest airline believes the tie-up will strengthen its already strong position in the US transborder market, and plans are under way for the two airlines to grow their combined daily transborder flights from 70 to 100 in the next two years. In order to gain approval for the joint venture from Mexican authorities, Aeromexico and Delta have agreed to relinquish eight slot pairs at Mexico City Juarez. Some US airlines, including jetBlue, have been vocal about additional concessions from the two airlines. jetBlue has asked DoT to consider requiring Aeromexico and Delta to divest 30 slot pairs at Juarez to ensure fair access to the slot-controlled airport. See related report: Mexico-US transborder airline market Part 2: Controversy surrounds the proposed Aeromexico-Delta JV It is not far-fetched that DoT might require some additional slot divestitures to ensure airlines looking to take advantage of the new bilateral can gain access to Mexico City Juarez, where Aeromexico holds 41% of the airport’s system-wide seats. jetBlue has been critical that its slot times at Juarez for service to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale are commercially unviable.

Aeromexico charts solid revenue growth, but continues to battle currency pressure As it awaits approval for its joint venture with Delta Aeromexico has a relatively positive view of the its current operating environment. Its yields in 3Q2016 grew 2.9%, and unit revenues increased 7.3% year-on-year. Overall revenues grew 16.5% year-on-year. Mexico’s economy grew an average of 2.3% from Jan-2016 to Jul-2016, but the MXP depreciated nearly 14% agains the USD in 3Q2016. The currency depreciation resulted in Aeromexico’s MXP-dominated fuel costs growing 2.4% year-on-year in 3Q2016, offsetting decreases in USD fuel prices. The MXP has been depreciating against the USD for about 14 months, and to ease some of the pressure Aeromexico has been working to shift some point of sale to international markets. Its USD unit revenues are down year-on-year but perhaps, once the joint venture with Delta is in place, Aeromexico will have more of an opportunity to shift point of sale into additional international markets. Aeromexico's capacity growth underpins international ambitions in long haul, and the Delta JV Unlike most US airlines that are planning lower capacity growth in 2017 Aeromexico is planning capacity expansion, mostly into long haul international markets where, in some cases, it can feed into networks of its SkyTeam partners. Aeromexico’s transborder strategy rests on gaining approval for its joint venture with Delta, which allows for the airlines to  operate essentially as a single carrier in the key transborder market. Ultimately, in order to move forward with their plans, Aeromexico and Delta may have to concede to concessions mandated by US regulators to ensure fair access to Mexico City Juarez for airlines aiming to capitalise on the new bilateral – just as Aeromexico and Delta are hoping to do.

Mexican ULCC Volaris makes a pivot in its transborder strategy – into more contested markets 19-Oct-2016 The US has been a key market for the Mexican low cost airline Volaris since the company launched transborder service in 2009, reflected in the more than 23 US markets the airline presently serves. For many years Volaris’ transborder push originated in other bases outside Mexico City, given slots constraints at Juarez International airport and previous caps on the number of airlines serving transborder routes from Mexico City. But in 2017 Volaris is entering more contested markets, taking advantage of a new US-Mexico bilateral that lifts restrictions on the number of airlines operating on some routes between the two countries. It is upping competition with its Mexican rivals Aeromexico and Interjet on services from Mexico City, as well as with the large US global network airlines. It is not clear if the routes will absorb the additional capacity added by Volaris, but the airline will be the only ULCC operating on those routes, betting it can stimulate traffic with its ultra-low cost model in the already crowded markets. Interjet’s international passengers soar with new US transborder push against Mexican and US rivals 19-Sep-2016 International passenger numbers for the Mexican low cost airline Interjet skyrocketed more than 50% in the first seven months of 2016, reflecting the launch of more than 10 new international routes during that period, and with US transborder routes representing the bulk of Interjet’s international expansion. Interjet is no doubt positioning itself to seize on opportunities created by a new, finalised bilateral between the US and Mexico that lifts restrictions on the number of airlines operating on specific routes between the two countries. Interjet’s rival Volaris has also grown its US transborder passengers in 2016, but it has a different route profile from that of Interjet. Generally, Interjet is subject to higher levels of competition on some of its transborder routes than Volaris, given that Interjet and Volaris offer different products to their passengers. During the past two to three years Interjet and Volaris have been essentially tied for the coveted position of Mexico’s second largest domestic airline. But for the seven months ending Jul-2017 Volaris logged 22% domestic passenger growth, while Interjet’s passenger numbers inched down slightly, resulting in Volaris assuming full command of the second place ranking. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

Travel Business Travel Nothing dense about British Airways’ plans for densification The airline’s plans for an extra seat in each row of economy on many of its Boeing 777s might be a smart move Simon Calder @SimonCalder Saturday 5 November 2016 16:50 BST A Row of World Traveller seats British Airways You may have seen our exclusive story about British Airways installing an extra seat in each row of economy on many of its Boeing 777s – the backbone of the long-haul fleet. “Densification,” British Airways calls it.  Now, airlines generally like to trumpet their news by sending out press releases. But the plans to densify were quietly revealed at a Capital Markets Day aimed at investors, not passengers. Nevertheless a call to British Airways confirmed the plan. Squeezing in more bums on seats in the same size plane makes sense given BA’s rivals to the east (Emirates, Etihad and a dozen more) and the success of Norwegian across the Atlantic. Indeed, BA’s boss, Alex Cruz, made the point that the densification of the 777 would bring seat costs below Norwegian’s 787.  Nonetheless, the move triggered plenty of responses to The Independent. “Funny how for years they've had a strict weight allowance for luggage but suddenly they've decided the weight of an extra 52 bodies is fine,” commented Rabid Raccoon, while Keevil81 added: “The Western world is getting fatter and seats are getting smaller. Doesn’t seem to add up.”  Read more How the big squeeze on BA could affect you John said: “The plans remind me of those old diagrams of the slave ships, the ‘merchandise’ crammed into every available space like sardines. Cavern predicted: “This is a blow for slim passengers too. The curvy passenger sat next to them will spill over even more.” And Steve tweeted: “So the only good thing about BA now is a British Captain’s reassuring voice when you board in far flung places?” Well, no. There is much that is good about British Airways. It is a premium brand with a well-earned reputation for excellent service. And for the two classes of travel that are presently most profitable for BA, improvements are on the way. The high-performing cabins are Club World and World Traveller Plus – or, if you prefer the generic descriptions, business and premium economy.  The World Traveller Plus cabin on board those British Airways 777s is being doubled in size, from 24 to 48. Since its eight-abreast configuration remains the same while personal space shrinks in economy, presumably it will be even more in demand by business travellers seeking space to work or relax without paying the often high fares of Club World. Russ Williams thinks likewise, as he tweeted: “Urgh it's tight enough as it is! Is this a dastardly ploy to encourage upgrades?!” The space race is evident in the seating plans for the new-look Boeings. Space for those extra two dozen World Traveller Plus seats is being created by removing just eight Club World flat-beds.  Read more BA to shrink seat space to squeeze more passengers on to flights Fury as BA launches seven holiday routes from Heathrow BA increases minimum check-in time BA’s business class is what keeps the whole airline aloft, and therefore I sense the airline cares more about it than any other part of the aircraft. British Airways is investing £400m to keep Club World competitive, and is promising a “new ambience to maximise sleep” and “better soft product including bedding”. Don’t tell the folk at the back on the 6,300-mile long haul to Lima. There's no First cabin to Lima – in common with almost all the routes from Gatwick, with the odd exception such as Bermuda. First is in the same category as economy: not performing as well as BA would wish. What’s wrong? “NPS high but paid load factor low,” is the crisp comment on one of the slides shown to analysts. NPS, as you know, is “net promoter score”, a proxy for how happy the passengers are. And “paid load factor low” means hardly anyone is actually paying the appropriate tariff – instead First is the refuge of upgradees (and, from my observation, partners of crew). So the number of First seats is being cut back – to just eight on the next lot of Boeing 787s. And the cabin is being removed completely from “routes with limited demand”. Ben Schlappig, who writes the One Mile at a Time blog, says: “The race to the bottom continues for British Airways”. To me, it looks more like a race to the middle.

The airline giant has reportedly taken the step to bring it 'into line' with competitors, even though the average waistline of passengers is expanding. The company is set to add an extra 52 seats to its Boeing 777s at Gatwick from 2018, and plans to “densify” aircraft at Heathrow after that, it is said. Currently passengers will find nine economy seats in each row in the 777s. But from 2018, there will reportedly be 10 seats fitted within the same space. The move would increase the population on board flights by up to a fifth and stretch current facilities further. The number of toilets is currently 11, allowing for one for every 25 passengers. The latest move will bring that up to one for every 30 passengers, reports The Independent. Read More Are crying babies the worst thing on a flight? This airline may have just changed all that However, one upside is that BA says the economy cabin will be fitted with new entertainment systems with bigger screens. Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, told investors at a Capital Markets Day: “We’re responding to a market opportunity.” The airline giant is said to have taken the step even though the average waistline of passengers is expanding (Photo: REUTERS) He said the move would allow BA to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand”. A British Airways spokesman told Mirror Online: "We are flying more customers than ever before to our expanding network of destinations. "To meet this demand, we are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors and allow us to offer even more low fares. Read More BA widens airplane seats - but EasyJet and Thomas Cook STILL have bigger ones "As part of the update, we will also be fitting new entertainment systems with bigger screens. "British Airways continues to offer customers a generous hand baggage allowance and complimentary food and drink on all our long-haul services." Among the other airlines with a 10-abreast configuration are Air New Zealand, Emirates and Air France. EasyJet’s A320 airbus offers 18-inch wide seats - while BA lags behind at 17.3ins (Photo: PA) British Airways will also reportedly add 12 extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 from Heathrow -which will increase the planes seating density to match easyJet's. The move come after BA increased its seat width from 16.8ins to 17.3 ins on its new Dreamliner fleet last year. The move followed complaints from travellers, with at least one claiming they did not have enough room to open the cutlery pack with their meal. However, the firm still hasn't caught up with some of its rivals. EasyJet’s A320 airbus and Thomson’s Boeing 767-300ER also offer 18-inch wide seats and even no-frills Ryanair gives wriggle space of 17 inches on its 737-800 aircraft.

Deputy Director-General of Uzbekistan Gennadiy Kharlap, Deputy Directors of Aviation Enterprise Uzbekistan Airways Technics Andrey Margachev and Valeriy Kosov received the plane at the Boeing facility. Pilots Andrey Tyan, co-pilo Yuriy Gorkov and chief navigator of the airline Stanislav Gurfinkel carried out 12-hour flight to bring the airplane from Seattle to Uzbekistan. A solemn ceremony of meeting of the airplane was held in Tashkent with participation of the officials of the state bodies. Uzbekistan Havo Yollari received the first Boeing-787 Dreamliner airplane on 31 August. The airline started commercial exploitation on 5 September. It carried out first international flight to Almaty, Kazakhstan, on 9 September. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It seats 250 to 330 passengers, depending on the variant. Boeing states that it is the company’s most fuel-efficient airliner and the world’s first major airliner to use composite materials for most of its construction. According to Boeing, the 787 consumes 20% less fuel than the similarly-sized 767. Uzbekistan Havo Yollari and Boeing signed a contract on purchase of two airlines of Boeing-787-800 Dreamliner and additional engine. The cost of the contract is US$246.4 million. Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (FRDU) issued a loan for US$223.2 million to finance the contract. Subscribe to our Telegram channel to keep in touch with latest news.

The move is being marketed as necessary to catch up with other competitors and save costs. Offering decent legroom and elbow space has become a top priority for carriers flying long-haul destinations, but efforts to lower the average cost per seat is literally putting a squeeze on economy class passengers.  British Airways will add 52 extra seats to its Boeing 777s starting from 2018, meaning each row will have ten seats instead of nine like BA’s current economy class seating layout, according to the Independent.  BA announces at IAG Capital Markets Day 25 Boeing 777s will move from 9-10 seats a row in World Traveller & more seats on short-haul aircrft pic.twitter.com/U6QFe5T2C9— LondonAirTravel (@LondonAirTravel) 4 ноября 2016 г. At present, all Boeing 777s operated by the UK’s flag carrier have nine economy seats abreast, carrying up to 299 passengers in all class configurations. “We are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors,” said a British Airways spokesperson, as cited by the Independent. According to the Airline Reporter, other major carriers using a 10-abreast setup on Boeing 777s include Emirates, Air France, American Airlines, Japan’s ANA, and Korean Air. Even Singapore Airlines, ranked third in the prestigious 2016 World’s Top 100 Airlines list, has ten seats in each row.  Read more Spacious & narrow: Airbus designs adjustable ‘bench seat’ for obese passengers, families Willie Walsh, the CEO of BA’s parent company International Airline Group (IAG), said: “We’re responding to a market opportunity,” adding that the move will allow the British flag carrier to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand.”  British Airways is also planning to add 12 extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 aircraft flying from Heathrow, making the planes almost as densely packed as those operated by Britain’s low-cost airline EasyJet. However, BA said the new seats on ‘Triple Sevens’ would be fitted with bigger screens and upgraded in-flight entertainment systems. Airlines across the world are competing for passenger traffic on short and long-haul routes by trying to reduce operational costs, sometimes at the expense of customer-friendly options. Earlier in April, American Airlines, United, and Delta announced that they would apply tiered pricing to all economy seats, meaning that passengers may be charged extra for choosing window or aisle seats. Some carriers, like Uzbekistan Airways, even considered weighing passengers and their hand luggage before boarding, citing “in-flight safety requirements” introduced by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), but the organization said it has no such regulations.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Moog Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End Results EAST AURORA, NY–(Marketwired – Nov 4, 2016) – Moog Inc. (NYSE: MOG.A) (NYSE: MOG.B) announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 1, 2016. Fourth Quarter Highlights Earnings per share of $0.92, up 23% from a year ago; Sales of $619 million, down 1%; Restructuring and impairment expenses of $12 million, the equivalent of $.24 per share; Strong cash flow from operating activities. Full-Year 2016 Highlights Earnings per share of $3.47, up 4%; Sales of $2.41 billion, down 4%; Operating margins of 9.9%, up marginally; Strong cash flow from operating activities, continuing the strong pattern of recent years; Repurchase of 850,000 shares in the second and third quarters for $39 million. Segment Results Total Aircraft Controls sales in the quarter were $265 million, down 4% from a year ago. Military aircraft sales of $127 million were down 13%, with softness in both OEM and aftermarket sales. Commercial aircraft revenues increased 6%, to $139 million. Sales of OEM products to Airbus increased 44%, to $33 million, on the A350 ramp. Boeing OEM product sales were 14% higher, to $64 million. Commercial aftermarket sales were off marginally. For the year, Aircraft Controls sales were $1.1 billion, down 2%. Military aircraft OEM sales of $512 million were down 6% due to weaker sales on legacy programs including the F-15 and F-18 fighters, V-22 tilt rotor and Black Hawk helicopter programs. However, F-35 production sales were 6% higher, at $90 million. Military aftermarket sales of $200 million were off 5% due to the completion of the C-5 Super Galaxy modernization program. Commercial aircraft sales of $551 million in the year were up 2%, mostly due to increased Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 OEM deliveries. Commercial aftermarket sales were down 4% on lower initial provisioning of 787 spares and softer business jet activity.  In the quarter, Space and Defense segment sales were $97 million, up 5% year over year. Space sales were 14% higher, attributed to strong satellite propulsion sales. Defense sales were off 4% on softer ground vehicle sales in Europe. Space and Defense sales for the year were $366 million, down 4%. Space sales were $183 million, off 5%, as work on NASA’s Common EHA and Soft Capture programs wound down. Defense sales were down 3%, at $184 million, reflecting lower sales of missile controls and ground vehicle systems in Europe. Industrial System segment sales in the quarter were $131 million, up 2%. Most of the increase was tied to stronger foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Energy sales were higher, simulation and test sales were mostly unchanged and industrial automation sales were down. Industrial System sales for the year were $515 million, down 1%, mostly due to foreign exchange movements. Weaker industrial automation sales for metal forming and steel processing equipment, off 6%, were partly offset by increased sales for simulation and test products and an increase in wind energy sales tied to pitch control systems. The Company’s Medical Devices segment has been integrated into the Components segment. All Components segment numbers referenced below have been restated and are comparable. Components segment sales in the quarter were $125 million, down 1% from last year on weaker industrial sales, in particular, sales of oil and gas exploration products. Aerospace and defense sales of $47 million and medical sales of $47 million were unchanged. For the year, Components sales were $467 million, down 13%, with lower sales across all markets. Consolidated year-end 12-month backlog was $1.2 billion. Fiscal 2017 Outlook The Company provided its initial projections for fiscal 2017. Forecast sales of $2.44 billion, up 1%; Forecast earnings per share of $3.50, plus or minus $0.20; Forecast full year operating margins of 10.3%; Another year of solid cash flow. “Q4 was a strong finish to a challenging fiscal 2016,” said John Scannell, Chairman and CEO. “Like many companies, we’re faced with a slow-growth environment and we responded with restructuring activities, on-going portfolio adjustments and continued investment for the long term. Our underlying operations performed well despite significant challenges in the year and we’re optimistic that the actions we’ve taken will lead to long-term performance improvements.” “We’re starting out fiscal 2017 with a cautious view of our markets. We’re assuming most markets will be fairly stable with the only real growth coming from the A350 program. We’re planning for a negative shift in the mix of programs in both our military and commercial aircraft businesses as production rates on legacy programs such as the F-18, 777 and business jets slow and new programs such as the F-35 and A350 continue to ramp up. Our Aircraft R&D will abate somewhat but will remain relatively high on our A350 and E-2 programs. We’ll also have a higher tax rate than fiscal 2016.”  In conjunction with today’s release, Moog will host a conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. ET, which will be broadcast live over the Internet. John Scannell, Chairman and CEO, and Don Fishback, CFO, will host the call. Listeners can access the call live or in replay mode at www.moog.com/investors/communications.

Soon after, CEO of Boeing Dennis Muilenburg declared that the first spacecraft with humans on it to reach Mars will be a Boeing rocket. Now, Obama wants in. After the president’s claim this past week that NASA should be able to send humans to Mars by 2030, Obama supplemented his statement in saying, “Yeah, and by humans, I mean me. Michelle and the kids can come too, if they want.” “I mean, don’t get me wrong,” the president continued, “I love this whole Space Race 2.0 thing we have going on. It’s pretty funny that every other country is so fucked that America is racing against itself. Could you redact that? Anyway, yeah, I think Mars would be a good getaway for a while. Maybe forever. We’ll see how the 2016 election turns out.” When asked why Obama wants to be the first human on Mars, Obama responded in saying that he’s “just so fucking done with this country, ya know?” The president plans on training for his mission by exercising for one hour each day, as recommended by his wife and FLOTUS, Michelle Obama. “She’s always saying ‘Let’s move!’. So I always say ‘Sure honey,’ ‘cause happy wife, happy life, you know?” Obama said to his daughters, Malia and Sasha, Thursday night at the White House dinner table. They chuckled obligatorily in response. SpaceX, Boeing, and NASA have all responded to Obama’s addendum in the same way: they’re hurrying the fuck up. “If we could be the first ones to send America’s first black president to Mars, that would be the best day of my life. Fuck, I don’t mean that in, like, a racist way. Ah, shit,” Musk said this past Wednesday at a press conference. When asked about the president’s plan to go to Mars by 2030, Michelle Obama replied, “He can go to Mars once he figures out how to set up that printer he bought for himself two years ago. Yeah, I don’t think we’ll be leaving anytime soon.” Share this: Twitter Facebook Reddit Email Google More Tumblr Pinterest Print LinkedIn Like this: Like Loading... Related Bookmark the permalink.

The target for average annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rental costs in the 2016 to 2020 period was lowered to EUR5.3 billion ($5.9 billion). Last year, the airline company raised the level from an average of EUR5 billion to about EUR5.6 billion. Shares slumped 3.04%. IAG last week cut its 2016 earnings outlook because of the sharp fall in sterling following the U.K. vote to leave the European Union. Profit now is expected at EUR2.5 billion, down from EUR3.2 billion at the start of the year. The company reports earnings in euros, but the British Airways unit, which generates most profit, principally sells tickets in pounds, which are worth less after the Brexit vote. The June referendum drove the British currency to a more than 30-year low. European airline overcapacity has contributed to a sharp fall in ticket prices this year, one of several headwinds for European airlines, which also have had to contend with depressed bookings from terrorist attacks and strikes that have led to flight cancellations. Competition is heating up in the lucrative trans-Atlantic market, where a new breed of long-haul discount carrier such as Norwegian Air Shuttle SA are challenging the dominance of established U.S. and European network airlines. British Airways on Friday said it would embark on a restructuring plan, shedding staff and lowering costs, "We are going to look for ways to make the company more efficient," BA Chief Executive Alex Cruz said at an investor briefing for IAG. BA is adding seats on some of its Boeing Co. 777 widebody planes to lower unit costs and better compete against the emerging field of discount long-haul carriers. The denser plane will drive unit costs below those of Norwegian Air's Boeing 787 Dreamliners, he said. BA's Mr. Cruz said his airline would also roll out product enhancements to win higher-paying passengers. A new business class seat is being developed, as well as in-flight upgrades. The airline will also reintroduce business class on some short-haul routes. British Airways Chief Financial Officer Steve Gunning said the carrier plans to take a fourth-quarter restructuring charge on par with the EUR62 million restructuring costs booked in the previous quarter. Even higher costs loom in 2017 for the cost-cutting program, he said. Additionally, BA didn't say how many employees might exit the company ahead of negotiations with employees. Mr. Gunning said 550 crew members took up a buyout offer last quarter. Sister airline Iberia is negotiating a voluntary redundancy program for another 1,000 employees, airline Chief Executive Luis Gallego said Friday. He said the measures would help Iberia meet IAG financial commitments. IAG said capacity through the end of the decade is now expected to grow around 3% a year, compared with a previous forecast of 3% to 4%. Capital expenditure plans for the coming years were cut to EUR1.7 billion a year from EUR2.5 billion projected a year ago. To help lower costs, IAG plans to delay taking delivery of some of Boeing's Dreamliners and the rival Airbus Group SE A350 jet. British Airways will fly some older Boeing 747 jumbo jets longer. IAG left unchanged other medium-term targets, including a sustainable 15% return on invested capital, an operating profit margin of 12% to 15% and average earnings-per-share growth of more than 12% a year. The company's free cash flow expectation remains at EUR1.5 billion to EUR2.5 billion a year.

But will new contracts follow? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 5, 2016 at 10:15AM The U.S. Air Force doesn't hate the A-10 Warthog -- at least not officially. In fact, the Air Force doesn't have an official position on the Warthog at all. It has more like a dozen of them. The A-10 Thunderbolt II "Warthog" is one scary fighter jet -- and may just have scared the Air Force into keeping it. Image source: Getty Images. On the one hand, the Air Force commissioned a promotional documentary a few years back explaining how the A-10 Warthog is its single best fighter jet "built for ground combat," and how "its presence alone is enough to keep the enemy at bay." On the other, the Air Force also says anyone who clues in Congress to the Warthog's value risks "committing treason." Indeed, on a third hand, the Air Force has repeatedly called for the Warthog's retirement, arguing this is the best way to free up funds for the Air Force to buy more F-35 stealth fighter jets from Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). And on, and on, and on. Sanity check Last week, the Air Force announced its latest position on the A-10 Warthog, and I can just about guarantee that this one will surprise you: After years of maneuvering to get the A-10 retired from service, the Air Force now wants to keep the A-10 Warthog flying. What's more, they may even be willing to pay for it. As you may recall, the Air Force currently plans to begin retiring A-10s from service in 2018 and to completely eliminate the aircraft from its inventory by 2021. But Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James recently told Aviation Week that she'd consider "different approaches" to keep the A-10 in service "longer" than that -- although she didn't say how much longer. That vagueness has some folks questioning the Air Force's commitment to its close-air support mission. But James insists  that "we stand by 150% the close-air support mission." And there's at least some evidence of actions being taken to back up those words. Last month, AW reported  that maintenance depots servicing the A-10 are "ramping up capacity" to maintain the A-10. Air Force Materiel Command chief Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski confirms that her command has "turned on the depot line, we're building it back up in capacity and supply chain," and is making plans to continue maintaining the A-10 "indefinitely." What it means to investors All of this costs money -- and for defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing (NYSE:BA), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), perhaps enough money to be worth fighting over. For example, a recent piece in Popular Mechanics referenced Boeing's $2 billion contract to install new, upgraded wings on dozens of the 283 A-10 Warthogs still in service. At the same time, both Lockheed and Northrop Grumman share in the $700 million to $840 million per year that the Air Force says it spends on maintaining and operating its existing A-10s. The longer those A-10s keep flying, the longer those revenues will keep flowing to Lockheed, Boeing, and Northrop. By the same token, though, the key reason behind the Air Force's historical efforts to retire the A-10 remains its desire to spend this money on buying new F-35 stealth fighter jets. If the Air Force is now rethinking the idea of retiring the A-10 Warthog, that would seem to imply a reduction in the rate at which it buys F-35s -- which would necessarily pinch Lockheed's profits. So how should investors respond to this latest shift in Air Force priorities? Given the frequency with which the Air Force changes its mind about the A-10, I'm not convinced there is a need to respond to this latest development, which could be reversed yet again in the very next press release. For now, the Air Force's latest rethink seems to give hope to fans of the A-10 Warthog, and investors in the companies that are maintaining, and upgrading the aircraft. But we'll want to see more hard numbers, and actual contract awards, before acting on those hopes. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Breitbart.com reports that polar bears are so numerous in some places that they have become pests. The bald eagle is common enough to have been removed from the U.S. endangered species list. Nevertheless, you can't watch a nature documentary without the obligatory final 10 minutes of hectoring about human activity driving the world to the brink. Meanwhile, 21 percent of U.S. pregnancies in 2011 ended in elective abortions.  About 7 percent of live births in the United States are to immigrants who are here illegally, roughly equal to the number of abortions obtained by black women. You can decide what to make of those statistics. Immigrant-rights protesters on Oct. 26 blocked New York City-bound lanes of the George Washington Bridge for hours, some chaining themselves to the girders. The next day, police in riot gear were called in to remove anti-pipeline protesters from private land in North Dakota. Yet, who protests, or even speaks, for the approximately one million unborn aborted annually?   We hear feverish claims that if conservatives stopped government funding to Planned Parenthood — which runs general women's health clinics besides its abortion mills — it would mean the end of women's cancer screening. This is untrue, since private insurance, charities and Medicaid all subsidize screenings by various providers.  Hillary Clinton has said her campaign is "about the children." Apparently, that concern only begins once the child is delivered. The unborn, however, are not part of her constituency. Gerald Keer Turnersville Beware of trade wars if U.S. hikes tariffs To the Editor: Both major candidates for president want to make more jobs for the citizens of this country. They suggest various strategies: more education; penalizing U.S. companies that manufacture goods abroad; raising barriers for importing products from other countries; financial incentives for companies that expand their U.S. operations. All of these proposals have some merit, but they'd all cost someone something. We set trade barriers to some products coming into the United States, and those blocked countries impose barriers on imports of U.S. products. How does a high tariff on planes that Boeing wants to sell to China sound to you? How about if Japan were to forbid the importation of choice beef or expensive fruit produced in America. Don't you think that such retaliatory moves would cause losses for U.S. firms and producers? Take something more specific. Suppose we put a new 20 percent tariff on imports of all goods from China? These goods would cost 20 percent more when they appear on American store shelves. With these price increases, some American firms will find that they can compete, and begin producing more goods in the good ol' U.S.A. Bingo! More jobs here. But who pays for these U.S. jobs? The 20 percent tariffs will not be paid ultimately by the countries sending us imports. American buyers will pay the extra 20 percent. Whose family budgets, whose cost of living of living, will go up? Don't get me wrong. I may be willing to pay more for the goods I buy if it means more U.S. jobs. But, remember, nothing is free. Someone pays.

It shows the high quality of the water that runs out of your tap.  Water supply is a critical service the borough provides, but it comes with an increasing cost for upgrading the infrastructure and for maintenance. For this and other reasons, I support a "yes" vote in Tuesday's ballot referendum for approval to transfer ownership of the water utility to Aqua New Jersey, an investor-owned utility company.   This ballot question and sale recommendation was not a decision that borough council members took lightly. It came after years of research and an independent engineering study that evaluated existing water facilities and recommended a 20-year infrastructure improvement plan.  A sale might cause residents to have questions, but they should know this is not a unique idea. Privately-owned, regulated water systems produce 4.6 billion gallons of clean water daily to thousands of communities like ours. The sale would also mean an $8.4 million revenue boost to our community, and we won't have to raise taxes to fund the necessary infrastructure improvements. We'll also receive $3.4 million worth of improvements to our water system in the first few years — all without a rate increase during the first five years of Aqua ownership. Discounts that seniors and people with disabilities receive will continue.  Westville has been successfully running its water system since at least the early 1940s. But the new engineering report states that all 23 miles of our pipeline is nearing the end of its life cycle. It's more than 70 years old. Our community needs to implement these infrastructure changes.  This vote is about allowing the continuation of our high-quality water system and providing a financial boost that will greatly benefit Westville for years to come. This Election Day provides a great opportunity for the borough. My hope is that residents will vote "yes" on the referendum, so that we can work together to take advantage of this partnership with Aqua New Jersey.   Michael Ledrich Council President Borough of Westville Send a letter to the editor of South Jersey Times at sjletters@njadvancemedia.com nj.com About Us About NJ.com Advertise with us Contact Us Visit OMJ.com Frequently Asked Questions Jobs at NJ Advance Media Newsletters RSS feeds More on NJ.com Interact Weather Site map Claim your free business listing Sponsor Content Search Place an ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Post a job Post a free classified ad Apartments & rentals NJ.com Sections N.J.

It's a standard college recruiting pitch — except in this case, the whole company could be at stake. On a recent Thursday afternoon outside Willard Airport, 17 Parkland College aviation students listened to all of the reasons they ought to come fly for Trans States Airlines once they're licensed. Regional carriers like it are tasked with handling flights that feed into major airport hubs, and all non-military rookie pilots must work at that level before joining a big-name commercial airline like Delta or Southwest. Trans States representatives came to Champaign-Urbana to try to build brand loyalty before the job hunt starts for the 40 students in Parkland's program, 17 of whom showed up to hear the sales job. It's just one strategy used in the face of a looming nationwide pilot shortage. In February, CNN reported that a pilot shortage led to so many grounded flights for regional Republic Airways that it was forced to file for bankruptcy protection. According to Boeing and Oliver Wyman's Airline Economic Analysis, there will be a demand of 95,000 North American pilots from last year to 2034 — and just 64,000 pilots available to supply it. For aviation students, this makes their prospects almost too good to be true — they can pick from guaranteed jobs if they can successfully qualify for and travel the expansive, but expensive, road of education and training. However, that road is scarring the profession with damage that could take congressional action to reverse. After Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash-landed in 2009 near Buffalo, killing all 49 people aboard and one on the ground, Congress raised the required number of training hours for commercial pilot certification — from 250 to 1,500. That number shrinks to 1,000 after a prospective pilot obtains a four-year aviation degree, 1,250 with a two-year aviation degree and 750 for discharged military pilots. Those regulations vary for non-commercial organizations, such as charter airlines, which aren't required by Federal Aviation Administration regulations to adhere to the commercial airline rules. If the shortage continues as expected, commercial outfits — the majority of which contract with regional airlines — will be slammed next. Sybil Phillips, the chief pilot and director of aviation at Parkland, doesn't shy away from saying the industry is going through "interesting times." 'A big stress for me' Confronted with a burdensome budget shortfall, the University of Illinois closed its Institute of Aviation in 2013-14 and transferred operations over to Parkland. Students at both Parkland and the UI can still participate in the program and earn a two-year associate aviation degree or pilot certification. Over the past 10 to 15 years, the dropout rate for aviation students was around 50 percent, Phillips said. What worries her more, though, is the declining number of aviation professors. Parkland could use two to four more, she said, but many candidates, in response to the shortage, are increasingly being courted by commercial airlines — even if all they can contribute are a few years of work before mandated retirement at 65. "Locally, the shortage of flight instructors is a big stress for me," Phillips said with a solemn pause. "It's going to be very interesting to see how the shortage plays out in the next five to 10 years." That stress is spilling over to Willard, home to seven daily flights from Envoy Air, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines. Six of those go to Chicago O'Hare, the other lands in Dallas. During a Sept. 13 city council meeting, Willard's executive director received Champaign's public support to pursue adding a route to Charlotte. Gene Cossey said American Airlines needs to wait for its pilot numbers to stabilize before that can happen. "The shortage is affecting us right now," Cossey said. "American is saying they're slim on pilots." Landing a much-coveted Charlotte route also depends on how well Cossey and his staff communicate the area's need and demand for it. He said that involves meetings to drum up business and community support. Overall, Cossey said he doesn't see bankruptcy in Envoy's future because of its relationship with American. "One side (of flight shortage perceptions) is doom and gloom and the other is that it's a moderate problem," Cossey said. "The truth is that it's probably somewhere in the middle." Experience argument The 1,500-hours requirement is not without critics. The majority of aviation students and professionals contacted by The News-Gazette have unfavorable opinions of it. The naysayers include Henry Fineberg, who graduated from Parkland's aviation program in May and is training to become a flight instructor. "More experience is good but it might be a little overkill," Fineberg said, noting how he believes the requirement is contributing to the overall pilot shortage. Count Daren Goembel, a captain at the Flightstar charter service in Savoy, among those who agree with the rule. Flightstar requires that its captains have 1,200 hours of training. "You've got to do something to mitigate that gap between being licensed and having experience," Goembel said. "It makes it more difficult but overall I don't think there's anything wrong for requiring more experience." Flight training hours can accrue by providing lessons, hauling anything from cargo to corpses and flying banners, among other tasks. The time it takes to finish the hours creates a sizeable gap between graduation and launching a career. Fran Tao, a UI senior majoring in psychology and political science, takes pilot certification classes at Parkland and is debating whether she wants to enter that pre-career gap. "It's like two years of your life," Tao said of the commitment to finishing training hours. Bill Giannetti, president and chief pilot at Flightstar, doesn't mince words when critiquing the requirement. "It's unnecessary and it makes no sense," he said. "Hours have never been a good indicator of pilot skill. Military pilots are flying around in a jet fighter with 500 hours of experience. I believe the rule will be changed very shortly or else the airline industry will dry up." 'Supply and demand' While laying his career foundation in the 1990s, Flightstar captain Martin Birge was one of many pilots who worked two jobs. He had to in order to get by — back then, rookie salaries ranged from the $20,000s all the way down to minimum wage. "I waited tables at night and flew six to seven days a week for six hours each day to build my initial flight time," Birge said. Those wages are now starting to double in response to the shortage. Phillips predicts that will ultimately be what solves the problem, although it could also be what drives up ticket prices. "I wouldn't advocate that (wages) go down more," Phillips said. "It's simple supply and demand." In addition, perks like signing bonuses, raises and retention pay are becoming more and more attractive. "They're throwing money at the problem," said Scott Conrad, a captain for Trans States Airlines. Aviation students can end up paying more for air time than they do for tuition. At Parkland, Phillips said it costs around $60,000 to receive a commercial pilot license without also majoring in aviation. That amount doesn't include the air time fees for finishing training hours after leaving Parkland. For the 2016-17 school year, Parkland's aviation program charges $157, $370 or $529 per semester hour, depending on where the student lives. Additional course fees range from $1,992 at the low end to $9,894 at the highest. Parkland aviation student Tristan Polk said he is taking out multiple loans to make it all work. Airline-sponsored scholarships, from what he can tell, are starting to increase. "(Aviation) is more of a lifestyle than a job," Polk said. "You have to live around it and the cost." The gender gap Another way to recruit more pilots? Ditch the image of aviation as a boys club. According to the International Society of Women Airline Pilots, around 97 percent of all commercial pilots are male. Being a female exchange student from China, Tao said, "I want to prove that I can do anything I want — that gender is never an issue." Community-building opportunities are springing out of the gender gap, including several groups and scholarships centered around advancing women in aviation. Tao is a member of the Female Aviators Sticking Together group on Facebook. "There's aviation memes, ratings news, flying fashion tips, pictures of babies in 'My Mom Flies' onesies. ... It's really supportive," she said. Goembel says the industry gender gap is indisputable. He has seen it first-hand throughout his 10 years in the profession. "Flat out, you have more white males in the industry than any other gender or race," Goembel said. "It will take a lot of time before that changes." 'A literal dream' Unavoidable downsides to the job — the time away from home, the risks of air travel — can also drive potential pilots away, although some will have enough passion to push those aside. "Flying is a literal dream," Fineberg said. "I know I couldn't let it go." Both Birge and Goembel said they can manage their frequent time away from home because their families act as a strong support system. With all the talk of aviation's disadvantages and the pilot shortage, Phillips wants her colleagues to remember how the increased demand for air travel factors in. "I always think: Who's in the back of the plane?" Phillips said. "It's business people who are also gone from home multiple days of the week. "We're in a society where people travel for work a lot more and we're on the go a lot more."

Mana Rabiee reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Tensions were high at this Beijing hotel on Saturday. That's where family members of the passengers on board a missing Malaysian Airlines plane waited anxiously for news of their loved ones. The Boeing passenger plane carrying 239 people on board was en route to the Chinese capital from Kuala Lampur. It went missing near the South China Sea off Vietnam about an hour or so into the flight. Relatives complained about their treatment by the airline, saying no was in touch with them or giving them any information. (SOUNDBITE) (Mandarin) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN, WHOSE MOTHER WAS ON MISSING PLANE, SAYING: "Some people are crying, some are checking information on their mobile phones, there is nothing in the rooms except for some water, biscuits and bread. There is nothing else. People are sitting in chairs, or even on the floor, because there are not enough chairs." There were no reports of bad weather or an emergency on the plane. A Malaysian Airlines representative said on Saturday that a search and rescue operation was underway. (SOUNDBITE) (English) UNIDENTIFIED MALAYSIA AIRLINES REPRESENTATIVE, SAYING: "We are working with authorities who have actively activated the search and rescue team to locate the aircraft. Our team is currently calling the next of kin of passengers and crew...Our thoughts and prayers are deeply with the affected passengers and the family members." Among the passengers were 24 Chinese artists and their families, in Malaysia for an art exchange program. If confirmed, a crash would likely mark Boeing's deadliest incident since the American jetliner entered service 19 years ago.

Along with the live event at Edmonds Center for the Arts, 13 community libraries will host livestream viewing along with four partner sites including Snohomish PUD auditorium, Everett; Everett Community College, Edmonds Community College and University of Washington Bothell. To ensure seating, registration is required for the Sno-Isle Libraries sites. Registration is not required for the four partner sites. “We’ve heard some frustrations that we are just now announcing the speaker lineup, even though registration opened 20 days ago,” Harvey said. “This is something that sets TED and locally organized TEDx events, such as TEDxSnoIsleLibraries, apart from other conferences. “TED and TEDx is about coming to hear something, not see someone,” Harvey said. “It is the promise of delivering and connecting with a day of ideas, not about speaker names, credentials or personalities.” Still, Harvey said he’s pretty excited about who will be delivering those ideas. “The speakers range in age from 16 to 64,” Harvey said. “They also range from a CEO to high-school students, from a horse trainer to a robotics team coach along with other backgrounds that serve as launching points for the ideas they will bring forth.” Harvey also pointed out that the day is intended to be transformational for the speakers as well as those who hear and see them. “The speakers are chosen by a team of Sno-Isle Libraries staff members, starting from a list of nominations that we solicit from the public,” Harvey said. “But that’s just the beginning. Once chosen, the speakers go through a substantial orientation and training to help hone the presentation of their messages. “Many of the speakers from the 2015 event said this was one of the most valuable and transformational things they’d ever been involved in,” Harvey said. The speakers for TEDx SnoIsle Libraries 2016 are: Andre Feriante, flamenco guitarist, poet Andre’s career path was set at 13, when he first heard the flamenco guitar. He mastered the art and has blended it with classical and Brazilian styles.

This concert performer has also released 14 albums. Andre is artistic director of Leavenworth’s Guitar Euphoria Festival.

Dienes was an Army Air Corps photographer sent in to document the bomb's effects. by Michaela Winberg, STAFF WRITER Close icon Michaela Winberg STAFF WRITER Milton Dienes was dispatched in November 1945 to Nagasaki, Japan, as an Army Air Corps photographer, just 100 days after an atomic bomb obliterated much of the city, killing at least 40,000 people instantly and thousands more from the lasting effects of radiation exposure. Slideshow King of Prussia veteran's Nagasaki photos Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Related links After mysterious disappearance, flag will fly again over vets' cemetery Main Line veteran recalls intense fighting, his capture and rescue Open or Closed for Veterans Day Then, Dienes didn't know the danger of radiation exposure and he walked the streets of the hilly, historic port city without protective gear. The streets of Nagasaki Dienes walked were mostly deserted. He saw collapsed homes once made of sheet metal. Most of the homes weren't built very well, he said, and some "just blew away" in the atomic blast. Concrete buildings appeared to have melted together in the bomb's intense heat - their textured surfaces smoothed by the high temperatures. "It was almost like a glass surface," Dienes recalled. Nagasaki was mostly factories and buildings then - there were few people to photograph, which "was actually better," he said, because their suffering would have been hard for him to face. "The damage, it was strange," said Dienes, now 92, who lives with his wife Harriet in King of Prussia. "It left an impression, something you can't possibly forget." Dienes, a member of the Army Air Corps' 9th Photographic Technical Unit, captured with his Speed Graphic camera unforgettable images of the catastrophic destruction of Aug. 9, 1945. He and his buddies also processed the historic photos taken by pilots of Boeing B-29 Superfortress planes as the atomic bombs were being dropped on Hiroshima and, three days later, on Nagasaki. Those blasts are widely credited for Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. Dienes and his squadron returned to their lab in Guam to develop hundreds of original, on-the-ground and aerial photos that captured the bomb drops and subsequent destruction in Nagasaki. Those historic images, unpublished and mostly unseen outside the military, are now destined for the Library of Congress archives. "I have all these photographs and the stories that go along with them," he said. "I've had some stuff published, but I didn't expect anything like that," Dienes said. About two months ago, Dienes got a phone call from Col. Diane Hickey, commander of 14th Intelligence Squadron based in Dayton, Ohio. "It was so out of the blue because, number one, I had no connection to Dayton," Dienes said. "I just knew it was a major base for U.S. intelligence." Hickey had been searching for Dienes for years. The 14th Intelligence Squadron inherited the lineage of the 9th Photo Technical Unit, but she had almost no record of its existence. "They had no information whatsoever of what we did there - not only that, but they had no photographs," Dienes said. "They didn't know what we did or how we did it." After two years of searching, Hickey finally found Dienes online, listed as a veteran of the unit. "I came across Mr. Dienes, and found this rich history that we didn't even know about," she said. "These were the guys that processed the photos from Nagasaki." Out of more than 100 original members of the 1945 9th Photographic Technical Unit, Hickey found Dienes and one other veteran, John "Jerry" Johnson from Mercer, Pa. "They're still living, they still remember the stories, their minds are still sharp," Hickey said. "They have great memories that have not been recorded, and photos." She invited the two veterans to spend a long weekend in late September in Dayton, hoping to introduce them to the current members of 14th Intelligence Squadron. "By the time we finished, they had a lot of information that they didn't know before," Dienes said. "They copied every photograph I brought with me ... probably 75 or 100 photographs which they never had before." Dienes and other members of his squadron built the photo lab in Guam in 1945 - a structure that looked more like a shack than a studio. Developing photos in the lab back then was "primitive" at best, Dienes said. Days in Guam were usually hot, around 80 degrees. Dienes explained that photo negatives required cool temperatures to properly develop, so he kept an icemaker in the lab, producing 8,000 pounds of ice a day to ensure the right conditions to develop nearly 14,000 photos. Now 71 years old, those black-and-white photographs shot on 4-by-5-inch film are still in "really good shape," he said, "which means we did a good job in the lab when we made them." Dienes, born and raised in the Logan neighborhood of North Philadelphia, graduated in 1942 from Central High School, where he was a school yearbook photo editor. He headed to Pennsylvania State University to earn a pre-med undergraduate degree, but his education was interrupted shortly after his freshman year. A telegram arrived on May 29, 1943, instructing Dienes to report for duty the next morning. But he had a scheduling conflict. "It was my parents' 25th wedding anniversary, and we had a big party planned," Dienes said. "So I called the colonel - I didn't know any better - and I told him I had a problem with that date." Dienes said the colonel told him his problem was "irregular," to say the least, but he nonetheless granted his request to stay home and celebrate with his parents. It wasn't until August 1943 that the Army instructed him to report for duty in the 75th Infantry Division in Alabama. The division was preparing to fight in Europe during the Battle of the Bulge, but Dienes was transferred last minute to the Air Corps. He trained in Mississippi and in Oklahoma, using his experience to help "put together" the photo squadron and teach pilots to use cameras for the first time. Dienes served in Guam from May 1945 to March 1946. After he was discharged, he returned to Penn State to continue his sophomore year, but he didn't complete his degree. Instead, he did some photographic work in the city before joining Jerrold Electronics as a salesman. Later, he was director of marketing at General Instrument, a Horsham-based electronics company. About 30 years ago, Dienes founded Summit Sales & Marketing, a manufacturer's representative company for consumer electronics and computer products. By the time he retired in September 1990, he had earned $96 million in sales, just shy of his lifetime goal of $100 million. When Dienes retired, his only son Garry took over the business. For the most part, Dienes has only shown his photos and told his story sparingly, mostly at local libraries and country clubs. He has had no ill effects from any radiation exposure in Nagasaki. "I don't glow at night," he joked. His mind is sharp: Dienes can still recall every story, every detail of his involvement in World War II without hesitation. He displays his Nagasaki photographs with pride - some of them are mounted on a large poster in his dining room, looking almost like new; the others are tucked away in a photo album, protected from the light. Sharing his photos with the 14th Intelligence Squadron in Dayton will forever be "one of the greatest experiences of my life," Dienes said. "It's great as we start to get older and start to appreciate those that went before us in the military," Hickey said. "The fact of the matter is: They are a part of history, and they're a part of our history." mwinberg@philly.com 215-854-5915 @mwinberg_ Published: November 5, 2016 — 5:48 PM EDT | Updated: November 7, 2016 — 12:17 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

(Photo: John Giles / PA Wire) The imperatives of the climate crisis and the logic of economic austerity are at war—and Washington State is on the front lines. So-called “revenue-neutral” carbon pricing—whereby the proceeds are used to fund tax cuts—has long been a cherished hobbyhorse of free-market economists and the odd Republican who favors climate action. It’s also the policy of choice for big polluters like ExxonMobil. And now this right-wing friendly model is being pushed in Washington State, thanks to Initiative 732. I-732, on the ballot on November 8, would be the first revenue-neutral price on carbon in the United States. It is widely unpopular among the state’s Democrats, Republicans, and even the business lobby, and has only managed to win the support of one significant environmental group. But on the off chance it is approved by voters, it would be a disastrous precedent that could set back the climate justice movement for a decade—time that we simply can’t afford to lose. Some have accepted the logic that something is better than nothing, even arguing that a “tax swap” could substitute for a just transition to a low-carbon economy. The evidence proves otherwise. In British Columbia, two-thirds of the tax cuts have ended up in corporate pockets, while carbon emissions have been rising in recent years and the fracking industry has boomed. By some estimates, I-732 would raise gasoline and electricity prices less than 15 percent by 2040 in Washington State—hardly enough to jumpstart an urgent, sweeping phase-out of fossil fuels. Meanwhile, it would offset carbon revenues by cutting taxes for big corporations, including major polluters. (According to the Seattle Times, Boeing could see windfalls of tens of millions annually.) And while polluters get rewarded, the communities of color that have born the burnt of fossil fuel pollution, and the working people whose jobs are at risk as we move away from fossil fuels, are left empty handed. The money raised by the tax won’t be used to fund green jobs in low-income communities, or to retrain workers currently in high carbon sectors. In other words, this is the epitome of an unjust transition. In fact, this “neutral” tax might not even break even, with a state government analysis concluding it would blow a $797.2 million hole in Washington’s budget over six fiscal years—this at a time when the legislature is under court orders to fix its failure to adequately fund education. So rather than the equitable green transition that has long been promised (better and more affordable public transit, community controlled renewable energy…), low income communities could well end up with even more eroded services than they have now. The backers of I-732 are running on a pessimistic platform of “just do something,” preying on the real urgency that so many of us feel in the face of the climate crisis. But sometimes “something” is worse than nothing, especially if it will stand in the way of better proposal down the road. A paltry, revenue-neutral carbon tax simply cannot deliver the massive green energy investments and community-driven solutions we all need. Science-based climate action means an unprecedented, rapid, and decisive shift to renewables; a truly equitable carbon tax can play an important role in spurring the transition, but it won’t work unless we make the polluters pay, and put their immoral profits to work repairing the damage they have knowingly created. The way to do that is to mobilize the broadest possible coalition—led by the frontline communities who stand to benefit most from building a cleaner and fairer economy. “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” I-732 proponents like to say. It sounds good, but it is not what opponents of in this initiative are doing. “Perfect” is not on the table—we lost that option when climate action was delayed for decades. So much time has been lost, in fact, that now we have just one shot to get the policy right. And that means we can’t let the politically difficult be the enemy of the scientifically and socially necessary. © 2015 The Nation Naomi Klein Naomi Klein is an award-winning journalist, author, and syndicated columnist.

The airline giant is to add the seats into Boeing 777s at Gatwick from 2018, with those based at Heathrow next. Alamy 2 A British Airways Boeing 777 mid flight – there are plans to add in one more seat per row by 2018 Currently these planes, which are the most commonly used for passengers using BA, has nine economy seats per row. But these new plans would see that increase to 10 seats per row. The number of toilets could stay that same despite the extra numbers, meaning those waiting in familiar long lines to relieve themselves could be waiting even longer. The Independent reported Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA’s parent company IAG, told investors at a Capital Markets Day: “We’re responding to a market opportunity.” RELATED STORIES HUMAN RIGHTS ACT SNUB Network Rail cancels Amnesty International's Human Rights Act campaign as it is 'too political' FESTIVE WARNING Scientists discover Christmas shopping could cause fatal heart problems 'SOMETHING WENT WRONG' OAP dies in blaze after firefighters 'just down the road' take more than 90 minutes to arrive 'a risky experiment' Government's plans to replace nurses with less-qualified staff could cause up to a fifth more deaths brits 'best' for blood Brits have the 'healthiest blood pressure in Europe' after dramatic drop in cases of hypertension 'driving us nuts' Pet squirrel causes train delays in south London after getting trapped in one of the carriages He said the move would allow BA to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand”. A spokesperson for BA said it was updating the planes to “bring us into line with many of our competitors”. This comes after it was announced passengers will have to pay for food and drink on short-haul flights if they want a mid-air snack. The airline is ditching the free food on offer on flights under five hours, putting it on the same page as other no-frills carriers like easyJet and Ryanair. Alamy 2 The number of toilets could stay that same despite the extra numbers BA unveils pop-up orchestra Other airlines which have 10 seats per row include Air New Zealand and Emirates. While space for passengers would be smaller, BA has said the economy cabin would be fitted with new entertainment systems. The airline also has plans to add in 12 extra seats on short haul flights using the Airbus A320 flying from Heathrow. BA passengers will be able to surf the web using wifi on short-haul flights from next summer. The technology will allow passengers to watch streaming services, such as Netflix, watch Skype or FaceTime family and friends across multiple devices.

But will new contracts follow? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 5, 2016 at 10:15AM The U.S. Air Force doesn't hate the A-10 Warthog -- at least not officially. In fact, the Air Force doesn't have an official position on the Warthog at all. It has more like a dozen of them. The A-10 Thunderbolt II "Warthog" is one scary fighter jet -- and may just have scared the Air Force into keeping it. Image source: Getty Images. On the one hand, the Air Force commissioned a promotional documentary a few years back explaining how the A-10 Warthog is its single best fighter jet "built for ground combat," and how "its presence alone is enough to keep the enemy at bay." On the other, the Air Force also says anyone who clues in Congress to the Warthog's value risks "committing treason." Indeed, on a third hand, the Air Force has repeatedly called for the Warthog's retirement, arguing this is the best way to free up funds for the Air Force to buy more F-35 stealth fighter jets from Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT). And on, and on, and on. Sanity check Last week, the Air Force announced its latest position on the A-10 Warthog, and I can just about guarantee that this one will surprise you: After years of maneuvering to get the A-10 retired from service, the Air Force now wants to keep the A-10 Warthog flying. What's more, they may even be willing to pay for it. As you may recall, the Air Force currently plans to begin retiring A-10s from service in 2018 and to completely eliminate the aircraft from its inventory by 2021. But Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James recently told Aviation Week that she'd consider "different approaches" to keep the A-10 in service "longer" than that -- although she didn't say how much longer. That vagueness has some folks questioning the Air Force's commitment to its close-air support mission. But James insists  that "we stand by 150% the close-air support mission." And there's at least some evidence of actions being taken to back up those words. Last month, AW reported  that maintenance depots servicing the A-10 are "ramping up capacity" to maintain the A-10. Air Force Materiel Command chief Gen. Ellen Pawlikowski confirms that her command has "turned on the depot line, we're building it back up in capacity and supply chain," and is making plans to continue maintaining the A-10 "indefinitely." What it means to investors All of this costs money -- and for defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing (NYSE:BA), and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), perhaps enough money to be worth fighting over. For example, a recent piece in Popular Mechanics referenced Boeing's $2 billion contract to install new, upgraded wings on dozens of the 283 A-10 Warthogs still in service. At the same time, both Lockheed and Northrop Grumman share in the $700 million to $840 million per year that the Air Force says it spends on maintaining and operating its existing A-10s. The longer those A-10s keep flying, the longer those revenues will keep flowing to Lockheed, Boeing, and Northrop. By the same token, though, the key reason behind the Air Force's historical efforts to retire the A-10 remains its desire to spend this money on buying new F-35 stealth fighter jets. If the Air Force is now rethinking the idea of retiring the A-10 Warthog, that would seem to imply a reduction in the rate at which it buys F-35s -- which would necessarily pinch Lockheed's profits. So how should investors respond to this latest shift in Air Force priorities? Given the frequency with which the Air Force changes its mind about the A-10, I'm not convinced there is a need to respond to this latest development, which could be reversed yet again in the very next press release. For now, the Air Force's latest rethink seems to give hope to fans of the A-10 Warthog, and investors in the companies that are maintaining, and upgrading the aircraft. But we'll want to see more hard numbers, and actual contract awards, before acting on those hopes. Fool contributor Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

According to UK’s Independent, “BA is to add an extra 52 seats to its Boeing 777s at Gatwick from 2018, and plans to “densify” aircraft at Heathrow after that.” Travellers who are accustomed to reasonable elbow room in the cheap seats will find they have less space. While British Airways has nine economy seats abreast in its 777 fleet at present, from 2018 each row will have 10 seats – even though the average girth of passengers is increasing. If the number of toilets stays the same at 11, accommodating almost a fifth more people means that there will be one for every 30 passengers, compared with 25 passengers now,” the website added.

Along with the live event at Edmonds Center for the Arts, 13 community libraries will host livestream viewing along with four partner sites including Snohomish PUD auditorium, Everett; Everett Community College, Edmonds Community College and University of Washington Bothell. To ensure seating, registration is required for the Sno-Isle Libraries sites. Registration is not required for the four partner sites. “We’ve heard some frustrations that we are just now announcing the speaker lineup, even though registration opened 20 days ago,” Harvey said. “This is something that sets TED and locally organized TEDx events, such as TEDxSnoIsleLibraries, apart from other conferences. “TED and TEDx is about coming to hear something, not see someone,” Harvey said. “It is the promise of delivering and connecting with a day of ideas, not about speaker names, credentials or personalities.” Still, Harvey said he’s pretty excited about who will be delivering those ideas. “The speakers range in age from 16 to 64,” Harvey said. “They also range from a CEO to high-school students, from a horse trainer to a robotics team coach along with other backgrounds that serve as launching points for the ideas they will bring forth.” Harvey also pointed out that the day is intended to be transformational for the speakers as well as those who hear and see them. “The speakers are chosen by a team of Sno-Isle Libraries staff members, starting from a list of nominations that we solicit from the public,” Harvey said. “But that’s just the beginning. Once chosen, the speakers go through a substantial orientation and training to help hone the presentation of their messages. “Many of the speakers from the 2015 event said this was one of the most valuable and transformational things they’d ever been involved in,” Harvey said. The speakers for TEDx SnoIsle Libraries 2016 are: Andre Feriante, flamenco guitarist, poet Andre’s career path was set at 13, when he first heard the flamenco guitar. He mastered the art and has blended it with classical and Brazilian styles.

This concert performer has also released 14 albums. Andre is artistic director of Leavenworth’s Guitar Euphoria Festival.

[…] By: Huma Siddiqui | New Delhi | Published: November 5, 2016 6:23 AM The aircraft is designed and built by a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers. With India seeking more than 300 fighter jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF), the British offer of the Eurofighter Typhoon is expected to be part of discussions when during UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s first ever meeting with Prime Minister Modi next week. Britain is part of the European consortium producing the Eurofighter Typhoon. It may be recalled that in 2015, former UK Prime Minister David Cameron had offered the Eurofighter Typhoon and help Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) develop worldclass fighter jets in India as part of the ‘Make in India’ initiative. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Aviation Rafale were short-listed by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in 2011 as part of its medium multi-role combat aircraft competition (MMRCA), but Rafale was finally announced as the preferred bidder in 2011. Though the MMRCA request for proposal (RFP) was scrapped eventually last year, India recently signed an agreement with the French company to buying 36 Rafale combat aircraft off the shelf. Sources told FE, “No decision has been firmed up for the kind of fighter planes India wants for the IAF — single-engine or twin-engine. This leaves scope for all aerospace majors to look at the Indian market again. Three companies have already made presentations to the government and have expressed willingness to transfer technology and to make in India.” In 2011, six contenders for the MMRCA including the Boeing F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-16 Block 60, Swedish Saab Gripen, and Russian RSK MiG-35, had undergone exhaustive trials. At the end of the trials, the IAF made its choice clear to the government on the kind of fighter jets it needs. The frontrunners were the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Rafale. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a twin-engine, multi-role canard-delta air-superiority fighter aircraft, designed and built by a consortium of European aerospace manufacturers through Eurofighter GmbH. On offer was the Tranche-3 Typhoon for the Indian requirement, equipped with the CAESAR AESA radar. Besides the Eurofighter, the visiting leader is expected to talk about the existing defence programmes between the two countries including the BAE Systems and a Mahindra group tie-up for the assembling of M-777 guns. According to the official MEA spokesperson Vikas Swarup, “Prime minister of UK Theresa May would be visiting India during November 6-8, 2016. This is her first bilateral visit outside the EU. She will hold bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” May, along with Modi, will inaugurate the India-UK Tech Summit on November 7 in New Delhi. The decision to hold the India-UK Tech Summit was agreed to during the visit of Modi to UK in November 2015. The Summit is being organised by the Department of Science and Technology and CII, and it demonstrates the importance and expanse of science and technology cooperation in India-UK partnership. At the summit, government officials, business leaders and scientists will engage to see how best S&T collaboration could be leveraged to open up new opportunities for bilateral business, trade and investment. New initiatives on deepening science and technology collaboration between India and UK will be announced at the Summit. Also, a meeting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO), chaired by MOS for commerce and industry Nirmala Sitharaman and UK secretary of state for international trade Liam Fox, will be held during the visit.

Ro McGonegal Nov 4, 2016 0 Comment(s) Share View Full Gallery This car entered the Johnson family collection in 2002. While he was away at college, TJ Johnson’s dad and brother bought it in Defiance, Iowa, for $700. They got it from a woman named Dixie Shanahan, a woman with an abusive spouse. Eventually, she killed him and then went about selling off all his cars. The episode was chronicled in a true crime novel called Dixie’s Last Stand. Suffice that TJ’s dad was called to testify at the murder trial. “My in-laws lovingly refer to the Malibu as the Dead Man’s Car, but that’s only one of its few nicknames,” quipped TJ. To be sure, there have been literally dozens of Chevrolets, from pre-War old to current, entertained by the Johnson family, but this car TJ can’t quit and has clung to him with the tenacity of a vestigial remain. “In the time I’ve owned it, it’s had four iterations, more or less, each defined by what engine was in it,” TJ cracked. 2/40 3/40 “I often get told that it’s deceptively quick. I don’t necessarily think the car’s a sleeper. It’s visible. It has a rollbar, slicks and skinnies, and the license plate says NOS. But the interior and rollbar are very tidy. The nitrous bits underhood are tastefully out of sight and the exhaust note is pretty tame. It feels good to catch people off guard and hear the things they say once they understand what it’s all about.” Since we have neither the space nor the inclination to detail the entire history, let’s just step off from where he took it on. “This car was rather complete, though sans motor and transmission, and we had plenty of parts around to get it running,” he said. “With a four-bolt-main 350 and a decent buff-job on the paint, this became my daily driver through my senior year of college and into the professional working world when I started at Holley in January 2004 as a Research Engineer.” 4/40 5/40 6/40 While in Bowling Green, he touched up the interior, re-covering the back seat, fixing the door panels, and swapping out the sun-faded carpet. He hauled it to Jamie Blubaugh in Augusta, Kansas, for a six-point rollbar installation. Then the car went to Roger Bosley for paint. Since the majority of the sheetmetal was new and the quarter seams were well-done by Bruce Philbrook (Maize, Kansas), the car basically only needed “straightening” by way of several coats of high-build primer and block sanding. An Impala SS TJ saw parked at a pet store turned him to the color: Laser Blue Metallic. As the world turned, so did employment for this aerospace engineer. In 2005, he accepted an offer from Boeing in Wichita. After a slew of small-blocks, he thought he saw sparks from an LS arcing on the horizon. He grabbed an LQ4 and parted out the 383 stuff to fund the 6.0 junkyard jewel—ported heads, Lunati cam, Holley swap oil pan and motor mounts, headers, intake manifold, NOS plate, and Dominator ECU and harnesses. Prior to the winter of 2010-2011 TJ got hooked up with an episode of Pinks. Their rules forbade any coolant other than water cut slightly with antifreeze. Abnormal cold cracked the lifter valley, so in the 2013-2014 off-season, he went on the hunt gathering parts for a serious Brian Tooley-built 416-inch LS. 7/40 8/40 9/40 He also signed up for the 2014 Drag Week epic but had no desire to pull a trailer. He reclaimed trunk space, situating a Rick’s stainless tank with 450-l/hr in-tank pump under the floor. He wanted full-length tailpipes but the ARB Air Locker links occupied the space where they would pass over the rear axle. He fixed that with a UMI 1 3/8-inch under-axle bolt-in drag bar. He reworked the suspension with TRZ chrome-moly drag racing upper and lower control arms and TRZ billet steering arms (to improve bumpsteer), Viking double-adjustable coilovers, and Wilwood Dynalite brakes. Though he usually punches a Powerglide, for the Drag Week SR SB NA class (Street Race Small-Block Normally Aspirated) he put up a reverse-pattern, trans-brake-equipped Turbo 400. So how’d that trek transpire? Besides losing a tailshaft housing bushing on I-35 on Day Two and hurting a gearset on Day Four, he ended up finishing Fourth in SR SB NA with a five-day average of 10.97 at 121, set a personal NA best of 10.71 at 123.6 … and made several new hot rodding friends. Before closing the 2014 season, with the ’Glide back in, the Dyno Dynamics eddy current chassis rollers netted 530 horsepower on nuts and 755 on squeeze. 10/40 11/40 The fussin’ didn’t stop there. In 2015, with the car finally final, he ran a nitrous best of 9.62 at 140 on a relatively small shot. Then, at Street Legal Shootout in June, he set a new True Radial personal best of 10.75 at 138 on True Street hard-compound mud and snow rated Futura Super Sport 275/60 tires—not drag radials. He finished runner-up at that event. He attended a variety of local and regional street car gatherings, winning three or four Sunday Fundays to the tune of $1,000. But the ultimate achievement took place in Oklahoma City at the inaugural Outlaw Armageddon No Prep race and winning the Pure Street class, a new favorite trophy, and $1,600 to boot! (As of this writing, TJ has since hit the quarter-mile and upped the nitrous dose with a 250-shot and additional chassis tuning and was able to muster up the car’s best lap ever with a 9.24 e.t. at 146 mph.) 12/40 Tech Check Owner: TJ Johnson, Wichita, Kansas Vehicle: 1967 Malibu Engine Type: LS3 Displacement: 416 ci Compression Ratio: 11.3:1 Bore: 4.070 inches Stroke: 4.000 inches Cylinder Heads: LS9 Roto-cast, CNC-ported by Wegner Automotive, 2.165-inch LS3 lightweight intake valves, 1.590-inch LY9 Inconel exhaust valves Rotating Assembly: K1 forged crankshaft and lightweight H-beam rods, Wiseco pistons Valvetrain: 1.7:1 rocker arms, Brian Tooley Racing (BTR) lifters, 0.660-inch lift springs and 3/8x7.400-inch chrome-moly pushrods Camshaft: BTR-spec ground by Comp Cams (243/258-deg. duration at 0.050; 0.627/0.615-inch lift), Comp adjustable single-row timing gear, LS3 rocker covers Induction: Mast Motorsports CNC 4150LS3EFI intake manifold, Holley Billet 4150 1,000-cfm throttle body, Siemens Deka 60 lb/hr injectors, Edelbrock Pro-Flo air cleaner, NOS dry system, Nitrous Outlet 4150 Stinger plate, Rick’s Stainless tank, Walbro 450-l/hr in-tank pump, Holley billet Dominator bypass regulator Ignition: GM LS3 coils, Holley V2 Dominator ECU Exhaust: BRP/Muscle Rods headers, 2-inch primary pipes, 3.5-inch collectors (ceramic coated by Performance Coatings Plus (Joplin, MO)), Hooker X-pipe, 3-inch system, Hooker Aero Chamber mufflers, system built by Kevin’s American Muffler (Wichita, KS) Ancillaries: Holley 6-qt. oil pan modified for stroker clearance with baffle, All Star catch-can, LS3 alternator, rebuilt factory radiator, ported Melling oil pump, C6 Corvette water pump, SPAL fans Output: 533 rwhp on motor, 755 rwhp on juice Machine Work: Big Mike’s Speed & Performance, Darrel’s Automotive, Smith Auto Machine & Supply, Duane Saum Engineering Tuner: Wichita Dyno Drivetrain Transmission: TCI Auto flexplate, Trans Specialties Proline 5000 Powerglide maintained by Rick Bills, Neal Chance 5,100-stall 9-inch bolt-together converter, TSI Pro-Lite trans brake Rear Axle: Ford 9-inch w/ Strange Engineering S-Series carrier, billet pinion support, and 1350 yoke; Motive Gear 3.89:1 ratio; spool; Moser 33-spline axles; Motorsports Innovations driveshaft speed sensor/collar; Driveshaft Shop 3.25-inch carbon-fiber driveshaft Chassis Front Suspension: Stock spindles; TRZ upper and lower control arms, billet steering arms and bumpsteer kit; Viking double-adjustable coilovers (450 lb-in springs); six-point Holzman Racecars Chevelle main hoop; custom rear bars and door bars by Jamie Blubaugh (Augusta, KS) Rear Suspension: Hypercoil springs (125 lb-in), Viking double-adjustable shocks, Wolfe Racecraft adjustable spring perches, UMI double-adjustable upper and lower control arms and 1 3/8-inch under-axle antisway bar Brakes: Wilwood 12.19-inch rotors, Dynalite four-piston calipers front and rear; Chrysler-style master cylinder; Wilwood proportioning valve Wheels & Tires Wheels: Weld RTS 15x4 front, 15x9.33 rear Tires: M/T Sportsman S/R 26x6 front, Hoosier Quick Time Pro 28x11.5 rear Interior Upholstery: Scott Downey (front seats), Matt Baker (headliner), TJ Johnson (back seat cover) Material: PUI Interiors replacement vinyl, new foam Seats: Stock with G-Force five-point harness Steering: Factory wheel refurbished Dash: Factory gauge cluster Instrumentation: Shiftworks SS gauges; Holley air/fuel, fuel pressure, and Nitrous Works on A-pillar Audio: Original radio-delete plate HVAC: Windows down Exterior Bodywork: Bruce Philbrook (Maize, KS); finish work by Roger Bosley (formerly of Haysville, KS) Paint by: Roger Bosley Paint: PPG Laser Blue Metallic, DBS base, DBU clearcoat Hood: Goodmark steel 2-inch cowl Grille: YearOne repro Bumpers: YearOne repro MORE PHOTOS VIEW FULL GALLERY PHOTO GALLERY (40) X View Full Image Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Read the Article: COMMENTS Connect With Us Get Latest News and Articles.

ALSO READ UK tightens visa rules for techies Theresa May to visit India in November Theresa May: Women in power Trade deal seen dominating Theresa May's India visit 10 things to know about the British PM-to-be Theresa May In a rare departure from precedent, visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May will skip Bengaluru’s famous software companies. She will, instead, visit Dynamatics Technologies - an aerospace and hydraulic pumps manufacturer, which has three factories in the UK generating jobs there - when she visits Bengaluru on Tuesday.  While Dynamatics, founded by Udayant Malhoutra, doesn’t have the brand name of an Infosys or a Wipro, the company is a respected supplier of systems for Boeing and Airbus, besides Hindustan Aeronautics. It ranks among the world’s largest suppliers of hydraulic pumps and also has built a model of generating local jobs in the UK, while offshoring work to India.  Over the past two decades, successive British PMs such as John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron have made it a point to visit campuses of Infosys or Wipro in Bengaluru and interact with young software engineers. Blair became the first foreign country leader to start his visit outside Delhi from Bengaluru, during the peak of the India-Pakistan standoff in January 2002. Other leaders have used the visit to software campuses in Bengaluru to boost their local image such as Japanese Prime Minister Yashiro Mori, whose ratings among young Japanese shored after he played golf in the mini golf course at Infosys. For May, however, the trip is different. Her conservative government has already pledged to reduce migrants into the UK, a promise that helped Brexit happen. So, her decision to skip software companies on November 8 in Bengaluru comes after her government moved to tighten visa rules, making it difficult for Indian information technology professionals to work in the UK. The visa rules have set higher threshold for salaries and tougher language norms for family members of visa holders.  India’s software sector, which is struggling for growth, is miffed. The restrictions will further hurt the sector, which generates 20 per cent of the $108-billion software exports revenue from the UK. Software lobby group Nasscom (National Association of Software and Services Companies) has already warned the move of restricting working professionals would backfire and restrict the growth and productivity of the economy of the UK. “The broader sentiment is the move by the UK is not pro-outsourcing. It is very inward-looking and veering towards protectionism,” says Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and chief executive officer of Greyhound Research.  May’s visit to a local aerospace systems supplier is also seen as the UK’s strategy to pursue new defence deals. India, among the world’s top importers of defence equipment, is already the biggest buyer of Hawk advanced jet trainers outside the UK.  “Defence is a strong area for the UK in India. That is an area they would pursue aggressively and May’s visit aligns with their goals in defence,” said an industry official, requesting not to be identified.

The manufacturer has identified a “limited number” of parts closely related to one used by American that had a "material anomaly," according to the letter sent on Friday. All but one of the parts are now out of service, GE said in the letter. It added that it was working with the single airline with an aircraft still equipped with the part to ensure its removal from service. GE did not name the airline. A company spokesman, Rick Kennedy, confirmed that GE had sent the letter and said it was still in the early stage of an "intense investigation." On Oct. 28, American Airlines Flight 383 from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an "uncontained" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through the aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured. An American Airlines spokesman said none of the company's aircraft in operation had the additional parts that GE referred to in the letter. The spokesman added that American was turning over a part from an engine not in operation to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for further examination. U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for last week's incident. However, they said on Friday that a so-called stage 2 disk in the engine showed what appeared to be cracking. The disk's corrupted material likely indicated a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker, said Jim Hall, a former NTSB chairman. In its letter, GE stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s. GE will update engine operators if action is later required, the letter said. Bloomberg earlier reported news of the letter from GE.

The manufacturer has identified a "limited number" of parts closely related to one used by American that had a "material anomaly," according to the letter sent on Friday. All but one of the parts are now out of service, GE said in the letter. It added that it was working with the single airline with an aircraft still equipped with the part to ensure its removal from service. GE did not name the airline and a company spokesman did not immediately comment. On Oct. 28, American Airlines Flight 383 from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an "uncontained" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through the aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured. An American Airlines spokesman said none of the company's aircraft in operation had the additional parts that GE referred to in the letter. The spokesman added that American was turning over a part from an engine not in operation to the U.S. National Transportation Saftey Board (NTSB) for further examination. U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for last week's incident. However, they said on Friday that a so-called stage 2 disk in the engine showed what appeared to be cracking. The disk's corrupted material likely indicated a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker, said Jim Hall, a former NTSB chairman. In its letter, GE stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s. GE will update engine operators if action is later required, the letter said. Bloomberg earlier reported news of the letter from GE.

Inslee Signs Supplemental Operating Budget, Vetoes Several Provisions News The Green Sheet– March 7, 2016 Caroline Halter and WSW Staff | Washington State Wire Features March 7, 2016 Alas, the last week of the 2016 Legislative Regular Session is finally here. Although it was short, it wasn’t exactly sweet. Tensions ran high this year, between the ongoing investigation of the Department of Corrections by the Senate, the surprise firing of now former-Secretary of Transportation, Lynn Peterson (also by the Senate) and the transgender restroom fiasco. We also saw the introduction of two controversial Initiatives–a carbon tax and the minimum wage. The Carbon Tax Initiative, I-732, has generated surprising opposition, not just from the business community but even the State Democratic Party and other major environmental groups.  Meanwhile,the Washington Business Alliance has quietly been working on an alternative, a 732B, which if passed would also appear on the ballot in November.  There is growing support for this draft but time seems to be running out.  In a meeting last week at the Association of Washington Business with key industry leads, even the Governor’s staff were receptive to working on an alternative. The timing on the Governor’s decision to temporarily pull his Clean Air Rule is seen by many as an attempt to clear the way for an I-732B.  While some would prefer to take the path of least resistance and let I-732 fail at the ballot, others urge action, saying that if they don’t act now they’ll end up with a much more onerous carbon tax or cap and trade solution. On Saturday the campaign for at $13.50 statewide minimum wage kicked off. In anticipation, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders endorsed the initiative via Twitter. Adding to the momentum, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed a new minimum wage into law last week, guaranteeing $14.75 for Portland and $13.50 for the rest of the state. In the midst of two liberal initiatives, it’s easy to forget that conservatives groups have this tool at their disposal as well. Let’s not forget that the infamous Tim Eyman initiative, which would have made it more difficult to raise taxes in Washington State. It was struck down by the state’s Supreme Court, spurring identical resolutions from Senate Republicans, none of which passed. A group called Just Want Privacy filed an initiative that would do the same thing that a few Republican lawmakers attempted to do during the session: repeal a Human Rights Commission Ruling regarding gender identity and choice of restroom and/or locker room facility. Initiatives aside, this week is about passing a budget…maybe. The supplemental budgets passed by each house differ by more than $400 million in overall spending. In an interview with Austin Jenkins Representative Hans Dunshee, D-Snohomish, said “For us it might be better to just stay with the existing budget and leave.” It may be easy for Dunshee to walk away empty-handed, seeing as he’ll be joining the Snohomish County Council rather than running for reelection. But, his fellow Democrats won’t get off the hook so easily. There is pressure for them to get funding for things like homelessness and raise teacher salaries. House Democrats proposed tapping the rainy day fund. They also want to increase revenue by closing a series of tax loopholes. What do Republicans want? A modest increase in spending that includes money for charter schools, and to send a message to the Supreme Court by refusing to pay the fine imposed at the end of last session. What do both sides want? To go home on time. Lawmakers are still hungover from last session, which lasted a whopping 176 days, making it the longest in our state’s history.  Lawmakers have penciled a few laws this session, but they still have some key issues to work through. Will the Voting Rights Act pass? Charter schools? Ban on Flame Retardants? Boeing tax exemptions? The law enforcement pension merger? The preservation tax exemption for affordable housing? What about the police body camera bill?Tune in this week to see what happens. Quotes: Here’s Senator Bruce Dammeier, R-Puyallup, responding to Representative Dunshee’s comments (see above) about the budget: “The House budget, besides spending $500 million more, is kind of does it have that fiscal discipline going out four years. And that’s a big philosophical difference.” State Auditor Troy Kelley’s criminal-defense lawyer said this at a pretrial hearing last Friday: “This case started as a political attack, and once the FBI got it, it became a high-profile political corruption case.” “Policy without money is not policy,” said Representative Dunshee during a House Appropriations Committee hearing on February 29th. “We have finally come to a bill that addresses almost every single concern we have heard except for one — that is the ability to make the bill actually mean something. Some Republicans continue to tell us they are worried about the right to use the courts to determine whether or not the solutions that are agreed upon actually address polarized voting and meet the criteria of the federal Voting Rights Act.” That was Senator Pramila Jayapa, D-Seattle, speaking on the tenuous legislation.

Sandeep Unnithan  Follow @SandeepUnnithan   sandy@intoday.com November 2, 2016 | UPDATED 13:06 IST A +A - An Embraer ERJ-145 with the DRDO developed AEW&C radar at Aero India 2015 in Bangalore. In the murky world of arms deals which thrives on stealth and shady wire transfers, the document filed before a US court probably came as a blast of bright, blinding sunshine. In a 59-page deferred prosecution agreement in the US district court in Florida on October 24, Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer confessed it was guilty of paying bribes to bag aircraft contracts across the world. The agreement, a copy of which is with India Today, painstakingly details how Embraer paid $5.76 million in 2009 to an Indian arms agent identified in the document only as 'Agent D'. The bribes were to swing a $200 million deal for the sale of three Embraer ERJ-145 jets. These twin-engined aircraft were to be customised for India to fit an indigenous Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) radar. The path to the doorstep of the US district court in Florida was a long one. It began in 2010 when US authorities suspected irregularities in the sale of aircraft by Embraer to the Dominican Republic. The allegations gathered steam in 2013 when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first detailed kickbacks paid by the Sao Paulo-based aircraft manufacturer to bag contracts in several countries including India. The October 24 agreement essentially means that Embraer is free to carry on its business after paying the hefty $205 million in fines to US authorities. An October 24 statement released by the Sao Paulo-based aircraft conglomerate, expressed 'deep regrets' for its conduct, acknowledged responsibility for the conduct of its employees and agents according to the facts ascertained in the investigation. Click here to Enlarge The fraud section of the US department of justice moved against the Brazilian airplane maker in 2013. US laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 1977, which prohibits bribery of foreign nationals apply to US-registered companies like Embraer which trade shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The ripples of the global bribery scandal, from which Embraer made an $83 million profit, have already begun to be felt in India. The CBI registered a preliminary inquiry in September this year when a Brazilian newspaper first reported the bribery investigations. The CBI now believes Agent D is Delhi-based defence consultant Vipin Khanna, 87. On October 18, the agency registered a case against the octogenarian defence agent for receiving bribes in the aircraft purchase. This means the Union ministry of defence could place further dealings with the Brazilian jet maker on hold unless the ministry notifies a new debarment policy that lays the ground rules for dealing with bribe-giving defence firms (see box: Blacklist Policy Paralysis). "The CBI investigation will proceed according to Indian laws on corruption, kickbacks etc. subject to appropriate evidence," a defence ministry spokesperson said. BLACKLIST POLICY PARALYSIS For over two years now, the NDA government has toyed with a debarment policy which would punish bribe-giving defence companies without hurting defence preparedness. The effects of blacklists on Bofors and HDW after the bribery scandal of the mid-1980s have lethally impacted India's defence preparedness for nearly three decades. Over a dozen defence suppliers have been blacklisted in the past decade. Finance minister Arun Jaitley, who held the defence portfolio earlier, summed it up in August 2014. Blacklisting, he said, "upholds consideration of probity but narrows our buying options...which can affect our security preparedness". In 2014, the MoD initiated a nuanced suspension and debarment policy which, rather than an outright ban, looked at a graded response to allegations (see box: Three-Stage Debarment Policy). A blacklist was the last resort, only after allegations of bribery are established by the CBI. Even so, the MoD and Service HQ retained the right to deal with the tainted firm in the name of national security. A draft of the policy has been pending with defence minister Manohar Parrikar for close to a year now. The MoD is believed to have scrapped a proposal to legalise defence agents in arms sales. The delay in approving the debarment policy has resulted in anxiety within the forces. The policy was supposed to be released with the Defence Procurement Policy (DPP) in March this year, but held back. In fact, the DPP mentions it at least a dozen times. Blacklists continue to impact the military machine that already imports nearly 70 per cent of its defence requirements. They shrink an already limited space of equipment suppliers. The navy's new Scorpene class submarines, for instance, do not have torpedoes because the torpedo maker belongs to the Leonardo-Finmeccanica firm, one of whose subsidiaries is accused in the 2010 VVIP helicopter purchase scandal. Major democratic military powers like the US have elaborate suspension and debarment procedures, which balance considerations of probity and integrity with national security. In the deferred prosecution agreement, authorities included a simple formula for assessing Embraer's guilt. The calculations clinically weigh various factors- the complicity of senior officials and the company's contrition-before arriving at the figure of 205 million dollars. "India has not been able to strike such a balance due to inappropriate policies," says Vivek Rae, former DG (acquisitions) in the defence ministry. "The Indian political and bureaucratic establishment likes to occupy the moral high ground at the slightest whiff of corruption, overlooking the fact it might be compromising national security. There are various options for penalising rogue companies. Blacklisting need not be the default option." Defence ministry sources say a Defence Acquisition Committee meeting, slated for November 7, will take a final call on the debarment policy. But as with several recent meetings, it remains to be seen if the policy actually gets approved.   THE SLEAZE TRAIL Embraer first touched down in India in 2004 when the Indian Air Force's Palam-based communications squadron bought three ECJ 135 business jets (a fourth jet was purchased by the home ministry for the Border Security Force). The aircraft, meant for use by the defence minister and the service chiefs, quickly set new standards in comfort. One UPA-era defence minister, who moved out to another ministry, insisted on still being able to use the business jet. By 2015, the Brazilian firm was the world's third largest airplane maker after Boeing and Airbus. The company delivered 215 jets last year, with a year-on-year growth of 6.3 per cent and an order backlog of $22.5 billion. A vein of corruption however ran through some of the deals for military aircraft as the documents filed before the US court show. Sometime in January 2005, soon after its maiden foray into India, Embraer signed an agency agreement with a shell company domiciled in the UK and affiliated with Agent D. Under the agency agreement, Embraer agreed to pay the shell company 9 per cent of the value of any defence contract. According to the deferred prosecution agreement, "Embraer believed that Agent D could help ensure that any contract would be awarded on single-source rather than competitive basis". Embraer, of course, knew the agreement with the agent was illegal under Indian law and thus took steps to conceal its existence. The sole fully-executed version of the agreement was placed in a safe deposit box in London. It could be opened only when both an Embraer employee and Agent D or his associate were present. This also explains the even greater lengths the firm was to go to mask the eventual bribes to Agent D. The money trail passed through Switzerland and was routed through a shell company in Singapore which paid the Indian agents. India's defence ministry bans middlemen and the payment of commissions in defence deals. Companies have to sign a pre-tender integrity pact where they expressly state they have not paid money to manipulate the contract. On February 8, 2005, Embraer announced that it had signed an MoU with the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) to supply new early warning aircraft for the IAF. These had the same engines and airframe as the jets sold to the IAF's VVIP squadron. The MoU with the DRDO, Embraer believed, could result in securing a contract for an initial sale of three ERJ-145 aircraft. The DRDO, at the time, was on a global hunt for long-range business jets on which it could mount an indigenously developed airborne radar-the Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AEW&C). The AEW&C radar, mounted on the aircraft fuselage, could monitor enemy aircraft and cruise missiles up to 250 km. Part of a Rs 2,500 crore DRDO programme, the contract was a lucrative one. IAF staff requirements called for 12 such aircraft to patrol its air frontiers with Pakistan and China. "AEW&C aircraft are the key to offensive air operations," says Air Marshal P.S. Ahluwalia (retired), former C-in-C, Western Air Command. "They are eyes in the sky which can see anything airborne over 200 km across the western and eastern borders. This means, I don't have to put all my fighters up in the air. It increases our choices and we don't need to waste resources on air defence operations." Between 2005 and 2006, Delhi-based NRI Vipin Khanna and his sons Arvind and Aditya were hitting the news with unnerving frequency. And for all the wrong reasons. First, it was the 2005 Volcker report which found that India's then external affairs minister Natwar Singh used his position to lobby Iraqi ministers in the 'oil-for-food' scandal. Singh had lobbied Iraqi officials to do business with companies linked with his son Jagat Singh and a relative, Aditya Khanna, the son of Vipin Khanna. An FIR filed by the CBI in October 2006 found Arvind Khanna, then a Congress party MLA, to be the recipient of remittances from Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) for the sale in 2000 of Barak-1 missiles to India. Others charged in the Rs 1,150 crore deal included former defence minister George Fernandes and arms agent Suresh Nanda (the CBI closed the case in 2013 for lack of evidence). Meanwhile, on July 3, 2008, Embraer hit pay dirt. The IAF agreed to purchase three aircraft from Embraer for approximately $208 million. The very next day, on July 4, 2008, the US documents say, Agent D contacted Embraer and demanded he be paid the agreed-upon commission. The dispute over the commission continued for some months. Sometime in early 2009, an Embraer executive met with lawyers representing Agent D and agreed to pay $5.76 million to settle the claim. To conceal the payment, Embraer created a false agency agreement, a common ruse among recent defence kickbacks. On November 21, 2009, Embraer, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, ECC Investment Switzerland AG, executed an agency agreement with a shell company domiciled in Singapore. This shell company was affiliated with Agent D for its purported services as an agent in a sale made to another country. (The US court document does not specify the country or the sale). The agreement was executed on the same day. The Singaporean shell company delivered three invoices to ECC, each for $1.92 million. These invoices had nothing to do with the aircraft sale to the IAF. Embraer, through ECC Investment Switzerland, remitted three payments to the shell company shortly thereafter. Embraer's books and records did not reflect that this transaction was related to its agreement with Agent D. All three aircraft were delivered to the DRDO by 2011. The agency hopes to complete the programme by next year and hand the aircraft over to the IAF. Highly-placed sources in Delhi say that Vipin Khanna was nothing more than a front for the deal. The deal, they say, was most likely executed by his London-based son, Aditya. The Khanna family did not respond to e-mails and calls for comment. The Embraer scandal is only the newest among a clutch of UPA-era defence scandals to tumble out of the closet. On October 31, the BBC and The Guardian detailed how their investigation had found that UK-based aircraft engine firm Rolls Royce had made secret payments of 10 million pounds to firms linked to UK-based arms agent Sudhir Choudhrie. The payments were linked to the sales of the Hawk trainer aircraft purchased by India from the UK-based BAE systems in two tranches-66 jets in 2004 and 57 jets in 2010. On October 17, the Delhi police registered a case under the Official Secrets Act against defence consultant Sanjay Bhandari for possessing classified MoD documents. Bhandari's name has been linked to other defence deals too signed during the UPA era. The CBI is already investigating alleged bribery in the 2010 purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters from a British subsidiary of Italian defence conglomerate Leonardo-Finmeccanica. Over the next few days, CBI officials are likely to fan out across the world, from the United States where the case was registered, to Embraer's headquarters in Sao Paulo. CBI investigators will issue Letters Rogatory requesting foreign courts to cooperate with their investigation as they follow the money trail from New York to London, Switzerland and Singapore. More important, CBI sleuths will have to establish the last mile connect in the bribe chain: that Embraer's payoffs to the Indian middleman were in turn used to bribe officials in India. It is an arduous international trail, one familiar to investigators in arms bribery scandals from Bofors in the 1980s to the Barak missile scam in 2006. Very little of promise comes out even after decades of investigation. "The Embraer bribery case too will meet a similar fate," predicts former CBI director Joginder Singh. "How will the CBI get the evidence? The law does not recognise depositions made before Indian policemen and foreign nationals have no incentive to come and depose before an Indian court." Ajay Agnihotri, former chief commissioner, customs and central excise, blames the CBI's lack of specialists as the root cause of their inability to book cases in arms deals. "The CBI is manned by IPS officers who're clueless about banking and finance matters which is what these bribery cases are about." But with the culpability of the company proven and much of the graft trail and agents out in the open, this time the CBI has little recourse but to seek some semblance of successful closure.   Follow the writer on Twitter @SandeepUnnithan     For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in. ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.     # Embraer# Embraer deal# India# CBI# DRDO# IAF# Emraer bribery scandal   Recommended Watch Right Now Top Takes NEWS INDIA WORLD PHOTOS CRICKET MOVIES AUTO SPORTS LIFESTYLE TECH EDUCATION BUSINESS SITEMAP Copyright © 2016 Living Media India Limited.

The incident happened on October 25, when the unidentified aircraft, belonging to the Air National Guard, took off from Selfridge Base near Detroit, Michigan, and lost the bombs on its way to Camp Grayling training center, the website Military.com reported. The munitions, including six bombs and a missile, were later found in a wooded area near Luzerne. Nobody was injured, according to the report. Military officials blamed the incident on a mechanical failure. No more details were disclosed in this regard. Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Trumble, director of the Camp Grayling Air Gunnery Range, downplayed the incident, saying such mishaps were “rare.” According to the Michigan Air National Guard, the missile was non-explosive and did not pose any threats.It was not clear if the bombs were operational. The force only said that it was able to locate them by activating a smoke mechanism that allows pilots to track the bombs when they fall. In another accident involving military aircraft, a US Air Force KC-10 Extender air tanker lost its refueling boom during an exercise over the state of Idaho on Tuesday.  A Boeing KC-10 Extender air tanker stretches its boom to refuel an F-22 Raptor fighter jet. The aircraft, which belonged to the 60th Air Mobility Wing based at Travis Air Force Base, California, made an emergency landing after the mishap. Nobody was injured in that incident either. The Extender can carry more than 356,000 pounds [178 tons] of fuel in its six tanks and is capable of delivering fuel at a maximum rate of 1,100 gallons [4163 liters] per minute.         Tweet More by Special Correspondent RELATED NEWS January 27, 2016 Indian fighter jet accidentally drops 5 bombs in Rajasthan July 07, 2015 Iraq jet accidentally bombs Baghdad, killing eight March 03, 2014 US Navy jet crashes during training October 02, 2011, 4:24 pm Yemeni jet mistakenly bombs army post, kills 30 MORE IN INTERNATIONAL November 15, 2016, 8:40 pm Twitter rolls out tool to curb online abuse, bullying November 15, 2016, 8:15 pm Integrate or face populist fury, London mayor warns November 15, 2016, 8:09 pm Hundreds return to Turkish city after eight-month curfew November 15, 2016, 7:57 pm Spike in murders seen after Florida self-defense law: study Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus TODAY'S POPULAR Most Viewed | Most Commented ‘Will represent other country if Pakistan doesn’t give ...

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Aerospace Industry Adoption of SPD-Smart Electronically Dimmable Windows Highlights 2016 NBAA Trade Show ORLANDO, FL–(Marketwired – November 04, 2016) – The trend towards increasing adoption of SPD-Smart electronically dimmable windows (EDWs) for aircraft was evident at this week’s National Business Aviation Association Convention and Exhibition in Orlando, Florida. Aircraft at the show’s static display, mockups on the show floor, and public statements in the media, all point towards the industry’s growing recognition of EDWs as a mature solution for the challenges inherent in controlling light, glare, heat and noise in aircraft cabins. Business aviation and commercial aviation share the goal of improving the passenger experience, and this need has opened new horizons in cabin innovations. One such innovation is SPD EDW systems. Passengers, at the touch of a button, can instantly and precisely control the amount of daylight and glare coming through their window. They continue to enjoy views by tinting their SPD-Smart EDW to control the amount of light to a comfortable level, rather than blocking their view with a shade. SPD EDW systems offer the aerospace industry a potent and unique solution to improving how passengers feel while in flight, by managing the ideal level of daylight in the cabin — as well as offering a cooler, quieter cabin. Textron Beechcraft: King Air 350i, King Air 250, and King Air C90GTx SPD-Smart EDWs, supplied by Research Frontiers licensee InspecTech Aero Service, are standard equipment on all three models of Beechcraft King Airs: King Air 350i, King Air 250, and King Air C90GTx. Two models of King Airs were at this week’s NBAA show. InspecTech is now shipping their “iShade” brand of SPD-Smart EDWs for all three models, and King Airs with the new interiors are now being delivered to customers. Honda Aircraft Company: HondaJet HA-420 SPD-Smart EDWs, supplied by Research Frontiers licensee Vision Systems, are standard equipment on the HondaJet HA-420. A HondaJet demonstrator aircraft was on display at this week’s NBAA show. Vision Systems is now shipping their “Nuance” brand of SPD-Smart EDWs for the HondaJet. Deliveries of the HondaJet to customers began in December of 2015. Dassault Aviation: Falcon 5X SPD-Smart skylights, supplied by Vision Systems, have been selected as standard equipment on the upcoming Dassault Falcon 5X. At this week’s NBAA, a mockup of this aircraft was on display. To offer business aviation’s first skylight, Dassault was faced with a critical need to manage the intense solar light, glare and heat coming into the cabin, and SPD-Smart EDW technology provide the solution. At the NBAA, the media reported that Dassault is confident that the Falcon 5X will be ready for service entry in 2020. Bell Helicopter: 525 and 429 VIP helicopters SPD-Smart EDWs are offered on the Bell Helicopter 429 VIP. Deliveries of this model, with the new interior, was announced by Bell as beginning in March of this year. Passengers control the SPD-Smart EDWs using their own smart devices, which connect to the internal Wi-Fi in the aircraft. SPD-Smart EDWs are also to be offered on the upcoming VIP Model 525. Bell hopes to certify this super-medium rotorcraft in late 2017 or early 2018. At this week’s NBAA, this model, with SPD-Smart EDWs, was launched at the booth of Bell Helicopter. Epic Aircraft: E1000 At this week’s NBAA, a mockup of the Epic E1000 aircraft, with SPD-Smart EDWs, was exhibited. EDWs are standard equipment on the upcoming E1000 — the company now expects that certification is expected in the summer of 2017, with deliveries to begin shortly thereafter. The status of the E1000 was covered by the media at the show: here is an example. The E1000 uses carbon fiber composite material in the airframe, and as a result larger, and a greater number, of passenger windows are possible. These windows presented a light, glare and heat challenge, however SPD-Smart technology provides the elegant solution. Survey on EDWs replacing window shades Further evidence of the industry’s growing recognition of EDWs as a mature solution for the challenges inherent in controlling light, glare, heat and noise in aircraft cabins can be seen in a recent survey. The publication Business Jet Interiors International recently conducted a survey with the question: “Will ‘smart’ glass ever fully replace window shades?” 69% of respondents indicated “Yes.” Lufthansa Technik and Mercedes interior for VIP aircraft At the NBAA this week, an example of the industry’s movement towards EDWs as a solution to a myriad of cabin comfort challenges was Lufthansa Technik and Mercedes presenting the final version of their next-generation interior design for private jets having the size of Airbus and Boeing aircraft. The early design concept, revealed in 2015, has evolved to meet the requirements of airworthiness and certification. A unique use of EDWs are under evaluation for this interior, and the EDW feature has been widely reported in the media: here is an example. Airbus Corporate Jets: Melody interior Another example of the trend towards EDW adoption was seen this week in NBAA show media reports about Airbus Corporate Jet’s “Melody” cabin concept, for future customers of the ACJ320neo family of aircraft. These reports indicate inclusion of EDWs that can control the amount of natural light entering the cabin. Please read this article for an example. Vision Systems at 2016 NBAA Vision Systems showcased an array of SPD-Smart EDWs at NBAA, including its new “Acti-Vision” product which incorporates an interactive transparent display in the EDW, products that combine SPD EDWs with traditional shades, and EDW solutions for the cockpit. The media covered Vision Systems at the show, and here is an example (go to page 10). The comfort and benefits an SPD-Smart EDW system delivers extends to all passengers. Cabin-wide control, operated either automatically with photosensors, or manually by the crew, can result in the optimum level of daylight present throughout the cabin at all times. Benefits include greater daylighting, enhanced views, and a more open feeling resulting in greater perceived space. The management and “harvesting” of healthy daylighting instantly transforms the cabin, and synergistically complements other cabin systems including interior mood lighting systems and entertainment systems, for an unequalled passenger experience. Aircraft windows are a primary path of other environmental elements entering an aircraft cabin through the window opening — heat and noise. These unwanted elements — cabin heat while the aircraft is at the gate or on the taxiway, and cabin noise during the entire flight — are well known to cause passengers discomfort, fatigue, jet lag and other physical and psychological ailments. SPD EDW systems provide remarkable thermal and acoustic insulation, further improving the passenger experience for all. Coupled with the superior daylight management benefits, as an integrated system it is the complete solution for managing the environmental challenges outside conditions inflict on the cabin interior.

Air India Express, which introduced flights between Kolkata and Singapore four days a week, will have Singapore Airlines and Druk Air for company on these two days. Singapore Arilines flies daily, while Druk Air operates three times a week. With the introduction of the AI Express flights, capacity in the sector will increase to 2,870 seats a week — an addition of 756 seats. There are indications though that the capacity may double in a couple of years as Singapore Airlines introduces a larger aircraft and AI Express, as well as Druk Air, hikes frequency. On Friday, AI Express CEO K Shyam Sunder said the airline would explore flights to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Yangon, Dubai and Kathmandu as well. "We are restarting operations from Kolkata to Singapore and Dhaka but have plans to fly out to more destinations in Southeast Asia once we increase our fleet from 23 planes to 36 in two years. All the additional planes will be taken on lease," he said. Of the current fleet, 17 are owned by the airline and the remaining six, including the one that will operate flights from Kolkata to Singapore and Dhaka, are on lease. On the domestic route, AI Express plans to start a flight between Kolkata and Kochi. Singapore Airlines, which has a daily flight in conjunction with sister carrier Silk Air, will hike its capacity in a couple of years when it replaces the ageing A330 fleet with the new generation Boeing 787 10X, the super-stretched version of the Dreamliner. In the domestic sector, Jet Airways has introduced the A330 on the Kolkata-Delhi route, replacing the Boeing 737-800 to add capacity. Speaking to TOI on the occasion of the airline completing 30 years of operation to Kolkata, India GM David Lim said the carrier hopes to bring in the B787-10X aircraft in a couple of years. The airline has ordered 30 planes from Boeing Co of US in addition to 67 Airbus 350. "Six A350s have arrived and will replace the A330. These will be put into service in Delhi and Mumbai connections next year," he said. The A350 will have a configuration of 42 business, 24 premium economy and 187 economy seats. The configuration of the B 787-10X is yet to be finalized, but it will be able to seat up to 310 passengers. From October to December, and again from April to June, when traffic in the sector increases, the 285-seater Singapore Airlines A330 plies on four days and the 162-seater Silk Air B737-800 plies on three days. The rest of the year, it is three days of Singapore Airlines and four days of Silk Air operations. While fliers who take Druk Air or AI Express will primarily be holidayers to Singapore or traffic from corporates, half of those who take Singapore Airlines or Silk Air fly onward to Australia, New Zealand, Japan or the US west coast.

The general manager for Indonesia for Turkish Airlines, Mehmet F. Gurulkan cited the growth of air traffic demand in Indonesia as prompting the decision to add Bali as their second Indonesian destination. Mehmet declined to comment further or reveal the commencement date, days of operation, timing and equipment to be used while the new route remains under discussion with Indonesian authorities. Turkish Airlines commenced direct flights between Istanbul and Jakarta in early 2016, averaging load factors of 85% to 90% using Boeing 777 on a daily flight schedule.

Secret Service agents rushed Trump offstage in Reno after they determined a protester in the audience might pose a threat him. As the agents removed the Republican presidential candidate, authorities quickly wrestled Austyn Crites, 33, to the ground in the front of the crowd. As early details of the ordeal were being reported, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr retweeted a post on Twitter shared by special projects director at Citizens for Trump, Jack Prosobiec that suggested Trump had survived a murder attempt. 'Hillary ran away from rain today. Trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attempt,' Posobiec tweeted.  Scroll down for video  After Donald Trump was quickly hustled off a stage during a rally in Nevada amid a security scare, his son Donald Trump Jr (pictured in Nevada on Thursday) was quick to retweet claiming Saturday's skirmish was an 'assassination attempt' The tweet was originally posted by special projects director at Citizens for Trump, Jack Prosobiec but was later retweeted by Donald Trump Jr (above) The younger Trump also retweeted a claim early on as details were coming in that that someone in the crowd reportedly pulled a gun Donald Trump Jr retweeted the message along with Trump campaign social media director Dan Scavino Jr also retweeted the post calling the incident an assassination attempt. The Secret Service said they never found a weapon and called the fracas 'a commotion' in a statement. News reporters and others on social media were quick to call out Prosobiec and others who described the incident as an assassination attempt or attempted murder. 'ATTENTION: Using phrase "assassination attempt" abt #Trump #Reno = RECKLESS & FLAT WRONG. Listen to @SecretService NO GUN "COMMOTION,' Major Garrett, Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News, tweeted.  Secret Service agents rushed Trump off the stage during a campaign rally in Reno on Saturday after they determined a protester in the audience might pose a threat to him 'Trump's social media director + his son tweeted about an "assassination attempt." That was obviously inaccurate,' Jose A DelReal, national political reporter for the Washington Post wrote. While introducing Trump ahead of his rally in later on Saturday in Denver, one of the speakers also described the incident as an attempted murder. 'You attack him every time, thinking he raises a speech of hate,' Mohana said. 'Tonight I think, the hate [that a] lot of [the] media raised against him caused an attempt of murder against him in Nevada.' A senior Trump campaign official told DailyMail.com that Crites, whom rally-goers already identified as an anti-Trump protester, caused a panic when he reached into his waistband. News reporters and others on social media were quick to call out Prosobiec and others who described the incident as an assassination attempt or attempted murder, including Major Garrett, Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News  Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for the Guardian, also made note that Posobiec had called the incident an assassination attempt Jose A DelReal, national political reporter for the Washington Post tweeted that Posobiec had inaccurately described the incident At that point, the campaign official said, a voice called out: 'He's got a gun!' Trump's protective detail sprang into action, pulling him offstage as a sea of bodies scattered, screams rang out and authorities dragged Crites away as he kicked and strained.  One witness told DailyMail.com that a holstered gun was spotted on the hip of a plainclothes officer, adding to the confusion.   Just before the fracas, Trump could be seen shielding his eyes from the lights in order to peer into the crowd as a struggle broke out.  Three agents then stormed the stage and hustled the Republican presidential candidate away.    Crites, who has since been released, appeared on local newscasts saying he had merely been holding a sign that read 'Republicans Against Trump.'  Secret Service agents rushed Donald trump offstage on Saturday evening in Reno, Nevada after they determined that a protester in the audience posed a threat to the Republican presidential candidate Security personnel rush off stage after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was escorted away during a rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno, Nevada on Saturday When he reached into his waistband, however, police and good Samaritans took the man down. The crowd surged backward in fright and strained against metal barriers enclosing the press section.  Witness Donald Newton, 45, of California who was in the crowd at the time, said he was next to Crites, who he said was holding a sign and started heading toward the stage. 'He had something on his belly. I don't know what it was,' Newton told the Reno Gazette-Journal.  'Somebody yelled "gun" and everyone jumped on him. My friend put his knee on his head, but he kept getting up.' Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed the man from the rally on Saturday. He has since been identified as 33-year-old Austyn Crites At this time a motive is not clear. Authorities placed the man in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump's motorcade and the press vehicles were staged Austyn Crites, 33, (pictured) was detained by Secret Service after trying to raise a flag that read 'Republicans Against Trump' when someone yelled 'gun' causing a panic during the rally Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed Crites and placed him in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump's motorcade and the press vehicles were staged. SWAT officers with high-powered rifles guarded the entrance to the restroom while reporters milled outside. Television footage showed the white male suspect pinioned on the ground by officers and searched, before he was led away from the convention center.  Crites told the Guardian that he was terrified how the crowd responded during the chaotic moment. 'I was in survival mode. I knew I could die at that moment,' Crites told the Guardian. Crites was punched and kicked, and his neck was placed in a chokehold, he said. At one point someone in the crowed even grabbed his testicles as he feared for his life. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next ¿I don¿t care about Trump¿s sex life¿: Cheating on Melania...

Share this article Share 816 shares Police officers and U.S. Secret Service rush a man in handcuffs out of the rally on Saturday Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued Crites identifies as a Republican who supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to his Facebook page.  While he is a Republican, he has a couple of posts on his Facebook with Clinton's logo and an American flag with the words, 'Nevada Republicans proudly voting for Secretary Clinton.' 'I understand that this election has people torn, but we must chose HOPE over HATE,' one post appearing on his Facebook page read. Later on Saturday he wrote a post on his Facebook, which was slammed with negative comments and appears to have since been taken down, recounting Saturday's ordeal.  'Hi all, Not sure if you saw the news today, but I was beat up at a Trump rally for holding a sign and falsely accused of having a gun. I am ok and have been released,' Crites wrote. 'I have NO connection to the Clinton campaign apart from me supporting her HOPE over Trump’s HATE.' 'I have canvassed for her for about 3 hours, have contributed to her campaign, and voted for her.' Later on Saturday he wrote a post on his Facebook, which was slammed with negative comments and appears to have since been taken down, recounting Saturday's ordeal 'Though I do not agree with many of Hillary’s policies, we cannot allow a fascist/dictator to take our beloved freedoms to simply boost his ego and “get back” at anyone who disagrees,' he continued. 'Take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incident of violence – against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign.  'I am a Republican and cannot support Trump and his decisive rhetoric. This election cycle we all know what we need to do. PLEASE STAND UP WITH ME AND STOP TRUMP!’ The Secret Service said a thorough investigation into the incident is ongoing.   A short time after the fracas, Trump returned onstage and addressed the audience as he continued his rally speech, appearing unrattled by the scuffle and spoke with his usual self-confidence. 'Nobody said it was going to be easy for us,' he declared. 'But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped.' 'I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.' Trump had spotted the protester and described him as a Hillary Clinton supporter before asking security to 'take him out.' As he returned to his speech, he thanked a group of fans near the stage who had stepped in to subdue his would-be attacker. Just before the fracas, Trump could be seen shielding his eyes from the lights in order to peer into the crowd as a struggle broke out Police officers stand guard backstage after Trump was hustled off the stage by security agents 'You were amazing, fellas,' he said. 'I saw what you were doing. That's a tough group of people right there... Nobody messes with our people, right?' Secret Service agents escorted the Republican presidential candidate from the Reno-Sparks Convention Center without incident. He and his staff made it aboard his custom Boeing 757, dubbed 'Trump Force One,' for of a flight to Denver where he will hold the day's fourth rally in as many stages. Trump issued a brief statement before the plane took off, but shed no new light on what had happened. 'I would like to thank the United States Secret Service and the law enforcement resources in Reno and the state of Nevada for their fast and professional response,' Trump said. 'I also want to thank the many thousands of people present for their unwavering and unbelievable support. Nothing will stop us – we will make America great again!'  Trump later returned and addressed the audience minutes later following the scary ordeal Trump thanked the Secret Service saying: 'These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.' Supporters watch as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno Saturday's incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to protect the GOP's standard-bearer. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. Thomas Dimassimo was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. 'I was ready for him, but it’s much easier if the cops do it, don’t we agree?' Trump said at the time. 'And to think I had such an easy life! What do I need this for, right?' Separately, in September a British man pleaded guilty to trying to grab a Las Vegas police officer's gun so he could assassinate Trump. The June incident at the Treasure Island hotel-casino did not put the Republican in any immediate danger.   Trump issued a brief statement before the plane took off, but shed no new light on what had happened Read more: Security forces rush Trump off stage during Reno speech Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) on Twitter Share or comment on this article e-mail 816 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Secret Service agents rushed Trump offstage in Reno after they determined a protester in the audience might pose a threat him. As the agents removed the Republican presidential candidate, authorities quickly wrestled Austyn Crites, 33, to the ground in the front of the crowd. As early details of the ordeal were being reported, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr retweeted a post on Twitter shared by special projects director at Citizens for Trump, Jack Prosobiec that suggested Trump had survived a murder attempt. 'Hillary ran away from rain today. Trump is back on stage minutes after assassination attempt,' Posobiec tweeted.  Scroll down for video  After Donald Trump was quickly hustled off a stage during a rally in Nevada amid a security scare, his son Donald Trump Jr (pictured in Nevada on Thursday) was quick to retweet claiming Saturday's skirmish was an 'assassination attempt' The tweet was originally posted by special projects director at Citizens for Trump, Jack Prosobiec but was later retweeted by Donald Trump Jr (above) The younger Trump also retweeted a claim early on as details were coming in that that someone in the crowd reportedly pulled a gun Donald Trump Jr retweeted the message along with Trump campaign social media director Dan Scavino Jr also retweeted the post calling the incident an assassination attempt. The Secret Service said they never found a weapon and called the fracas 'a commotion' in a statement. News reporters and others on social media were quick to call out Prosobiec and others who described the incident as an assassination attempt or attempted murder. 'ATTENTION: Using phrase "assassination attempt" abt #Trump #Reno = RECKLESS & FLAT WRONG. Listen to @SecretService NO GUN "COMMOTION,' Major Garrett, Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News, tweeted.  Secret Service agents rushed Trump off the stage during a campaign rally in Reno on Saturday after they determined a protester in the audience might pose a threat to him 'Trump's social media director + his son tweeted about an "assassination attempt." That was obviously inaccurate,' Jose A DelReal, national political reporter for the Washington Post wrote. While introducing Trump ahead of his rally in later on Saturday in Denver, one of the speakers also described the incident as an attempted murder. 'You attack him every time, thinking he raises a speech of hate,' Mohana said. 'Tonight I think, the hate [that a] lot of [the] media raised against him caused an attempt of murder against him in Nevada.' A senior Trump campaign official told DailyMail.com that Crites, whom rally-goers already identified as an anti-Trump protester, caused a panic when he reached into his waistband. News reporters and others on social media were quick to call out Prosobiec and others who described the incident as an assassination attempt or attempted murder, including Major Garrett, Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News  Ben Jacobs, a political reporter for the Guardian, also made note that Posobiec had called the incident an assassination attempt Jose A DelReal, national political reporter for the Washington Post tweeted that Posobiec had inaccurately described the incident At that point, the campaign official said, a voice called out: 'He's got a gun!' Trump's protective detail sprang into action, pulling him offstage as a sea of bodies scattered, screams rang out and authorities dragged Crites away as he kicked and strained.  One witness told DailyMail.com that a holstered gun was spotted on the hip of a plainclothes officer, adding to the confusion.   Just before the fracas, Trump could be seen shielding his eyes from the lights in order to peer into the crowd as a struggle broke out.  Three agents then stormed the stage and hustled the Republican presidential candidate away.    Crites, who has since been released, appeared on local newscasts saying he had merely been holding a sign that read 'Republicans Against Trump.'  Secret Service agents rushed Donald trump offstage on Saturday evening in Reno, Nevada after they determined that a protester in the audience posed a threat to the Republican presidential candidate Security personnel rush off stage after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was escorted away during a rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno, Nevada on Saturday When he reached into his waistband, however, police and good Samaritans took the man down. The crowd surged backward in fright and strained against metal barriers enclosing the press section.  Witness Donald Newton, 45, of California who was in the crowd at the time, said he was next to Crites, who he said was holding a sign and started heading toward the stage. 'He had something on his belly. I don't know what it was,' Newton told the Reno Gazette-Journal.  'Somebody yelled "gun" and everyone jumped on him. My friend put his knee on his head, but he kept getting up.' Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed the man from the rally on Saturday. He has since been identified as 33-year-old Austyn Crites At this time a motive is not clear. Authorities placed the man in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump's motorcade and the press vehicles were staged Austyn Crites, 33, (pictured) was detained by Secret Service after trying to raise a flag that read 'Republicans Against Trump' when someone yelled 'gun' causing a panic during the rally Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed Crites and placed him in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump's motorcade and the press vehicles were staged. SWAT officers with high-powered rifles guarded the entrance to the restroom while reporters milled outside. Television footage showed the white male suspect pinioned on the ground by officers and searched, before he was led away from the convention center.  Crites told the Guardian that he was terrified how the crowd responded during the chaotic moment. 'I was in survival mode. I knew I could die at that moment,' Crites told the Guardian. Crites was punched and kicked, and his neck was placed in a chokehold, he said. At one point someone in the crowed even grabbed his testicles as he feared for his life. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next ¿I don¿t care about Trump¿s sex life¿: Cheating on Melania...

Share this article Share 816 shares Police officers and U.S. Secret Service rush a man in handcuffs out of the rally on Saturday Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued Crites identifies as a Republican who supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to his Facebook page.  While he is a Republican, he has a couple of posts on his Facebook with Clinton's logo and an American flag with the words, 'Nevada Republicans proudly voting for Secretary Clinton.' 'I understand that this election has people torn, but we must chose HOPE over HATE,' one post appearing on his Facebook page read. Later on Saturday he wrote a post on his Facebook, which was slammed with negative comments and appears to have since been taken down, recounting Saturday's ordeal.  'Hi all, Not sure if you saw the news today, but I was beat up at a Trump rally for holding a sign and falsely accused of having a gun. I am ok and have been released,' Crites wrote. 'I have NO connection to the Clinton campaign apart from me supporting her HOPE over Trump’s HATE.' 'I have canvassed for her for about 3 hours, have contributed to her campaign, and voted for her.' Later on Saturday he wrote a post on his Facebook, which was slammed with negative comments and appears to have since been taken down, recounting Saturday's ordeal 'Though I do not agree with many of Hillary’s policies, we cannot allow a fascist/dictator to take our beloved freedoms to simply boost his ego and “get back” at anyone who disagrees,' he continued. 'Take what happened to me tonight as a classic example of dictator incident of violence – against your own Republican brother with a stupid sign.  'I am a Republican and cannot support Trump and his decisive rhetoric. This election cycle we all know what we need to do. PLEASE STAND UP WITH ME AND STOP TRUMP!’ The Secret Service said a thorough investigation into the incident is ongoing.   A short time after the fracas, Trump returned onstage and addressed the audience as he continued his rally speech, appearing unrattled by the scuffle and spoke with his usual self-confidence. 'Nobody said it was going to be easy for us,' he declared. 'But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped.' 'I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.' Trump had spotted the protester and described him as a Hillary Clinton supporter before asking security to 'take him out.' As he returned to his speech, he thanked a group of fans near the stage who had stepped in to subdue his would-be attacker. Just before the fracas, Trump could be seen shielding his eyes from the lights in order to peer into the crowd as a struggle broke out Police officers stand guard backstage after Trump was hustled off the stage by security agents 'You were amazing, fellas,' he said. 'I saw what you were doing. That's a tough group of people right there... Nobody messes with our people, right?' Secret Service agents escorted the Republican presidential candidate from the Reno-Sparks Convention Center without incident. He and his staff made it aboard his custom Boeing 757, dubbed 'Trump Force One,' for of a flight to Denver where he will hold the day's fourth rally in as many stages. Trump issued a brief statement before the plane took off, but shed no new light on what had happened. 'I would like to thank the United States Secret Service and the law enforcement resources in Reno and the state of Nevada for their fast and professional response,' Trump said. 'I also want to thank the many thousands of people present for their unwavering and unbelievable support. Nothing will stop us – we will make America great again!'  Trump later returned and addressed the audience minutes later following the scary ordeal Trump thanked the Secret Service saying: 'These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.' Supporters watch as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a rally at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno Saturday's incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to protect the GOP's standard-bearer. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. Thomas Dimassimo was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. 'I was ready for him, but it’s much easier if the cops do it, don’t we agree?' Trump said at the time. 'And to think I had such an easy life! What do I need this for, right?' Separately, in September a British man pleaded guilty to trying to grab a Las Vegas police officer's gun so he could assassinate Trump. The June incident at the Treasure Island hotel-casino did not put the Republican in any immediate danger.   Trump issued a brief statement before the plane took off, but shed no new light on what had happened Read more: Security forces rush Trump off stage during Reno speech Paul Lewis (@PaulLewis) on Twitter Share or comment on this article e-mail 816 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Most offers include the jets and industrial cooperation."The situation here is obviously concentrating people's minds," said Robert Hewson, spokesman for Saab. "So we have found a lot of interest in people talking to us about our radar products, our airborne surveillance products, because they need to be able to extend their horizons."Indonesian President Joko Widodo had promised to double the country's defence budget, clean up procurement and modernize its ageing military equipment. Since he took office, the country's total defence spending has jumped around 26 percent - though next year should actually see a slight dip to 108 trillion rupiah ($8.3 billion).Much of the effort, as with other countries in the region, includes a push to bring skills to Indonesia through joint ventures and partnerships, like a deal with South Korea which analysts initially said could cost up to $8 billion, to develop a mid-level fighter jet programme. Korea Aerospace Industries said this week it is working with Indonesia's state-owned aerospace company Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) on joint marketing efforts, as well as a drone development programme for surveillance.French defence firm Thales said it was getting interest in its air defence offerings, after selling to Malaysia last year, as other countries consider how to upgrade existing technology with lasers to improve accuracy.Indonesia will also seek to upgrade its heavy-lift helicopters, and the annual show saw Boeing promoting additional Apache helicopters and its Chinook. Indonesia has already ordered eight AH-64E Apache helicopters."Maritime surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities are moving to the forefront around the world and we certainly see that in Southeast Asia," a Boeing spokeswoman said.

Anthony KeaneNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend AUSTRALIANS’ personal finances are in the firing line of this week’s US presidential election. Economists say the impact of Tuesday’s vote may be unprecedented and could affect everything from inflation and home loans to superannuation and shares. Hillary Clinton has been the preferred choice of financial markets, which tumbled last week as her lead in the polls weakened. A win by Trump is tipped to trigger a global sharemarket sell-off — similar to June’s Brexit turmoil — because of fears his trade policies would damage global growth. Darryl Gobbett, chief economist of advice and stockbroking firm Baillieu Holst, said Mr Trump’s economic vision “until now has been blurry at best”. “The outlook for our interest rates, exchange rate, inflation and share market is heavily influenced by the policies and economic performance of the United States, whether we like it or not,” he said. Mr Gobbett said global financial markets had figured that a Clinton win will would be “more of the same” economic, financial and trade policies. “Financial markets don’t like surprises, uncertainty and volatility. In the event that Donald Trump snatches victory, I would expect equity markets and the Australian dollar would tumble at least for the short term.” With Clinton seen as steady-as-she-goes, the US election impact on everyday Australians would come from a Trump win. The consensus among financial experts appears to be that a Clinton victory will mean ‘more of the same’ for global financial markets, while a Trump win could usher in a period of instability. Picture: AFPSource:AFP MORTGAGES AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said a Trump victory that sparked financial market weakness and stoked fears of a trade war would increase the chance of another Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate cut. “Investors globally worry that if he does win, it will lead to slow economic growth and possibly a global recession, and our part of the world is exposed to that,” he said. At least part of a RBA rate cut would flow through to mortgage interest rates. SAVINGS Rate cuts reduce the income paid on savings accounts, further eroding the income of retirees who have watched their returns slashed from 7 per cent to 3 per cent in recent years. SHOPPING AND BILLS A slower economy means lower inflation, so consumers will be happy about only small price rises — apart from energy and education bills, which never seem to slow. SHARES Dr Oliver said a Trump win could send share markets around the world tumbling between 5 and 10 per cent. “A Trump win would be seen as a global economic shock and cause a loss of confidence in sharemarkets,” he said. Mr Gobbett said both candidates favoured spending more on the military, which could create attractive investment opportunities in defence-rated companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and British Aerospace. SUPERANNUATION A majority of people’s super fund assets sit in Australian and international shares, so a shares slowdown will hit short-term super fund returns. However, super is an investment over decades rather than weeks, and Dr Oliver said we could learn lessons from the kneejerk sell-off following the Britain’s Brexit vote in June. “After a few days global markets moved on to focus on other things. So there is a danger in making too much of the US election,” he said.
