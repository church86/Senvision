At an informal press event, ViaSat revealed its latest and most advanced satellite, which will put the company on a path to be more competitive in the Internet market. Carlsbad-based ViaSat is scheduled to launch its ViaSat-2 satellite in late March or early April. They partnered with Boeing to construct and test the satellite, which will increase ViaSat’s broadband Internet performance. The photo is of two Boeing 702 satellites in its thermal vacuum.

The total project cost, meanwhile, is about $600 million, which include the launch, satellite, insurance and ground equipment, and took three years to construct. However, no photos were allowed to preserve company and technological strategies. Nevertheless, ViaSat’s crown jewel stands 25-feet high, about 10 feet wide and, once its solar panels deploy in space, it will have a wingspan of 150 feet. Arianespace, a French company, will deliver the satellite on its Ariane 5 rocket. “We’re really evolving toward, what we believe, is the first global Internet service provider,” said Dave Abrahamian, ViaSat’s director of space systems. “Our whole mantra for the past 10 years … is to reduce the cost per bit, increase capacity substantially so that satellite-based broadband is no longer the choice of last resort. We’ll move that ball significantly forward when we launch ViaSat-2.” ViaSat-2, meanwhile, will have roughly two times more the capacity than ViaSat-1, when it launched in 2011, for a total capacity of 300 gigabits per second (Gbps). With 300Gbps of capacity, it will give customers download speeds between 25 to 50Mbps. It will also providing seven times more coverage. With a successful launch, which is scheduled for March or April in French Guiana in South America, ViaSat-2 will expand the Carlsbad-based company’s reach across the Atlantic Ocean to the Middle East and the northern tip of South America. Alaska will be the only state not to receive coverage from ViaSat-2 due to the angle of Earth. “We don’t have to sacrifice capacity for coverage area,” Abrahamian explained. “We can also move capacity around. ViaSat-2 solves that problem.” In addition, the increase in ViaSat’s reach and capacity will allow its customer base to increase by an estimated two to three times, said Keven Lippert, executive vice president of Satellite Systems and Corporate Development at ViaSat. Currently, the company has about 700,000 residential and business users on its ViaSat-1 satellite plus more than 550 commercial aircraft along with maritime vessels and the U.S. government. Its domestic airline portfolio includes United, JetBlue, Virgin America and most recently, American Airlines.

It was the first-ever communications satellite and broadcasted the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Courtesy photo “We won the American Airlines contract first for their 737… and (a sizable portion of their) North American fleet,” Abrahamian said of the Boeing partnership. “We think we can compete favorably with cable providers. The cost per user…, which is their metric, is greatly, greatly in our favor. There is no great efficient means of providing broadband in a large area than satellite.” Abrahamian said another advantage for the company comes from aircraft service. With the launch, and ViaSat’s European partner Eutelsat, 85 to 90 percent of all flight routes will be covered. Lippert, though, said the ultimate advantages of the new satellite will allow the company to become more competitive in the Internet market. Notably, ViaSat can challenge low- to mid-tier cable and DSL Internet service providers. In addition, ViaSat-2 will begin to ease data caps currently in place. Abrahamian, though, said ViaSat-2 will dovetail into ViaSat-3, the company’s most aggressive effort to date. The project will launch a trio of satellites for global coverage and could eliminate the data caps plaguing Internet satellite companies. It will be the first satellite with one terabyte of capacity, which is larger than the more than 400 combined communication satellites currently in space. “I think the other point is our competition is more and more not other satellite companies,” Lippert said. “It’s DSL, cable and traditional telecom companies. That’s really our goal … and where we’re headed.” As for Boeing’s role, the two companies partnered to build the ViaSat-2 satellite. ViaSat constructed the systems and the design, while Boeing built the satellite (a 702 high-power series) and performed the mandatory testing requirements plus delivery to the launch site. Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International, and Ron Dukat, Boeing-ViaSat program director, said the partnership has flourished. “What we can offer customers like ViaSat is the best of the best,” Spiwak said. “Certain customers, like ViaSat, have certain proprietary information that they may not want to share that and we respect that.” As for the launch schedule, Abrahamian said ViaSat-2 had undergone and passed all testing performed by Boeing and is now waiting to be shipped to South America. Testing included temperature performances, where in space there is a 600-degree difference between light (300 degrees Fahrenheit) and shade (-300), noise exams up to 10,000 hertz and simulated space tests in Boeing’s thermal vacuum. “You get one shot at this,” Spiwak added. “These are 22,000 miles away so it’s a pretty rigorous test program so it makes sure it works for 15 years or whatever the design life is on orbit. You can’t go up there and fix it.” Once there, it will be fueled and launched into its orbital slot. However, ViaSat will conduct numerous systems tests once the satellite is in space and will be operational for consumer use by the fourth quarter 2017, Lippert added.

The 35-year sentence Manning received was the longest ever imposed for a leak conviction. Manning has already served seven years of her sentence and will now be released on May 17, 2017.  ADVERTISEMENT She was originally set to be released be released in 2045.  Manning's grant came in a batch of 209 commutations and 64 pardons, announced with four days left in Obama's presidency.  The former Army private, who is transgender, has reportedly struggled with mental health issues. She has tried to commit suicide twice and has spent time in solitary confinement as punishment.  Obama's move could also have consequences for the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, whose organization published material leaked by both Manning and Snowden.  "If Obama grants Manning clemency Assange will agree to US extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of DoJ case," WikiLeaks tweeted last week.  The president's decision is sure to roil an ongoing debate about weighty issues such as intelligence leaks and criminal justice reform.  The Hill's Jordan Fabian has the full story on Manning's commutation here.  The president also pardoned retired Gen. James Cartwright, who was convicted in 2012 for lying to FBI investigators while being questioned about leaks involving a top secret U.S. program to derail Iran's nuclear program.  Our Katie Bo Williams has more on the Cartwright pardon here. The Manning commutation is already sparking controversy, with one Republican senator saying that Obama had commuted the sentence of a traitor. The Hill's Mark Hensch has that story: Sen. Tom CottonTom CottonConservative nonprofit pressures GOP to approve Trump budget pick In a divided US, one event proved there's still bipartisan foreign policy Mulvaney vows to give Trump straight talk on entitlements MORE (R-Ark.) says President Obama treated "a traitor like a martyr" in commuting former soldier Chelsea Manning's prison sentence. "When I was leading soldiers in Afghanistan, Private Manning was undermining us by leaking hundreds of thousands classified documents to WikiLeaks," he said in a statement Tuesday. "I don't understand why the president would feel special compassion for someone who endangered the lives of our troops, diplomats, intelligence officers, and allies. We ought not treat a traitor like a martyr." Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, though, is praising the decision, reports The Hill's Paulina Firozi. "In five more months, you will be free. Thank you for what you did for everyone, Chelsea. Stay strong a while longer," Snowden tweeted.   BOEING CEO MEETS WITH TRUMP: The head of Boeing said Tuesday he and President-elect Donald TrumpDonald TrumpTrump to speak with Putin, other world leaders Saturday Trump orders publication of stats on terror-linked crime by foreign nationals Warren goes on tweetstorm over refugee ban MORE made progress on reducing the cost of the next generation of Air Force One planes in their second meeting since Trump slammed the program on Twitter. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told reporters after meeting with Trump. "All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I'm pleased with the progress there." In December, Trump tweeted that costs for the new Air Force One are "out of control" and threatened to cancel the program. The Hill's Rebecca Kheel has more here.   PENTAGON IDENTIFIES GITMO DETAINEES SENT TO OMAN: The Pentagon on Tuesday identified the 10 Guantanamo Bay detainees sent to Oman. The Pentagon's confirmation came a day after the Arabian Peninsula country announced that it had accepted the detainees. Among those transferred include two men who the Pentagon acknowledged were cases of mistaken identity. "The United States is grateful to the government of Oman for its humanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility," the Pentagon said in a statement Tuesday. "The United States coordinated with the government of Oman to ensure these transfers took place consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures." The transfer is part of President Obama's push to clear the facility as much as possible before he leaves office Friday. Forty-five detainees now remain at Guantanamo. Oman has a rehabilitation program for extremists and previously took in 20 Yemeni detainees from Guantanamo. The Hill's Rebecca Kheel tells us more about who the 10 detainees are here.   McCAIN PROPOSES $640B DEFENSE BUDGET: Sen. John McCainJohn McCainMcConnell warns Trump: Don’t lift Russia sanctions Week ahead: Russian sanctions in the spotlight Trump: 'Very early' to consider lifting Russian sanctions MORE (R-Ariz.) is proposing a $640 billion base defense budget for the next fiscal year, $54 billion above what had been projected by the Obama administration. "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to 'fully eliminate the defense sequester' and 'submit a new budget to rebuild our military.' This cannot happen soon enough," McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, wrote in a 33-page white paper released over the holiday weekend. "The damage that has been done to our military over the past eight years will not be reversed in one year. Just stemming the bleeding caused by recent budget cuts will take most of the next five years, to say nothing of the sustained increases in funding required thereafter." The Hill's Rebecca Kheel has more here.    TRUMP'S NAVY BUILDUP: President-elect Donald Trump wants to expand the Navy's fleet to 350 ships, the largest build-up since the end of the Cold War.  But where that money will come from is unclear and defense contractors aren't counting their ships yet, writes The Hill's Kristina Wong.  Experts say that going from the current fleet of 274 ships to Trump's 350 goal will cost about $165 billion over 30 years. And it will be impossible to achieve unless there's a dramatic increase in the defense budget, currently at $619 billion. There are expectations on Capitol Hill and within the Pentagon that Trump will substantially increase the defense budget. However, there are key obstacles to raising defense spending.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) NEW YORK—Vice President-elect Mike Pence is pledging to a group of mayors that the Trump administration will make a serious investment in infrastructure. Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that “we’re going to do an infrastructure bill and it’s going to be big.” Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday’s inauguration, saying it will mark “the dawn of a new era for our country, it’s an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America.” Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He’ll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he’s sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump had previously criticized the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One program.

(Tim Vizer/Belleville News-Democrat via AP, File) “We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost,” Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag.

On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he’s missed since 1987. John Lewis said about my inauguration, “It will be the first one that I’ve missed.” WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he… — Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 17, 2017 Lewis’ office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush’s 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would “love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don’t, we’ve got some great seats for others to partake in. It’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power.” Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach “too complicated” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Related Coverage Pence to Use Reagan’s Bible for Inauguration Ceremony Trump Adviser: US/UK Trade Deal Possible Quickly Trump, Pence Respond to John Lewis’s Statements That He Won’t Attend Inauguration At issue is a proposal called “border adjustment” that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It’s part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump’s ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” Trump also said that Britain’s decision to leave the 28-nation EU would “end up being a great thing,” and he predicted that other countries would also leave. Also this week, Trump’s picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump's efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors.  It also showed Boeing's adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy. Scroll down for video  Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg (pictured) met with President-elect Donald Trump today at Trump Tower and said the two made progress on the price of new Air Forces Ones  Dennis Muilenburg, head of aerospace giant Boeing, stopped and talked to reporters after speaking with President-elect Donald Trump  Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings.  Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled.  Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Last month, Trump also asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the 'excellent conversation' with Trump could lead to a deal 'in the very near term.' 'We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,' Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next New tax battle brewing between Trump and Ryan as...

Share this article Share 43 shares 'That's going to lead to substantial cost reductions.' On fighter jets, he said, 'we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably.' Muilenburg praised Trump's approach to negotiations. 'I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business,' he said, noting that as the U.S.' top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. 'If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest,' he said. 'We're proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country.' 'I appreciate the teamwork approach on this - I think it's the right way to do business.' Boeing's stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trade.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Pence promises big investment in infrastructure Tuesday Jan 17, 2017 at 6:57 AM Jan 17, 2017 at 4:40 PM Jonathan Lemire The Associated Press NEW YORK - Vice President-elect Mike Pence is pledging to a group of mayors that the Trump administration will make a serious investment in infrastructure.  Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance ofFriday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Trump also said that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU would "end up being a great thing," and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple - "it is the unity of the Europeans." In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: "We Europeans have our fate in our own hands." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. ___ Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Washington and Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report.

SMITH / POOL Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg speaks to media after a meeting in Trump Tower in New York City, United States on January 17, 2017. EFE/BRYAN R. SMITH / POOL Menéame Boeing said Tuesday that excellent strides were made in bringing down the Air Force One replacement fleet's cost, which President-elect Donald Trump said last month was exorbitant. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification ... all that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost. I'm pleased with the progress there," the company's CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, said after a meeting with the president-elect at Trump Tower. Trump caused a stir on Dec. 6 when he complained in a tweet that the cost of the new Air Force One was too high. "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" he wrote. Muilenburg first met with Trump on Dec. 21 to discuss the issue and then on Tuesday sat down again with the real-estate mogul at Trump Tower for what he told reporters was a "very productive" conversation. Trump also has criticized Lockheed Martin for "out-of-control costs" on its F-35 jet and asked Boeing to offer a price for a similar aircraft, its F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Muilenburg said he also spoke Tuesday with Trump about fighter planes but did not offer any details. Content providers. Contact EFE.

In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Trump also said that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU would "end up being a great thing," and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple — "it is the unity of the Europeans." In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: "We Europeans have our fate in our own hands." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Washington and Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report. 0 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill, and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports while campaigning, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman's Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. "We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world," Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his "America First" mantra. "I'm not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will," Pence said, adding that Trump "will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world." The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program.

"Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment."

The Associated Press | (2) Comment By Art | JANUARY 17, 2017 10:25 PM Honestly I do not think the Europeans will be fine. The U.S. pivot towards Russia, and the destabilisation of the Middle East, together with the refugee problem that has generated, are two phases of an ongoing war against Europe and the ideals of equality, social democracy and mutual co-operation that it stands for. The #1 enemy is liberalism, and its failure in Europe is a necessary part of the coming fascist global order that Trump and the billionaire class are gleefully ushering in. 3   1 Report as Offensive By RGC | JANUARY 17, 2017 05:07 PM The Europeons will be fine. 3   17 Report as Offensive ( Page 1 of 1 ) Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Most Read SEE MORE Bingemans opening restaurant in downtown Kitchener BlackBerry and Nokia phones are coming back — with a twist Sexual predator Watts released from prison again Waterloo man, 67, charged with child porn Elderly woman has wallet, debit card stolen outside Kitchener grocery store In Your Neighbourhood Today Invest in people to improve your company’s bottom line Energy efficiency projects live or die on the knowledge and skills of the people involved.

See how we got here. USA TODAY NETWORK Flight officer Rayan Gharazeddine scans the water in the southern Indian Ocean off Australia from a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion during a search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. (Photo: Rob Griffith, AP) Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the fatal-accident rate among airliners. The story has been updated with the correct statistics. As governments sail away from the nearly three-year search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, failing to find the wreckage and explain what went wrong for the 239 people aboard could haunt the industry that has reached lofty levels of safety. The Boeing 777 disappeared without a distress call March 8, 2014, on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Based on clues from the plane’s electronics, the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia spent $160 million scouring a section of the Indian Ocean floor the size of Pennsylvania. The suspension Tuesday of the underwater search leaves fundamental questions unanswered: What went wrong? Was there a mechanical problem? Did somebody aboard the plane make a mistake – or crash it intentionally? The search's end comes two months after investigators took another detailed look at the clues that dictated where they were looking, and a month after they found that another area of ocean floor the size of Vermont might be more promising. “They’re going to be haunted by what might or might not be in that zone,” said David Gallo, who helped find Air France Flight 447 at the bottom of the Atlantic in 2011 and who is now senior advisor for strategic initiatives at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “This should really drive them crazy.” Investigators say the plane’s wreckage – and potentially the data and voice recorders – could explain whatever problems happened so that they could be avoided in the future. The Boeing 777 is a workhorse of the long-haul fleet, with 1,200 flying worldwide. “We really do need to find the wreckage to ensure that there’s no problem with the aircraft,” said Al Diehl, a former investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. For example, the recovery of Air France Flight 447 revealed that pilots made mistakes flying in a snowstorm, but also a problem with pitot tubes, sensors that stick out of the fuselage of the Airbus A330, that gave the pilots bad information. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said the manufacturer has been fully dedicated to the Malaysia search and investigation. The company’s thoughts continue to be with the families, friends and colleagues of those aboard the flight, he said. “We accept the conclusion of government authorities leading the investigation and search that, in the absence of credible new information that leads to identification of a specific location of the aircraft, there will be no further expansion of the search area,” Alder said. The disappearance came at a time of dramatic improvements in safety. The number of fatalities aboard passenger airliners worldwide from 1959 throgh 2015 was 29,165, according to a Boeing study. But the total for the last decade was 3,133, according to the study. The last fatal crash of a U.S. passenger airline was in February 2009. “Historically, we’ve achieved this very high level of aviation safety by finding the wreckage and other data, and analyzing it – lessons learned from previous accidents,” Diehl said. Finding sunken planes is hard, even when the location is better known than the Malaysia flight. A Northwest Airlines plane that crashed in Lake Michigan in 1950 without modern tracking equipment has never been found. The Aviation Safety Network counts 84 planes, each with at least 14 people aboard, that have gone missing since 1948, typically over oceans, mountains or other remote areas. The Malaysia flight’s transponder and automated maintenance system stopped signaling less than an hour into the flight. But a satellite caught hourly pings from the plane, which suggested it flew far out over the ocean until running out of fuel. Because the ocean is several miles deep in the search area, the vessels first mapped the ocean floor and then dragged sonar vehicles on miles-long cords to scan the bottom. They found details as small as anchors and as large as a shipwreck. But no airliner. “It’s probably one of the largest continuous maps of the seafloor ever made, with the resolution they made it," Gallo said. He called deep-sea exploration one of the hardest tasks on Earth, comparable to space expeditions. “You’re actually mounting an expedition into an unknown world where the mountains are taller, the valleys are deeper and wider. There are volcanoes and earthquakes,” Gallo said. “It’s almost like going to Mars, to look for a plane. You’re mounting an expedition to an unknown world.” USA TODAY Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 turns up shipwreck instead USA TODAY Underwater searches 'not easy ... but not impossible' USA TODAY New MH370 report says plane crashed into ocean at high speed More than 20 fragments of the Malaysia plane have washed up on distant shores, along the coast of Africa, and the islands of Mauritius, Reunion and Rodriguez. Damage to flaps from the wings suggested that they were in position for cruising rather than landing when the plane plunged into the sea. The search committee conducted a November review of how those fragments drifted and other data. In December, the committee changed its interpretation of where the wreckage might be, to north of where search vessels were focused, in an area of about 9,600 square miles. “The experts concluded that, if this area were to be searched, prospective areas for locating the aircraft wreckage, based on all the analysis to date, would be exhausted,” the committee said in a Dec. 20 report. But without a more precise location, the transport ministers of the three countries in charge of the search announced Tuesday the last vessel had left the search area located about 1,000 miles west of Australia. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness,” said the statement from Liow Tiong Lai of Malaysia, Li Xiaopeng of China and Darren Chester of Australia. “Whilst combined scientific studies have continued to refine areas of probability, to date no new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft.” Chester told reporters that he understood the "disappointment and frustration" of relatives of the passengers, some of whom he met with, and that he shared their disappointment even if he couldn't "possibly understand their grief." "They have been waiting for answers now for almost three years, and it is the unanswered questions for them which is the most difficult part for them to deal with," Chester said. But the three governments agreed in July that they would suspend the search if they didn't develop any more precise information about the plane's location. "If I continue the search effort and came to you today and said I have reached agreement with Malaysia and China to find another 20, 30, 40 or 50 million dollars, you'd be saying to me well, 'Why are you spending taxpayers' money in this way?'" Chester said. "But by coming to you and saying that we agreed in July last year that in the absence of any credible new evidence leading to the specific location of the aircraft, we intend to suspend the search, you are now asking well why won't you extend it to a new area. I don't think there's a perfect answer." The advocacy group Voice 370, which represents families of the passengers, urged the search to continue. The group called the November review “a mere smokescreen” and said requiring the “precise location of the aircraft” before continuing the effort would “bury the search.” “In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” the group said on its Facebook page. 16978 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2k1YhMX NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports on the campaign trail, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump was set to make his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Trump also said that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU would "end up being a great thing," and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple — "it is the unity of the Europeans." In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: "We Europeans have our fate in our own hands." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

By: Hana Levi Julian Published: January 17th, 2017 Facebook Twitter Telegram Google Reddit LinkedIn Printer-Ready Page Layout Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg at Trump Tower in NYC Photo Credit: DS Levi U.S. President-elect Donald Trump met with Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York City to discuss the company’s F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet — a possible competitor for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 stealth fighter jet, which has overrun its production times and costs — and to discuss a replacement fleet for Air Force One. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters at a quick briefing following his one-hour meeting with Mr. Trump. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements on Air Force One, streamlining the process – all that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost.” Mr. Trump had scrapped the original replacement plans for Air Force One, saying the price was simply “too high.” Muilenberg revealed no further details about the discussion over the military aircraft. Israel received delivery of its first two F-35 stealth fighter jets — named the “Adir” in Hebrew — this past month, with more expected to arrive this year. By the end of the next decade, Israel is expected to receive a total of 50 of the aircraft. But a Pentagon report released this month revealed the aircraft has yet to be fully “bug free” and has more than 200 technical issues that still must be addressed.

Trump continues to hold meetings at his offices days before the inauguration in Washington. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)    5427097 Boeing’s CEO confirmed that the company, which is currently building an updated Air Force One for the president, has taken steps to provide a “better airplane at a lower cost.” The confirmation came from Boeing’s CEO Tuesday. Speaking to reporters in a brief gaggle in the lobby, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company has made some “great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One,” according to pool reporter Katie Reilly of Time Magazine. “We talked about a couple of topics. We discussed Air Force One. We discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg said after emerging from the elevator in Trump Tower. He characterized his meeting with Trump as an “excellent conversation.” The meeting follows recent comments from the president-elect regarding the cost of the Air Force One. In early December, Trump tweeted that while Boeing is building a band new 747 Air Force One, costs were out of control, with a price tag north of $4 billion.”Cancel order!” Trump said at the time. Boeing responded by assuring the public that it was dedicated to providing the best product at the lowest cost, and followed up by meeting with the president-elect. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Muilenburg said. “All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I’m pleased with the progress there,” the CEO said. “And similarly on fighters, we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably.” “I think Mr Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business,” Muilenburg said when asked if he thought Trump’s habit of tweeting directly to companies was the “right way” to negotiate on business. “We want to generate jobs in the U.S.,” he told reporters. “I think Mr. Trump’s engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country,” Muilenburg said. When asked when a deal would be finalized, Muilenburg said that “I think we’re making great progress,” but declined to state a date. “I appreciate the teamwork approach on this. I think it’s the right way to do business,” the Boeing CEO said of his meetings with the president-elect. Follow Ted on Twitter Send Tips to [email protected] .

The modification is a follow-up to the company's contract with the U.S. Navy initially awarded in July 2014. Under the modification, Bell-Boeing will provide engineering services for MV-22 Osprey aircraft to be sold to the government of Japan.

John Lewis, D-Ga. testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at the confirmation hearing for Attorney General-designate, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Lewis says he's doesn't consider Donald Trump a "legitimate president," blaming the Russians for helping the Republican win the White House. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)(Cliff Owen) The Associated Press Donald Trump is making his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach and his focus turns to the nation's capital. The president-elect also on Tuesday continued his social media attacks on Rep. John Lewis, an Alabama native and civil rights icon. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

"We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Muilenburg told reporters after their second meeting at Trump Tower in New York. "All of that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost, so I'm pleased with the progress there." Story Continued Below In December Trump posted on Twitter that the cost estimates of the next-generation pair of Air Force One aircraft were "out of control" and raised the prospect of canceling the project. Muilenburg and Trump subsequently met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where the Boeing executive pledged the company would build two new presidential aircraft for less than $4 billion. Outgoing Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James told POLITICO at the time that new Air Force One will be so expensive because it requires so many added features demanded by White House security personnel. The price tag could be pared down "if you change the requirements," James said. "If you have lesser communications requirements, if you have lesser countermeasures, if you have lesser any of these factors." She also said that while the Air Force oversees the program, the aircraft standards are set by the White House. Leaving their meeting on Tuesday, Muilenburg said he and the president-elect also talked about fighter aircraft and "options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably." Trump has criticized the cost of Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, and said he's asked Boeing to explore pricing for an F/A-18 alternative. But last week Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, who also met with Trump for the second time, said the company is "close to a deal" that will bring down the cost of the F-35. When asked whether Trump's Twitter comments were the right way to negotiate business, Muilenburg said the president-elect "is doing a great job with engaging the business. We're all on the same page here. Our objective is to provide the best capability for our country most affordably. We want to generate jobs in the U.S.” He added: “If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest. We’re proud to take on that mission. And I think Mr. Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Ellen Mitchell emitchell@politico.com This story tagged under: Defense Listen to today's flash briefing POLITICO Playbook's must-listen rundown on what's driving the day in Washington.

By Tony Capaccio, Toluse Olorunnipa and Julie Johnsson Bloomberg Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said he “made some great progress” in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect’s demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One. In addition to Boeing’s contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced fighter jet. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.” Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” although no specific reductions have yet been announced. “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business,” Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. “We’re on the same page here.” Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, its CEO touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports. “You want manufacturing jobs — aerospace is the place to invest,” Muilenburg said. “We’re proud to take on that mission.” Trump’s public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.” More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11. Trump also called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet,” referring to the company’s F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly” on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems, a key subcontractor on the program. “Over a period there’s no question we’ve been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period,” Carr said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday from Davos. “We respect that and we’ll work towards a contribution towards that.” At the time of Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, it wasn’t immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said in an interview that the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, “he’s heard these big numbers,” Frank Kendall said in an interview. “Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They’re not contract values, necessarily.” “The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion — the 747s we’re buying — so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means,” Kendall said. “We’re still negotiating with Boeing on that.” Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. “His general interest in reducing costs is terrific — his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics,” Kendall said.

(AP file) NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump is making his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach and his focus turns to the nation’s capital. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He’ll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he’s sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One program. “We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost,” Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump’s comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday’s inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he’s missed since 1987. “WRONG (or lie!)” Trump tweeted. “He boycotted Bush 43 also because he ‘thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in….he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.’ Sound familiar!” Lewis’ office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush’s 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycotts, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said “it’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power,” but noted that it is their right. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach “too complicated” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called “border adjustment” that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It’s part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump’s ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” Trump also said that Britain’s decision to leave the 28-nation EU would “end up being a great thing,” and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple — “it is the unity of the Europeans.” In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: “We Europeans have our fate in our own hands.” Also this week, Trump’s picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening.

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill, and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports while campaigning, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman's Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. "We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world," Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his "America First" mantra. "I'm not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will," Pence said, adding that Trump "will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world." The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program.

Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment."

Speaking Tuesday to a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, Pence said President-elect Donald Trump told him to pass on that "we're going to do an infrastructure bill, and it's going to be big." Trump, who consistently lamented the state of American bridges, roads and airports while campaigning, has promised to invest $1 trillion in transportation and infrastructure spending, though he has provided few details. Pence also said the new administration will work with cities as partners. He looked ahead to Friday's inauguration, saying it will mark "the dawn of a new era for our country, it's an era of growth and opportunity and renewed greatness for America." Trump also made his first trip to Washington in weeks on Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach. Trump flew in for a black-tie dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The Chairman's Global Dinner drew nearly 150 diplomats and ambassadors, well-heeled donors, soon-to-be White House staffers and Cabinet picks. "We have great respect for your countries. We have great respect for our world," Trump told the group after he was introduced by Pence, who assured that the future president was willing to engage with the world, despite his "America First" mantra. "I'm not sure that the national media here in America completely understands the president-elect. I can assure you that the world will," Pence said, adding that Trump "will be a president who puts America first, but we will work every day with nations around the world to advance the peace and prosperity of our allies and our friends across the world." The president-elect is expected to return to New York after the dinner. He'll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he's sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing's Air Force One program. "We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost," Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump "is doing a good job as an agent of business" and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump's comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday's inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he's missed since 1987. "WRONG (or lie!)" Trump tweeted. "He boycotted Bush 43 also because he 'thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar!" Lewis' office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush's 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycott on a phone call with reporters, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said they would "love for every member of Congress to attend but if they don't, we've got some great seats for others to partake in. It's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power." White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the boycott was a "reflection of the division" in the country. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach "too complicated" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called "border adjustment" that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It's part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 percent to 20 percent. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don't love it," Trump said. Trump also appeared to outline a different health care goal than many Republicans over the weekend. During interviews with The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, Trump said that after the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, he'll offer "insurance for everybody." Congressional Republicans have been careful to say that they want to provide "universal access." European Union nations bracing for Trump's ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect's stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump's view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren't paying their fair share had "caused astonishment." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana made his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. ___ Associated Press writers Julie Pace and Jill Colvin in Washington and Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report. ___ Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Associated Press   By JONATHAN LEMIRE and CATHERINE LUCEY     NEW YORK -- Donald Trump is making his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach and his focus turns to the nation's capital. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honoring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner.

Trump also said that Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU would "end up being a great thing," and he predicted that other countries would also leave. At a meeting of EU ministers, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said the best response to such comments was simple - "it is the unity of the Europeans." In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted: "We Europeans have our fate in our own hands." Also this week, Trump's picks for Cabinet posts continue their trek to Capitol Hill to win support from lawmakers considering their confirmation for Cabinet positions. On Tuesday, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana was scheduled to make his case to be interior secretary. And Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick for education secretary, has a confirmation hearing Tuesday evening. ___ Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Washington and Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report. ___ Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire Tweet This article filed under: News Nation/World Associated Press Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

WABC By Josh Einiger Tuesday, January 17, 2017 WASHINGTON, DC (WABC) -- It was Donald Trump's first time as President-elect, literally on the international stage. Tuesday night, three days before the inauguration, before more than 200 foreign diplomats in Washington, Donald Trump couldn't help but remind them that he won. "We set records in so many different ways, they don't love talking about that on the news," Trump said. "They don't like saying more counties than anybody you look at a map of the counties in this country that we won and it's literally entirely, it just looks like it is entirely red." Earlier, they were checking the sound on the Capitol steps where Trump will officially take the oath on Friday. He'll use two Bibles, including one his mother gave him, and one used by Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama. But nothing is normal about this inaugural. With demonstrations gearing up against the pending repeal of the Affordable Care Act, as many as 400,000 Americans are expected in Washington to protest the inauguration. Then there are the planned no-shows. One in four congressional democrats is boycotting the event. "I can't go to this inauguration because he continues to spew hatred, bigotry and prejudice," a democrat said. Trump is taking office with unprecedented unpopularity. Just 40% percent of Americans approve of how he's handled the transition. That's 30 points lower than his last three predecessors. Tuesday, Trump tweeted that the polls are rigged. Later, he told that crowd of foreign dignitaries the team he's chosen is top notch. "I'm very proud of everybody, the cabinet members," Trump said. "We have put together a team, I think the likes of which has never been assembled. So, we'll have further reports in the years to come, but I think you'll see that.

FILE - In this Jan. 13, 2017 file photo, President-elect Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York. Trump has offered views on U.S. relations with Asia that could indicate radical shifts in long-standing policy toward the region. From opposing free trade agreements to confronting China and questioning Japan-South Korea alliances, he appears set to be charting a course far different from previous administrations. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) NEW YORK – Donald Trump is making his first Washington trip in weeks Tuesday, as his inauguration festivities approach and his focus turns to the nation’s capital. Trump planned to fly in for a dinner honouring Tom Barrack, his longtime friend and head of the Inauguration Committee. The president-elect will return to New York after the dinner. He’ll make his final trip to Washington on Thursday to attend a concert at the Lincoln Memorial and to stay, as is custom for incoming presidents, at Blair House, the presidential guest quarters, the night before he’s sworn in. In New York on Tuesday, Trump met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Trump has criticized the cost of Boeing’s Air Force One program. “We made some great progress to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features, all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost,” Muilenberg said after the meeting. He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming. He did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag. Trump’s comments on Twitter and to news organizations threatened to overshadow the pomp and circumstance of Friday’s inauguration. On Tuesday, the president-elect continued his attacks on Rep. John Lewis, whom he berated Saturday for challenging his legitimacy to be the next president. Trump said that the veteran African-American congressman from Georgia had wrongly claimed that it would be the first inauguration he’s missed since 1987. “WRONG (or lie!)” Trump tweeted. “He boycotted Bush 43 also because he ‘thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush’s swearing-in….he doesn’t believe Bush is the true elected president.’ Sound familiar!” Lewis’ office on Tuesday confirmed that the civil rights icon had missed George W. Bush’s 2001 swearing-in, saying it was also a form of dissent. Trump has been widely criticized for the comments and more than 40 House Democrats plan to boycott his inauguration. Trump had sought to ease friction Monday, meeting with a son of Martin Luther King Jr. Asked about the boycotts, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said “it’s a shame that these folks don’t want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power,” but noted that it is their right. Trump also put GOP lawmakers on the defensive Tuesday over their tax plan, after he called their approach “too complicated” in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. At issue is a proposal called “border adjustment” that would tax imports to the U.S. while exempting exports. It’s part of a sweeping planned rewrite of the U.S. tax code aimed at lowering overall rates on corporations from 35 per cent to 20 per cent. “Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it,” Trump said. European Union nations bracing for Trump’s ascension showed defiance Monday in the face of the president-elect’s stinging comments on everything from NATO and German cars to the crumbling of the European Union. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said the Trump’s view that NATO was obsolete and his criticism that European allied members aren’t paying their fair share had “caused astonishment.” Trump also said that Britain’s decision to leave the 28-nation EU would “end up being a great thing,” and he predicted that other countries would also leave.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Nation & World Politics Boeing CEO says he ‘made some great progress’ in talks with Trump about Air Force One Originally published January 17, 2017 at 10:24 am Updated January 18, 2017 at 6:19 am Dennis Muilenburg, Boeingchief executive (BRYAN R. SMITH / POOL/EPA) Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with the president-elect at Trump Tower on Tuesday to talk about the jet maker’s contract to build the new Air Force One and about the F-18 Super Hornet. Share story By Tony Capaccio, Toluse Olorunnipa and Julie Johnsson Bloomberg News Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said he “made some great progress” in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect’s demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One. In addition to Boeing’s contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced jet fighter. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.” Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” although no specific reductions have yet been announced.

Cancel order!” After that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. Trump also called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet,” referring to the company’s F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly’’ on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Comments Share Tweet Share Share Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg says he and President-elect Donald Trump made “great progress” during a meeting on the next Air Force One fleet. Muilenburg visited Trump Tower Tuesday morning to discuss the contract for the second time since Trump publicly criticized the aerospace giant for the estimated cost of the Air Force One program. Related: Boeing’s problems are nothing when compared to ‘the old days’ Last month, Trump tweeted, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” The New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, told reporters the cost to the government was “ridiculous,” though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, “but not that much.” In the wake of that, Muilenburg vowed that the company would build the new version of the jet for less money. However, the Air Force would likely have to change its requirements to lower costs. “It was a terrific conversation,” Muilenburg said after his first meeting with Trump. “I have a lot of respect for him. He’s a good man and he’s doing the right thing.” In March, the Government Accountability Office estimated the total program cost of the Air Force One program at more than $3.2 billion. Much of that would be for research and development. The Defense Department put the cost of two new aircraft around $4 billion, the Associated Press reports. That cost would also include research and development, construction and maintenance. As of December, the Air Force spent around $170 million on contracts to begin identifying what would need to be done to a 747-8 to adapt it for use by the president and his staff. Under the current deal, the Air Force would purchase the 747-8, which is a newer version of the two currently in use by the government. The two modified Boeing 747s President Obama has used were built in the 1980s. They took flight in the early 1990s. The new Air Force One planes wouldn’t be ready until about 2023 or 2024, which would be the end of Trump’s second term — if he sought and won re-election. Reuters reports that after their second meeting, Muilenburg, who wouldn’t go into much detail, said he and Trump “made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One,” which could lead to “substantial cost reductions.” Comments Share Tweet Share Share Most Popular It's all fun and games until you become president 'Gold' could at least be closer to the truth Port of Seattle CEO placed on administrative leave More Microsoft fights US government and wins Is Elon Musk getting into the tunnel game?

CONGRESS-HEALTH OVERHAUL Analysis says premiums would jump WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress’ nonpartisan budget analyst says premiums would jump sharply and millions more people would be without health coverage under a bill Republicans passed last year eliminating President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. The Congressional Budget office says under that measure, premiums for people buying policies on the law’s online marketplaces would jump up to 25 percent in the first year after enactment. They’d about double by 2026. It also says there’d be 18 million new uninsured people in the first year after enactment. That number would grow to 32 million by 2026. Republicans have said they’re using last year’s bill as a starting point as they try to dismantle Obama’s law this year and replace it. Last year’s measure did not include any replacement provisions. Obama vetoed last year’s bill. TRUMP-BOEING Boeing CEO cites progress on Air Force One cost WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of Boeing says “great progress” has been made in negotiations with President-elect Donald Trump to settle on a new price tag for the Air Force One program. Trump last month blasted the proposed cost to replace the aging fleet of presidential aircraft. He met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg last month and again today in Trump Tower. BRITAIN-BREXIT British PM calls for a clean Brexit break LONDON (AP) — Britain’s future outside the European Union is becoming much clearer. Prime Minister Theresa May, in a speech today, said the U.K. wants to free itself from governance by the EU. But it still wants to be allies — and trading partners, without tariffs — with the 27 remaining EU nations. Some analysts are saying her plans are ambitious — like a divorcing couple who want to stay best friends, share the kids, and keep each other’s front door keys. DAVOS Dollar rise could hurt developing economies DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — The dollar’s strength could lead to financial bailouts in emerging market economies and even an intervention to limit the currency’s rise. That’s the view of David Rubenstein, co-CEO of The Carlyle Group, a leading private equity firm. Addressing delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Rubenstein says there’s a risk of “potentially another Mexican-style crisis” in emerging markets because many firms that borrowed in dollars won’t be able repay the loans if their earnings are in local currency while the dollar appreciates. He says there’s around $4.5 trillion in emerging market corporate debt that is dollar-denominated. He says there may well have “to be some intervention” to rein in the dollar or “you’re going to have to bail some of these countries out.” DAVOS-CHINA Chinese president presses case for free trade DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) —Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) is pressing his case for free trade, urging the world to “say no to protectionism” and warning that “no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. Xi made the comments today in an opening address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Swizerland. It’s the first such visit ever by a Chinese head of state to the gathering of world business and political leaders. Xi didn’t directly mention U.S. President-elect Donald Trump but cast China as a standard-bearer of free trade amid concerns in some corners that the new U.S. administration may enact more protectionist measures in trade. Xi says the world must “remain committed to promoting free trade and investment through opening up” and said “pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room.” UNITED NATIONS-WORLD ECONOMIC FORECAST UN forecasts modest economic recovery but no robust revival UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations is forecasting a modest economic recovery in 2017-18 but warns the projection is an indication of economic stabilization rather than a signal of robust revival. In its annual economic report released today, the U.N. says the world economy expanded by 2.2 percent in 2016, the slowest rate of growth since the 2009 recession. It forecast growth of 2.7 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2018, a slight downward revision from its mid-year predictions in May. The U.N. report says: “Underpinning the sluggish global economy are the feeble pace of global investment, dwindling world trade growth, flagging productivity growth and heavy levels of debt.” It says low commodity prices have exacerbated these factors. Assistant Secretary-General Lenni Montiel has urged redoubled efforts to promote stronger global economic growth. WAL-MART-HIRING Wal-Mart to add about 10,000 retail jobs in the US NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart plans to add about 10,000 retail jobs in the U.S. as it opens new stores and expands existing locations. The world’s biggest retailer said Tuesday that there will also be about 24,000 construction jobs as well. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. says there will be 59 new, expanded and relocated Walmart and Sam’s Clubs facilities. The chain is planning $6.8 billion in capital investments in the U.S. in the coming fiscal year, which starts on Feb. 1. The investments include construction and remodeling of stores, clubs and distribution centers, and the expansion of new services such as online grocery pickup. Last week Amazon announced that it would add 100,000 full-time jobs over the next 18 months. GENERAL MOTORS GM announces $1B factory investment, new jobs DETROIT (AP) — General Motors will make a $1 billion investment in its factories that will create or keep around 1,500 jobs. A person briefed on the matter says the investment is part of the normal process of equipping factories to build new models, and it’s been planned for months. GM also says axle production for its next generation full-size pickup trucks will move to Michigan, creating 450 U.S. jobs. Some of that production had been done in Mexico. And, the Detroit automaker is confirming that a supplier in Michigan will make components for those pick-up trucks, moving 100 supplier jobs from Mexico. SKOREA-HYUNDAI MOTOR-US Hyundai highlights US spending plan before Trump inaugurated SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hyundai Motor Group says it will significantly increase its investment in the U.S. while Donald Trump is president and is considering building a new U.S. factory. A president of the Hyundai group says Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors and their affiliated companies will spend $3.1 billion during the five years through 2021 on research and development and maintaining their factories in Alabama and Georgia. BRITAIN-ROLLS ROYCE Rolls Royce agrees to pay $808 million on bribery claims LONDON (AP) — Jet engine maker Rolls Royce has agreed to pay $808 million to settle bribery and corruption charges brought by authorities in Britain, the U.S. and Brazil. A U.K. High Court judge will examine the deferred prosecution agreement during a public hearing today. The scandal involved intermediaries in overseas markets including Indonesia and China. Rolls-Royce says in a statement that the “voluntary agreements” will result in the suspension of prosecution. But Transparency International’s U.K. executive director Robert Barrington says individuals should be prosecuted so the case serves as a deterrent to bribery. He says that “whether or not this settlement is in the public interest, the key individuals responsible for corrupt behavior must not be allowed to evade justice.” TOBACCO MERGER British American Tobacco agrees on takeover of Reynolds LONDON (AP) — British American Tobacco has agreed to fully take over Reynolds American Inc. on terms that are improved from an initial bid made last year. The takeover would create the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company and combine BAT’s presence in developing countries, where anti-smoking campaigns are not as strong as in the U.S. and Europe, with Reynolds’ almost exclusive focus on the U.S. BAT says it will buy the 57.8 percent of Reynolds it does not already own. Reynolds shareholders will receive for each share $29.44 in cash and 0.5260 BAT shares. BAT says that values Reynolds at $59.64 per share, or $49.4 billion for the stake to be acquired. BAT sells Dunhill, Rothmans and Lucky Strike cigarettes, while Reynolds owns brands like Newport, Camel and Pall Mall. AIRLINES-RANKINGS Hawaiian, Delta top on-time ratings for US airlines UNDATED (AP) — The chances that your flight will be on time and won’t get canceled appear to be looking up. The federal Department of Transportation reports that 86.5 percent of U.S. flights in November arrived on time, an improvement over both the previous month and November 2015. Less than one-third of 1 percent of domestic flights were canceled, the lowest rate in any month since the department started keeping comparable records in 1995. And the rate of bags that got lost, delayed or damaged was the lowest in figures that go back to 1987. Hawaiian Airlines and Delta Air Lines posted the best rates for on-time arrivals, more than 90 percent. Virgin America, which is now owned by Alaska Airlines’ parent, had the worst mark. TAXES-OVERVIEW IRS refund delays could hear the neediest taxpayers WASHINGTON (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service’s battle against fraud and identity theft is intensifying as the tax filing season opens, and some of the neediest taxpayers are getting caught in the middle. The agency is barred from issuing refunds before Feb. 15 on any returns claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit. Congress mandated the delay to give the IRS more time to review returns to try to catch fraudulent ones before refunds are paid out. Dave DuVal, vice president of customer advocacy at TaxAudit.com, says some taxpayers are living “paycheck to paycheck and this is money they’re counting on.” This year’s filing deadline is Tuesday, April 18, since the traditional April 15 date falls on a Saturday, and D.C. Emancipation Day is observed on April 17. IMMACULATA-TUITION REDUCTION Immaculata University to cut tuition by 23% for 2017-18 MALVERN, Pa. (AP) — A Catholic college in suburban Philadelphia says it’s reducing its tuition by 23 percent for the 2017-18 academic year to offset the rising cost of higher education. Tuition to Immaculata University in Chester County will be reset from $34,410 to $26,500 next year. Without the reduction, university officials say tuition including room and board would’ve risen to nearly $50,000 in 2017-18. Immaculata will additionally scale back the amount of funding the school awards in scholarships and grants. As a result, students’ out-of-pocket costs will not reflect much of a change. The tuition reduction follows similar plans executed locally by both Rosemont College and La Salle University. Gerald Wargo Jr., vice president for enrollment management, says the move is all about opening up Immaculata to more potential applicants.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Print Email Bloomberg News By Bloomberg News The Times-Picayune on January 17, 2017 at 11:35 AM comments Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg net for the second time since the election with President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday (Jan. 17) to discuss his company's contract to build the next-generation version of Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, according to two people familiar with plans for the meeting. The conversation was also expected to touch on the company's F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 as the Pentagon's advanced fighter jet, according to one of the people. Both asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting. Trump shook the defense industry -- and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice -- when he tweeted Dec. 6 that "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that Chicago-based Boeing could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. "We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens," Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his "personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company." More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. JUST IN: Boeing CEO arrives at Trump Tower in New York City for a meeting with the President-elect. pic.twitter.com/ERUH3rhVcZ -- CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) January 17, 2017 Boeing isn't the only defense contractor that's felt the fury of Trump's tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for "out of control costs" on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered January 11. Trump also called on Boeing to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet" to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect's criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs "significantly'' on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. At the time of Trump's tweet about Air Force One, it wasn't immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon's top weapons buyer said in an interview that the President-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, "he's heard these big numbers," Frank Kendall said in an interview. "Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They're not contract values, necessarily." "The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion -- the 747s we're buying -- so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means," Kendall said. "We're still negotiating with Boeing on that." Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. "His general interest in reducing costs is terrific- -- his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics," Kendall said. - Tony Capaccio, Kevin Cirilli (c) 2017, Bloomberg Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Business Names in the News Does your company have a recent hire, promotion, appointment or honoree to announce?

Mr Trump called the meeting at Trump Tower in New York after he pressured the Chicago-based aerospace and defence company last month to lower prices on Air Force One and to price a contract with Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter. Boeing is ready to discuss the fighter jet and Air Force One, "but this is the president-elect’s meeting", said Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher. "He and his team will determine the agenda." Mr Trump met the Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg on December 21, and posted a Twitter message the next day saying he had asked Boeing to offer its older-generation aircraft as a possible alternative to the F-35. He had previously threatened to cancel Boeing’s Air Force One presidential aircraft sale, saying the price was too high, and extracted a pledge from Boeing to keep the cost of the programme under US$4 billion. * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Southwest Airlines beats profit forecasts on fare price hike Raytheon hit as F-35 missile maker’s sales slow Ryanair targets Lufthansa’s Frankfurt hub to increase services Qantas relaunches Beijing route after eight-year gap MOST VIEWED Business | All Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet UAE and India pledge to boost bilateral trade by 60% London-based renewables investment adviser to open Dubai office Emirates slashes fares on routes to US, rekindling Open Skies tension UAE military contingent participates in India’s Republic Day parade Etihad Airways to deploy new Dreamliners on Levant and Far East routes Language of money best left to the present Singapore Airlines replaces Boeing 777 on two-stop route Airbus ‘in danger’ as Brexit trigger looms Owning cars, watches or art – directly or via a fund – is an investing option More Most Viewed ‘Ninety bodies found’ at Libyan ISIL camp bombed by US Matchmaking advertising billboards taken down in Dubai Life lessons: ‘My mother is British ... but I am 100 per cent Emirati’ Top Gear cast in Dubai for two-day shoot Emirati and Indian musicians release song to celebrate their countries’ friendship - video Trump changes his mind on Nato Burj Khalifa and Adnoc tower light up in colours of Indian flag Crowds cheer on Ironman 70.3 Dubai competitors and Ironkids Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet US businessman arrested after anti-Muslim tirade at JFK More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: Trump and Iraq’s oil Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent Municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Uncertain times in UAE football as China flexes its financial muscle Christo cancels Arkansas project and will now focus on Abu Dhabi’s The Mastaba About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Eric Berger - Jan 17, 2017 5:09 pm UTC Enlarge / The Soyuz MS-03 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome with NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy of Roscosmos, and ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet on board in November. NASA/Bill Ingalls reader comments 154 Share this story NASA's commercial program holds much promise—the development of private vehicles to transport humans into low Earth orbit should eventually bring down spaceflight costs and broaden access to space. But as is often the case with new spacecraft development, both Boeing and SpaceX have faced technical problems with their capsules. Publicly, NASA has maintained the hope that at least one private vehicle, either Boeing's Starliner or SpaceX's Crew Dragon, would be capable of operational missions by the end of 2017 or early 2018. But that no longer appears certain—or even likely. Meanwhile, NASA still has the International Space Station to maintain and must get its astronauts there through the only means possible. Back in 2015, anticipating delays with the commercial crew program, NASA purchased transport on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft through 2018. But that may not be long enough, the agency has decided. Seats for 2019 Further ReadingNASA officials mulling the possibility of purchasing Soyuz seats for 2019Last September, based upon anonymous sources, Ars reported that NASA had begun considering buying additional seats in 2019 as a hedge against further delays with the commercial crew program. Both NASA Administrator Charles Bolden and the agency's head of human spaceflight, Bill Gerstenmaier, subsequently denied this report. These dismissive comments notwithstanding, a new solicitation filed by NASA on Tuesday reveals that the agency is indeed seeking to purchase Soyuz seats for 2019 (NASA will negotiate with Boeing for these additional seats, which Boeing received from Russia's Energia as compensation for the settlement of a lawsuit involving the Sea Launch joint venture). The solicitation seeks an option to buy three additional Soyuz seats in 2019 "as a primary or backup transportation capability to ensure proper launch cadence with no gaps in crew rotation transportation." The solicitation comes just three days before Bolden, a champion of the commercial crew program who has sparred with Congress over funding, leaves office. It seems likely the notification is timed such that there still is time for Russia to build additional Soyuz launch capacity for 2019, while also allowing the current NASA leadership to bypass this politically sensitive issue before leaving office on January 20 when Donald Trump is inaugurated. Undoubtedly, Congress will not be positively predisposed to funding requests for additional Russian seats, especially because the price keeps going up. Since the decision to retire the space shuttle in 2009, the Russian price for a seat has skyrocketed from about $30 million for a trip into orbit to $81.9 million for each of the six seats NASA bought for 2018. It seems likely the price for any seats in 2019 would increase substantially, especially because NASA would be providing less than the three years of lead time as is customary for such orders. More seats in 2017 and 2018 The new NASA request also seeks an additional two seats in 2017 and 2018. This is possible because Russia will scale back its presence on the space station for the next couple of years, from three crew per six months to two, as it seeks to pare expenses. By reducing the number of its crew members, Russia will need to fly fewer Progress cargo ships, which deliver food and supplies to the Russian side of the station. Further ReadingSpace station crew may drop to five because of Russia This Russian decision will make room for one crew member in the fall of 2017 as well as the spring of 2018, and NASA would like to buy those two rides into space, as well, to increase crew time for science research on board the station. "The purchase of these services in 2017 and 2018 will increase US crew size on the ISS from three to four crew members to maximize ISS science utilization," the NASA solicitation states. "Maximizing science utilization of the ISS is a program priority." The additional seats for NASA and US partners would not kick in until September of this year, meaning that Fyodor Yurchikhin and Jack Fischer will still fly as a crew of two in March.

RedEye Get can't-miss events, buzz on top bars & the hottest restaurants delivered to your inbox Business Trump talks on Air Force One cost make progress, Boeing CEO says Whoosh Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune Air Force One lands Oct. 27, 2015, at O'Hare International Airport.  Air Force One lands Oct. 27, 2015, at O'Hare International Airport.  (Michael Tercha / Chicago Tribune) Tony Capaccio and Kevin CirilliBloomberg Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said he "made some great progress" in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect's demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One. In addition to Boeing's contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company's F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-35 as the Pentagon's advanced fighter jet. "We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft," Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification." Trump has shaken the defense industry -- and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice -- with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of "the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases," although no specific reductions have yet been announced. "I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business," Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. "We're on the same page here." Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, its CEO touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports.  "You want manufacturing jobs -- aerospace is the place to invest," Muilenburg said. "We're proud to take on that mission." Trump's public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. Trump suggests he would ditch F-35 in favor of alternate F-18 from Boeing Missy Ryan President-elect Donald Trump piled on fresh criticism of the Pentagon's most sophisticated aircraft on Thursday, suggesting that he might abandon the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in favor of a cheaper plane due to high costs. In a message on Twitter, Trump said that cost overruns in Lockheed Martin... President-elect Donald Trump piled on fresh criticism of the Pentagon's most sophisticated aircraft on Thursday, suggesting that he might abandon the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in favor of a cheaper plane due to high costs. In a message on Twitter, Trump said that cost overruns in Lockheed Martin... (Missy Ryan) "We're going to get it done for less than that, and we're committed to working together to make sure that happens," Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his "personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company." More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn't the only defense contractor that's felt the fury of Trump's tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for "out of control costs" on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11. Trump also called on Boeing to "price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet," referring to the company's F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect's criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs "significantly'' on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems, a key subcontractor on the program.

Now there's an app that will send a phone notification to users if Trump tweets about any companies where they own stock. The feature was created by Trigger Finance, an app that notifies, or "triggers," users... (Karen Turner) "Over a period there's no question we've been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period," Carr said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday from Davos. "We respect that and we'll work towards a contribution towards that." At the time of Trump's tweet about Air Force One, it wasn't immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon's top weapons buyer said in an interview that the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, "he's heard these big numbers," Frank Kendall said in an interview. "Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They're not contract values, necessarily." "The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion -- the 747s we're buying -- so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means," Kendall said. "We're still negotiating with Boeing on that." Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    5426391 President-elect Donald Trump will meet with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg Tuesday to discuss the cost of replacing Air Force One, Bloomberg News reports. This will be the second meeting between Trump and Muilenburg as president-elect, and comes just over a month after Trump criticized the plans to replace the aging fleet of Boeing 747s on Twitter, declaring “cancel order.” (RELATED: Trump Tweets: ‘Cancel Order’ For $4 Billion Air Force One Plane)   Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 “The plane is totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower Dec. 6. Calling the cost “ridiculous,” Trump said he thinks “Boeing is doing a little bit of a number” on taxpayers. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” Trump said. Boeing is currently under a $170 million contract with the Air Force for initial stages of the Air Force One replacement, which would not be complete until at least 2024. Muilenburg met with Trump just before Christmas and gave the president-elect his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company” that costs would be controlled. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said to reporters after meeting with Trump in Mar-a-Lago, Fl., Dec. 21. Trump has already shown an interest in renegotiating high-value defense contracts. Trump met with Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson earlier in January to discuss ways to bring down future costs on an over-budget program. “We are close to a deal that will bring the cost down significantly from the previous lot of aircraft to the next lot of aircraft and moreover it’s going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States,” Hewson told reporters after the meeting Friday afternoon.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Boeing’s difficult journey from racism to diversity Originally published January 16, 2017 at 6:00 am Updated January 16, 2017 at 5:33 pm Since Boeing hired its first two black “Rosie the Riveters” in 1942, horizons have expanded. But today’s workers are divided on how close to colorblind the workplace comes. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter “I will not recommend for membership in this union any other than members of the white race.” That may sound like some old declaration from the Deep South. But until after World War II, that was part of the oath sworn by members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) union, which represented Boeing workers in the Puget Sound region. The union, which organized the Boeing workforce here in 1935, was hardly the sole barrier to racial integration at Boeing. From the company’s founding in 1916, management had not hired a single black person.

Massachusetts St., Seattle More info: 206-518-6000 or naamnw.org/event/martin-luther-king-jr-day-celebration Prewar, such employment bans were pervasive throughout U.S. industry, even here in what’s now one of the country’s most politically liberal regions. Boeing hired its first two black “Rosie the Riveters” in 1942 to build bombers for the war effort — more than nine months after a presidential order banning discrimination at defense companies — and afterward progressed only slowly toward equality. Interviews with current and former employees trace a difficult journey spanning 75 years from the reluctant hiring of those black Rosies through today — when young African Americans can take advantage of Boeing’s official policy encouraging diversity and equal opportunity. (Boeing declined to share the racial demographics of its current workforce.) In recent years a handful of African Americans have risen to prominent positions in the company. Joan Robinson-Berry held various engineering and supplier management roles at Boeing and now heads the company’s growing Charleston, S.C., complex. The highly regarded former chief financial officer James Bell in 2005 served for four months as Boeing’s interim chief executive after a scandal ousted his boss. Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, is widely viewed as a possible future chief executive. Yet even now, with race remaining a divisive issue in America, some black employees find the workplace reality at Boeing still falls short of the colorblind ideal. “Employment for Negroes impossible at Boeings,” reads a headline in the Nov. 8, 1940, issue of Northwest Enterprise. Racist history Even as World War II approached and the nation began a rapid buildup of defense workers, Boeing management resisted a federal edict to cease discrimination, according to Battle at Boeing, a Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History project at the University of Washington. In the fall of 1940, Thurgood Marshall, then a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and later a Supreme Court justice, wrote to the Seattle branch of the organization noting that Boeing had just been granted a $7 million government bomber contract. Marshall encouraged the local branch to push for the hiring of blacks. The union local’s newspaper in June 1940 focuses on whether to bar blacks. After black leaders threatened to bring thousands of protesters to the White House in April 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring companies with government contracts to cease racial discrimination. Local activists in Seattle mounted an intense public campaign to have Boeing comply with the order. Yet in the following months, although Boeing was hiring 1,000 people a week, none of them were African Americans. That July, in a letter to the NAACP’s Washington state branch, Boeing personnel manager Paul Fredrickson conveniently ignored the company’s pre-IAM history of never hiring African Americans and put the blame entirely on the union. He cited the closed-shop bargaining agreement with the IAM’s Local 751 and pointed out that “only those of the Caucasian race are acceptable” to the union. By 1942, the needs of the war effort finally forced a management reversal and African Americans, mostly women at first, were hired. The union only reluctantly acceded, according to Seattle’s African American newspaper at the time, Northwest Enterprise. “We rather resent that the war situation has been used to alter an old established custom,” IAM representative James Duncan said. Even months after it became illegal for defense companies to discriminate, the union defended its ban. The African Americans that Boeing hired were required to pay for special temporary “work permits” that cost more than union dues, allowing them to work even though they were still barred from the union. By 1944, about 1,600 blacks worked at Boeing locally, in a workforce of nearly 43,000 that was churning out B-17 bombers at phenomenal rates. Defense hiring at Boeing and at Puget Sound shipyards brought an influx of African Americans to the region, mostly from the South. According to a history of Seattle race relations by Howard Droker, Seattle’s black population doubled between 1940 and 1944 to about 8,000. The racist clause in the IAM oath was removed in 1946, after the war. Only then did Boeing truly begin to open up to African Americans. A black Rosie the Riveter Lou Annie Charles, now 94, was one of those early black “Rosie the Riveters.” She still lives in her Central District home, paid for, in large part, by her long career at Boeing. Lou Annie Charles, 94, is one of the original Rosie the Riveters from World War II. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times) Born in Muskogee, Okla., she was raised on a farm where she picked cotton and grew vegetables. Charles trained as a riveter in the early 1940s under a New Deal program and was hired in 1943 to work for 60 cents an hour at Boeing’s airplane plant in Wichita, Kan., where she assembled B-29 Superfortress bombers. “It gave me an opportunity to help my parents,” Charles said. “I sent money home. That was a good feeling, to have money to help them.” After the war when Charles and many other Wichita workers were laid off, she moved to Seattle, where the company rehired her in 1950. At the old Plant 2 in Seattle and later in Renton and Everett, Charles worked at Boeing for another 38 years until her retirement in 1988. “I did nothing but rivet,” she said. “I enjoyed it.” The Boeing job allowed her to buy her home in 1956 — a time when the Central District was the only neighborhood open to black people for homeownership — and to put her two children through college. Her daughter became an airline flight attendant, her son a police officer and later an attorney. Recalling her early days working at Boeing, Charles said she met very little racial bias. “Most of the time, I’d be the only black woman in the shop,” she said. “I never had any problem with anyone not wanting to work with me.” She got on well with her workmates, though she said some of her supervisors were prejudiced and “not too nice.” Charles recalls her working life at Boeing fondly and still sends Christmas cards to the remaining members of her old crew. The union’s record Emerson Hamilton, an IAM union official, will be 70 next month and plans to retire in two weeks. Starting in 1979, he worked at Boeing in Seattle and Auburn, making airplane parts for 20 years, then was hired by the union as a full-time staff member. “The Boeing Company is a good company to work for,” Hamilton said. “They provide good jobs. I have no complaints about the benefits and pay. Just some people in management.” In his experience, said Hamilton, the company slapped down any instances of overt racial harassment. “They did not allow that,” he said. “If they ever caught anybody doing it, they always took corrective action.” Boeing: 100 years of flight The people who shaped Boeing — Part 1: Dupler, Mulally, Huntman and Grieser The people who shaped Boeing — Part 2: Lopez, Corvi and Albaugh The people who shaped Boeing — Part 3: Condit, Sutter and Darcy-Henneman From cloth to carbon fiber, a timeline of Boeing’s 100-year flight In good times and bad, Boeing’s force field has shaped region’s fortunes Talton: Formidable challenges loom in Boeing’s next century Flying high: an interactive look at Boeing’s 100-year history Yet he recalls having to fight for his rights in his early years on the shop floor. He found that management constantly left him behind under a grading system that determined whether workers could move up to better positions. “I was training some of the young white guys who came in and they’d get upgraded before me,” he said. “I fought against that.” After he protested to an official in the company’s equal employment-opportunity unit, he got his upgrade. Hamilton said it was similar issues that in 1994 led several dozen African-American employees in the Puget Sound region to file a class-action lawsuit against Boeing, representing about 4,000 black employees. “African Americans were getting fed up,” he said. “They didn’t think they were being upgraded like they should.” After civil-rights activist Jesse Jackson helped broker a $15 million settlement, Boeing donated $50,000 to Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition organization. However, an appeals court reversed the settlement in 2002 and a federal jury later ruled that Boeing had not discriminated in its handling of the promotion system. (A new lawsuit alleging racial discrimination, filed in June by an employee at Boeing’s satellite unit in El Segundo, Calif., is pending.) Hamilton recalls how former district 751 President Bill Johnson and his successor, Mark Blondin, worked to try to make up for some of the union’s history of racism. One gesture involved giving special recognition to Roman Mayfield, one of the first African Americans in the union who became a long-serving shop steward. Though in his early years at the company Mayfield wasn’t allowed in the union, the IAM in 2000 retroactively granted him membership for those years, and honored him with various awards before his death two years later. Yet Hamilton said the union still has some way to go. He says there have never been more than one or two black faces among the slate of full-time union officials, his being one of them. “I take that as a token,” Hamilton said. A double minority Omar Abdul-Alim, 50, joined Boeing in 1989 after leaving the Army. He works as a mechanic in Renton, pressurizing 737 fuel tanks to test the seals before the planes roll out. Omar Abdul-Alim joined Boeing in 1989 after getting out of the Army. He describes his time there as bittersweet — partly due to being a minority in both race and faith. He is African American and Muslim. (Bettina Hansen/The Seattle Times) Abdul-Alim is a double minority: An African American, he grew up Baptist in Rainier Beach, then converted to Islam at age 30. In 2000, he married a Somali immigrant and is active today at a Tukwila mosque popular with the Somali community. He’s grateful that the job at Boeing has given him what it gave generations of local workers without a college degree: the chance to earn good money and create a comfortable middle-class life. Some of the African-American males he hung around with as a youngster sank into lives of drugs and prison. “A few of us were able to escape,” Abdul-Alim said. “I and a few of my friends, we’ve been the blessed ones.” Yet management actions have recently soured his view of Boeing. “It’s not the same company we hired into,” Abdul-Alim said, a common lament among Boeing veterans of every skin color since the last contract froze their pensions. A forceful personality, he said he won’t put up with disrespect on matters of race or religion, whether it comes from a Somali immigrant treating him as an outsider or from a prejudiced white American. “There are people who are ignorant,” Abdul-Alim said. “But I have a thick skin. I have no problem defending myself.” Even though he’s endured a few incidents of hostility to Islam at work, he says “my being an African American was more of an obstacle for me at Boeing than being a Muslim.” Boeing grants accommodations in his schedule to allow him to do his Islamic prayers five times daily. He has a prayer rug at work. What he finds harder to fight against than open hostility from an individual is what he perceives as covert racism from some supervisors. Echoing the complaints of those in that 1990s lawsuit, he said at times he’s seen less-qualified white workers given transfers to better jobs ahead of him. And he said he’s been unfairly disciplined for arguments at work that grew out of racial harassment. “Boeing says it’s open opportunities for everybody. I don’t find that to be true,” he said. Young, black, hopeful For LaDonna Perkins, 25, who next month will complete two years as an engineer at Boeing, the experience so far has been entirely positive, full of openness, encouragement and possibility. She grew up in the small city of Wetumpka, Ala., The daughter of a clothing-factory worker and a carpenter, she’s the first in her immediate family to go to college. Perkins did two summer internships at Boeing before being hired full time. She now works in Renton in the cabin-interiors unit, as a project manager working on an airplane lavatory-lighting system. Of about 50 engineers who graduated with her from the University of Alabama, six were black and three were women. Although she’s the only woman in her five-person work group at Boeing, the larger organization of some 120 people that she’s part of has about 10 percent African Americans, she estimates. “I was very surprised. On my first day at work, I saw three African-American women in my first group,” Perkins said. “In the interiors organization we do have a really diverse group, different people of color and from different countries.” She hasn’t come across any bias. “I grew up in Alabama. I’ve seen prejudice,” she said. “I haven’t experienced that at Boeing.” The encouragement of her manager “pushed me to think of all the things I can do at Boeing,” she said, and she’s taken advantage of Boeing-sponsored courses in professional development and technical matters. She also attended a company diversity conference in California with about 900 employees from all over the country, where she met chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and several vice presidents. “The culture at Boeing is very inclusive,” Perkins said. She’s become an evangelist for engineering and for Boeing to people back home in Wetumpka. “I’ve had a couple of people Facebook message me asking what are the steps to become an engineer,” Perkins said. In 10 years, she said, her goal is to be a Boeing vice president herself.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Nation & World Nation & World Politics Trump meeting today with Boeing CEO over Air Force One Originally published January 16, 2017 at 9:43 pm Updated January 17, 2017 at 9:34 am Trump tweeted Dec. 6 that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Share story By Tony Capaccio Bloomberg News Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg was meeting for the second time since the election with President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday to discuss his company’s contract to build the next-generation version of Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, according to two people familiar with plans to hold the meeting. Muilenburg arrived for the meeting Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in New York. The conversation between the two also will touch on the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced fighter jet, according to one of the people. Both asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting. Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” although no specific reductions have yet been announced.

His public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that Chicago-based Boeing could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.” More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered January 11. Trump even called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet” to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly’’ on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. At the time of Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, it wasn’t immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said in an interview that the President-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, “he’s heard these big numbers,” Frank Kendall said in an interview. “Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They’re not contract values, necessarily.” “The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion — the 747s we’re buying — so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means,” Kendall said. “We’re still negotiating with Boeing on that.” Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. “His general interest in reducing costs is terrific- — his focus on that is good, but I think there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specifics,” Kendall said.

Iran Air took delivery last week of the first of 100 jets it has ordered from Airbus (EADSF). The first of 80 aircraft from Boeing (BA) are scheduled to arrive in 2018. The badly needed jets will reconstitute Iran's decrepit commercial aircraft fleet, which has been languishing under decades of Western sanctions. Peter Roskam, a Republican member of the House, introduced a bill on Friday to initiate an investigation by the Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence into Iran Air and the nation's other airlines. If Iran Air or any other airline were to be found to support the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or foreign terrorist organizations, the airline would be added to the U.S. sanctions list and be prevented from receiving new aircraft or U.S.-made parts. That would effectively freeze the sale of jets from Boeing to Iran. The legislation would exert little control over the Airbus aircraft that are already delivered, but the airline would not be able to receive spare parts for those planes, or receive any maintenance outside of Iran. If Iran Air received maintenance or parts outside of Iran, that provider would be barred from doing business with the U.S. market. Mahan Air, Iran's second biggest carrier, is still on the sanctions list for aiding Iran's military and is barred from buying Western planes and parts. A new Airbus delivered to Iran Air. Iran drops plan to buy A380 superjumbo Iran Air was removed from the U.S. sanctions list in January 2016 as part of an agreement to convince Iran to restrain its nuclear program. It opened the path for multi-billion dollar sales by Boeing and Airbus. That prompted an outcry from some lawmakers like Roskam, who said the Obama administration offered no proof that Iran Air had stopped its support of the Iranian military or designated terrorist organizations. Roskam and other critics of the sales say Iran Air was removed from the sanctions list for political reasons to complete the six-nation diplomatic agreement The Treasury Department, in a November 23 letter to Roskam, defended the nuclear deal and said Iran Air was cleared from sanctions after a review "of its activity to ensure" sales would be "consistent with our national security and foreign policy goals." Boeing's Iran deal won't prevent production cut The new bill restarts an earlier effort by Roskam. He introduced a bill with a similar aim last year -- the House passed it, but the Senate didn't act. Now Republicans have control of Congress and President-elect Trump has been sharply critical of the nuclear agreement. Boeing, which has said it has proceeded cautiously into a deal with Iran Air, has said repeatedly that it will continue to take its cues from the U.S. government. The company declined to comment on the Roskam bill.

The conversation also will touch on the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced fighter jet, according to one of the people. Both asked not to be identified discussing a private meeting. Trump shook the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — when he tweeted Dec. 6 that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that Chicago-based Boeing could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.” More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for over 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered January 11. Trump also called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet” to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly” on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. At the time of Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, it wasn’t immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said in an interview that the President-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract.

Last month, Boeing’s Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump and told him that his company can build a new Air Force One for less than originally quoted. Trump made headlines for blasting the company on Twitter for alleged cost overruns and called on the government to cancel the contract. The paper reported that it is unclear what the two will discuss at the meeting. Muilenburg has appeared to strike an agreeable tone with the incoming president and said he made a “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing company.” Since early December, Trump has been browbeating Boeing and Lockheed Martin over the costs of the next Air Force One and the F-35, respectively. “I don't need a $4.2 billion airplane to fly around in,” Trump told “Fox News Sunday” earlier this month, referring to Air Force One.

Saturday, 28 January 2017 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview US Congress Renews Push to Sabotage Iran’s Jet Deals: Report News ID: 1298974 Service: Economy January, 17, 2017 - 13:37 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – A bill has been introduced in the US Congress that could scuttle the aircraft deals between Airbus and Boeing and Iran, a report said. Peter Roskam, a Republican member of the House, introduced a bill on Friday to initiate an investigation by the incoming Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence into Iran’s airliners, including Iran Air, according to CNN. If Iran Air or any other airline were to be found to support the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the airline would be added to the US sanctions list and be prevented from receiving new aircraft or US-made parts. That would effectively freeze the sale of jets from Boeing to Iran, the report added.  During a January 2016 visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Tehran signed a major contract with Airbus worth about $27 billion to buy 118 planes. Iran Air took delivery last week of the first of the jets it has ordered from Airbus. Iran sealed another deal in June worth around $25 billion with the US aerospace heavyweight, Boeing, for the purchase of 100 passenger planes. In December, the deal with Boeing was finalized, allowing Iran to buy 80 planes within 10 years. The first deliveries are expected in 2018. While Western plane makers are very keen on trade with Iran, Washington still demands that even non-American manufacturers wishing to sell to Iran obtain an export license if their products include materials made in the United States. Airbus, based in Europe, buys more than 40 percent of all its aircraft parts from the US.

Lee Khim Fatt, the husband of Foong Wai Yueng, a flight attendant on the plane, told the Associated Press he was extremely disappointed that the search has been suspended, but still holds a small glimmer of hope that his wife is alive. “I told my children to keep praying.

The Boeing 777 disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board, sparking a two-and-a-half year search that has focused on the Indian Ocean. Authorities from Malaysia, Australia and China initially expected to finish searching a 120,000 sq km (46,000 sq mile) target area by the end of 2016, but bad weather has delayed the probe by another two months. The end of the search without the aircraft being discovered will bring fresh heartache for families. But the reason why the plane crashed and disappeared looks like it will forever remain a mystery and something which conspiracy theorists will continue to speculate on. Here, Mirror Online looks at some of the bizarre conspiracies over the missing plane. Have your say in the comments section belowComment Below Missing: The flight disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board Read More Search for Missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 ENDED nearly three years after jet disappeared with 239 on board Plane was shot down during military ops A shocking book claims that missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may have been accidentally shot down and the search for survivors covered up. ‘Flight MH370: The Mystery ’ makes the incredible allegation that the airline was shot down by US-Thai strike fighters as part of a training drill that went horribly wrong. But just 71 days after the Boeing 777 vanished carrying 239 people from 14 nations relatives say the UK published work is ‘too soon’ and ‘too insensitive’. The book says the drill was to involve mock warfare on land, in water and in the air, and would include live-fire exercises. It adds: “Say a participant accidentally shot down Flight MH370. Such things do happen. No one wants another Lockerbie, so those involved would have every reason to keep quiet about it.” Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next Rapper "predicted loss of plane" Rapper Pitbull predicted that Flight MH370 would go missing YEARS ago, it has been suggested. Conspiracy theorists have been drawing comparisons between the lyrics of his 2012 track Get It Started and the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the plane on March 8. Lines in the song, which features a guest appearance from Colombian singer Shakira, include: "Now it's off to Malaysia" and "Two passports, three cities, two countries, one day." Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Viewers on YouTube are convinced the two passports is a reference to the stolen Austrian and Italian passports used by two Iranians to board MH370. They also believe the three cities refer to the capital cities of Malaysia, China and Vietnam and the two countries are Malaysia and Vietnam. Ex-PM joins conspiracy theorists Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused the CIA of known the whereabouts of flight MH370. He said in a blog that someone was hide something because if the plane's GPS system failed then Boeing or the US government agency would know why. In his blog in 2015, the 88-year-old suggests that in the event of the jet being hijacked, then control of the aircraft could have been remotely activated elsewhere. He said: "Clearly Boeing and certain agencies have the capacity to take over uninterruptible control of commercial airliners of which MH370 B777 is one. He added: "Someone is hiding something. It is not fair that MAS and Malaysia should take the blame." US military base conspiracy The United States have been forced to flatly deny claims that the plane landed at its military base on the remote island of Diego Garcia. There were strong rumours that the jetliner could have headed for the small coral atoll in the Indian Ocean, which sits around 3,500km from Malaysia. However, a spokesman for the US embassy in the Malaysian capital said there was no truth in this speculation. He told Malaysia's Star newspaper by email: "There was no indication that MH370 flew anywhere near the Maldives or Diego Garcia. "MH370 did not land in Diego Garcia." Afghan hijacking (Photo: Reuters) A Russian newspaper claimed MH370 has been hijacked and flown to Afghanistan, where the crew and passengers were being held captive. A military source reportedly told the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper: "Flight MH370 Malaysia Airlines missing on March 8 with 239 passengers was hijacked. "Pilots are not guilty; the plane was hijacked by unknown terrorists. We know that the name of the terrorist who gave instructions to pilots is "Hitch. "The plane is in Afghanistan not far from Kandahar near the border with Pakistan." Others have since gone on to indicate that the passengers have been divided into seven groups and are living in mud huts with almost no food. MH370 'hid' behind another plane Early in the search it was suggested that the plane may have hidden from detection under another plane. Blogger Keith Ledgerwood suggested: "It is my belief that MH370 likely flew in the shadow of [Singapore Airlines flight] 68 through India and Afghanistan airspace. "As MH370 was flying 'dar' without a transponder, SIA 68 would have had no knowledge that MH370 was anywhere around as it entered Indian airspace, it would have shown up as one single blip on the radar with only the transponder information of SIA68 lighting up ATC and military radar screens". This theory was described as feasible but the planes would have to be within 3,300ft of each other. Alien abduction Social media users have jumped on the possibility of extraterrestrial life having something to do with the missing plane. One user wrote: "After an extensive conversation with my father & his partner, we have come to the conclusion that the only explanation is #aliens mh370." Another added: "I secretly believe that plane is abducted by aliens.. I know I’m not the only one.." And one user even said there were only two possibilities for its disappearance, aliens or a DB Cooper-style heist. He wrote: "This Malaysian airlines flight has the potential to be either the greatest heist since DB Cooper, or alien abduction. I vote aliens." A life insurance scam The Malaysian police chief refused to rule out the possibility of the missing plane being an elaborate insurance scam. Khalid Abu Bakar addressed the world in 2015 to provide an update on the investigation and revealed authorities were exploring every single avenue - no matter how remote. "Maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money, you know, we are looking at all possibilities," he said. The authorities' investigations extend to examining every detail of the passengers for any clues as to what may have happened. "We are looking very closely at the video footage taken at the KLIA (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), we are studying the behavioural pattern of all the passengers," he added. The Illuminati Reddit users have seemingly taken a keen interest in the disappearance. One, known only as i-am-SHER-locked apparently uncovered that the Boeing 777 in question was the 404th such aircraft to be produced. "An HTTP 404 error means not found," they wrote. "Which in this case is oddly appropriate for the status of the aircraft, or just a coincidence. "Coincidence, I think not." Edward Snowden (Photo: Getty) There were early suggestions 20 employees from the Texas-based Freescale Semiconductor were on board the flight. So Reddit user Dark_Spectre has put two and two together and come up with, well, you decide. "So we have the American IBM Technical Storage Executive for Malaysia, a man working in mass storage aggregation for the company implicated by the Snowden papers for providing their services to assist the National Security Agency in surveilling the Chinese," he wrote. "And now this bunch of US chip guys working for a global leader in embedded processing solutions (embedded smart phone tech and defense contracting) all together..on a plane..And disappeared.. Coincidence??" He goes on to that the plane itself was kidnapped by Chinese authorities to uncover more about Snowden's revelations. Electronic warfare experiment A theory suggesting the plane was hidden as part of an experiment has circulated. Citizens news site Beforeitsnews.com reported: "It is conceivable that the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 plane is 'cloaked', hiding with hi-tech electronic warfare weaponry that exists and is used. "In fact, this type of technology is precisely the expertise of Freescale, that has 20 employees on board the missing flight." It also sparked theories the plane could have been taken by North Korea for similarly unknown purposes. A reddit user wrote: “There’s no telling what crazy logic they [North Korea] might have for taking a plane. They literally have no grasp of reality and have been caught red handed kidnapping foreigners, making s**t up and generally being d****es.” Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next Fire One of the most widely held theories is that there was a fire on board that killed all on board but burned out before damaging the exterior of the plane. This would explain why the aircraft, on auto-pilot, would fly such a long distance off course. An aviation source said that if this was the case, it would have hit the water at around 600mph after gliding down from 35,000ft. The source said: “The plane would not have dropped like a stone, it would have glided down from 35,000ft for around 10-12 minutes after it had exhausted its fuel. “It would have hit the water with a massive impact - as though the plane had landed on concrete. Nobody could have survived that. “There would have been a huge explosion with the wings ripped off and the fuselage would probably have plummeted straight down.” A military take out or secret weapon at work Conspiracy theory and scientific site Natural News, run by Mike Adams, has another theory. Adams said: “If we never find the debris, it means some entirely new, mysterious and powerful force is at work on our planet, which can pluck airplanes out of the sky without leaving behind even a shred of evidence." He added: “If there does exist a weapon with such capabilities, whoever controls it already has the ability to dominate all of Earth's nations with a fearsome military weapon of unimaginable power." He believes the plane fell into an area "outside the search zone" and could lead to a very dark end for Earth. (Photo: Getty) Pilot suicide One explanation for the sudden disappearance, according to some, could be pilot suicide. But so far no evidence has come to light to suggest either captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid had such intentions. John Brennan, head of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), told the Daily Mail, when asked if it was a possibility: "I think you cannot discount any theory." Malaysian police have attempted to investigate whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery. Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said at a news conference: "We are looking at all possibilities." Other theorists have claimed the pilot or crew could have hijacked the plane themselves. But Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director of Malaysia Airlines, said the captain in charge of the flight was a very seasoned pilot with an excellent record. "There have been absolutely no implications that we are aware of that there was anything untoward in either his behaviour or attitude," Dunleavy told Reuters in an interview. "We have no reason to believe that there was anything, any actions, internally by the crew that caused the disappearance of this aircraft." Cracks in the aircraft Six months before the plane went down, the U.S. aviation watchdog warned airlines of a problem with cracks in Boeing 777s that could lead to a mid-air break up or a catastrophic drop in pressure. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an alert in September last year giving airlines until April 9 to detect and correct cracking in the fuselage skin on Boeing 777s. The FAA warned that failure to do so would leave the aircraft vulnerable to ‘a rapid decompression and loss of structural integrity’. The organisation issued a final directive just two days before the Malaysia Airlines plane took off and said one airline had found a 16-in crack in the fuselage skin of a 14-year-old plane. However, Boeing said that the FAA alert did not apply to the missing jet because it did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing 777s. It's in an Asian Bermuda triangle The idea there could be a second Bermuda Triangle seems a popular one on social media. Its sudden and unexplained disappearance from radar could have several explanations, whether it be a sudden explosion or mid-air disintegration, or even a mechanical failure. But some theorists believe it simply means the plane has entered another Devil's Triangle. Boats and planes have been known to disappear in the patch of sea in the North Atlantic Ocean, known as the Bermuda Triangle, including Flight 19 in 1945, when five torpedo bombers mysteriously vanished. But could there really be another one? One Twitter user wrote: "So...what is up with this Malaysian airplane thing? Is there an Asian version of the Bermuda Triangle?" Another added: "Maybe there's such thing as Asian bermuda triangle. #Malaysia #MalaysiaAirlines." Terrorists crashed it into the sea No terrorist groups have claimed responsibility for the missing flight, but that hasn't stopped theorists claiming it's the only explanation. The two passengers who boarded the plane with stolen passports really triggered this possibility, with many believing they must be part of a huge cover up to sink the plane. Pilot David Learmount, who is operations and safety editor of Flight Global magazine, said: “Something happened and the pilots did not tell anyone. Why? It’s a good question. “It’s extraordinary the pilots failed to call because they had plenty of time to. Unless there was a bomb on board but there has been no evidence of that.” Other groups, however, have claimed responsibility over the last few days, including an unknown Chinese group. An email was sent to various journalists in China, saying: “You kill one of our clan, we will kill 100 of you as payback.” But officials in Malaysia have said they believe the group's claim could be a hoax. The email did not explain what had happened to the plane. Pilot 'deliberately turned off passengers' oxygen supply' before ditching into sea (Photo: Getty) Passengers on flight MH370 died of oxygen starvation hours before the pilot performed a controlled ditching in the Indian Ocean, according to a study into the disaster. Analysis by a veteran air accident investigator suggests all 239 people lost consciousness up to four hours before the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared beneath the waves. The most likely scenario is that pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately depressurised the cabin, thereby depriving those on board of air, the research concludes. Although oxygen masks would have dropped down automatically from above the seats, their supply was limited to just 20 minutes. Those unable to grab a mask, including sleeping passengers, would have passed out within the space of a few minutes. Pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah is prime suspect because he cleared his diary The captain of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was a prime suspect in the jet’s disappearance – because he had made no future plans. Back in 2015, detectives from Malaysia’s special branch found Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, had cleared his diary of social or work commitments, unlike his crew. The inquiry made him the most likely culprit if the plane was lost due to human intervention.

Aviation experts and government officials remain baffled over the mystery of the jet and the fate of the 239 people aboard.

MUST WATCH What caused Air France 447 crash 02:55 The passenger jet, an Airbus A330, took off from Rio de Janeiro headed to Paris on May 31 of that year. A few hours later, as it crossed the Atlantic, it told control center its position. That was the last contact with the plane. Its last known position -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports -- complicated the searches. It took almost two years before the bulk of the wreckage, the majority of bodies, and the voice and data recorders were recovered. All 228 people aboard died. French authorities said ice crystals disrupted the system used to determine the plane's airspeed, causing the autopilot to disconnect. The plane plunged into the ocean. 2003: Boeing 727 JUST WATCHED 2014: Joe Padilla, missing since flight disappeared in 2003 Replay More Videos ...

It took off from the main international airport in the city on May 25 of that year, headed for Burkina Faso. It departed with its lights off and a dysfunctional transponder. There are conflicting reports on the number of people in the jet, but flight engineer Ben Charles Padilla is believed to be one of them. Some reports say he was alone, while others say three people were aboard. The plane has not been heard from since. Its whereabouts are unknown to this day. 1999: EgyptAir Flight 990 A National Transportation Safety Board Official stands with piles of wreckage from EgyptAir Flight 990 on November 1, 2000. The passenger jet made a rapid descent, plunging almost 14,000 feet in 36 seconds. The Boeing 767, en route to Cairo from New York City, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusetts coast in October of that year. Though its debris was later found, speculation remains on the cause of the crash that killed all 217 people on board. Theories included a possible suicide by the pilot or co-pilot, complete with tales of a chaotic struggle for controls in the cockpit. Egyptian authorities have said a mechanical failure was the cause. 1947: British Stardust The British aircraft vanished after takeoff from Buenos Aires, headed to Chile.

A flight instructor flew one plane, and qualified pilots were in the others, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Radio transmissions indicated that the instructor got lost when compasses malfunctioned. Radio contact was lost before the exact problem was determined, and no traces of the planes were ever found. Adding to the mystery, a search aircraft sent to look for Flight 19 also disappeared. The patrol plane, which took off later that day, has not been seen or heard from since. Flight 19 was reported in the area informally known as the Bermuda Triangle. 1942: British fighter JUST WATCHED WWII plane wreckage found 70 years later Replay More Videos ...

Tim Hepher – Over the past two decades, planemakers Airbus and Boeing have traded the crown in the annual orders race, and it was usually clear who had bragging rights in the fiercely competitive $120 billion annual jet market. On Wednesday, Airbus retained the top spot when it said it had recorded a total of 731 net orders for 2016, beating Boeing’s tally of 668 for the year released a week ago. Standing out as the unusual kingmaker between the two Western giants is Iran, emerging from decades of sanctions to place billions of dollars of new orders. Because of fragile demand elsewhere, its comeback carries unusual weight. While Airbus included all but two of the 100 aircraft it sold to Iran last year, its American arch-rival did not include the 80 aircraft it sold to the country. It is unclear why Airbus formally reported Iranian orders while Boeing did not, and what criteria were used by each company in making their decisions. Airbus is further ahead in the sales process; Iran took delivery of its first Airbus jet on Wednesday, while Boeing’s planes will be delivered from 2018. A source close to Boeing said there was some bemusement at the US planemaker as to why Airbus was able to book all of their Iranian orders. Airbus sources said the company’s year-end numbers had been strictly audited. Analysts say decisions on whether to formally report such orders in annual tallies would depend partly on the status of the US export licenses needed by both companies due to their heavy reliance on US parts. People close to the deals say that while both big jetmakers have received US export licenses for sales to Iran, only some of them cover the whole delivery period running until 2028. Both companies must apply for extensions for part of their orders. Industry sources say the same contractual conditions applied to both companies. Even though Boeing lost the headline order battle, analysts say it may ultimately benefit from lagging Airbus in the Iranian sales process if it can use its rival’s presence in the country to make the case for its own deal to go through, in the face of US Republican political opposition. During his election campaign, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of the international nuclear deal that led to the lifting of sanctions on Iran. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Robot arms replace factory hands Indian airlines soar but turbulence ahead → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Identity faces challenges Impact from influx of foreign workers World edges closer to doomsday A rendezvous of families Aleppo traders clear debris from war-scarred souq Read More ...

The jumbo Turkish freighter slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of Bishkek, killing 37 people and destroying at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan’s emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev blamed the crash on “crew error,” but offered no details about the claim. The deputy prime minister said on Kyrgyzstan’s state-run Kabar news agency that the government had reviewed preliminary information from the accident. Air accident investigations typically take months. A thick mist caused poor visibility at the time of the crash and was being cited as a possible contributor to Monday’s crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash. Pictures of the immediate aftermath of the accident showed a portion of the village badly damaged. In one image, the plane’s smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car’s roof was completely ripped off in another. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan’s capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan’s state-run Kabar Agency. It’s not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 — including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline’s website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane’s black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines — the country’s national carrier — under its flight number. The flight’s ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey’s Anadolu news agency.. ACT Airlines confirmed the news of the crash on its website. “The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available,” the statement said. Boeing also extended its condolences in an emailed statement, as did Turkish Airlines in a tweet. “A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities,” the Boeing statement said. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company’s website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747’s enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

By Dominic Gates Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS “I will not recommend for membership in this union any other than members of the white race.” That may sound like some old declaration from the Deep South. But until after World War II, that was part of the oath sworn by members of the International Assocation of Machinists union, which represented Boeing workers in the Puget Sound region. The union, which organized the Boeing workforce here in 1935, was hardly the sole barrier to racial integration at Boeing. From the company’s founding in 1916, management had not hired a single black person. Prewar, such employment bans were pervasive throughout U.S. industry, even here in what’s now one of the country’s most politically liberal regions. Boeing hired its first two black “Rosie the Riveters” in 1942 to build bombers for the war effort – more than nine months after a presidential order banning discrimination at defense companies – and afterward progressed only slowly toward equality. Interviews with current and former employees trace a difficult journey spanning 75 years from the reluctant hiring of those black Rosies through today – when young African-Americans can take advantage of Boeing’s official policy encouraging diversity and equal opportunity. (Boeing declined to share the racial demographics of its current workforce.) In recent years a handful of African-Americans have risen to prominent positions in the company. Joan Robinson-Berry held various engineering and supplier management roles at Boeing and now heads the company’s growing Charleston, South Carolina, complex. The highly regarded former chief financial officer James Bell in 2005 served for four months as Boeing’s interim chief executive after a scandal ousted his boss. Marc Allen, president of Boeing International, is widely viewed as a possible future chief executive. Yet even now, with race remaining a divisive issue in America, some black employees find the workplace reality at Boeing still falls short of the colorblind ideal. Racist history Even as World War II approached and the nation began a rapid buildup of defense workers, Boeing management resisted a federal edict to cease discrimination, according to Battle at Boeing, a Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History project at the University of Washington. In the fall of 1940, Thurgood Marshall, then a lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and later a Supreme Court justice, wrote to the Seattle branch of the organization noting that Boeing had just been granted a $7 million government bomber contract. Marshall encouraged the local branch to push for the hiring of blacks. After black leaders threatened to bring thousands of protesters to the White House in April 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring companies with government contracts to cease racial discrimination. Local activists in Seattle mounted an intense public campaign to have Boeing comply with the order. Yet in the following months, although Boeing was hiring 1,000 people a week, none of them were African-Americans. That July, in a letter to the NAACP’s Washington state branch, Boeing personnel manager Paul Fredrickson conveniently ignored the company’s pre-IAM history of never hiring African-Americans and put the blame entirely on the union. He cited the closed-shop bargaining agreement with the IAM’s Local 751 and pointed out that “only those of the Caucasian race are acceptable” to the union. By 1942, the needs of the war effort finally forced a management reversal and African-Americans, mostly women at first, were hired. The union only reluctantly acceded, according to Seattle’s African-American newspaper at the time, Northwest Enterprise. “We rather resent that the war situation has been used to alter an old established custom,” IAM representative James Duncan said. The African-Americans that Boeing hired were required to pay for special temporary “work permits” that cost more than union dues, allowing them to work even though they were still barred from the union. By 1944, about 1,600 blacks worked at Boeing locally, in a workforce of nearly 43,000 that was churning out B-17 bombers at phenomenal rates. Defense hiring at Boeing and at Puget Sound shipyards brought an influx of African-Americans to the region, mostly from the South. According to a history of Seattle race relations by Howard Droker, Seattle’s black population doubled between 1940 and 1944 to about 8,000. The racist clause in the IAM oath was removed in 1946, after the war. Only then did Boeing truly begin to open up to African-Americans. A black Rosie the Riveter Lou Annie Charles, now 94, was one of those early black “Rosie the Riveters.” She still lives in her Central District home, paid for, in large part, by her long career at Boeing. Born in Muskogee, Oklahoma, she was raised on a farm where she picked cotton and grew vegetables. Charles trained as a riveter in the early 1940s under a New Deal program and was hired in 1943 to work for 60 cents an hour at Boeing’s airplane plant in Wichita, Kan., where she assembled B-29 Superfortress bombers. “It gave me an opportunity to help my parents,” Charles said. “I sent money home. That was a good feeling, to have money to help them.” After the war when Charles and many other Wichita workers were laid off, she moved to Seattle, where the company rehired her in 1950. At the old Plant 2 in Seattle and later in Renton and Everett, Charles worked at Boeing for another 38 years until her retirement in 1988. “I did nothing but rivet,” she said. “I enjoyed it.” The Boeing job allowed her to buy her home in 1956 – a time when the Central District was the only neighborhood open to black people for homeownership – and to put her two children through college. Her daughter became an airline flight attendant, her son a police officer and later an attorney. Recalling her early days working at Boeing, Charles said she met very little racial bias. “Most of the time, I’d be the only black woman in the shop,” she said. “I never had any problem with anyone not wanting to work with me.” She got on well with her workmates, though she said some of her supervisors were prejudiced and “not too nice.” Charles recalls her working life at Boeing fondly and still sends Christmas cards to the remaining members of her old crew. The union’s record Emerson Hamilton, an IAM union official, will be 70 next month and plans to retire in two weeks. Starting in 1979, he worked at Boeing in Seattle and Auburn, making airplane parts for 20 years, then was hired by the union as a full-time staff member. “The Boeing Company is a good company to work for,” Hamilton said. “They provide good jobs. I have no complaints about the benefits and pay. Just some people in management.” In his experience, said Hamilton, the company slapped down any instances of overt racial harassment. “They did not allow that,” he said. “If they ever caught anybody doing it, they always took corrective action.” Yet he recalls having to fight for his rights in his early years on the shop floor. He found that management constantly left him behind under a grading system that determined whether workers could move up to better positions. “I was training some of the young white guys who came in and they’d get upgraded before me,” he said. “I fought against that.” After he protested to an official in the company’s equal employment-opportunity unit, he got his upgrade. Hamilton said it was similar issues that in 1994 led several dozen African-American employees in the Puget Sound region to file a class-action lawsuit against Boeing, representing about 4,000 black employees. “African-Americans were getting fed up,” he said. “They didn’t think they were being upgraded like they should.” After civil-rights activist Jesse Jackson helped broker a $15 million settlement, Boeing donated $50,000 to Jackson’s Rainbow Coalition organization. However, an appeals court reversed the settlement in 2002 and a federal jury later ruled that Boeing had not discriminated in its handling of the promotion system. Hamilton recalls how former district 751 President Bill Johnson and his successor, Mark Blondin, worked to try to make up for some of the union’s history of racism. One gesture involved giving special recognition to Roman Mayfield, one of the first African-Americans in the union who became a long-serving shop steward. Though in his early years at the company Mayfield wasn’t allowed in the union, the IAM in 2000 retroactively granted him membership for those years, and honored him with various awards before his death two years later. Yet Hamilton said the union still has some way to go. He says there have never been more than one or two black faces among the slate of full-time union officials, his being one of them. “I take that as a token,” Hamilton said. A double minority Omar Abdul-Alim, 50, joined Boeing in 1989 after leaving the Army. He works as a mechanic in Renton, pressurizing 737 fuel tanks to test the seals before the planes roll out. Abdul-Alim is a double minority: An African-American, he grew up Baptist in Rainier Beach, then converted to Islam at age 30. In 2000, he married a Somali immigrant and is active today at a Tukwila mosque popular with the Somali community. He’s grateful that the job at Boeing has given him what it gave generations of local workers without a college degree: the chance to earn good money and create a comfortable middle-class life. Some of the African-American males he hung around with as a youngster sank into lives of drugs and prison. “A few of us were able to escape,” Abdul-Alim said. “I and a few of my friends, we’ve been the blessed ones.” Yet management actions have recently soured his view of Boeing. “It’s not the same company we hired into,” Abdul-Alim said, a common lament among Boeing veterans of every skin color since the last contract froze their pensions. A forceful personality, he said he won’t put up with disrespect on matters of race or religion, whether it comes from a Somali immigrant treating him as an outsider or from a prejudiced white American. “There are people who are ignorant,” Abdul-Alim said. “But I have a thick skin. I have no problem defending myself.” Even though he’s endured a few incidents of hostility to Islam at work, he says “my being an African-American was more of an obstacle for me at Boeing than being a Muslim.” Boeing grants accommodations in his schedule to allow him to do his Islamic prayers five times daily. He has a prayer rug at work. What he finds harder to fight against than open hostility from an individual is what he perceives as covert racism from some supervisors. Echoing the complaints of those in that 1990s lawsuit, he said at times he’s seen less-qualified white workers given transfers to better jobs ahead of him. And he said he’s been unfairly disciplined for arguments at work that grew out of racial harassment. “Boeing says it’s open opportunities for everybody. I don’t find that to be true,” he said. Young, black, hopeful For LaDonna Perkins, 25, who next month will complete two years as an engineer at Boeing, the experience so far has been entirely positive, full of openness, encouragement and possibility. She grew up in the small city of Wetumpka, Alabama. The daughter of a clothing-factory worker and a carpenter, she’s the first in her immediate family to go to college. Perkins did two summer internships at Boeing before being hired full time. She now works in Renton in the cabin-interiors unit, as a project manager working on an airplane lavatory-lighting system. Of about 50 engineers who graduated with her from the University of Alabama, six were black and three were women. Although she’s the only woman in her five-person work group at Boeing, the larger organization of some 120 people that she’s part of has about 10 percent African-Americans, she estimates. “I was very surprised. On my first day at work, I saw three African-American women in my first group,” Perkins said. “In the interiors organization we do have a really diverse group, different people of color and from different countries.” She hasn’t come across any bias. “I grew up in Alabama. I’ve seen prejudice,” she said. “I haven’t experienced that at Boeing.” The encouragement of her manager “pushed me to think of all the things I can do at Boeing,” she said, and she’s taken advantage of Boeing-sponsored courses in professional development and technical matters. She also attended a company diversity conference in California with about 900 employees from all over the country, where she met chief executive Dennis Muilenburg and several vice presidents. “The culture at Boeing is very inclusive,” Perkins said. She’s become an evangelist for engineering and for Boeing to people back home in Wetumpka. “I’ve had a couple of people Facebook message me asking what are the steps to become an engineer,” Perkins said. In 10 years, she said, her goal is to be a Boeing vice president herself.

The Turkish Boeing 747 crashed just outside the Manas airport, south of the capital Bishkek, killing people in the residential area adjacent to the airport as well as those on the plane. Reports of the death toll yesterday ranged from 37 people according to emergency officials in the Central Asian nation, to 31 reported by the presidential press office which also said rescue teams had recovered parts of nine bodies. Fifteen people including six children have been hospitalized. Images from the scene showed the plane’s nose stuck inside a brick house and large chunks of debris scattered around. Several dozen private houses cluster just outside the metal fence separating the cottages from the runway. Manas has been considerably expanded since the United States began to operate a military installation at the Manas airport, using it primarily for its operations in Afghanistan. American troops vacated the base and handed it over to the Kyrgyz military in 2014. “I woke up because of a bright red light outside,” Baktygul Kurbatova, who was slightly injured, told local television. “I couldn’t understand what was happening. It turns out the ceiling and the walls were crashing on us. I was so scared but I managed to cover my son’s face with my hands so that debris would not fall on him.” More than a thousand rescue workers were at the scene by late morning in the residential area where 15 houses were destroyed, Deputy Prime Minister Mukhammetkaly Abulgaziyev said. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Kyrgyz Emergency Situations Minister Kubatbek Boronov told reporters that it was foggy at Manas when the plane came down but weather conditions were not critical. The plane’s flight recorders have not yet been found. The plane, which had departed from Hong Kong, belonged to Istanbul-based cargo company ACT Airlines. It said in an emailed statement that the cause was unknown. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu yesterday called his Kyrgyz counterpart, Erlan Abdildaev, to offer Turkey’s condolences, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.

Iran Air took delivery last week of the first of 100 jets it has ordered from Airbus (EADSF). The first of 80 aircraft from Boeing (BA) are scheduled to arrive in 2018. The badly needed jets will reconstitute Iran's decrepit commercial aircraft fleet, which has been languishing under decades of Western sanctions. Peter Roskam, a Republican member of the House, introduced a bill on Friday to initiate an investigation by the Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence into Iran Air and the nation's other airlines. If Iran Air or any other airline were to be found to support the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps or foreign terrorist organizations, the airline would be added to the U.S. sanctions list and be prevented from receiving new aircraft or U.S.-made parts. That would effectively freeze the sale of jets from Boeing to Iran. The legislation would exert little control over the Airbus aircraft that are already delivered, but the airline would not be able to receive spare parts for those planes, or receive any maintenance outside of Iran. If Iran Air received maintenance or parts outside of Iran, that provider would be barred from doing business with the U.S. market. Mahan Air, Iran's second biggest carrier, is still on the sanctions list for aiding Iran's military and is barred from buying Western planes and parts. A new Airbus delivered to Iran Air. Iran drops plan to buy A380 superjumbo Iran Air was removed from the U.S. sanctions list in January 2016 as part of an agreement to convince Iran to restrain its nuclear program. It opened the path for multi-billion dollar sales by Boeing and Airbus. That prompted an outcry from some lawmakers like Roskam, who said the Obama administration offered no proof that Iran Air had stopped its support of the Iranian military or designated terrorist organizations. Roskam and other critics of the sales say Iran Air was removed from the sanctions list for political reasons to complete the six-nation diplomatic agreement The Treasury Department, in a November 23 letter to Roskam, defended the nuclear deal and said Iran Air was cleared from sanctions after a review "of its activity to ensure" sales would be "consistent with our national security and foreign policy goals." Boeing's Iran deal won't prevent production cut The new bill restarts an earlier effort by Roskam. He introduced a bill with a similar aim last year -- the House passed it, but the Senate didn't act. Now Republicans have control of Congress and President-elect Trump has been sharply critical of the nuclear agreement. Boeing, which has said it has proceeded cautiously into a deal with Iran Air, has said repeatedly that it will continue to take its cues from the U.S. government.

First Look Top officials at US State Department abruptly resign (+video) Photos of the day 01/27 SUBSCRIBE Artist sketches released by the FBI of a man calling himself D.B. Cooper, who vanished in 1971 with $200,000 in stolen cash after hijacking a commercial airliner over Oregon. Citizen scientists in Seattle believe the man may have been a Boeing worker or contractor. FBI handout via Reuters | Caption Fullscreen Loading... Ben Rosen Staff | @Benji_Rosen January 15, 2017 —Leave it to a group that calls itself the Citizen Sleuths to uncover a new lead in the 45-year hunt for D.B. Cooper. The three amateur scientists have found rare-Earth elements on the JCPenney tie the infamous skyjacker left behind when he jumped out of a commercial airplane on a blistering night in 1971, with $200,000 in unmarked bills, a parachute, and a raincoat. The sleuths say the elements could indicate Cooper was an engineer or manager in the aerospace industry. The FBI closed its investigation in July, calling it one of the longest and most exhaustive in the agency’s history. Perhaps the biggest break in the case came in 1980 when an 8-year-old boy, while searching for firewood, found a bundle of $20 bills from the hijacking along the Columbia River near Vancouver, Wash. While that find seemed to support the theory Cooper didn’t survive the jump into the freezing rain and pitch-black sky, this latest discovery could help unravel the mystery behind the true identity of the man who called himself Dan Cooper. "The fascination with Cooper has survived not because of the FBI investigation, but because he was able to do something that not only captured the public imagination, but also maintained a sense of mystery in the world," Geoffrey Gray, author of “Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper,” told the Associated Press. How safe is flying? Take the aviation safety quiz Whether the scientists add to Cooper’s lore, or diminish the mystery, they say the clip-on tie Cooper left on the Boeing 727 tell us a lot about him. The amateur scientists, which include a paleontologist from Seattle’s Burke Museum, found more than 1,000 particles on the tie when they had it examined under an electron microscope. Among them were the cerium, strontium sulfide, and pure titanium. Tom Kaye, the paleontologist and the lead researcher for the group, told CBS affiliate King5 on Friday that the chemicals were used in the aerospace industry in 1971. Boeing, said Mr. Kaye, was using these chemicals in its efforts to build a Super Sonic Transport Plane, which it was developing with government funding in the 1960s and 1970s. Boeing historically had a large factory in Everett, Wash., near Seattle. Kaye told King5 the discovery indicates Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines]. He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye said. The scientists are posting a running list of the particles they have found on Cooper’s tie, with the hope others will come forward with more knowledge about how these particles were used then or, perhaps, with the true identity of Cooper. On Nov. 24, 1971, the day before Thanksgiving, a man who called himself Dan Cooper (early wire-service reports misidentified him as “D.B. Cooper”) bought a $20 ticket at Portland International Airport for a Northwest Orient flight bound for Sea-Tac in Seattle. The man, who fellow passengers later described as slim, olive-skinned, and wearing a black suit and aviator sunglasses, coolly ordered a bourbon and soda and smoked a cigarette aboard the plane before he handed a stewardess a note that read in all capital letters: I HAVE A BOMB IN MY BRIEFCASE. I WILL USE IT IF NECESSARY. I WANT YOU TO SIT NEXT TO ME. YOU ARE BEING HIJACKED." When the stewardess slipped the note, unread, into her pocket, the man said, "Miss, you'd better look at that note. I have a bomb." The plane landed as scheduled in Seattle, where the hijacker managed to get $200,000 and a parachute in ransom for the passengers. He then ordered the pilots to take off and head for Mexico.   En route somewhere over the woods of Washington and Oregon, a cockpit warning light showed the rear door of the plane had been opened. The pilots asked over the intercom, “Is everything OK back there?” “No!” the man yelled, and jumped. Since then, the biggest break in the case came in 1980 with the discovery of the unmarked bills. Other than that, a body was never found, leading to a slew of conspiracy theories, books, and songs. A Michigan author proposed Cooper was in fact a father of four, Richard Lepsy, who went missing from Grayling, Michigan in 1969. An Oklahoma woman also told the FBI about a late uncle who showed up to Thanksgiving dinner in Oregon in 1971 with serious injuries. The FBI couldn’t conclusively link guitar straps made by the uncle, L.D. Cooper, with evidence found on the clip-on tie. The History Channel also recently suggested a 72-year-old California man, Robert W. Rackstraw, may have been Cooper, although the Vietnam veteran’s former lawyer denied the documentary’s allegations.   "Americans like their criminals suave and sophisticated, and this guy fits the bill," Stephen Mihm, a folklore expert at the University of Georgia in Athens, told the Christian Science Monitor’s Patrik Jonsson, about Cooper. "There's something very debonaire about the nature of the hijacking, and it was extremely risky, too, and that combination … is probably more appealing than if he he looked like a Hell's Angel and killed several people along the way. He fits our ideal of a criminal mastermind." Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

The cargo plane crashed this morning, killing people in the residential area adjacent to the Manas airport as well as those on the plane. ASSOCIATED PRESS The tail of a crashed Turkish Boeing 747 cargo plane laid at a residential area outside Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan today. The cargo plane crashed this morning, killing people in the residential area adjacent to the Manas airport as well as those on the plane. BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan >> A Turkish cargo plane crashed today in a residential area just outside the main airport in Kyrgyzstan, destroying half of a village and killing at least 37 people in the plane and on the ground, the Emergency Situations Ministry said. The Boeing 747 crashed at 7:40 a.m. local time while approaching Manas airport, south of the capital, Bishkek, in this Central Asian nation. Footage from the scene showed the plane’s nose stuck inside a brick house and large chunks of debris scattered around. A dozen body bags were laid out in the yard of one home. A car parked nearby was mangled in the crash, and a refrigerator lay open. The bodies of 15 victims, including five children, all of them Kyrgyz citizens, had been identified by this evening, the Kyrgyz government said on its website. Another 15 people, including six children, were hospitalized in the disaster, according to the health ministry. Kyrgyz Emergency Situations Minister Kubatbek Boronov said 23 out of the 43 houses in the village had been destroyed. Several dozen homes were near the fence surrounding the runway. The plane, which had departed from Hong Kong, belonged to the Istanbul-based cargo company ACT Airlines, which said the dead included the plane’s four Turkish crew members: two pilots, a freight expert and a flight technician. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Emergency Situations Minister Boronov told reporters that it was foggy at Manas when the plane came down but weather conditions were not critical. One of the plane’s two flight recorders was recovered at the scene, according to the Kyrgyz prime minister’s office. “I woke up because of a bright red light outside,” resident Baktygul Kurbatova, who was slightly injured, told local television. “I couldn’t understand what was happening. It turns out the ceiling and the walls were crashing on us. I was so scared but I managed to cover my son’s face with my hands so debris would not fall on him.” The Manas airport has been considerably expanded since the United States began to operate a military installation there, using it primarily for its military operations in Afghanistan. The U.S. handed the base over to the Kyrgyz military in 2014. ACT Airlines said today that the crash wasn’t the result of “technical reasons or factors linked to the freight” on the plane. It did not specify the plane’s cargo. It said the plane’s records book had no record of any technical faults and said that the plane had not encountered any mishaps during its journey or as it proceeded to land at Bishkek. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev today to express his condolences and convey his sadness at the loss of lives in the disaster. Turkey’s transportation ministry also sent two experts from its accident investigation board to Bishkek to assist Kyrgyz authorities. Suzan Fraser contributed to this report from Ankara.

 Airbus rallies late to take sales crown from Boeing Benjamin Zhang Jan. 12, 2017, 4:32 PM 1,622 facebook linkedin twitter email print Airbus A350-1000 test flight.Airbus Airbus' and Boeing's fight for supremacy of the skies continue into 2016. The two titans of the aviation industry have been going head-to-head with one another every year for the past two decades. Both airplane makers posted solid numbers during the year, but Airbus rallied late to take the sales crown from Boeing with 731 net orders to Boeing's 668. The Toulouse, France-based company booked an incredible 321 net orders in the month of December to take the lead. "We delivered on our objectives in a challenging environment, proving our ramp-up readiness for the future," Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Brégier. "I salute all our teams on this outstanding achievement." As a result, Airbus boasts a backlog of 6,874 aircraft valued at more than $1 trillion. However, all was not lost for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The Seattle-based airplane maker delivered 748 planes to its customers during 2016 — 60 more than Airbus. In addition, Boeing still boasts a healthy backlog of 5,715 planes. Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.Boeing As expected the bulk of Airbus and Boeing's orders were for their respective workhorse A320-family and 737-Series narrow body jets. Twin-engine wide-body jets such as the Airbus A330, A350 along with the Boeing 777 and 787 remain popular. However, both manufacturers continue to struggle finding new buyers for its large jumbo jets. Even with low fuel prices, Airbus ended 2016 with zero net orders for the A380 superjumbo. On the other hand, Boeing's venerable 747 jumbo jet had a banner year with 17 net orders — the most in a decade for the program. Sadly, the 747's new orders are driven by demand for the plane's ability to carry cargo rather than passengers. Unfortunately, even with the 747's stellar year, its order backlog is down to just 28 planes.  SEE ALSO: You can now fly from the US to Europe for $70 — but one day it might be free NOW WATCH: Watch Air France's first Boeing 787 get assembled and painted in this amazing time-lapse Loading video...

David Hertz spotted the scrap Boeing 747  and paid $26,000 and used it to build this stunning house in the remote hills of Malibu, California. Hertz, from Los Angeles, was tasked by Francie Rehwald who wanted curves and feminine shapes for her dream house. This is the amazing home built in the Californian hills by architect David Hertz using a scrapped Boeing 747 jumbo jet Hertz was commissioned to build the house by Francie Rehwald who paid $26,000 for the former passenger jet The large wing sections from the Boeing 747 were carried into place by a Chinook helicopter - made by Boeing  Rehwald interviewed 12 architects before deciding on David Hertz Architects, and spent 15 years searching the globe for the perfect piece of land. All Hertz had to do was look to the skies for his inspiration - coming up with the idea when he was on an aeroplane.  Rehwald even had to get permission from 17 government agencies - including Homeland Security - to build the house, as from the sky it looks like a plane crash.

Share this article Share Rehwald had to secure permission from federal agencies for her home's design as it looks like a plane has crashed from the air As a result of the innovative design and location, the house has unbelievable views over the Malibu hills  The giant sections of wing were moved around the construction site using a mobile crane and eased into their resting places Inside, the house has incredibly high ceilings and wide open spaces - taking advantage of the remote location The retired Mercedes Benz dealer said: 'I wanted something that was feminine. 'You might not think wings are feminine, but once they were detached from the place they really come into their own. 'They have such subtle curves.' Hertz's brief was an economical, feminine house with a floating roof. He said: 'I was flying and looking out at the wing, thinking about what I could do to float a roof. 'Then it occurred to me, why try to build a wing when I can appropriate a wing?' Rehwald interviewed 12 architects before deciding upon Hertz and spent 15 years searching for the ideal spot for the house Rehwald said the aircraft was perfect for her new home as the curved wings were very feminine  The former passenger jet, pictured, cost Rehwald $26,000, although she would not reveal how much the Malibu house cost Rehwald - who refused to say exactly how much it cost to build, only hinting it was in the millions - added: 'No one had ever built anything like this before. 'There were a lot of surprises that brought the cost up, but it's just beautiful.' The mansion sits on 55 acres and is 1,000 feet above sea level. It used two Boeing wings and two tail fins, which were detached from the plane using the latest precision technology. The astonishing property sits on 55 acres of land and suitably for a former jet, it is now permanently 1,000 feet above sea level Officials were forced to close down five freeways to allow the heavy-duty Chinook to carry the wings across the road safely During the journey, the pilots were under orders to drop the wings if they were caught by the wind and risked the helicopter  They were then transported to the mansion via helicopter, after having to close five freeways to get them partway there. Hertz said: 'There was a lot of risk with the helicopter. 'It was clear when we were transporting the wings that if they started to turn or catch the wind, they would just drop them.' Rehwald added: 'Every day is a complete and utter joy and I feel so lucky.' In this bedroom, the wing section provides the ceiling while the owner can look over the Californian hills from their bed The house used the aircraft's two wings and sections from its tail to create the unusual house in the hills  The former Mercedes dealer spent 15 years looking for the perfect location to build their ideal home using the jet The floor-to-ceiling windows provide unbelievable views across the hills surrounding Malibu in California  The interior of the building looks very modern with curved staircases bringing you to the upper level  Francie Rehwald, pictured, left, inspects the work after one of the wing sections was put into place above her house  Share or comment on this article e-mail 155 shares Absolutely stunning.

ADVERTISEMENT Whether Trump will continue to single out companies in the White House remains to be seen, as ethics rules are supposed to bar federal officials from making direct endorsements. Here are the companies that Trump has singled out on Twitter since he began his presidential bid last year, not including his spats with media organizations. L.L. Bean Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.Bean for your great support and courage. People will support you even more now. Buy L.L.Bean. @LBPerfectMaine— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017 Trump weighed in this week after a rash of stories about his critics boycotting L.L. Bean, which makes outdoor apparel and gear, as well as the popular “Bean boot.” One of the members of the Bean family, Linda Bean, gave $60,000 to the Making American Great Again LLC, a PAC that supported Trump’s presidential bid. That donation has put Bean in hot water, as under federal law, the maximum donation that a PAC can take is $5,000, according to The Associated Press. Bean argues she only donated $25,000 and thought she was donating to a super PAC, which can take unlimited amounts of money. Making American Great Again LLC is reportedly seeking to change its registration to become a super PAC. Bean appeared on “Fox and Friends” to talk about her support of Trump despite the boycott about an hour before Trump’s tweet. Carrier/United Technologies Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier. They will sell many air conditioners!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2016 Trump’s deal with Carrier has become one of the biggest moments of his transition, and he spent the end of November singing the company’s praises on Twitter. His supporters lauded the administration for directly negotiating to keep jobs at a Carrier furnace plant, owned by the parent company United Technologies, in Indiana. Critics charge that Trump is exaggerating the number of jobs his deal saved, noting that hundreds of others are still slated for outsourcing. Rexnord Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016 Days after he announced the Carrier deal in early December, Trump challenged the industrial company Rexnord for its decision to ship jobs overseas. Rexnord workers are represented Steelworkers Local 1999 Union, the same union that represents the workers at Carrier’s Indiana plant. So when the 1999 head criticized Trump for inflating the number of jobs saved in the Carrier deal, Trump took time to needle another company under the union’s umbrella. Boeing/Lockheed Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Trump has taken on the aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin several times since Election Day. He did so again during his Wednesday news conference when he said that Lockheed is behind schedule and over budget on the F-35 program. That remark prompted its stock shares to plunge. Ford/Fiat Chrysler Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U.S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017 In a rare incident of Twitter praise, Trump applauded both automakers this month for deciding to make further investments in American plants instead of outsourcing. Ford’s CEO told CNN that the move is a “vote of confidence” in Trump’s new direction. But Fiat Chrysler told ThinkProgress in a statement the move had been announced a year ago and had nothing to do with Trump. General Motors General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017 Trump set his sights on yet another car company this month, this time to warn against shipping Mexican-made cars into America. A General Motors spokesperson told PolitiFact it sells about 15 percent of Mexican-made hatchbacks in America, with the rest manufactured in the U.S. And statements from the company since the tweet show that it doesn’t expect to change its business plans based on Trump’s tweets and threats for import tariffs. Toyota Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 Trump slapped at Toyota in January for building a new plant in Mexico. The plans had been announced in 2015, before Trump even declared his presidential bid, and had coincided with additional investments in four American car plants. Apple Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2016 During the presidential campaign Trump blasted Apple for refusing to help the FBI crack into iPhone of a suspect in the December 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif. The issue went to rest months later when the FBI disclosed that it had found a way into the phone with help from an outside source. Amazon If @amazon ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash and it would crumble like a paper bag. The @washingtonpost scam is saving it!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 Trump has locked horns with fellow business billionaire Jeff Bezos of Amazon, who bought The Washington Post in 2013. The feud likely has to do with Trump’s complaint that the Post doesn’t cover him fairly. But Trump has suggested that Bezos is using the Post as pressure to keep his tax burden down and avoid an anti-trust violation at Amazon. Macy's Thx to all the people who called to say they are cutting their @Macys credit card as a protest against illegal immigrants pouring into US— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2015 Good news, disloyal @Macys stock is in a total free fall. Don't shop there for Christmas! https://t.co/wpDDCWcLFD pic.twitter.com/vT3uGjiZ9B— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2015 The clothing giant had a falling out with Trump over his campaign, cutting its ties to Trump’s clothing brand in July, weeks after he jumped into the presidential race making controversial comments about Mexican immigrants. Trump responded with near-monthly tweets blasting the company and calling for a boycott through the rest of 2015. Amer-I-Can Join @AmerIcan32, founded by Hall of Fame legend @JimBrownNFL32 on 1/19/2017 in Washington, D.C.https://t.co/14DGDrIlcl pic.twitter.com/XwSmQVFuoM— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016 Trump boosted the Amer-I-Can nonprofit founded by former football star Jim Brown in a December tweet two weeks after Brown traveled to New York with a group to meet with the future president.  After the meeting, Brown and his allies told reporters that Trump committed to merge the Amer-I-Can program with the Trump administration’s efforts to keep kids from gang violence. Koch Industries While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little Marco RubioMarco RubioSanders: I will vote no on Tillerson Rubio's Tillerson vote is why people don't trust politicians McCain warns Trump he'll fight on lifting Russian sanctions MORE, the lightweight from Florida— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016 Many of Trump’s critiques of businesses are based in political differences. That was the case when Trump sent this February 2015 tweet blasting the company owned by the GOP mega donors Charles and David Koch. The impetus for the tweet was the decision by Marc Short, a top political operative from the Koch-connected Freedom Partners, to go to work for Marco Rubio in the GOP primary. Short joined the Trump campaign after the primary and was just named the assistant to the president and director of legislative affairs. T-Mobile .@JohnLegere @TMobile John, focus on running your company, I think the service is terrible! Try hiring some good managers.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2015 Trump has regularly targeted T-Mobile on Twitter during his career, but only once while he was running for office. When T-Mobile CEO John Legere criticized Trump for a November 2015 tweet chiding a UFC fighter for her surprise loss, Trump shot back to blast T-Mobile and later retweeted a follower complaining about the cell-phone company's "pathetic" service." Twitter, Google and Facebook Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2016 The social media giants drew Trump’s ire in late October of 2016 hours after a story posted on Breitbart News, the outlet once led by future White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, alleging that news about the FBI’s investigation into Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonSecret Service agent critical of Trump put on paid leave: report Rob Reiner: Trump 'out of his f---ing mind' Trump brought up ending Electoral College, but McConnell talked him down: report MORE’s email was not prominently featured. The fact-checking website PolitiFact repudiated that claim in a post that showed the topic’s presence on the various websites.

"ACT Airlines is deeply saddened to report that an accident happened during the flight from Hong Kong to Bishkek by Boeing 747-400 TC-MCL registered cargo aircraft at 01:20 Z. The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available," the company said in a statement following the crash. ACT Airlines is a Turkish cargo airline based in Istanbul. It operates international scheduled and charter air cargo services, as well as wet and dry lease services. Its main base is Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, Istanbul. The airline's European hub is based at Liege Airport in Belgium. Established in 2004, the company changed ownership in March 2006 when Turkish aviation veteran Yavuz Cizmeci teamed up with HBK Investments to acquire the company, according to the information on the airline's website. In February 2008, a 21 percent equity stake was acquired by Manara Investments Ltd. Manara is an investment vehicle sponsored by four leading Saudi business groups. New partners and existing shareholders expect ACT Airlines to become a leading regional and international player. ACT received the prestigious SCATA Supply Chain and Transport Award for ‘The Air Cargo Operator of the Year’ in recognition of its exceptional customer service in 2007. The airlines also applied for IATA certification after completing the IATA Operational Safety Audit in 2007. In 2011, China’s HNA Group have bought 49% of the shares of ACT Airlines. 50.9% of the shares remain with Daglar Cizmeci and 0.1% with other Turkish holders. ACT Airlines rebranded as myCargo after this alliance took place.

Boeing 16 January, 2017 Image used for illustrative purpose. A man walks near an Airbus A330-200F freighter aircraft on display at the Singapore Airshow REUTERS/Tim Chong 16 January 2017 By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is set to post an 8 percent rise in deliveries for 2016, beating expectations, after a sprint to the finish line that narrowed the gap with arch-rival Boeing, according to industry experts and records of aircraft movements. The European planemaker was forced to accelerate deliveries sharply in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year. It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of flight-tracking data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and plane-watcher reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo. One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the company's informal target of more than 670. Advertisement Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing, but its growth contrasts with a 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U.S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The higher-than-expected Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is the latest evidence thatplanemakers are racing to whittle down big order backlogs and hoard cash as they face a potentially worsening slowdown in orders that began in 2015. Boeing temporarily eased output last year to make way for a new model but, like Airbus, plans to increase production of its best-selling aircraft. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Europe's largest aerospace company clawed back losses to end up 0.2 percent in a weaker Paris market. The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday. Airbus's December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter. The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29. "I was amazed," said a veteran of such operations. Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal for 72 jets with India's GoAir. It may announce a $6.4 billion order for 60 jets from Saudi carrier flynas, two sources said. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeing's 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATION Airbus delivered at least 70 A320-family narrow-body jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose ramp-up had been disrupted by delays in receiving new fuel-saving engines from Pratt & Whitney. That brought 2016 deliveries of narrow-body jets - the most cash-generating models - to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 wide-bodies. Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo. Narrow-body deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger wide-body aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive. On its other main profit-driver, Airbus delivered over 62 long-haul A330s in 2016, according to the estimates. But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents. Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say. Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation. The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europe's troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the world's largest four-engined jets. The programme took another blow in late December when Dubai-based Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries.

Boeing 16 January, 2017 Image used for illustrative purpose. A man walks near an Airbus A330-200F freighter aircraft on display at the Singapore Airshow REUTERS/Tim Chong 16 January 2017 By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus is set to post an 8 percent rise in deliveries for 2016, beating expectations, after a sprint to the finish line that narrowed the gap with arch-rival Boeing, according to industry experts and records of aircraft movements. The European planemaker was forced to accelerate deliveries sharply in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year. It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of flight-tracking data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and plane-watcher reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo. One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the company's informal target of more than 670. Advertisement Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing, but its growth contrasts with a 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U.S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The higher-than-expected Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is the latest evidence thatplanemakers are racing to whittle down big order backlogs and hoard cash as they face a potentially worsening slowdown in orders that began in 2015. Boeing temporarily eased output last year to make way for a new model but, like Airbus, plans to increase production of its best-selling aircraft. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Europe's largest aerospace company clawed back losses to end up 0.2 percent in a weaker Paris market. The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday. Airbus's December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter. The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29. "I was amazed," said a veteran of such operations. Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal for 72 jets with India's GoAir. It may announce a $6.4 billion order for 60 jets from Saudi carrier flynas, two sources said. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeing's 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATION Airbus delivered at least 70 A320-family narrow-body jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose ramp-up had been disrupted by delays in receiving new fuel-saving engines from Pratt & Whitney. That brought 2016 deliveries of narrow-body jets - the most cash-generating models - to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 wide-bodies. Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo. Narrow-body deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger wide-body aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive. On its other main profit-driver, Airbus delivered over 62 long-haul A330s in 2016, according to the estimates. But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents. Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say. Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation. The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europe's troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the world's largest four-engined jets. The programme took another blow in late December when Dubai-based Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries. That could put the iconic double-decker plane back into loss in 2017, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service.

Poor visibility was likely a factor. More than 30 people were killed when a Turkish cargo plane crashed into a village in Kyrgyzstan, according to a statement from Kyrgyzstan's Ministry of Emergency Situations. Poor visibility was likely a factor. More than 30 people were killed when a Turkish cargo plane crashed into a village in Kyrgyzstan, Russian state media reported citing the Kyrgyzstan Health Ministry. By Joshua Berlinger, Jon Ostrower and Joe Sterling CNN (CNN) -- Bad weather and possible 'crew error' appeared to be an early focus of an inquiry into what caused a Boeing 747 freighter to crash Monday in a village near Kyrgyzstan's capital. The jumbo Turkish freighter slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of Bishkek, killing 37 people and destroying at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan's emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev blamed the crash on "crew error," but offered no details about the claim. The deputy prime minister said on Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar news agency that the government had reviewed preliminary information from the accident. Air accident investigations typically take months. A thick mist caused poor visibility at the time of the crash and was being cited as a possible contributor to Monday's crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash. Pictures of the immediate aftermath of the accident showed a portion of the village badly damaged. In one image, the plane's smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car's roof was completely ripped off in another. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan's capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar Agency. It's not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 -- including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline's website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane's black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines -- the country's national carrier -- under its flight number. The flight's ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey's Anadolu news agency.. ACT Airlines confirmed the news of the crash on its website. "The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available," the statement said. Boeing also extended its condolences in an emailed statement, as did Turkish Airlines in a tweet. "A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities," the Boeing statement said. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company's website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747's enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard. CNN's Jon Ostrower reported from New York, while Joshua Berlinger wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Joe Sterling reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Emma Burrows in Moscow, Donie O'Sullivan in New York, Zahra Ullah in Hong Kong and Hande Atay and Merieme Arif in Atlanta contributed to this report.

The Boeing 747 freighter jumbo jet slammed into a residential neighbourhood – killing many people on the ground – near the country’s main airport in the capital Bishkek. Flight TK6491 attempted to land on Monday morning, with a temperature of minus 11 degrees Celsius outside and the airport immersed in thick fog. Hong Kong’s Cathay Dragon plans HK$20b aircraft replacement programme The country’s deputy prime minister said preliminary tests suggested pilot error caused the accident, but said terrorism could not be ruled out. “Now we cannot say who is guilty of the accident. According to preliminary estimates of experts, it was pilot error,” Mukhammetkaly Abulgaziyev said, according to local news agency 24.kg. “Everything will be known after the investigation,” he said, adding that he could not rule out whether the plane had been overloaded. At least four pilots – reportedly all Turkish nationals – were on board and died in the crash. The rest of those killed were on the ground when the plane crashed. The crew had flown to the airport before and was familiar with the weather conditions, officials said. Prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation, citing possible safety violations. The country’s health minister Talantbek Batyraliev told local media that in total 32 people had died including 12 minors, and several more were in hospital.

In 2011, the Chinese conglomerate HNA Group bought a 49 per cent stake in the cargo operator. The flight took off from Hong Kong for Bishkek at 3.12am on Monday and crashed at 7.31am local time. It had been scheduled to continue to Istanbul. Parts of the plane were strewn across a radius of 1km, with many houses damaged or demolished. On Monday evening, officials were hunting for the aircraft’s “black box” flight data and voice recorders. A Kyrgyz news agency reported that a local resident had written on Facebook that the plane’s impact had “blown away” many structures. “Many homes simply burned,” she wrote. “People were sleeping and didn’t have any idea.” The plane’s manufacturer Boeing said it was standing by to help investigators, and extended “its deepest condolences to the families of those who perished.” In a statement on Monday, ACT Airlines said the cause of the accident was “unknown at this time” and that they would provide further details as they became available.

(Swiss), the national airline of Switzerland. Through the agreement, Swiss will integrate Jeppesen Crew Tracking into their operations to optimize crew planning and recover from disruptions to planned crew schedules. “Using Jeppesen Crew Tracking services enables us to manage daily operations in an efficient way, through the ability to quickly resolve the myriad operational issues that can result in changes to scheduled crew rosters,” said Daniel Silvestri, head of Operations Planning, Swiss. “This service from Jeppesen will support early detection of potential crew schedule issues and provides multiple recovery options, with associated costs directly calculated and displayed. This will allow us to make the most informed decisions to repair crew schedules in real time.” Jeppesen Crew Tracking is a component of a family of crew management solutions that optimize operations and increase efficiency for airlines. The data analytics-driven tool employs modeling and simulation to reveal insights that lead to better decision-making and actions. This provides airlines with the ability to detect, resolve, and follow-up on changes to originally published crew plans.

(Reuters) - Boeing Co.’s chief executive said on Tuesday that he and President-elect Donald Trump “made progress” on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft, and suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg’s visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump’s efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors. It also showed Boeing’s adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy. Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Trump also last month asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the “excellent conversation” with Trump could lead to a deal “in the very near term.” “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices,” Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. “That’s going to lead to substantial cost reductions.” On fighter jets, he said, “we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably.” Muilenburg praised Trump’s approach to negotiations. “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business,” he said, noting that as the U.S.’s top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. “If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest,” he said. “We’re proud to take on that mission, and I think Mr Trump’s engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country.” “I appreciate the teamwork approach on this – I think it’s the right way to do business.” Boeing’s stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trading.

MUST CREDIT: Washington Post photo byJabin Botsford Jabin Botsford, The Washington Post .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... NEW YORK – Exactly one week after becoming president-elect, Donald Trump stepped outside his namesake fortress here for the first time. He ventured just five blocks, to dinner at the 21 Club – a dark-mahogany-and-red-leather-banquette throwback, where model airplanes and sports memorabilia hang from the ceiling, and jackets are de rigueur for men. The vintage haunt, where Trump dined with family members, feels like home. The waiters know his preferred table (No. 14, which Frank Sinatra and Richard M. Nixon also used) and his regular order (the $36 burger, well done, with fries). So it has been for the president-elect, who has retreated to one comfortable, familiar refuge after another – his soaring Manhattan tower, his white leather-upholstered Boeing jet, his lush golf courses, his opulent beachside castle. Advertisement Continue reading Trump is a man isolated, increasingly cocooned away from the voters who lifted him to his seemingly improbable victory. He favors his own people and his own places, creating the veneer of accessibility – his tweets reach millions, and he still answers his cellphone – while placing himself in almost entirely habitual settings. He spends most of his days in Trump Tower, with few close friends and few meaningful one-on-one interactions beyond the family members, advisers and loyalists who are whisked by gold-colored elevator to his 26th-floor office for private audiences. Trump rarely leaves, not even for a breath of fresh air; nor does he encounter many people he does not already know or who do not work for him. Yet Trump remains omnipresent in American life, constantly communicating with the public via Twitter and media interviews without the varnish of news releases or the protection of handlers. Whether it is Meryl Streep’s remarks about him or the question of Russian hacking, no topic is too mundane or charged for him to lend his voice to it. And he answers his personal cellphone, something that acquaintances and colleagues speak of in almost reverential terms. As he prepares to enter the White House, Trump is resisting his advisers’ efforts to take away his cellphone or at least restrict his use of it, said one person close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of private conversations. They worry about national security; he worries about losing touch. When Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) needs to reach Trump, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman does not have to go through an aide or schedule a meeting. He said he simply dials Trump’s cellphone directly, and the president-elect answers, even though Corker’s number registers as “No Caller ID.” “I’ve never seen anything relative to access like this. Unbelievable,” Corker told reporters recently. “I don’t think there’s likely been a White House like this, maybe ever, but certainly in modern history.” In many ways, Trump seems most comfortable communicating at a slight remove, with a stage or a screen – television, Twitter, phone – serving as the intermediary between him and the public. Such tools are both his megaphone and his shield, allowing him to blast out a message undiluted with little risk. “He sees the power of mass communication, which goes through screens, and he recognizes its importance,” said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and the chief executive of the website Newsmax Media. “He’s clearly studied the art of it and developed an online and TV persona that’s very powerful. If you look, he’s very much impressed by people who are on TV or come across well on TV, because he thinks it’s such critical marketing.” Advertisement Continue reading Trump has shunned some of the traditional photo ops that his predecessors have orchestrated to demonstrate compassion and forge a connection with everyday Americans. He spent Veterans Day in November not laying a wreath at a memorial site, as President-elect Barack Obama did in 2008 to pay tribute to fallen soldiers, but staying inside Trump Tower (even though New York’s historic parade was marching right outside along Fifth Avenue). On Thanksgiving and Christmas, he celebrated in private with family members and friends, making no public appearances at military bases or homeless shelters or soup kitchens. “A lot of what you see by previous presidents are platitudes: ‘I’m going to go and pretend I’m supportive of a particular entity and serve food at a soup kitchen,’ ” said Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager of Trump’s. “Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back so we don’t have soup kitchens. He has not been a person to do staged events for the sake of doing staged events.” Trump’s duality – his wariness of those not in his trusted orbit, yet his insatiable desire for constant contact and feedback – has posed challenges for his advisers and could ultimately leave him detached from everyday voters. He does not use email and rarely surfs the Internet, meaning that telephone calls, television appearances or physical proximity are the best ways to reach him. As his three successive campaign managers quickly learned, whoever controls the flow of information to Trump controls the man – at least as much as he can be contained. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was a trusted campaign adviser to Trump, said he expects the new president’s relationship with Congress to be a mix of salesmanship and accessibility. “Trump will be a larger figure who’s more aloof and more distant but whose weight and effectiveness is so great he will clearly be a dominating figure,” Gingrich said. “He’ll bounce back and forth between the two worlds. When he comes into the congressional world, he’ll be very effective on the personal level.” But, Gingrich added, “On another level he’ll be very distant, and you’ll see him by tweet and you’ll see him on ‘Fox and Friends.’ “ Advertisement Continue reading Trump’s distance, friends say, stems in part from a certain insularity, with the developer turned politician preferring his own properties, stocked with his own people. Ruddy, who is a member of the private Mar-a-Lago club and whose Newsmax is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., said he has lived in the area for two decades, yet he can count on one hand the number of times he has seen Trump outside of his private Florida retreats. “He’s an old-shoe type of guy – he likes to be in his comfort zone, which are his golf clubs and his homes,” Ruddy said. “He likes people he’s comfortable with and likes, and if he doesn’t feel comfortable around you, he’s not going to be inviting you around.” Trump has gone out to eat only a few times since the election – twice to the 21 Club and once to Jean Georges at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, where the president-elect dined on frog legs and prime sirloin with adversary-turned-job-applicant Mitt Romney. For Trump, like President Obama, the links – whether at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., or Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., near his beloved Mar-a-Lago – are personal sanctuaries. In either place, he is most at ease. He wears boxy “Make America Great Again” caps and open-collar shirts, unwinding with friends over rounds in the morning and then retreating to the clubhouses for casual lunches. “He’s always playing golf courses that bear his name,” sportswriter Michael Bamberger said. “The golf cart has his name on it. The water bottle has his name on it. If the course is crowded, groups will move to the side for him. . . . When he gets to the dining room, the waitress is right there. Membership has its privileges, but ownership has a lot more privileges.” Bamberger, who has closely studied Trump’s golf habits for years, said the president-elect is deeply knowledgeable about the sport and plays it well. And he uses his time at the golf course to forge bonds and size people up. “He’s a very social creature, a gregarious creature, and golf gives him an opportunity to do that,” he said. One of Trump’s preferred methods of charming, however, is the telephone, which he uses to receive advice and pepper his callers with questions well into the night. Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Trump, likened him to a mix of former presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (with his ability to woo and cajole) and Nixon (with his late-night tendencies). Advertisement Continue reading “He is like LBJ,” Stone said. “He loves the telephone. He loves calling people. He really does have a very good manner with people. He can be very likable on the phone.” As Trump hurries to solidify his Cabinet, he has been known to call his nominees unprompted just to check in, asking which senators he ought to lobby to help them win confirmation. “Who do you need me to call? Who do I need to call?” Trump asked one nominee, according to someone familiar with the conversation. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s choice for secretary of state, cited his prospective boss’s almost constant availability during his Senate confirmation hearing when asked how he would handle an impromptu Trump tweet that undermines his own diplomatic efforts. “I have his cellphone number,” the former ExxonMobil chief said. “And he’s promised me he’ll answer.” “And,” added Tillerson, “he does.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Trump might take national victory tour – Nov 13, 2016 Amid signs of transition trouble, Trump huddles with Pence – Nov 15, 2016 A brand boost?

X Underwater search for flight MH370 called off Countries end nearly three-year search for Malaysia Airlines jet carrying 239 people Tue, Jan 17, 2017, 18:07 An officer on an Australian air force P-3 Orion during the search for flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean. Photograph: Rob Griffith/AP         The deep-sea search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 ended on Tuesday without any trace being found of the plane that vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, the three countries involved in the search said. The location of flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the airline, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. “Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.” The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday after scouring the 120,000sq km area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the aircraft was not found or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators’ recommendation to shift the search further north, saying no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked, or whether all aboard perished and the aircraft was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the aircraft’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. Inescapable duty A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement that investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. “In our view extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” Voice 370 said. ADVERTISEMENT Most of the passengers were from China. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been “thorough and comprehensive”, and it “stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search”. “MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light, and the aircraft would eventually be located,” it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother Anne Daisy was on the aircraft, said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000sq km. “If money is a concern, prioritise within this area,” she said. Helpless and angry In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended “purely due to a funding shortage”. “The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life,” he said, referring to the flight number. The only confirmed traces of the aircraft have been three pieces of debris washed up on the island country of Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the aircraft. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro, has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American. – Reuters       Topics: Malaysia Airlines Australia Beijing China Kuala Lumpur Malaysia Mauritius Mozambique Reunion South Africa Tanzania Read More Serbia wants to annex part of Kosovo, president claims Ukraine urges Donald Trump to maintain tough line on Russia Theresa May to signal hard Brexit in keynote speech Istanbul nightclub attack suspect ‘has been captured’ UK exit from customs union threatens return of Border Trump plans to replace Obamacare with ‘insurance for everybody’ Trump considers removing press corps from the White House The value in Theresa May’s narrow vision and plodding virtues Hillary Clinton to suffer peculiar torture at Trump inauguration Gambians flee to Senegal fearing war over Barrow inauguration Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times US Donald Trump tells Theresa May he is ‘100% behind Nato’ Opinion Why Trump needs to hit the brakes on his trade plans Golf Tiger Woods’ comeback ends in a missed cut at Torrey Pines Politics Ireland encouraged to recognise state of Palestine ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest World Pence fires up anti-abortion activists in Washington march 23:37 Trump signs executive order implemeting ‘extreme vetting’ 22:41 Donald Trump tells Theresa May he is ‘100% behind Nato’ 20:46 Gambian man’s drowning in Venetian canal prompts questions 19:49 Close to 1,000 migrants rescued from leaky vessels in Mediterranean 19:48 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in News 1 Catholic priest from Co Clare marries long-time boyfriend 2 Driver with 483 convictions gets 18 months for killing teenager 3 French election to be showdown between Macron and Le Pen 4 My life on the Luggala Estate: ‘A slight otherwhere’ 5 Ireland encouraged to recognise state of Palestine Never miss a story.

We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.” More About: Trump and Manufacturing Mark Wilson, Hulton Archive, Getty Images Advertisement Boeing Co. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he “made some great progress” in face-to-face talks with Donald Trump on the president-elect’s demand to hold down costs on the next-generation version of Air Force One. In addition to Boeing’s contract to build the new Air Force One, the main presidential aircraft, they talked in their second meeting since the election about the company’s F-18 Super Hornet, which Trump suggested last month should be upgraded to compete with Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 as the Pentagon’s advanced fighter jet. “We discussed Air Force One, we discussed fighter aircraft,” Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York. “We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification.” Trump has shaken the defense industry — and put all large U.S. companies with government contracts on notice — with his Twitter postings. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, the president-elect boasted of “the massive cost reductions I have negotiated on military purchases,” although no specific reductions have yet been announced. Popular Now Apple and the Battle for American Manufacturing The Great Manufacturing Employment Challenge Moving From Dumb Manufacturing to Smart: Catching the Fourth Wave “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging with business,” Muilenburg said after their meeting Tuesday. “We’re on the same page here.” Although Boeing has announced plans to pare its workforce amid slowing commercial aircraft sales, its CEO touted the economic growth and the 1.5 million manufacturing jobs that the largest U.S. exporter supports: “You want manufacturing jobs — aerospace is the place to invest. We’re proud to take on that mission.” Trump’s public pressure on Boeing began on Dec. 6, when he tweeted that “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” In the wake of that comment, Muilenburg vowed that the Chicago-based company could build a new version of Air Force One for less than $4 billion. “We’re going to get it done for less than that, and we’re committed to working together to make sure that happens,” Muilenburg said as he left the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last month. Muilenburg said he gave Trump his “personal commitment on behalf of the Boeing Company.” More than a potent symbol of U.S. power, Air Force One planes are outfitted to highly classified specifications, which include secure communications and antimissile defenses, so they can operate as a flying White House in a national crisis. Boeing is currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of the complex military aircraft. Boeing isn’t the only defense contractor that’s felt the fury of Trump’s tweets. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson has met twice with Trump after he attacked the company for “out of control costs” on the F-35 jet, the largest U.S. weapons program. The $379 billion program for more than 3,000 fighters started development in 2001 after Lockheed beat Boeing in the winner-take-all contest. The 200th aircraft was delivered Jan. 11. Trump also called on Boeing to “price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet,” referring to the company’s F/A-18E/F jet, to compete with the F-35, a proposal defense analysts said was probably unworkable given the different roles and capabilities of the two fighters. For more news, notes and analysis about how President-elect Donald Trump and his administration could affect manufacturing, stay right here on IW.com and check out the IW Daily Newsletter, too, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning After the president-elect’s criticism, Hewson told Trump last week that Lockheed is close to a deal with the Pentagon to lower costs “significantly” on the next and largest production lot yet of F-35s. The push to reduce F-35 costs over time was underscored by Roger Carr, the chairman of BAE Systems Plc, a key subcontractor on the program. “Over a period there’s no question we’ve been told through Lockheed that the president has an ambition to reduce the cost of that aircraft by a material amount of money, many percent, into double digits over a period,” Carr said in a Bloomberg TV interview Tuesday from Davos. “We respect that and we’ll work towards a contribution towards that.” At the time of Trump’s tweet about Air Force One, it wasn’t immediately clear where his estimate of $4 billion originated. The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer said in an interview that the president-elect may be taking total acquisition costs and assuming that they are already built into the Boeing contract. On Air Force One and the F-35, “he’s heard these big numbers,” Frank Kendall said in an interview. “Those are often program costs, or maybe acquisition total costs. They’re not contract values, necessarily. “The basic aircraft is a small fraction of that $4 billion — the 747s we’re buying — so Boeing has part of that cost but not all of that, by any means. We’re still negotiating with Boeing on that.” Kendall praised the incoming president, who takes office Jan. 20, for his focus on reducing taxpayer expenses on large weapons contracts. “His general interest in reducing costs is terrific — his focus on that is good,” Kendall said. “But there are a lot of details I think he needs to absorb before he can talk about specific.” By Tony Capaccio, Toluse Olorunnipa and Julie Johnsson, with assistance from Kevin Cirilli and Benjamin Katz.

And once they ask for a price reduction, most of us put on our cost reduction hats and find a way to give it to them while maintaining margins.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Jan. 12, 2017 at 12:13 PM Follow @upi Comments PATUXENT, Md., Jan. 12 (UPI) -- The U.S. Navy has accepted its 50th P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance and anti-submarine aircraft from Boeing. The plane, which will be part of an eventual fleet of 117 Poseidon aircraft, was delivered at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla., earlier this month, U.S. Naval Air Systems Command reported. "I'd like to formally thank the team, including PMA-290, Boeing and our entire P-8A industry team, as we deliver the 50th P-8A Poseidon early and under budget," said Capt. Tony Rossi, the Navy's program manager for Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft. "This milestone demonstrates outstanding work ethic, professionalism and dedication to the fleet. "The P-8A is special. This is the first time a Navy combat aircraft was built from the ground up on a commercial production line. We've leveraged commercial expertise and experience, and a highly reliable airframe, the 737, which has reduced production time and overall production costs." The P-8A Poseidon is replacing the Navy's aging P-3 Orion. It features an electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turret and increased acoustic processing capability with 64 passive sonobuoys, 32 multi-static sonobuoys and concurrent passive and active processing.

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo The deep-sea search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 ended on Tuesday without any trace being found of the plane that vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, the three countries involved in the search said. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. “Despite every effort using the best science available … the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.” The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km (46,000-sq-mile) area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked.  Australia last month dismissed an investigators’ recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that.  Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked – or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water.  Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. “In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” Voice 370 said.  Most of the passengers were from China. TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. <a href='http://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a165bcc8&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'> <img src='http://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=20&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a165bcc8' border='0' alt='' /> </a> <a href='http://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/ck.php?n=af6a1a93&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'> <img src='http://antiguaobserver.com/adserver/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=21&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=af6a1a93' border='0' alt='' /> </a> Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been “thorough and comprehensive” and it “stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search”. “MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located,” it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing.  Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. “If money is a concern, prioritise within this area,” Nathan said.  In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt “disappointed, helpless and angry” because the search had been ended “purely due to a funding shortage”. “The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life,” he said, referring to the flight number. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania.  As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American.

Trump first criticized the presidential aircraft program on his Twitter feed Dec. 6 for costs “out of control, more than $4 billion and called for the cancellation of the contract to build two new 747-8 airplanes. The meeting also covered Boeing’s efforts to use commercial best practices in military aircraft programs through “streamlining the process (and) streamlining certification, Muilenberg said in remarks to the pool at Trump Tower aired on CNBC. “All that is going to provide a better airplane at a lower cost. I’m pleased with the progress there. Similarly on fighters, we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will… provide the best capability for our warfighters most affordably,” Muilenberg added. This meeting came four days after Trump met with Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson to discuss the F-35 fighter jet program’s costs. Trump said in a Dec. 22 Twitter post he asked Boeing to price out a comparable version of its F-18 Super Hornet combat plane to the F-35. Shares in Boeing were down $1.07 to $157.76 as of 1 p.m. Eastern time, while Lockheed’s stock was lower $0.38 to $254.15.

Trump last month blasted the proposed cost to replace the aging fleet of presidential aircraft. He met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg last month and again Tuesday in Trump Tower. Muilenerg said they were working to “to refine requirements for Air Force One, to streamline the process, to streamline certain features” and “all of that will lead to a better airplane at a lower cost.” He said Trump “is doing a good job as an agent of business” and added that more conversations would be forthcoming, though he did not set a timeline on settling on a final price tag.

The F-35B fighter jet undergoes flight testing from the amphibious assault ship America. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Samantha Masunaga and Aaron GreggContact Reporter For the second time in a few weeks, an aerospace giant emerged from a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump with news that the cost of a big-ticket program could be cut. It was the latest sign that defense contractors may have to play a new game when it comes to contract negotiations. On Friday, Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters the Bethesda-based defense giant is close to a new contract deal that would cut the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and also create jobs. The fifth-generation fighter jet has frequently been targeted by Trump, most recently in a new conference Wednesday, when the president-elect slammed the program for being “way, way behind schedule” and “many billions of dollars over budget.” "We had the opportunity to talk to [president-elect Trump] about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price," Hewson said. Her meeting followed a similar one with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in December, after which he told reporters that the company would build the next generation of Air Force One jets for less than $4 billion — a price tag Trump had slammed in a tweet earlier that month. Such meetings between executives and the president-elect could set a new precedent, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group. “It’s clearly his style,” he said. Hewson also said Lockheed Martin would create 1,800 new jobs related to the program in Fort Worth as part of the new contract deal. Lockheed Martin estimates the program accounts for 38,900 jobs in Texas, and the plane's supply chain touches 45 states. Lockheed shares climbed nearly 1% Friday on the news. In recent months, the president-elect has not been shy about taking to social media to criticize or heap praise on individual companies and military programs. A Dec. 6 tweet bashed Chicago-based Boeing for what he referred to as the "out of control" cost of the Air Force One presidential airplane. Weeks later he turned in Boeing's favor at the expense of Lockheed, tweeting that he had asked the company to "price out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet" because of the F-35's high costs. He also briefly brought up the F-35 in a Wednesday press conference intended to clarify his business conflicts, saying he would "do some big things" with the program and find a way to both trim costs and improve the plane itself. Voices on both sides of the political aisle have criticized the F-35 program's cost long before Trump took up the issue. The 15-year-old program has been beset by various delays and has never flown in combat. Each plane costs more than $100 million, though Lockheed and analysts expect the price will fall as the program matures and as more planes are built. “Regardless of how many you buy” of any weapons program, “the development costs are going to be about the same,” said Mark Gunzinger, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “So you could spread it out over many, or you could spread it out over a few.” Still, Trump's pick for Defense secretary, James Mattis, told lawmakers the president-elect remains a supporter of program. "Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on the F-35 program, and it bonds us tightly together with them," he said during a hearing on his nomination last week. "The president-elect has talked about the cost of [the F-35] but he has in no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants the best bang for the buck." Masunaga is a Times staff writer. Gregg writes for the Washington Post.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      Boeing Co.'s chief executive said on Tuesday that he and President-elect Donald Trump "made progress" on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft, and suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump's efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors. It also showed Boeing's adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy. Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Trump also last month asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the "excellent conversation" with Trump could lead to a deal "in the very near term." "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. "That's going to lead to substantial cost reductions." On fighter jets, he said, "we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably." Muilenburg praised Trump's approach to negotiations. "I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business," he said, noting that as the U.S.' top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. "If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest," he said. "We're proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country." "I appreciate the teamwork approach on this - I think it's the right way to do business." Boeing's stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trade. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith 1/2 left right Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of The Boeing Company, arrives at Trump Tower in New York City, U.S. January 17, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith 2/2 By Alwyn Scott and Doina Chiacu Boeing Co's chief executive said on Tuesday that he and President-elect Donald Trump "made progress" on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft, and suggesting a deal could be struck soon. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg's visit to Trump Tower on Tuesday marked another step in Trump's efforts to use his bully pulpit to cut better deals with defense contractors. It also showed Boeing's adroit use of the meetings to pursue its own sales and herald its importance to the U.S. manufacturing economy. Trump has been pressuring defense companies on prices through Twitter posts and meetings. Last month he said a $4 billion contract for Air Force One was too expensive and should be canceled. Boeing has said it so far has a $170 million contract for design work on the heavily modified Boeing 747 planes and that no final figure for the fleet of planes had been established. Trump also last month asked the Chicago-based aerospace and defense company to price a contract for Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet to compete with Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter, which is famously over budget. While not offering details, Muilenburg said the "excellent conversation" with Trump could lead to a deal "in the very near term." "We made some great progress on simplifying requirements for Air Force One, streamlining the process, streamlining certification by using commercial practices," Muilenburg told reporters after the hour-long meeting. "That's going to lead to substantial cost reductions." On fighter jets, he said, "we were able to talk about options for the country and capabilities that will, again, provide the best capability for our war fighters most affordably." Muilenburg praised Trump's approach to negotiations. "I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job of engaging business," he said, noting that as the U.S.' top exporter, Boeing supports 1.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs and 13,000 small and mid-sized supplier companies. "If you want manufacturing jobs, aerospace is the place to invest," he said. "We're proud to take on that mission and I think Mr Trump's engagement with industry is going to help us grow manufacturing jobs in this country." "I appreciate the teamwork approach on this - I think it's the right way to do business." Boeing's stock was down 0.6 percent at $157.87 in afternoon trade.

Prosecutors will not pursue Bridgegate charges against New Jersey governor New Jersey prosecutors on Friday said they would not pursue criminal misconduct charges against Governor Chris Christie in connection with the "Bridgegate" scandal. Trump has 'friendly' call with Mexican leader but he demands change WASHINGTON The presidents of the United States and Mexico spoke by phone on Friday after relations between the neighboring countries frayed further over Donald Trump's border wall plan, with the U.S. leader calling the talk friendly but still demanding reworked trade and other ties.

Australia last month dismissed an investigators' recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that.Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked - or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean.A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. "In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China.TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate.Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been "thorough and comprehensive" and it "stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search". "MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located," it said.Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search.Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility.Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. "If money is a concern, prioritise within this area," Nathan said. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt "disappointed, helpless and angry" because the search had been ended "purely due to a funding shortage"."The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life," he said, referring to the flight number.The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane.The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found.A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment.Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American.

(ATVI) Stock Looks to Rack Up Gains Trade of the Day: Oracle Corporation (ORCL) Stock on Cloud 9 Recent Posts: Dow Jones Industrial Average Continues the Climb Trade of the Day: Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock Building Up to More Gains Trade of the Day: Commercial Metals Company (CMC) Is on the Road to more Gains View All Posts Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) — On Nov. 10 I suggested the purchase of Boeing at $145 with a target of $175. On Dec. 13, it achieved $160 and, along with the market, is currently consolidating its gains. The consolidation pattern suggests that another breakout for this, the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial jets, is likely. And, as noted in my Nov. 10 Trade of the Day, BA stock is also the second largest maker of military weapons. Despite a supposed “dispute” with the new administration over the manufacture of Air Force One, things are still looking good for BA. Standard & Poor’s has raised their EPS estimate to $9.56 in 2017, up from $7.42 in 2016, noting that over the next several years, commercial aircraft demand is strong, with 787 and 737 production ramps. Cash returns to investors should rise due to stock repurchases and dividends. S&P’s 12-month target for BA is $172 based on 18X their 2018 EPS. Boeing’s trend is decidedly bullish, with “ramp-ups” from the low last January at $105 to its current consolidation. The stock, as noted on the chart, is in a consolidation channel from $155 to $160. A break from the resistance line at $160 should result in a 20-point run to $180 spurred on by new commercial and defense orders as well as further clarification of returns from the F-35 program. Moreover, BA pays a dividend of $5.68 for a dividend yield of 3.6%, which should attract those seeking long-term dividends from an investment-grade equity.

Cooper could have worked at Portland-area tech firm, scientists say Print Email Kale Williams | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Kale Williams | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 16, 2017 at 3:59 PM, updated January 16, 2017 at 4:05 PM comments "A lot of people think 'You'll never catch the guy,' but this is the closest we've been in a long time." A group of amateur scientists claim they may have narrowed the suspect pool in a case that has stymied the experts for decades. The infamous case of D.B. Cooper and the nation's only unsolved skyjacking has left investigators befuddled since a parachuted Cooper leapt from a Boeing 727 headed to Seattle from Portland on Nov. 24, 1971. But a team of "Citizen Sleuths" say that evidence they've uncovered could mean that Dan Cooper, the name used when the culprit bought his one-way ticket with cash, was in fact an employee of some sort of aerospace engineering firm. The crucial pieces of newly uncovered evidence: thousands of microscopic particles on a $3 clip-on necktie from JC Penney. "All of these particles are too small to be seen with the naked eye, but modern science can now track them to their source," the group wrote on their website. "These particles through their shape and composition can tell a story." If you are one of the few who are unfamiliar with the saga of D.B. Cooper, here's the short version: On that fateful day in 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper purchased a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle on Northwest Orient Airlines. He hijacked the plane, demanded $200,000 in ransom money, and having received it during a stopover in Seattle, jumped from the aircraft wearing nothing but a business suit and a parachute somewhere over the forests of southwest Washington. He wasn't wearing a full suit, the amateur investigators claim. A clip-on tie remained on seat 18E, where Cooper was seated. "Of all the possible things for him to leave on the plane, the tie was incredibly fortunate for this investigation," the Citizen Sleuths wrote. Namely because a necktie is one of the few articles of clothing that rarely, if ever, gets washed. The accumulation of particles can paint a picture of where the tie has been and the person who was wearing it. "Each of those particles comes from something and somewhere and can tell a story if the proper instruments like electron microscopes are used," the group wrote. The particles in question -- Cerium, Strontium sulfide and pure titanium -- are of note because because of how rare they are, lead investigator Tom Kaye told King 5 News in Seattle. "These are what they call rare earth elements. They're used in very narrow fields, for very specific things," he said. Of particular interest was the pure titanium. The mineral was widely used in aircraft manufacturing in the early 1970s, but titanium used in airplanes was almost always mixed with other metals, which ruled out Boeing, the region's largest aerospace manufacturer. Beyond that, metalworkers rarely wear ties to work, so Cooper would've had to have been a manager or an engineer. Given the other particles present, Kaye said the tie was likely in a plant that manufactured cathode ray tubes, which are vacuum tubes often used in televisions, computers and radar screens. A look at the tie under blacklight. The circles represent areas where particles were taken from the tie.Courtesy/Citizen Sleuths  The advanced analysis of the particles was made possible after the Travel Channel's "Expedition Unknown" show became interested in the group's work. The show funded a more in-depth examination by McCrone Associates, which specializes in particle analysis and lead Kaye and his team to identify a two firms in the Portland area that fit the bill -- Teledyn and Tektronix. Without the official capacity of the FBI, no one is quick to turn over personnel records, however. That's where Kaye is hoping the public will step in. Given the information his team has uncovered, he's hoping that someone who worked in this type of manufacturing in the correct timeframe will come forward. "We've narrowed down the field of potential Cooper suspects from millions of people in the United States to a very narrow group of people," he said. "A lot of people think 'You'll never catch the guy,' but this is the closest we've been in a long time." If you think you've got a lead on who the culprit might be, Kaye asked that you get in touch. --   Kale Williams kwilliams@oregonian.com 503-294-4048 @sfkale What do Portland city employees make?

The F-35B fighter jet undergoes flight testing from the amphibious assault ship America. (Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times) Samantha Masunaga and Aaron GreggContact Reporter For the second time in a few weeks, an aerospace giant emerged from a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump with news that the cost of a big-ticket program could be cut. It was the latest sign that defense contractors may have to play a new game when it comes to contract negotiations. On Friday, Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson told reporters the Bethesda-based defense giant is close to a new contract deal that would cut the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and also create jobs. The fifth-generation fighter jet has frequently been targeted by Trump, most recently in a new conference Wednesday, when the president-elect slammed the program for being “way, way behind schedule” and “many billions of dollars over budget.” "We had the opportunity to talk to [president-elect Trump] about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price," Hewson said. Her meeting followed a similar one with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in December, after which he told reporters that the company would build the next generation of Air Force One jets for less than $4 billion — a price tag Trump had slammed in a tweet earlier that month. Such meetings between executives and the president-elect could set a new precedent, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group. “It’s clearly his style,” he said. Hewson also said Lockheed Martin would create 1,800 new jobs related to the program in Fort Worth as part of the new contract deal. Lockheed Martin estimates the program accounts for 38,900 jobs in Texas, and the plane's supply chain touches 45 states. Lockheed shares climbed nearly 1% Friday on the news. In recent months, the president-elect has not been shy about taking to social media to criticize or heap praise on individual companies and military programs. A Dec. 6 tweet bashed Chicago-based Boeing for what he referred to as the "out of control" cost of the Air Force One presidential airplane. Weeks later he turned in Boeing's favor at the expense of Lockheed, tweeting that he had asked the company to "price out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet" because of the F-35's high costs. He also briefly brought up the F-35 in a Wednesday press conference intended to clarify his business conflicts, saying he would "do some big things" with the program and find a way to both trim costs and improve the plane itself. Voices on both sides of the political aisle have criticized the F-35 program's cost long before Trump took up the issue. The 15-year-old program has been beset by various delays and has never flown in combat. Each plane costs more than $100 million, though Lockheed and analysts expect the price will fall as the program matures and as more planes are built. “Regardless of how many you buy” of any weapons program, “the development costs are going to be about the same,” said Mark Gunzinger, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “So you could spread it out over many, or you could spread it out over a few.” Still, Trump's pick for Defense secretary, James Mattis, told lawmakers the president-elect remains a supporter of program. "Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on the F-35 program, and it bonds us tightly together with them," he said during a hearing on his nomination last week. "The president-elect has talked about the cost of [the F-35] but he has in no way shown a lack of support for the program. He just wants the best bang for the buck." Masunaga is a Times staff writer. Gregg writes for the Washington Post.

The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. "Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. "The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness." The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the US$145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators' recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked - or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. "In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. Traces A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokesperson did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been "thorough and comprehensive" and it "stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search". "MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located," it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. "If money is a concern, prioritise within this area," Nathan said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American. - Reuters For more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: Subscribe now mh370 Most Read Most Read Most Commented VOX KINI Related Reports mh370 M'sia to hold tripartite meeting on MH370 search direction 2016-12-22 08:41:00 M'sia says decision on extending search fo MH370 yet to be decided 2016-12-20 15:49:00 Investigators recommend extending search for missing MH370 2016-12-20 10:32:00 Investigators begin final sweep of MH370 search area 2016-12-14 17:44:00 Last search boat for missing flight MH370 sets sail 2016-12-13 14:18:00 Mkini Dotcom Sdn.

That’s what happens.” (An addendum from Trump: “Under the border adjustment concept, if somebody is making a motorcycle or a plane in our country, they’re getting a credit for the plane they make before they send it over to wherever it’s going. And you don’t need that plus lower taxes and everything else. And it’s too complicated. They get credit on some parts and not other parts. Where was the part made? I don’t want that. I just want it nice and simple.”) Story Continued Below Border adjustment backers have hoped they could win over Trump, who campaigned against recent trade deals and has hinted at wanting import tariffs, with a plan meant to incentivize exports. Among Trump’s problems with the idea: He thinks the dollar, which would need to appreciate to ease the sting on retailers and other importers, is already too strong. That doesn’t, however, mean that House Republicans will back down — because it’s hard to replace that roughly $1.2 trillion that a border adjustment framework raises. "Unfortunately our current tax code is not only complex, it favors Chinese steel over American steel, Mexican beef and autos over American beef and autos, and foreign oil over American oil. It's time to tax imports and exports equally in America, and end the 'Made in America' tax,” House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said in response to Trump’s comments. WHERE ARE THE EXPORTERS? In addition to not hearing much from Trump, anyone who’s been closely watching the tax reform debate in recent months has heard an awful lot from the industries and companies that would lose under the House GOP’s border adjustment plan — retailers, the Koch brothers and lots of others who rely heavily on imports. What you haven’t heard, at least publicly, is much of anything at all from the potential winners, including big-time exporters like Boeing, Caterpillar and General Electric. (Pro Tax’s Brian Faler reported recently that large exporters might never pay taxes again under a border adjustment plan.) Interest groups and lobbyists are hearing that an exporter coalition supporting the House GOP’s destination-based cash-flow tax is in the works, though details are pretty sparse right now. To some on K Street, there’s still plenty of time to get a coalition up and running, and have an impact on the tax reform debate. Others fear it might be too late, given the criticism that Brady and supporters of border adjustability have absorbed. But why have those with so much to gain been so quiet up to now? For starters, it’s just natural that the likely losers would be making more of a public commotion, and big exporters and other would-be winners have let top tax writers and their staff quietly know how they feel on the issue. You also have to ask: how helpful would it be in this current populist climate for big-name corporations to loudly advocate for a policy that would be so helpful to their own bottom line? And finally, brand-name exporters are already in major business advocacy groups, but those organizations have a mix of companies that both support and oppose border adjustability. Boeing, Caterpillar and GE are all members of the Business Roundtable, but so are Walmart and Target. Those three corporate titans also have a presence on the National Association of Manufacturers’ board of directors — but so does Koch Companies. In any event, Brady didn’t sound too concerned, at least publicly, when asked about the supporters’ silence late last week. “Opponents always get out of the gates early. Supporters tend to come at a different pace,” Brady said, noting that he’d asked for constructive feedback from opponents and remained confident that people would come around on border adjustments. “We’re working with everybody at this point, pro and con.” Y'ALL COME: Things might look a bit bumpy for tax reform right now, but there’s also this from the WSJ: “Companies are increasingly exploring the economics of moving production to the U.S., as an overhaul of the U.S. tax code looms and President-elect Donald Trump calls out their peers for expanding abroad.” Companies mentioned include Fitbit and Taylor Guitars. AFTER THAT HOLIDAY WEEKEND, we’ve now arrived at the final Tuesday in the Obama presidency. It’s also 124 years since a Committee of Safety, comprised of business leaders and planters backed by the American government, deposed Queen Liliuokalani, the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii. What’s happening out there? Email: bbecker@politico.com,teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, kodonnell@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax. ALSO OF NOTE: Trump, in a separate, rather broad interview with The Washington Post over the weekend, is sticking to a plan to get the corporate tax rate “as close to 15 percent as we can,” as Pro Tax’s Toby Eckert reports. Funnily enough, given his comments to the WSJ, Trump also said that he thought “we’re getting very close” on a tax measure. “It’ll probably be 15 to 20 percent for corporations. For individuals, probably lower. Great middle-class tax cuts,” he added. ** A message from Americans for Tax Reform: Obamacare imposes more than one trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) in higher taxes on middle class families including taxes on Health Savings Accounts, taxes on families with high medical bills, taxes on medical innovation, and taxes on health insurance. True repeal of Obamacare means repealing ALL Obamacare taxes. ** BUT WAIT … : There’s no reason to stop there with the potential tax reform obstacles. Entitlement reform might be an under-the-radar hurdle for a tax overhaul, but POLITICO's Rachael Bade reports it might soon be front and center. House Republicans will have to pass a second budget in the coming months to get a crack at using reconciliation for tax reform. Rank-and-file Republicans just went along with a budget that didn’t balance in exchange for the opportunity to take down Obamacare. But those lawmakers, who by and large have backed Speaker Paul Ryan’s entitlement reforms in previous budgets, don’t sound like they’ll be so forgiving next time. They’re hoping Ryan can convince President-elect Donald Trump, who has called the House GOP efforts on entitlements “political suicide,” to get on board with big changes to Medicare. But as Rachael put it, if that issue is “left unresolved, it threatens to sink tax reform, a top priority for both men.” ALSO REMEMBER: How much time Republicans spend dealing with the Affordable Care Act will undoubtedly have an effect on their tax reform efforts. And recent developments suggest the GOP might face a slog on Obamacare — POLITICO's Burgess Everett and Jennifer Haberkorn reported over the weekend that Trump’s saying he wants “insurance for everybody” is pretty tough to reconcile with his own choice for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who didn’t make universal coverage a goal of his legislation. Then there’s this, via CNN: “Price last year purchased shares in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics concerns.” INTERNATIONAL UPDATE ON SECOND THOUGHT: Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister and a well-known disciplinarian on fiscal issues, might be changing his tune on tax cuts, The Wall Street Journal reports. Schäuble said any tax cuts would have to come after September’s national election in Germany, assuming the Christian Democrats and Chancellor Angela Merkel are victorious, and would be for both businesses and individuals. The Journal called Schäuble’s comments a “stark shift in priorities,” but also noted that a host of other industrial countries have moved to cut their corporate tax in recent years and that governments might have more breathing room after moving to crack down on offshore tax gaming. STATE NEWS THE STATES AS A LABORATORY: If tax cuts have been the experiment, the results in states like Indiana, Kansas and Oklahoma haven’t been promising, the Associated Press reports. Comparing state budgets and the federal budget is far from apples-to-apples of course, but the AP notes that one common thread is policymakers often face forces beyond their control in both. “A recent Associated Press survey found that more than half of the states — 33 — are currently dealing with a budget shortfall or expect to confront one in the coming fiscal year. Experts say state economic growth has been slower than expected, with revenue in some places failing to meet projections or keep up with rising spending needs,” The AP added. A PICKLE FOR CUOMO: Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York is trying to cast himself as a national progressive figure while at the same time governing more as a centrist at home. That means that the looming expiration of a millionaires’ tax — almost 9 percent on household income over $2 million a year, or individual income in excess of $1 million — could cause the governor some political problems, the WSJ reported. So far, Cuomo has said he might be willing to continue the tax, but won’t commit either way. His next budget, expected Tuesday, could offer some clues, but there’s a reason state political analysts are saying things like: “The politics is that Andrew Cuomo wants to have his cake and eat it too, as we all do.” QUICK LINKS Poll: Most people still want to see Trump’s tax returns. AP: General Motors to announce $1 billion investment to keep or create 1,000 new jobs. Angela Merkel says she’ll fight for free trade, after Trump’s latest border tax comments. IMF foresees boost in U.S. economic growth after Trump victory. Financial Times editorial: House GOP tax reform plan deserves “serious consideration,” but other options are “simpler, less disruptive and less likely to start a trade war.” CNBC’s Larry Kudlow might be too free market on trade to be the chairman of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal and Chile pleads guilty to tax evasion, becoming the latest soccer star enmeshed in a tax mess. DID YOU KNOW? Akebono, born in Hawaii, was the first sumo wrestler not born in Japan to be awarded the sport’s highest rank — yokozuna. ** A message from Americans for Tax Reform: Obamacare includes nearly 20 new or higher taxes that hit middle class families, raise the cost of healthcare, and reduce access to care. The law imposes a tax on employer provided care, a tax on innovative medicines and other treatments, a tax for failing to buy government-mandated insurance, a new tax on health insurance, a tax on medical devices, taxes on Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts and even a tax hike on Americans facing high medical bills. In total, these taxes exceed one trillion dollars ($1,000,000,000,000) over a decade. The Obamacare repeal process is moving forward. Many members of Congress campaigned on lower taxes and reducing the federal government’s involvement in healthcare. They can fulfill both campaign promises by repealing all of Obamacare’s $1,000,000,000,000 in higher taxes. True repeal of Obamacare means repealing ALL Obamacare taxes. ** « View Archives Authors: Bernie Becker bbecker@politico.com About The Author Bernie Becker is a tax reporter for POLITICO Pro, where he is primarily responsible for writing the Morning Tax tipsheet.

The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. "Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. "The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness." The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 46,000-sq-mile area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators' recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked — or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. "In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines said the hunt had been "thorough and comprehensive" and it "stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search." "MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located," it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometers. "If money is a concern, prioritize within this area," Nathan said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American. NYC, in your inbox.

The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world’s greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. “Despite every effort using the best science available … the search has not been able to locate the aircraft,” Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. “The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.” The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km (46,000-sq-mile) area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the $145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators’ recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that.Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked – or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. “In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety,” Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been “thorough and comprehensive” and it “stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search“MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located,” it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. “If money is a concern, prioritise within this area,” Nathan said. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania.As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment.Twelve of the 239 on board were crew.

AFPBloomberg A file photo of a mural of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane in a back-alley in Shah Alam. Photo: AFP Kuala Lumpur: The underwater search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 was called off on Tuesday, leaving unsolved one of the most enduring mysteries of the aviation age. The Boeing Co. 777 aircraft disappeared on 8 March 2014, on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. According to satellite data, the jet headed south over the Indian Ocean for about six hours before plummeting into the water at up to 25,000 feet a minute. A file photo of a flight officer using binoculars at an observers window on a Royal Australian Air Force P-3 Orion during the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in Southern Indian Ocean, Australia. Photo: AP Here are the key dates in the disappearance of the plane and its 239 passengers and crew. •Flight 370 departs Kuala Lumpur at 12:41am, bound for Beijing. It vanishes from Malaysian civilian radar at 1:30am. A search and rescue operation is launched in waters east of peninsula Malaysia. • Malaysia’s air force chief says the plane may have turned back towards Kuala Lumpur for no apparent reason, citing radar data. In the coming days, the search area expands to the west of the Malaysian peninsula and the air force confirms the blip on its radar was indeed MH370. • The hunt spreads far south to the Indian Ocean after the White House cites “new information” that the jet may have flown on after losing contact. • Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announces that the plane appeared to have flown for hours, veering sharply off-route at roughly the same time that its communications system and transponder were manually switched off. • Satellite data suggests the jet’s last known location was somewhere along one of two huge arcs stretching north into Central Asia and south into the Indian Ocean. • With more than two dozen countries now involved in the search, the pilot and co-pilot, both Malaysians, come under scrutiny. FBI experts examine the hard drive on a flight simulator in Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah’s home, but find nothing suspicious. • A US-supplied “black box” detector begins scanning the suspected crash zone. No signals are detected within the locator beacons’ one-month battery life. A file photo taken on 30 March, 2014 shows Australian navy ship Ocean Shield as it lies docked at naval base HMAS Stirling while being fitted with a towed pinger locator to aid in her roll in the search for missing MH370 in Perth, Australia. Photo: AP • Australia announces the search area will be expanded across a huge swathe of ocean. The focus shifts for several months to mapping the uncharted seafloor before searching can resume. • A Malaysia-contracted vessel resumes the sonar search of the seabed for debris. Three specialised Dutch search ships join the effort. • Malaysia’s government declares MH370’s passengers and crew “presumed dead”, angering next of kin who demand proof. • Malaysia, Australia, and China say the oceanic search area for flight MH370 will double in size to 120,000 square kilometres (46,300 square miles). They later say the area will not be further expanded without credible new leads. • New Malaysia Airlines CEO Christoph Mueller says the carrier is “technically bankrupt”. The company begins to slash 6,000 jobs. • A piece of aircraft debris is found by a beachcomber on the shores of the French island of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean and sent to France for analysis. A file photo taken on 29 July shows police carrying a piece of debris from an unidentified aircraft found in the coastal area of Saint-Andre de la Reunion, in the east of the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion. Photo: AFP Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak later says experts analysing the debris have “conclusively confirmed” it is from MH370. • France says it will launch new searches by air, land and sea from Reunion island to hunt for more possible MH370 wreckage. • MH370 relatives begin filing a slew of lawsuits over the plane’s disappearance. A file photo taken on 29 July, 2016 shows a family member of a passenger aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 reacts during a protest outside the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing. The hat reads “Pray for MH370”. Photo: Reuters. • Malaysia confirms a piece of aircraft found off Tanzania in June is from MH370. A month later a piece of wing found in Mauritius is confirmed as having come from the plane. Other pieces of debris that turn up on various Indian Ocean shorelines are believed to be from the aircraft, although none is confirmed. • A new report finds Flight MH370 was likely out of control when it plunged into the ocean with its wing flaps not prepared for landing, casting doubt on theories a pilot was still in charge. • Fed up MH370 relatives travel to Madagascar to search for debris themselves. • An expert report says the wreckage of MH370 is almost certainly not in the Indian Ocean search zone, and may be further north. Australia and Malaysia say the report does not offer strong enough evidence to expand the search zone. The search is suspended.

My brother loved life, he loved his lifestyle, period.” Malaysia Airlines flight MH370: underwater search called off Read more Zaharie is the focus of several theories on how the Boeing 777 disappeared in the early morning of 8 March 2014. Authorities called off the search on Tuesday. A week after it vanished, the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, said military radar tracking revealed an unplanned route “consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane” before it went down, implying there was no accident. Since then, the case for the ”rogue pilot” theory has been repeatedly asserted as an explanation for why the passenger jet took an erratic course around Malaysia and flew south for several hours before smashing into the Indian Ocean. Several veteran pilots and aviation experts have added their voices to a scenario in which the most likely culprit was Zaharie, who was from Penang. They point to data showing radio contact and radar transponder transmissions were cut while the plane appeared to still be under human control. Suspicion around Zaharie’s role was deepened further when the Australian agency in charge of the search announced last summer that the captain’s home-built flight simulator had been used to plot a course to the southern Indian Ocean. “They have a right to their own views, just like I have to mine,” said Sakinab. But she has argued that 53-year-old Zaharie, nicknamed Ari by his family, was a generous and kind man with a warm sense of humour. In a commemorative note about her brother, Sakinab described a man with a “passion for life, for family and above all for flying”, who married his childhood sweetheart, had two sons, a daughter and a grandson. “I want the world to know here is a loving man who will stop at nothing to render help when it is needed,” she wrote. She described his compassion for other people, exemplified when he took family members on holiday or helped fix up their houses with his DIY skills. “My home and the homes of my sisters and brothers are not short of the things that remind us of him every day; framed pictures, leaking windows now repaired, a fish pond levelled up and nicely tiled, a new TV installed,” Sakinab wrote. Zaharie, she said, had a strong sense for loyalty towards his employer, Malaysia Airlines, which funded his dream to become a commercial pilot. He held an “unblemished flying record”, she said, after flying 18,000 hours since he joined the carrier in 1981. She told the Guardian the official investigation had been at best a “lackadaisical” effort and at worst a “huge fabrication”. “You see they have the state-of-the-art technology at their disposal. They have all the modern apparatus at their bidding. Boeing is by their side. Almost three years now … what have they got to show?” That 239 people can go missing in monitored airspace has baffled and alarmed the public, and Sakinab herself suspects foul play in one of aviation’s greatest unsolved mysteries. “Don’t forget the cargo,” she added, without elaborating. “However can a huge 777 just disappear from the surface of the earth?” The official investigation, led by Malaysia, Australia and China – the country where the vast majority of the passengers were from – does not back the pilot hijacking theory as the most likely scenario. Australia’s Transport Safety Bureau, the body that led the search operations in the southern Indian Ocean, has maintained an assessment it made in July 2014 that a rogue pilot is not their primary cause. The “best fit” based on the available evidence, they argued, was that there was a “hypoxia event” in which the aircraft was not properly pressurised and the pilots were deprived of an adequate oxygen supply. Hypoxia leads to extreme disorientation and even unconsciousness or death. It could result, the ATSB said, in a loss of radio communications, a long period without any manoeuvring of the aircraft, a steadily maintained cruise altitude while on autopilot and an eventual fuel exhaustion and dive. This is backed up by an investigation by Malaysian police that found no evidence that Zaharie or his 27-year-old co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, had any personal, medical or financial stresses. Their information was based on interviews with family members, including Sakinab. Many other prominent observers since then have dismissed the rogue pilot theory. However, until the black box is found intact with the jet, speculation will remain while Zaharie’s family grieves and searches for answers. His wife and children, who have never spoken to the media, are distraught, Sakinab says. “Sad is an understatement,” she said. “No one can even begin to make out our feelings about MH370 and our beloved brother being accused of ill intent.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SYDNEY: The deep-sea search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 ended on Tuesday without any trace being found of the plane that vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board, the three countries involved in the search said. The location of Flight MH370 has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries since the plane, a Boeing 777, disappeared en route to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. "Despite every effort using the best science available ... the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities said in a statement. "The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness." The last search vessel left the area on Tuesday, the three countries said, after scouring the 120,000-sq-km (46,000-sq-mile) area of the Indian Ocean sea floor that has been the focus of the almost-three-year search. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July to suspend the US$145 million search if the plane was not found, or if new evidence that might offer a clue as to its whereabouts was not uncovered, once that area had been checked. Australia last month dismissed an investigators' recommendation to shift the search further north, saying that no new evidence had emerged to support that. Since the crash, there have been competing theories over whether one, both or no pilots were in control, whether it was hijacked - or whether all aboard perished and the plane was not controlled at all when it hit the water. Adding to the mystery, investigators believe someone may have deliberately switched off the plane's transponder before diverting it thousands of miles out over the Indian Ocean. A next-of-kin support group called Voice 370 said in a statement investigators could not leave the matter unsolved. "In our view, extending the search to the new area defined by the experts is an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety," Voice 370 said. Most of the passengers were from China. TRACES A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, asked about the end of the search, said China placed great importance on the search and had actively participated in it alongside Australia and Malaysia. The spokeswoman did not elaborate. Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said the hunt had been "thorough and comprehensive" and it "stands guided by the decision of the three governments to suspend the search". "MAS remains hopeful that in the near future, new and significant information will come to light and the aircraft would eventually be located," it said. Boeing said it accepted the conclusion of the authorities leading the search. Malaysia and Australia have contributed the bulk of search financing. Malaysia holds ultimate responsibility given Malaysia Airlines is registered there. The aircraft is thought to have crashed west of Australia, placing it in its maritime zone of responsibility. Grace Nathan, whose mother, Anne Daisy, was on the plane said the governments should consider the recommendation to search an additional 25,000 square kilometres. "If money is a concern, prioritise within this area," Nathan said. In China, Jiang Hui, whose mother was also on board the flight, said he felt "disappointed, helpless and angry" because the search had been ended "purely due to a funding shortage". "The 370 incident is the most important thing in my life," he said, referring to the flight number. The only confirmed traces of the plane have been three pieces of debris found washed up on the island country Mauritius, the French island Reunion and an island off Tanzania. As many as 30 other pieces of wreckage found there and on beaches in Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa are suspected to have come from the plane. The engineering group leading the search, Fugro has raised the prospect someone could have glided the aircraft outside of the defined search zone to explain why it has not been found. A Fugro representative was not immediately available for comment. Twelve of the 239 on board were crew. According to the flight manifest, 152 passengers were Chinese, 50 Malaysian, seven Indonesian, six Australian, five Indian, four French and three were American.

Flyadeal, which is set to start services in mid-2017, is aiming to operate a fleet of up to 50 narrow-body jets by 2020 and Saleh Al Jasser, the director general of the state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, said last year Flyadeal would operate leased Airbus or Boeing jets. Airbus’ Middle East managing director Fouad Attar said Flyadeal would operate six of his planes. He was speaking on the sidelines of a news conference in Riyadh announcing an 80 aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia’s only operating low-cost airline, flynas. An Airbus spokesman later confirmed the aircraft type and leasing arrangements for Flyadeal. The current model A320s are being leased through an undisclosed leasor and delivery starts in the second half of the year, the spokesman said, adding that no further deals had been done with Flyadeal beyond the six aircraft. Saudi Arabian Airlines did not immediately respond a request for comment. An Airbus A320neo, the latest version of the jet, was displayed at Flyadeal’s launch in April 2016. The Airbus spokesman also confirmed Saudi start-up SaudiGulf Airlines, which recently started operations, has taken delivery of the four current model A320s it ordered. * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Southwest Airlines beats profit forecasts on fare price hike Raytheon hit as F-35 missile maker’s sales slow Ryanair targets Lufthansa’s Frankfurt hub to increase services Qantas relaunches Beijing route after eight-year gap MOST VIEWED Business | All Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet UAE and India pledge to boost bilateral trade by 60% London-based renewables investment adviser to open Dubai office Emirates slashes fares on routes to US, rekindling Open Skies tension UAE military contingent participates in India’s Republic Day parade Etihad Airways to deploy new Dreamliners on Levant and Far East routes Language of money best left to the present Singapore Airlines replaces Boeing 777 on two-stop route Airbus ‘in danger’ as Brexit trigger looms Owning cars, watches or art – directly or via a fund – is an investing option More Most Viewed ‘Ninety bodies found’ at Libyan ISIL camp bombed by US Matchmaking advertising billboards taken down in Dubai Life lessons: ‘My mother is British ... but I am 100 per cent Emirati’ Top Gear cast in Dubai for two-day shoot Emirati and Indian musicians release song to celebrate their countries’ friendship - video Trump changes his mind on Nato Burj Khalifa and Adnoc tower light up in colours of Indian flag Crowds cheer on Ironman 70.3 Dubai competitors and Ironkids Bombardier wins CRJ900 jet order from Irish carrier CityJet US businessman arrested after anti-Muslim tirade at JFK More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Fuel for Thought: Trump and Iraq’s oil Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent Municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Uncertain times in UAE football as China flexes its financial muscle Christo cancels Arkansas project and will now focus on Abu Dhabi’s The Mastaba About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Probably not. But if an old jumbo jet can look this fancy, we might be convinced. 8 ways to save money on your house bills Architect David Hertz has turned a scrap Boeing 747 jumbo jet into a snazzy mansion in the hills of Malibu, California. The plane-turned-mansion is the new home of Francie Rehwald, who interviewed twelve architects before picking David Hertz. She spent 15 years searching for the perfect bit of land for her custom home, which she wanted to have curves and ‘feminine shapes’. (Picture: Caters News) Francie ended up in Malibu, and set to work on creating her dream home. She fell in love with the idea of incorporating plane wings into her home. ‘I wanted something that was feminine,’ Francie said. ‘You might not think wings are feminine, but once they were detached from the place they really come into their own. ‘They have such subtle curves.’ David Hertz started to work on building a wing when it struck him – why build a house to look like plane wings, when you could make a house out of plane wings? (Picture: Caters News) He used two wings from a scrap Boeing and two tail fins, which were transported to the hills by helicopter. They had to close five roads just to get the wings there, and extreme care had to be taken not to drop them. More: Property This enormous mansion worth millions was sold to a charity for £1 7 things you only realise when you're buying your first home Kentish Town is the best place to live in London and here are 11 reasons why Francie also had to seek permission from 17 government agencies to build the home, as from the sky it looks a bit like a plane crash (which could be alarming to planes flying overhead). So, a lot of work went into Francie’s home. Plus millions of pounds. But for her, it’s all entirely worth it. (Picture: Caters News) The mansion now sits across 55 acres, has the feminine curves Francie wanted, and is pretty snazzy – with massive windows revealing views of lush surrounding mountains. ‘No one had ever built anything like this before,’ said Francie. ‘There were a lot of surprises that brought the cost up, but it’s just beautiful. ‘Every day is a complete and utter joy and I feel so lucky.’ MORE: Peaceful photos show what it’s like to live in a houseboat on the River Thames MORE: Alexander McQueen’s £8.5 million mansion goes on the market MORE: This incredible two-bedroom houseboat with a spiral staircase could be all yours (for £1.5 million) The Fix The daily lifestyle email from Metro.co.uk.

Flyadeal, which is set to start services in mid-2017, is aiming to operate a fleet of up to 50 narrow body jets by 2020 and Saleh al-Jasser, director general of state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, said last year Flyadeal would operate leased Airbus or Boeing jets. Airbus’s Middle East Managing Director Fouad Attar told Reuters Flyadeal would operate six of his planes. He was speaking on the sidelines of a news conference in Riyadh announcing an 80 aircraft deal with Saudi Arabia’s only operating low-cost airline, flynas. An Airbus spokesman later confirmed to Reuters by phone the aircraft type and leasing arrangements for Flyadeal. The current model A320s are being leased through an undisclosed leasor and delivery starts in the second half of the year, the spokesman said, adding that no further deals had been done with Flyadeal beyond the six aircraft. Saudi Arabian Airlines did not immediately respond an to emailed request for comment. An Airbus A320neo, the latest version of the jet, was displayed at Flyadeal’s launch in April 2016. The Airbus spokesman also confirmed Saudi start-up SaudiGulf Airlines, which recently started operations, has taken delivery of the four current model A320s it ordered.

Pic/AP Bishkek: A Turkish cargo jet crashed near Kyrgyzstan’s Manas airport yesterday, killing at least 37 people, most of them residents of a village struck by the Boeing 747 as it tried to land in dense fog, Kyrgyz officials said. According to the airport administration, the plane was supposed to make a stopover in Manas on its way from Hong Kong to Istanbul. It crashed when trying to land in poor visibility at 7.31 am (0131 GMT). The doomed plane ploughed on for a few hundred metres through the Dachi Suu village, home to hundreds of families, shattering into pieces and damaging dozens of buildings. Initial estimates put the death toll from the crash at 37, said Kyrgyzstan’s emergencies ministry. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev announced that Tuesday would be a national day of mourning.

By YaronSteinbuch A Turkish cargo plane trying to land in dense fog crashed Monday morning near Kyrgyzstan’s main airport, killing 37 people — including entire families of a village struck by the jet, authorities said. The ACT Airlines Boeing 747 crashed just outside the Manas airport, south of the capital Bishkek, on its way from Hong Kong to Istanbul, airport officials told Reuters. “According to preliminary information, the plane crashed due to a pilot error,” Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev said on state TV, Agence France-Presse reported. Russian broadcaster NTV said: “The pilot tried to make a second landing attempt but failed to climb.” The aircraft plowed on for a few hundred yards through the Dacha-Suu village, home to hundreds of families, shattering into pieces and destroying buildings. The victims included 12 children, officials said. A 9-year-old boy who ran home from school found that his entire family was killed in the disaster, the Mirror of the UK reported. The torn-off tail assembly ended up upside down — lodged into a one-story house — and twisted pieces of the mangled jet were strewn across a football field-sized area of the devastated village. Injured victim Baktygul Kubatova told AKIpress that his house collapsed as his family slept. “I was worrying about my children, that they could die,” he said, The Sun reported. “I woke up after I saw something red in the window. I had no time to realize what happened. … With fear, I covered my son with my hand to protect him from the ruins. My daughter received injuries, as she was sleeping near the window, while me and my son were sleeping on the floor.” Tajikan, who identified herself only by her first name, told AFP she heard a roar and felt what felt like an earthquake. “Many people were sleeping, everything around was burning. One of the parts of the aircraft fell on our neighbor’s house. She and her whole family died,” the pensioner said. Meanwhile, local media reported that looters plundered through the village — with one man held by police for stealing two kettles, the Mirror reported. ACT Airlines said in a statement that it was “deeply saddened” by the crash of its Boeing 747-400, noting that “the cause of the accident is unknown.” Boeing extended its “deepest condolences” over the crash and offered to assist Kyrgyz authorities with the investigation, AFP reported. Bishkek transportation official Marat Amankulovso said the jet was approaching the runway from the east, The Sun reported. “At the landing it didn’t come down on the runway, flew over it, its fuselage touched the fence and after that it crashed,” he said. “It is hard to say whether the fog affected the situation. We are told that all the standards were met, and that planes were landing in the same conditions earlier.” The captain was identified as Ibrahum Gurcan Diranci, a former military pilot in Turkey, the paper reported. He was previously involved in an emergency landing of an ACT Airlines plane at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan in 2010. A landing gear fault caused by poor maintenance was blamed in the incident. Prime Minister Sooronbai Jeenbekov was heading a government commission to investigate the Monday crash and the country’s state prosecutor also opened a probe. President Almazbek Atambayev canceled his visit to China to return to Bishkek, according to Kyrgyz media. This story was first published on NYPost.com.

Cooper Mystery - DB Cooper Full view DB Cooper (Wikimedia) New Evidence Found In 45-Year-Old D.B. Cooper Mystery    Hillary Luehring-Jones January 16, 2017January 16, 2017January 16, 2017Daily Digest, News, News Feed > FBI investigators have found new evidence in the now 45-year-old case of the missing robber D.B. Cooper. FBI AMATEURS FIND NEW EVIDENCE IN D.B. COOPER CASE On Thanksgiving Eve 1971, Cooper boarded a flight from Portland to Seattle, told a flight attendant he had a bomb in his suitcase, and demanded $200,000 and four parachutes. The plane landed, the FBI delivered on his demands, and the plane took off again. Cooper jumped from the back of the plane into the freezing night and was never seen again. The FBI have never solved the case and Cooper is still missing, if he survived the jump. Today, a band of amateur scientists chosen by the FBI have been researching the case and came across a new set of clues. After analysis it has been concluded that the necktie Cooper wore and left behind contained more than 100,000 particles, including cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium. “These are what they call rare earth elements. They’re used in very narrow fields, for very specific things,” said Tom Kaye, the lead researcher for Citizen Sleuths. At that time in 1971, these elements were rarely around, but they were being used for Boeing’s supersonic transport plane that was being developed by the government in the 60s and 70s. This leads them to believe that Cooper was tied to the Puget Sound aerospace industry. Given that the particles were found on a necktie leads the researchers to believe that he was a Boeing employee but not one running the machines. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines],” said Kaye. “He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.” Boeing was apparently developing radar screens, which used some of the elements found on the tie. Citizen Sleuths is asking the public for help, especially old-timers who might know what the elements could have been used for in the early 70s. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say, ‘Oh my gosh. I know what that means having those particles on the tie,'” Kaye said. Tipsters can use the “contact” tab on the Citizen Sleuth website with any information.

Alfa Laval - Equipped for Success, remove impurities at the right state Port of Seattle, Boeing and Alaska Airlines launch study results showing best biojet strategy for Sea-Tac January 16, 2017 | Meghan Sapp In Washington state, the Port of Seattle, Boeing and Alaska Airlines released a first-of-its-kind study that identifies the best infrastructure options for delivering aviation biofuel to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. In pursuit of its goal to power every flight at Sea-Tac with sustainable aviation biofuel, Sea-Tac is among the first airports in North America to work with aviation, energy and research partners to systematically evaluate all aspects to developing a commercial-scale program from scratch. The study evaluated more than 30 sites around Washington State that could potentially support the receipt, blending, storage, and delivery infrastructure required to supply Sea-Tac Airport with up to 50 million gallons per year of sustainable alternative aviation fuel (also referred to as aviation biofuel). Potential sites were evaluated both for the ability to accommodate near-term (12-18 months) supplies of five million gallons per year and long-term (2-10 years) supplies of more than 50 million gallons per year. In pursuing an integrated aviation biofuels supply chain, sites were selected based on the capacity to accommodate delivery of unblended biofuel by pipe, rail, barge, and/or truck, and were evaluated based on land use, zoning, and environmental considerations. The most-feasible sites were determined based on the construction costs of the needed infrastructure, environmental constraints, permitting and planning, and other contingences to help determine an overall score and final recommendation. • A small biofuel receiving and blending facility at the Sea-Tac Airport Fuel Farm is the most cost-effective solution in the short term; • The Anacortes-area refineries are the most cost-effective options for large volumes of aviation biofuel over the long term due to their access to marine, rail, truck, and the Olympic Pipeline; and • The Phillips 66/Olympic Pipeline Company sites in Renton also showed potential to accommodate receipt and blending facilities for moderate-to-large biofuel volumes over the long term.

In pursuit of its goal to power every flight at Sea-Tac with sustainable aviation biofuel, Sea-Tac is among the first airports in North America to work with aviation, energy and research partners to systematically evaluate all aspects to developing a commercial-scale program from scratch. “Unlike the biofuel itself, fuel blending and delivery infrastructure cannot grow on trees,” said Port of Seattle Commissioner John Creighton. “We needed this comprehensive analysis to confirm that we can offer commercial airlines feasible and sustainable delivery options while reducing our environmental footprint and being a good neighbor to surrounding communities.” Sustainable aviation biofuel reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 50 to 80 percent compared to fossil fuel. This is because a biofuel feedstock, or source material, absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) during its growth cycle (e.g. photosynthesis). Using biofuel also reduces sulfur emissions, soot and particulates. The study evaluated more than 30 sites around Washington State that could potentially support the receipt, blending, storage, and delivery infrastructure required to supply Sea-Tac Airport with up to 50 million gallons per year of sustainable alternative aviation fuel (also referred to as aviation biofuel). Potential sites were evaluated both for the ability to accommodate near-term (12-18 months) supplies of five million gallons per year and long-term (2-10 years) supplies of more than 50 million gallons per year. In pursuing an integrated aviation biofuels supply chain, sites were selected based on the capacity to accommodate delivery of unblended biofuel by pipe, rail, barge, and/or truck, and were evaluated based on land use, zoning, and environmental considerations. The most-feasible sites were determined based on the construction costs of the needed infrastructure, environmental constraints, permitting and planning, and other contingences to help determine an overall score and final recommendation. - A small biofuel receiving and blending facility at the Sea-Tac Airport Fuel Farm is the most cost-effective solution in the short term; - The Anacortes-area refineries are the most cost-effective options for large volumes of aviation biofuel over the long term due to their access to marine, rail, truck, and the Olympic Pipeline; and - The Phillips 66/Olympic Pipeline Company sites in Renton also showed potential to accommodate receipt and blending facilities for moderate-to-large biofuel volumes over the long term. “We’re using all of the Port’s expertise and partnering with Washington State’s greatest institutions to pursue this vision of making travel more sustainable,” said Port of Seattle CEO Ted Fick. “While we increase our operations, we work relentlessly to reduce emissions, lower our waste and limit our environmental impact.” “Commercial aviation is committed to reducing the industry’s carbon footprint, and biofuels are key to achieving that goal,” said Ellie Wood, regional director of environmental strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We’re encouraged that this study shows the viability of making a biofuel blend available to every flight at Sea-Tac Airport. As part of our global strategy to develop and commercialize biofuel, we’re proud to support our hometown partners and keep the Pacific Northwest in the forefront of these innovative efforts.” “This study represents a critical milestone toward powering our planes with a sustainable aviation biofuel made right here at home,” said Joe Sprague, Alaska Airlines’ senior vice president of communications and external relations. “After recently flying the first commercial flight with new biofuel made from forest residuals from the Pacific Northwest, Alaska Airlines is eager to see how biofuel flights can become a daily reality at our hometown hub at Sea-Tac.” An aviation biofuel production plant was not considered in this feasibility study. However, once a long-term aviation biofuel source is identified, it will be an important next step to determine its relative proximity to the sites considered in the study. The closer the source of the aviation biofuel to a biofuel blending and integration facility, the lower the costs associated with the fuel.

In February last year, the airline said it would use the NBN’s Sky Muster satellites to offer free Wi-Fi for onboard passengers through a partnership with US satellite company, ViaSat. Qantas began initial trials of the service on a Boeing 747 and will now commence testing on Boeing 737S and A330 Airbuses. The builder of the NBN, nbn, today released a test agreement detailing the terms of the trial for Qantas to assess the “functionality and performance” of the “aeronautical mobile satellite service” and to provide periodic feedback over nine months to nbn, to help inform the final mobility product. According to the proof-of-concept agreement, the service is a Layer 3 virtual private networking (VPN) service on the nbn network delivered over satellite, with nbn managing the connection between the air-network interface (ANI) and it’s mobility network interface (M-NNI). Following the initial announcement in February 2016, Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said in a statement, “You won’t be limited to checking your email or Facebook – it’s going to be about watching the football live, streaming your favourite TV show or movie, catching up on the latest YouTube videos, or shopping online.” “As a premium carrier, delivering value for money to our customers is extremely important to us. That’s why we’ll be offering access to Wi-Fi for free, on top of all the other things that are included when you fly Qantas,” he said. Since April 2015, NBN has offered satellite services to end users following the launch of its first Sky Muster Satellite later in October 2015. The company then launched its second satellite the following year in October 2016. However, the company tackled software upgrade issues as its Sky Muster II entered orbit, resulting in an outage that affected regional areas serviced by the satellite.

But we’re taking to steps to ensure it doesn’t occur again,” nbn chief network engineer, Peter Ryan, told ARN at the time. Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mitch Fifield, at the time suggested that, despite the outage, and reports of ongoing connectivity and data allowance concerns among those using the Sky Muster service, customers had returned largely positive reviews of the satellite network.

The aircraft was owned and operated by Istanbul-based ACT Airlines and was on final approach at Manas in Bishkek when it crashed, destroying several houses. Its registration was TC-MCL, a 747F that first flew in January 2003 and was originally operated by Singapore Airlines Cargo. The flight, TK 6491, was operating from Hong Kong to Bishkek and on to Istanbul. ACT Airlines operates on behalf of Saudia Cargo and under the MyCargo brand. Manas airport was closed after the crash, but resumed operations at 1:30pm local time. ACT Airlines´ fleet includes eight 747Fs. Its last C-check was performed Nov. 6, 2015. In a statement, ACT Airlines said the Kyrgyzstan and Turkish governments had begun an investigation. Russia’s Interstate Aviation Committee was also reported to have sent representatives to Bishkek to support the investigation. Boeing said its “technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities”. ACT Airlines named the four crew members who were killed as pilot Ibrahim Gürcan Diranci, co-pilot Kazim Ondul, loadmaster Melih Aslan and flight technician Ihsan Koca. There were differing accounts on the number of people who died on the ground, but at least 30 were killed and more injured. ACT said there was no clear information about what caused the crash. “The flight with cargo from Hong Kong to Bishkek and Istanbul went airborne as planned, after all the checks were carried out, and was approaching Bishkek Airport without encountering any setback or problems during the flight,” the company stated. “The crew rested for 69 hours in Hong Kong and checked out for the flight to complete the six-hour flight from Hong Kong to Bishkek. The airplane took off with 85,618kg of general cargo loaded safely. There are no faults recorded in the technical log book of the aircraft.” Polina Montag-Girmes montag.girmes@gmail.com KarenWalker Karen.walker@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Flyadeal, which is set to start services in mid-2017, is aiming to operate a fleet of up to 50 narrow body jets by 2020 and Saleh al-Jasser, director general of state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines, said last year Flyadeal would operate leased Airbus or Boeing jets.

An Airbus spokesman later confirmed to Reuters by phone the aircraft type and leasing arrangements for Flyadeal. The current model A320s are being leased through an undisclosed leasor and delivery starts in the second half of the year, the spokesman said, adding that no further deals had been done with Flyadeal beyond the six aircraft. Saudi Arabian Airlines did not immediately respond an to emailed request for comment. An Airbus A320neo, the latest version of the jet, was displayed at Flyadeal's launch in April 2016.

The plane slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, killed 37 people, and destroyed at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan’s emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev drew the conclusion that “crew error” had led to the crash citing preliminary information, Kyrgyzstan’s state-run news agency, Kabar, said. Poor visibility due to thick mist has been cited as a possible factor in the crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash. Pictures of the immediate aftermath of the accident showed a portion of the village badly damaged. In one image, the plane’s smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car’s roof was completely ripped off in another. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan’s capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan’s state-run Kabar Agency. It’s not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 — including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline’s website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane’s black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines — the country’s national carrier — under its flight number. The flight’s ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey’s Anadolu news agency.. ACT Airlines, which operated the plane, confirmed the news of the crash on its website. “The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available,” the statement said. “Boeing extends its deepest condolences to the families of those who perished in the Turkish Airlines cargo Flight TK6491 accident near Manas Airport Kyrgyzstan, operated by ACT Airlines, as well as its wishes for the recovery of those injured,” Boeing said in an emailed statement. “A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities.” Turkish Airlines expressed its condolences to ACT in a tweet. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company’s website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747’s enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

Cooper hijacking case Posted 7:58 am, January 16, 2017, by CBS4 Web Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Google Pinterest The FBI closed the case last year, but that hasn’t stopped amateur investigators from finding new clues in the infamous D.B. Cooper case. The case has remained a mystery since Nov. 24, 1971, when a man hijacked a Boeing 727, obtained $200,000 in ransom money and then parachuted to safety. Despite an extensive manhunt and decades-long FBI investigation, the identity of the hijacker has never been determined. The case has spawned countless theories. In 2007, the FBI opened the case to the public, sharing files and evidence. A scientific team analyzed particles from the clip-on tie Cooper left behind. A powerful electron microscope found cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium on the tie, according to KING-TV. Tom Kaye, lead researcher for a group called “Citizen Sleuths,” said the elements discovered on the tie were rarely used in 1971. However, they were being used in the aerospace industry in the 1960s and 1970s, when Boeing was developing a supersonic transport plane. Kaye and his colleagues theorize that Cooper may have been a Boeing employee or contractor. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines). He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye told KING-TV. Kaye and his colleagues are appealing for help from the public on what the materials may have been used for. They’re hoping “old-timers” from the aerospace industry in the Pacific Northwest could be particularly useful. Find more information about Citizen Sleuths and their investigation at their website.

In one image, the plane’s smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car’s roof was completely ripped off in another.

The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company’s website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747’s enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

In one image, the plane’s smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car’s roof was completely ripped off in another. ACT Airlines, which operated the plane, confirmed the news of the crash on their website. “The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available,” the statement said. The crash The plane crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the airport, according to Kyrgyzstan’s state-run Kabar Agency. Poor visibility was likely a factor, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of Emergency Situations, told Kabar. At least eight people — including children — were hospitalized, Kabar reported. Fifteen homes were destroyed, according to Sharipova. It’s not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 — including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline’s website. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan’s capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24.

Post the state government policy and the Vibrant Gujarat Summit, MSMEs are eyeing a larger pie in aerospace and defence sectors through component supply to the likes of Airbus, Boeing and Rolls Royce, among others. MSMEs are upbeat especially in the wake of memorandums of understanding signed during the summit that would lead to further opportunities in the aerospace and defence component manufacturing. For instance, several companies based of Gujarat, especially Saurashtra region who already supply precision components to aircraft manufacturers as well as defence and space agencies including ISRO are anticipating a rise in business by anywhere between 25 per cent and 40 per cent in the next 2-4 years. "With the likes of Airbus and Boeing signing MoUs in Gujarat, there is now an increased scope for precision component suppliers like us. We anticipate double-digit growth in business opportunities since the foreign OEMs are already familiar with India-based component manufacturers, even MSMEs," said Ashok Surelia, managing director of Surelia Wire-Cut Pvt Ltd. The defence and aerospace sectors have seen at least over Rs 10,000 crore worth of MoUs being signed during VGGS. Among these, Reliance Defence and Deepak Fertilizer signed MoUs worth Rs 2,500 crore and Rs 3,000 crore for manufacturing set-ups in the state. On the other hand, Rajkot-based Jaivel Aerospace signed a MoU with Boeing for setting up a defence specific training centre under the Skill India program. "Amidst growing opportunities in the defence and aerospace sector, there will be need for trained manpower as well in future. The MoU has been signed keeping this requirement in mind," said Praveen Koti, head-business development of Jaivel Aerospace Ltd. The component manufacturers are also upbeat over union minister of defence Manohar Parrikar hinting at a possibility of government company setting up a unit in Gujarat that could also bring business for the former. While stating that around 20 companies have been granted licenses in defence manufacturing units in Gujarat, Parrikar also said that the minister would later visit the state to discuss possibilities of a defence PSU's foray.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Cargo plane crashes into village Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cargo plane crashes into village 00:50 Story highlights Tuesday declared a day of mourning in Kyrgyzstan One of the plane's black boxes has been found (CNN)Bad weather and possible 'crew error' appeared to be an early focus of an inquiry into what caused a Boeing 747 freighter to crash Monday in a village near Kyrgyzstan's capital. The jumbo Turkish freighter slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of Bishkek, killing 37 people and destroying at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan's emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev blamed the crash on "crew error," but offered no details about the claim. The deputy prime minister said on Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar news agency that the government had reviewed preliminary information from the accident. Air accident investigations typically take months. A thick mist caused poor visibility at the time of the crash and was being cited as a possible contributor to Monday's crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash.

The tail of a crashed Boeing 747 cargo plane lies in a residential area outside Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan's capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar Agency. It's not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 -- including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline's website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane's black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines -- the country's national carrier -- under its flight number. The flight's ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey's Anadolu news agency.. Poor visibility was likely a factor. ACT Airlines confirmed the news of the crash on its website. "The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available," the statement said. Boeing also extended its condolences in an emailed statement, as did Turkish Airlines in a tweet. "A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities," the Boeing statement said. A Kyrgyz firefighter inspects the plane crash site. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company's website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747's enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The wreckage of a Turkish cargo plane is seen after it crashed in a village outside Bishkek. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

The jumbo Turkish freighter slammed into the village of Dacha-Suu on the outskirts of Bishkek, killing 37 people and destroying at least 15 houses, Kyrgyzstan's emergency situations ministry said. Kyrgyz Deputy Prime Minister Muhammetkaly Abulgaziev blamed the crash on "crew error," but offered no details about the claim. The deputy prime minister said on Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar news agency that the government had reviewed preliminary information from the accident. Air accident investigations typically take months. A thick mist caused poor visibility at the time of the crash and was being cited as a possible contributor to Monday's crash. Abulgaziev said other planes landed safely at Manas airport before the crash. Pictures of the immediate aftermath of the accident showed a portion of the village badly damaged. In one image, the plane's smoldering fuselage could be seen jutting out of the snow and the remnants of destroyed buildings. A car's roof was completely ripped off in another. Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev signed a decree declaring Tuesday a day of mourning. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan's capital of Bishkek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. It crashed at 7:18 a.m. local time, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) away from the Manas airport, according to Kyrgyzstan's state-run Kabar Agency. It's not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 -- including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline's website. The precise breakdown of how many villagers and crew members were killed has not yet been released. One of the plane's black boxes was found at the scene and it will be examined by experts from Moscow, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of emergency situations, told Kabar. The cargo plane was operated by ACT airlines, an Istanbul-based freight airline, but was flown for Turkish Airlines -- the country's national carrier -- under its flight number. The flight's ultimate destination was Istanbul, Turkey, Abulgaziev said, according to Turkey's Anadolu news agency.. ACT Airlines confirmed the news of the crash on its website. "The cause of the accident is unknown at this time and further details will be provided as they become available," the statement said. Boeing also extended its condolences in an emailed statement, as did Turkish Airlines in a tweet. "A Boeing technical team stands ready to provide assistance at the request and under the direction of government investigating authorities," the Boeing statement said. ACT Airlines, which according to its website operates a fleet entirely made up of jumbo 747s, also operates as myCargo Airlines. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 2003 and it first flew for Singapore Airlines Cargo, according to flight tracking from Flightradar24 and a detailed description of the aircraft on the company's website. Airlines have cut back on their use of the Boeing 747 as full-fledged passenger aircraft in recent years, but the jumbo airliner makes up the backbone of the global freight fleet. The 747's enormous size and unique rising nose cargo door have made it the aircraft of choice for many cargo airlines. The aircraft model has been involved in several crashes over the past decade, including a pair of accidents in 2010 and 2011 attributed to on board fires involving the shipment of lithium ion batteries. Shifting cargo aboard a National Airlines 747 was blamed for a crash in 2012 when the jumbo airliner was taking off from Kabul, Afghanistan, killing all seven aboard.

Poor visibility was likely a factor, Kubatbek Boronov, the minister of Emergency Situations, told Kabar. At least eight people — including children — were hospitalized, Kabar reported. Fifteen homes were destroyed, according to Sharipova. It’s not clear how many people were on board, but the freighter had seating for 10 — including two pilots, two observers and six additional passengers, according to a description on the airline’s website. The Boeing 747 was headed from Hong Kong to Kyrgyzstan’s capital of Bishek, according to data from the tracking website FlightRadar24. “We’re aware of the report and monitoring the situation,” Marc Birtel, a Boeing spokesman, told CNN in an email. Turkish Airlines, the country’s national carrier, expressed their condolences to their fellow Turkish-based airline in a tweet.

The order includes 100 of Boeing’s 737 Max single-aisle jets and renegotiated terms for 55 previously ordered aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement Friday. The airline also has options to purchase another 50 Boeing aircraft, including the 777 and 787 Dreamliner wide-bodies. The commitment, which was included in Boeing’s 2016 order tally, comes as the Chicago-based plane maker races to catch Airbus in narrow-body sales, the largest source of profit for the companies. The deal for the Max, which competes with Airbus’s A320neo workhorse, also helps Boeing widen its footprint in the fast-growing South Asian market. Most of SpiceJet’s low-cost rivals fly the European company’s aircraft. “India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can’t ignore,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order gives Boeing “a lifeline. There’s a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia.” Rapidly expanding Indian carriers will need 1,850 new planes valued at $265 billion in 20 years, according to a Boeing forecast. Single-aisle planes will make up the bulk of the new deliveries. The Asia-Pacific region, which is eclipsing North America as the world’s largest aircraft market, will need 15,130 new aircraft valued at $2.3 trillion in the next 20 years, as economic growth boosts middle-class travel, according to Boeing. That represents 38 percent of the global requirement. Friday’s deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the U.S. planemaker in India. SpiceJet, which is based in Gurgaon near New Delhi, and AirIndia Express are the only budget carriers to use Boeing aircraft in the country. SpiceJet shares climbed 2.5 percent to 65.50 rupees in Mumbai. Boeing rose less than 1 percent to $159.02 at 9:55 a.m. in New York. The airline placed firm orders for 100 737 Max 8 aircraft, with a cumulative list price of $11 billion, before the discounts that are customary for large customers. Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 6 that the carrier was close to signing a deal for at least 92 planes valued at $10.1 billion and that the total could rise based on negotiations for discounts and service contracts. “We spent a considerable amount of time negotiating and finalizing the commercial terms, including maintenance of the aircraft,” Chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview. “It was important for us to get all the commercial terms right.” Deliveries will begin in July 2018 and continue through 2024. The carrier and Boeing also discussed a proposed stretch of the largest Max, Singh told reporters. The so-called 10X, Boeing’s response to Airbus’s fast-selling A321neo, would be available in 2020 and seat as many as 230 travelers. The order signals a resurgence for SpiceJet after it almost collapsed more than two years ago. The expansion also sets up sharpened competition against IndiGo, operated by   InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., which has about 400 Airbus aircraft awaiting delivery. IndiGo dominates the world’s fastest-growing major aviation market, with a 42 percent share. SpiceJet has 13 percent. A representative for Airbus declined to comment. The world’s two biggest plane makers are vying to serve a crucial market with an emerging middle-class that is flying for the first time and where passenger traffic is growing at twice the pace of nearest rival China. While the growth is prompting India airlines to order planes, they also have to contend with airport infrastructure that hasn’t kept pace. Limited landing and parking slots extend the time circling above airports such as Mumbai during peak hours, wasting fuel.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint It's been more than a decade since a handful of ambitious entrepreneurs saw their plans to provide global telecommunications service through massive satellite constellations blow up, doomed by runaway costs. Now, a new generation of satellite entrepreneurs is headed back to the launchpad. Backed by billions of dollars from deep-pocketed investors, they plan to blanket the earth in the next few years with perhaps thousands of miniature satellites beaming cheap, ubiquitous broadband service. What's different? Launching one of these smaller satellites can cost a fraction of the price for a larger, school-bus-sized satellite. These new satellites will largely be mass-produced. And consumers now demand high-speed internet connectivity pretty much everywhere, on airplanes, cruise ships and in the remotest village in Africa. Companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb and Boeing have all recently proposed networks of satellites in low-Earth orbit to provide high-speed broadband access around the globe. Even Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has aspirations to bring internet to poorly connected areas — a plan that was derailed in September after a satellite set to beam high-speed service to areas including sub-Saharan Africa was destroyed in the explosion of a SpaceX rocket. If this latest wave of satellite networks gets off the ground, it could pose a challenge to a $224.6 billion industry currently dominated by telecom and cable companies with their miles of fiber optic and copper wires. SpaceX via AP SpaceX plans to launch more than 4,000 satellites. By its final deployment, the firm said it “will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth’s surface.” "That's going to shake up how these operators are controlling different regions, and it's going to allow the consumer a little more of an option," said Taylor Palmer, industry analyst at market research firm IBISWorld. In mid-December, the Arlington, Va.-based OneWeb said it secured $1.2 billion of funded capital in a round led by Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group Corp., which contributed $1 billion of the total. The money will fund construction of a Florida satellite manufacturing plant, which is to start production in 2018. SoftBank is just one addition to OneWeb's list of big-name investors, which includes Qualcomm Inc., Airbus Group, the Coca-Cola Co. and Richard Branson's Virgin Group. "One of the main challenges is raising financing from investors, so this proves they are able to continue doing that and they're still attracting money from these big, established companies," said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at market research firm Forecast International. "That's going to be really vital." Satellite-provided broadband service is still tiny. It generated revenue of $1.9 billion in 2015, said a June report from the Tauri Group that was commissioned by the Satellite Industry Association trade group. That compares with $97.8 billion for satellite television. But interest in satellite broadband is growing as consumers expect high-speed service in places that aren't always well-served by fiber or cable. Last month, Southwest Airlines said it planned to equip its entire fleet of more than 700 planes with Wi-Fi. "There's a competitive advantage for those that have that service available," said Tom Stroup, president of the Satellite Industry Association. "Broadband has essentially become an expected fact of life." Analysts say satellite constellations could have the biggest effect in remote areas. In 2014, almost half of the world's population lived in rural regions, which are largely unconnected to the internet, said the ITU, a special agency of the United Nations. "Internet access is fundamental for understanding of culture, cultural differences, civic understanding and participation," said Greg Wyler, founder and executive chairman of OneWeb. "It helps make the unconnected economically relevant to the developed world. When they're economically relevant, we pay a lot more attention to them." The company has an ambitious timeline. It plans to launch the first 10 satellites into low-Earth orbit in early 2018 to test their capabilities. More launches will follow, with its broadband access beginning as early as 2019. By 2022, OneWeb says it will connect every unconnected school to the internet. Eventually, OneWeb plans a 700-satellite constellation. OneWeb's satellite manufacturing facility in Exploration Park, Fla., is key to these plans. The company will mass produce its microsatellites with automated assembly capabilities similar to those used in aircraft production facilities, eventually making three a day. OneWeb has said the satellites will weigh about 330 pounds. SpaceX, based outside Los Angeles, plans to eventually launch more than 4,000 satellites for its network. Each satellite would be about 13 feet long and 6 feet wide, with 19-foot-long solar arrays. In 2015, the company received a $1 billion infusion from Google Inc. and Fidelity Investments and opened an office in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle, to focus on developing the small satellites. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the whole constellation could cost $10 billion to $15 billion. After launching an initial 800 satellites, SpaceX said it could provide broadband coverage to the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. By its final deployment, the company said it "will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth's surface." Boeing's proposed 2,900-satellite constellation is intended to provide broadband access to both commercial and government users worldwide. The aerospace giant said it planned to launch more than 1,300 satellites within six years of the license approval. In the past, satellite broadband was hampered by slower data transfer based on the long distance from Earth — a problem the companies hope to solve by putting their satellites in low-Earth orbit. They will also launch extra satellites to ensure coverage if a few break down. "If they're really able to optimize the production … and get it out at a cost-per-unit measurement that makes sense for a household … then it really could expand satellite broadband into a major competitor for some of these terrestrial companies," Palmer said.

Space Jan 17, 2017 05:35 PM ET SpaceX Must Still Prove That It Can Safely Launch Astronauts Into Space Before Elon Musk's private spaceflight company can use its rockets to transport NASA astronauts into space in 2018, it has a lot of work to do. The successful launch of a Falcon 9 rocket this weekend sets the stage for Elon Musk's SpaceX to regain momentum following its launch pad accident last fall, but the company is not out of the woods yet. With the Federal Aviation Administration's blessings, SpaceX settled on a short-term solution to fix the problem that caused a booster to burst into flames on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test. Modifying the fueling procedures, as demonstrated during SpaceX's launch Saturday from California, is a first step. The company is working on a new design for the containers of helium that sit inside of the rocket's fuel tanks to maintain pressure. Accident investigators traced the cause of the launch pad fireball to a helium canister in the rocket's upper stage liquid oxygen tank that failed. NASA will be closely watching SpaceX's progress. The U.S. space agency has hired SpaceX, along with industry stalwart Boeing, to fly astronauts to the International Space Station, hopefully before the end of 2018. Since the space shuttles were retired in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia for crew transportation services. SpaceX's plan to fuel its rockets after the crew is aboard has raised questions by NASA safety advisory groups. SpaceX super-chills its propellants to make them denser so more can fit inside the tanks. The rockets need the extra power so they can not only boost their payloads into orbit, but turn around and land back on Earth as well. SpaceX's ambitious business plans are based on reusing its rockets, which dramatically cuts the cost of flying in space. RELATED: SpaceX Makes Spectacular Return to Flight, Launching 10 Satellites Into Orbit Loading the cryogenics just before launch keeps them from boiling off as the rocket awaits liftoff. Skeptics say the procedure, known as "load and go," adds extra risk, particularly when humans are aboard, and figuring out how much risk is, in itself, another problem. "Despite testing at the component and subassembly level, systems often display 'emergent' behavior once they are used in the actual operational environment. We are concerned that any determination of risk associated with 'load and go' would have signicant uncertainty," the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel said in its annual report to NASA and Congress, which was released last week. "We strongly encourage NASA top management to scrutinize this issue and ensure that any decision to accept additional risk … is justified by the value that will be gained. The decision should not be unduly influenced by other secondary factors such as schedule and budget concerns," the panel added. NASA is particularly sensitive to issues of crew safety. Two space shuttle crews were killed during the program's 30-year history due to equipment failures triggered by unexpected and seemingly benign operating environments that turned out to be deadly. The 1986 Challenger explosion was due to a booster rocket O-ring that failed after a Florida freeze. The ring allow hot gases to escape from the rocket, triggering a catastrophic explosion 73 seconds after liftoff, killing seven crewmembers. RELATED: Will SpaceX Get People to Mars Before NASA? A second shuttle, Columbia, was destroyed as it flew through the atmosphere for landing in 2003. Unbeknownst to NASA, the spaceship's left wing had been damaged 16 days earlier when a suitcase-sized piece of foam insulation fell off the external fuel tank during liftoff. NASA didn't know the lightweight foam could punch a hole into a wing panel made of reinforced carbon composites. The accident claimed another crew of seven. "The trick is to recognize when the hardware is talking to you BEFORE an accident occurs and react to it," said Mike Leinbach, a former shuttle launch director who led a team that literally pieced together debris and flight data recovered from the Columbia accident to determine the cause of the accident. "For new hardware and its new managers, being proactive can be very elusive, especially if complacency and/or overconfidence sets in following a few successful missions," Leinbach told Seeker. "Be ever vigilant, (which is) easy to say, hard to do. And harder yet if egos cloud good judgment and engineering decisions." NASA's goal for the new space taxis is that they reduce the odds of losing a crew on any one flight to 1-in-270, which is about three times better than the risk of flying on the shuttle following post-accident improvements. The primary threat to the new vehicles comes frompotential orbital debris impacts. SpaceX plans an unmanned test flight of its passenger Dragon spaceship in November. Boeing is targeting a similar test of its CST-100 Starliner for June 2018.

SCOUT Sign In Share & Embed Bell's New V-280 Valor Tiltrotor Helicopter Engineered With Stealth Properties Kris Osborn 01/17/2017 / Originally published onWarrior Bell Helicopters emerging V-280 Valor aims to engineer an advanced tiltrotor aircraft able to hit speeds of 280 knots, hover and maneuver like a next-generation helicopter -- all while reducing the radar signature of the aircraft. Bell Helicopter engineers and weapons developers and looking at innovative ways to reduce the radar signature of their new, next-generation V-280 Valor tilt-rotor aircraft slated to be operational by the 2030s. While developers stop short of calling the new project a “stealth” helicopter, they do acknowledge they are engineering “stealthy” characteristics -- such as infrared (IR) heat suppressing systems and various fuselage contour constructions as a specific way to make the new aircraft less targetable by enemies. “We will definitely employ some passive measures in terms of how we shape the aircraft, to make it invisible. The key is not to be able to target it and reduce the signature passively so radar sweeps do not see anything. In the end, you do not want to get detected or engaged,” Vince Tobin, vice president of advanced tiltrotor systems, Bell Helicopter, told Scout Warrior in an interview.   While, quite naturally, many of the specifics regarding stealth technology are not available, there are a few broad parameters followed closely by developers of low-observability aircraft. They include reducing the heat signature coming from engines or exhaust along with efforts to shape the exterior of the aircraft to be less detectable to “pings” or return signals to enemy radar. Radar sends electromagnetic signals, pulses or “pings” traveling at the speed of light – bounces them off of an object – and analyzes the return signal to determine the shape, size and speed of an enemy target. For this reason, electronic “jamming” is another tactic used to thwart or throw off enemy radar systems. Recognizing the importance of lowering the helicopters heat signature, Tobin explained that Bell is now investigating cutting-edge engine technologies specifically designed to reduce the heat they emit. “We are looking for opportunities to reduce that heat signature. A lot of new technologies that the engine companies are looking for include seeking the best ways to ensure maximum performance of the engine while using an IR suppressor,” Tobin explained. A key strategy, Tobin explained, is to use IR suppressor to reduce the signature so that less “jamming” is needed to confuse enemy radar.   Advancing Tiltrotor Technology  Bell intends to build upon and advance existing tiltrotor technology such as that which is currently operation in the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey aircraft. The Osprey continues to perform well in a wide range of missions and has recently been selected by the Navy to perform the Carrier On-board Delivery or COD mission transporting troops, equipment and weapons on-and-off surface ships.  The V-280 Valor is designed to be slightly bigger than an existing Black Hawk helicopter and use 24-inch seats to carry 11 passengers with gear, Tobin said.  “What Bell has done is taking its historical V-22 aircraft, and all the demonstrators before that, and applies them to this next-generation tilt-rotor. It is a straight wing versus a V-22 which is not straight. This reduces complexity,” Dan Bailey, JMR TD Program Manager, said in an interview with Scout Warrior last year. “They are also building additional flapping into the rotor system and individual controls that should allow for increased low-speed maneuverability.” The tiltrotors were engineered into the aircraft this past November, Tobin added. “We will get the gear boxes and transmission in before we get those blades on,” Tobin explained. Depending upon ultimate requirement established by the Army and DoD, Bell expects to engineer an attack variant of the aircraft with a slightly different fuselage configuration. “An armed attack version will have a gun, 2.75in folding-fin rockets and some type of point-to-point missile - hellfire or some later generation missile that would guide off of a laser or IR. We are being open ended in that we are not designing any specific requirement,” Tobin explained. V-280 Valor Uses F-35 Sensor The V-280 Valor next-generation tiltrotor aircraft for the 2030s includes the integration of a high-tech 360-degree sensor suite quite similar to the one used on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter called a Distributed Aperture Systems, or DAS, developers explained.  “Instead of having sensors mounted to the turret, you have sensors that are mounted to the aircraft – so essentially you have sensors staring in 360-degrees around the aircraft at any given time. Those images are stitched together so it appears as one continuous image to the pilot. Both pilots can make use of the same system,” Tobin said.  This technology will also allow troops riding in the back of the aircraft to wear goggles or a helmet giving them a view of the surrounding sensor feeds as they transit to a mission, Tobin added. The Northrop Grumman-built DAS system will also form the basis of a small-arms enemy fire detection technology which will search for and locate the signature of incoming enemy attacks. The sensors will be able to discern the location and heat signature coming from enemy small arms fire, giving the aircraft and opportunity to quickly attack with its weapons – lowering risk of injury to the pilots, crew and passengers. Army Future Vertical Lift - 2030s The new Bell tiltrotor, called the V-280 Valor, is part of the Army’s Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator program aimed at establishing requirements and paving the way toward a new Future Vertical Lift aircraft designed to meet a wide range of new requirements. The concept behind the Army’s joint Future Vertical Lift program is to engineer a forward-looking, future aircraft able to reach airplane speeds and yet retain and ability to hover and maneuver like a helicopter. “The aircraft will have an ability to come to a hover in challenging conditions and then, while at a hover, operate at low speeds with maneuvering capability to roll and yaw. We want it to have the handling perspective to make the aircraft able to do what it is able to do,” Tobin added. The V-280 Valor will also have yet-to-be-determined Degraded Visual Environment technology that allows sensors to see through obscurants such as brown-out conditions, bad weather and other impediments to navigation. Part of this will also include a system called Controlled Flight into Terrain wherein an aircraft has an ability to quickly re-route itself it is approaching a dangerous obstacle such as a mountain, rock wall or building structure. The new attack variant is expected to use a modernized or next-generation of existing Apache sensors and targeting systems called the Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor, or MTADS/PVS. When it comes to sensors and mission equipment, Bell engineers are building a tiltrotor aircraft with what is called “open architecture,” meaning software and hardware able to quickly integrate new technologies as they emerge. The concept is to construct a helicopter that is not intended to operate today but rather advance technology well into the 2030s and beyond. Therefore, it will need to anticipate the weapons, sensors, computer processors and avionics likely to emerge by the 2030s. This will likely draw upon a semi-autonomous navigation technology built into the aircraft known as “fly-by-wire.”  Bell Helicopter developed the initial algorithms for this technology, which is also now on the V-22 Osprey. Another survivability technology potentially slated for the aircraft is a system known as Common Infrared Countermeasure, or CIRCM; CIRCM is a lighter weight variant of an existing technology which uses a laser-jammer to throw incoming enemy missiles off course – therefore protecting the aircraft. "We are looking to the DoD customer to see what they want. Either way we can get that on the airplane,” Tobin explained. Bell helicopter has now attached the wing to the fuselage of the new tiltrotor aircraft engineered to reach speeds of 280 knots, fly for 800 kilometers on one tank of fuel, hover and maneuver in “high-hot” conditions and function as both a utility and attack helicopter platform. The intention is to build an advanced, high-tech tiltrotor demonstrator aircraft to take flight in November of 2017 as part of an effort to ultimate build a future aircraft able to begin operations in the 2030s. “There is one long wing. We attach the middle of the wing to the fuselage - the entire wing is one piece bolted to the fuselage of the airplane. One wing covers both sides. The wing is attached with aircraft grade structural fasteners. There are enough aircraft fasteners to provide sufficient strength to hold the aircraft together,” Tobin said.  As of January  of this year, Bell engineers are 81-percent complete with the aircraft; the wing is attached and the wiring is put in, Tobin said. In the next few months, Bell engineers will begin installation of the gear boxes and the fuel tanks.  Ground vibration testing is also slated to take place in coming months, to be followed by scale-model wind-tunnel data.  In addition, the future aircraft is intended to be able to use fuel-efficient engine technology to allow an aircraft to travel at least 800 kilometers on a single tank of fuel. Such an ability will enable the aircraft to operate more easily one a single mission without needing Forward Arming and Refueling Points, or FARPs. The idea is to engineer and aircraft able to fly from the west coast to Hawaii without needing to refuel. “FVL is a high priority. We have identified capability gaps. We need technologies and designs that are different than what the current fleet has. It will carry more equipment, perform in high-hot conditions, be more maneuverable within the area of operations and execute missions at longer ranges,” Rich Kretzschmar, project manager for the FVL effort, told Scout Warrior in an interview several months ago. Requirements for the program are still being refined for the Army-led program, which is aimed at service future aircraft for all four services. These requirements, now being put into actual demonstrator aircraft built by both Bell and a Boeing-Sikorsky industry teams, include building and aircraft able to reach speeds greater than 230 knots, hover in thin air at 6,000-feet and 95-degrees Fahrenheit, achieve a combat radius of at least 434 kilometers and be configured to include emerging sensors and mission equipment technologies likely to emerge by the 2030s. “We had set 230 as the speed requirement because we wanted to push the technology.  We wanted people to bring new ideas and new configurations to the table,” Bailey said.   Kris Osborn can be reached at Kris.Osborn@Scout.com.

The disappearance of the jet, which had 239 on board, has been blamed on everything from terror and pilot suicide to aliens. Australia, Malaysia and China – the countries that funded the £133million operation in the Indian Ocean – said the decision to halt it was taken with “sadness” but that their checks were “complete”. MH370 vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. For families of the 227 passengers and 12 crew on the Boeing 777 – 153 from China – the end of the search means they have no real hope of solving the puzzle. Officials were recently forced to admit they had been looking for the plane in the wrong place. Read More How did Flight MH370 disappear? 19 bizarre conspiracy theories over missing Malaysia Airlines plane as three-year search ends The New Zealand air force on the hunt for the plane (Photo: Getty) The joint agency co-ordination centre in Australia, which led the hunt, said research suggested it crashed north of the remote waters being searched to the west of the country. But it added: “Despite every effort, the search has not been able to locate the aircraft. Accordingly, the underwater search for MH370 has been suspended.” Pieces of debris have been found as far away as Madagascar but only three have been identified as ­definitely from the plane. The Australian government had warned that the hunt would be suspended once checks on the agreed search zone were exhausted, unless new evidence emerged to pinpoint the jet’s specific location. Read More Officials end £130 million search for missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 three years after jet disappeared with 239 aboard France's BEA air crash investigation agency said it was examining the debris (Photo: Reuters) Since no current technology can tell investigators where the plane is, the most expensive and complex search in aviation history is over. A private donor could bankroll work and Malaysia may offer fresh funds – but both are unlikely. Family support group Voice 370 described the search as “an inescapable duty owed to the flying public in the interest of aviation safety”. It said: “Stopping at this stage is nothing short oirresponsible.” Until the wreck is found, the conspiracy theories about the jet’s fate are sure to continue. Here are the most popular theories... 1 Fire Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 (Photo: Getty) A blaze killed everyone but burned out before damaging the exterior of the plane. This would explain why the aircraft, on auto-pilot, flew a long distance off course. It would have hit the water at around 600mph after gliding down from 35,000ft. 2 Terrorism Shippers carry an aircraft wing suspected to be a part of missing MH370 (Photo: Getty/REUTERS) Two passengers boarded with stolen passports. David Learmount, of Flight Global magazine, said: “Something happened and the pilots did not tell anyone. Why? It’s extraordinary the pilots failed to call. "They had plenty of time. Unless there was a bomb but there has been no evidence of that.” 3 Secret weapon Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch NextNew MH370 debris found in Mozambique Watch this video again Watch Next Suspected debris from MH370 found on the coast of1:38 Trump signs executive order for tighter vetting0:46 Another dolphin dies at the hands of selfie-hunti0:47 Inside North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear reactor0:38 Trump bags public invitation from The Queen to vi0:46 Trump and May hold hands in bizarre tender moment0:39 Watch Trump and May's first press conference toge18:59 Trump's vice president says US will end state-fun0:37 Trump poses with May in front of bust of Churchill1:05 Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next Website Natural News, run by Mike Adams, posted: “If we never find debris, it means some entirely new, mysterious and powerful force is at work on our planet, which can pluck planes out of the sky without leaving even a shred of evidence.” 4 Hijack Author Christine Negroni believes a bathroom break could have downed flight MH370 (Photo: christinenegroni.com) A Russian newspaper claimed MH370 was hijacked and flown to Afghanistan, where crew and passengers were being held captive. A military source told the Moskovsky Komsomolets: “Pilots are not guilty; the plane was hijacked by unknown terrorists. "We know the name of the terrorist who gave instructions to pilots. The plane is in Afghanistan.” 5 Warfare test gone wrong Burnt wreckage suspected to be from the missing MH370 flight (Photo: 7 News) MH370 “cloaked” using hi-tech electronic weaponry. One website stated: “This technology is precisely the expertise of Freescale, that has employees on the missing flight.” It also sparked theories the jet was taken by North Korea for similarly unknown purposes. 6 Pilot suicide Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah (Photo: Daily Mirror) There is no evidence against captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. Malaysia Airlines said their staff had an excellent record, adding: “We have no reason to believe the crew caused the disappearance of this aircraft.” 7 Hidden by another plane Police officers inspect metallic debris found on a beach in Saint-Denis on the French Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean (Photo: Getty) Lost from radar beneath another aircraft. Blogger Keith Ledgerwood said: “It is my belief that MH370 likely flew in the shadow of Singapore Airlines flight 68 through India and Afghanistan airspace. “As MH370 was flying ‘dark’ without a transponder, SIA 68 would have had no knowledge that MH370 was anywhere around as it entered Indian airspace.” 8 Military op Metallic debris found on a beach in Saint-Denis on the French Reunion Island (Photo: Getty) The book Flight MH370: The Mystery claims the airliner was shot down by US-Thai strike fighters in a training drill blunder. Relatives of victims from 14 nations described the UK publication as “insensitive”. 9 Insurance scam The flaperon discovered on Reunion Island has been officially identified as being part of a Boeing 777 aircraft (Photo: Rex) A Malaysian police chief refused to rule this out. Khalid Abu Bakar insisted authorities were exploring every single avenue. “Maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it,” he said. 10 Diego Garcia Malaysian Prime Minister confirms plane wreckage on Reunion Island is that of MH370 (Photo: SkyNews) The plane landed at the US military base on the remote island of Diego Garcia, a small coral atoll in the Indian Ocean. The US said there is no truth in this speculation. 11 CIA plot A Malaysian expert looks for debris from the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on a beach in Saint-Andre de la Reunion (Photo: Getty) Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad wrote in a 2015 blog: “Boeing and certain agencies have the capacity to take over uninterruptible control of commercial airliners, of which MH370 is one. Someone is hiding something.” 12 Alien abduction Johnny Begue, who stumbled across a piece of plane wreckage from the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 (Photo: Getty) Social media users blame extra-terrestrials. One posted: “I believe that plane is abducted by aliens. I know I’m not the only one.” A second added: “There were only two possibilities for its ­disappearance, aliens or a DB Cooper-style heist.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Malaysia Airlines Diego Garcia Flight MH370 Conspiracy theories News all Most Read Most Recent Melania TrumpIs this why Melania's face dropped at Donald Trump's inauguration?

He ventured just five blocks, to dinner at the 21 Club — a dark-mahogany-and-red-leather-banquette throwback, where model airplanes and sports memorabilia hang from the ceiling and jackets are de rigueur for men. The vintage haunt, where Trump dined with family members, feels like home. The waiters know his preferred table (No. 14, where Frank Sinatra and Richard M. Nixon once ate) and his regular order (the $36 burger, well done, with fries). So it has been for the president-elect, who has retreated to one comfortable, familiar refuge after another — his soaring Manhattan tower, his white leather-upholstered Boeing jet, his lush golf courses, his opulent beachside castle. Trump is a man isolated, increasingly cosseted away from the voters who lifted him to his seemingly improbable victory. He favors his own people and his own places, creating the veneer of accessibility — his tweets reach millions and he still answers his cellphone — while placing himself in almost entirely habitual settings. He spends most of his days in Trump Tower, with few close friends and few meaningful one-on-one interactions beyond the family members, advisers and loyalists who are whisked by gold elevator to his 26th-floor office for private audiences. Trump rarely leaves, not even for a breath of fresh air; nor does he encounter many people he does not already know or who do not work for him. Yet Trump remains omnipresent in American life, constantly communicating with the public via Twitter and media interviews without the varnish of news releases or the protection of handlers. Whether it is Meryl Streep's remarks about him or the question of Russian hacking, no topic is too mundane or charged for him to lend his voice to it. And he answers his personal cellphone, something that acquaintances and colleagues speak of in almost reverential terms. As he prepares to enter the White House, Trump is resisting his advisers' efforts to take away his cellphone or at least restrict his use of it, said one person close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of private conversations. They worry about national security; he worries about losing touch. When Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) needs to reach Trump, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman does not have to go through an aide or schedule a meeting. He said he simply dials Trump's cellphone directly, and the president-elect answers, even though Corker's number registers as "No Caller ID." "I've never seen anything relative to access like this. Unbelievable," Corker told reporters recently. "I don't think there's likely been a White House like this, maybe ever, but certainly in modern history." In many ways, Trump seems most comfortable communicating at a slight remove, with a stage or a screen - television, Twitter, phone — serving as the intermediary between him and the public. Such tools are both his megaphone and his shield, allowing him to blast out a message undiluted with little risk. "He sees the power of mass communication, which goes through screens, and he recognizes its importance," said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and the chief executive of the website Newsmax Media. "He's clearly studied the art of it and developed an online and TV persona that's very powerful. If you look, he's very much impressed by people who are on TV or come across well on TV, because he thinks it's such critical marketing." Trump has shunned some of the traditional photo ops that his predecessors have orchestrated to demonstrate compassion and forge a connection with everyday Americans. He spent Veterans Day in November not laying a wreath at a memorial site, as President-elect Barack Obama did in 2008 to pay tribute to fallen soldiers, but staying inside Trump Tower (even though New York's historical parade was marching right outside along Fifth Avenue). On Thanksgiving and Christmas, he celebrated in private with family members and friends, making no public appearances at military bases or homeless shelters or soup kitchens. "A lot of what you see by previous presidents are platitudes: 'I'm going to go and pretend I'm supportive of a particular entity and serve food at a soup kitchen,' " said Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager of Trump's. "Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back so we don't have soup kitchens. He has not been a person to do staged events for the sake of doing staged events." Trump's duality — his wariness of those not in his trusted orbit, yet his insatiable desire for constant contact and feedback — has posed challenges for his advisers and could ultimately leave him detached from everyday voters. He does not use email and rarely surfs the Internet, meaning that telephone calls, television appearances or physical proximity are the best ways to reach him. As his three successive campaign managers quickly learned, whoever controls the flow of information to Trump controls the man — at least as much as he can be contained. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was a trusted campaign adviser to Trump, said he expects the new president's relationship with Congress to be a mix of salesmanship and accessibility. "Trump will be a larger figure who's more aloof and more distant, but whose weight and effectiveness is so great he will clearly be a dominating figure," Gingrich said. "He'll bounce back and forth between the two worlds. When he comes into the congressional world, he'll be very effective on the personal level." But, Gingrich added, "On another level he'll be very distant and you'll see him by tweet and you'll see him on Fox and Friends." Trump's distance, friends say, stems in part from a certain insularity, with the developer turned politician preferring his own properties, stocked with his own people. Ruddy, who is a member of the private Mar-a-Lago club and whose Newsmax is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., said he has lived in the area for two decades, yet he can count on one hand the number of times he has seen Trump outside of his private Florida retreats. "He's an old-shoe type of guy - he likes to be in his comfort zone, which are his golf clubs and his homes," Ruddy said. "He likes people he's comfortable with and likes, and if he doesn't feel comfortable around you, he's not going to be inviting you around." Trump has only gone out to eat a few times since the election - twice to the 21 Club and once to Jean Georges at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, where the president-elect dined over frog legs and prime sirloin with adversary-turned-job-applicant Mitt Romney. For Trump, like President Obama, the links — whether at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., or Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., near his beloved Mar-a-Lago — are personal sanctuaries. In either place, he is most at ease. He wears boxy "Make America Great Again" caps and open-collar shirts, unwinding with friends over rounds in the morning and then retreating to the clubhouses for casual lunches. "He's always playing golf courses that bear his name," sportswriter Michael Bamberger said. "The golf cart has his name on it. The water bottle has his name on it. If the course is crowded, groups will move to the side for him . . . When he gets to the dining room, the waitress is right there. Membership has its privileges, but ownership has a lot more privileges." Bamberger, who has closely studied Trump's golf habits for years, said the president-elect is deeply knowledgeable about the sport and plays it well. And he uses his time at the golf course to forge bonds and size people up. "He's a very social creature, a gregarious creature, and golf gives him an opportunity to do that," he said. One of Trump's preferred methods of charming, however, is the telephone, which he uses to receive advice and pepper his callers with questions well into the night. Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Trump, likened him to a mix of former presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (with his ability to woo and cajole) and Nixon (with his late-night tendencies). "He is like LBJ," Stone said. "He loves the telephone. He loves calling people. He really does have a very good manner with people. He can be very likable on the phone." As Trump hurries to solidify his Cabinet, he has been known to call his nominees unprompted just to check in, asking which senators he ought to lobby to help them win confirmation. "Who do you need me to call? Who do I need to call?" Trump asked one nominee, according to someone familiar with the conversation. Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for secretary of state, cited his prospective boss's almost constant availability during his Senate confirmation hearing when asked how he would handle an impromptu Trump tweet that undermines his own diplomatic efforts. "I have his cellphone number," the former ExxonMobil chief said. "And he's promised me he'll answer." "And," added Tillerson, "he does."

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Washington Post Staff By Washington Post Staff January 17 President-elect Trump's transition team is holding daily media calls to update the press on how the transition is progressing. We will be posting the transcripts from these calls after they happen. Here is the transcript from Tuesday's call. On the call were Sean Spicer, incoming press secretary for Donald Trump, and Jason Miller, Trump's communications director. OPERATOR: Good day and welcome to the transition daily briefing call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sean Spicer and Jason Miller. Please go ahead. SPICER: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. We're now 72 hours out from the inauguration -- three days for those who are math-challenged. I'd like to start by highlighting the president-elect has nominated 20 of 21 of the Cabinet-level positions. We've now held 39 mock hearings to prep the nominees that we've selected. In total, 4,830 questions have been asked during these mock hearings, with an average of 123 questions being asked per hearing. The team anticipates more than 15 additional mock hearings to occur in the upcoming week to ensure that our nominees are ready for the hearings. Eighty-four thousand Americans have now applied to serve in the administration and 220,000 Americans have shared their ideas for making America great. In addition to our great accomplishments throughout this transition, just a quick overview of the upcoming Senate hearings occurring today. Montana Democrat John Tester will introduce Ryan Zinke to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee at 2:30. Congressman Zinke is a former Navy SEAL and current representative of Montana's at-large district. He's a life-long hunter and fisher, who grew up outside of Glacier National Park. He's got a strong appreciation of the importance of public land and its conservation for future generations. He understands how to paraphrase his hero Teddy Roosevelt that, quote, "Conservation means development as much as it does protection." Representing Montanans in Congress, he saw first-hand the need for responsible development of public lands. And he understands the importance of our public resources to job creation and the growth of our economy. That's why he has the enthusiastic backing from sportsmen's groups, conservationists, ranchers, the energy industry, Native American tribes, and of course, so many in Congress, some of whom liked him so much they wanted him to actually stick around and run for the Senate. Environmentalists are shamelessly trying to impugn Ryan's character by flinging political mud. The bottom line is that Ryan's military and public service record is unbelievably laudable. He was a lieutenant commander of SEAL Team 6, awarded two Bronze Stars for combat, and four Meritorious Service Medals. He is a leader in Congress on conservation issues. He has supported measures to manage America's public lands for hunters, anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts. In Congress, he negotiated a historic water compact between the federal government and a tribal community in the state of Montana. He's got a reputation for taking on tough issues, cutting through the bureaucracy, and we look forward to his confirmation. Today, Betsy DeVos will meet with the Senate HELP Committee at 5 p.m. She will be introduced by former Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. When the president-elect unveiled his decision to nominate Betsy, he said that she would, quote, "reform the education system and break the bureaucracy that's holding our children back," end quote. SPICER: Betsy is not just a critic who points out problems. She's a leader who's been fixing them. Her efforts to improve every school is critical to the administration's urban renewal plan. She'll be a stalwart advocate for students, especially low-income and special needs children, and a strong supporter of greater schools in all forums and dedicated teachers who strive every day to help students achieve. Betsy has been endorsed by over 20 former governors, former secretaries of education, Barbara Bush, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and many others. They praised her compassion for children, her impressive record of championing education reform. And she has incredible broad support from local leaders, who worked with her to improve access to education for families in Michigan. Washington Examiner columnist Byron York noted in the first week of hearings, quote, "Ended up being far less adversarial than expected, either because Democratic attacks lacked energy and focus or the nominee was able to deftly handle the situation or both. Democrats are clearly desperately trying to politicize this process and it's not working." We reported to you last week that this is a Cabinet of rivals -- this is not Cabinet of rivals, rather, but a Cabinet of disrupters and doers. These are people who know how to break the status quo and that's their job and their focus. Several stories last week noted divisions in point of view between the nominees and the president-elect. I just want to make sure that everyone saw the president-elect's tweet. He said, quote, "I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not be mine." This week, the Senate will hear from eight individuals who will each play a critical role in advancing a Trump agenda, including repealing and replacing Obamacare, improving (ph) every school, rolling back job killing regulations, putting American workers first by improving trade deals, ensuring America continues to be an energy leader and that U.S. consumers are protected. Following a meeting last week between president-elect and the CEOs of Monsanto and Bayer, the CEO of Bayer, which is the company buying Monsanto, committed to $8 billion in new U.S. research and development and investment. And more -- and more important, committed to retain 100 percent of Monsanto's 9,000-plus U.S. workforce and to create at least 3,000 new U.S. high-tech jobs which span from (inaudible) to robotics, to satellite imagery specialist, engineers, data scientists, advanced readers and statisticians. Monsanto's headquarters will remain in St. Louis. With the acquisition effort already public, this new domestic expansion has not been broadcasted anywhere previously, and is not something -- and it is something that has been in the works with Bayer and Monsanto previously. The reason for this commitment and expansion is because of the president-elect's focus on creating better business climate here in the United States, which is already increased consumer and small business confidence since the election. Just to recap on the schedule yesterday, the president-elect remained in New York, where he held meetings with Martin Luther King III, Reverend James Ford, Scott Rechlor and William Wachtel. He then met with David Gelernter, G-E-L-E-R-N-T-E-R, who's the candidate for science adviser. After that meeting, he met with Joshua Wright, W-R- I-G-H-T, who is a former Federal Trade Commissioner chairman. His last meeting of the day was with Agit Pai, A-G-I-T, last name P-A-I, who is the current FCC chairman. Today, the president (sic) began his day receiving the PDB here in New York. He will then meet with Ainsley Earhardt of "Fox & Friends" for an interview that will air later. He will meet with Judge Andrew Napolitano and then he will meet with the CEO of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg, and his first name is D-E-N-N-I-S, last name M-U- I-L-E-N-B-U-R-G. Then he will meet with Sheri Dillon, S-H-R-I (sic) D-I-L-L-I-O-N, his attorney who many of you recall, who spoke at the press conference last week. And after that, he will sit down with Mike Allen of the new site Axios. And then he has a photo shoot with The Washington Post. The president-elect will then travel to Washington D.C. from LaGuardia for a dinner honoring the chairman of the presidential inaugural committee, Mr. Tom Barrack. The president-elect will return to New York this evening. SPICER: The vice president-elect will be in Washington all day. He received his presidential daily briefing this morning, is currently holding a series of bipartisan meetings on Capitol Hill. He'll then address the winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. That's at 2:30 and it's open press. In his last event of the evening, he will address the chairman's global dinner at 8:00 p.m. tonight which is closed press. And for the remainder of the week, we will hold -- I think just logistically we've talked about this. Tomorrow, Wednesday, we will hold an off camera gaggle at the PTT offices -- transition offices. Confirmations have already gone out to individuals who are able to fit into the space. And that e-mail just for what it's worth is credentials@ptt.gov. The press gaggle tomorrow will be at 10:30. For those of you who can't make it or weren't able to make it for space reasons, you will still be able to dial in to this number and we will just have a phone on the podium. And we will make sure that folks on the phone have an opportunity to ask questions as well as those in person for those who are concerned about that. On Thursday, the press conference -- press briefing, rather, will be at 9:15 in person at the PTT. Again, we will have a phone option, but it'll be in a listen mode only and we will take questions from -- on camera from individuals there. There will be a pool camera providing a live feed for those folks interested. Details on this will be available shortly. And on Friday, obviously there's a wide range of events celebrating the inauguration that is available from the Presidential Inaugural Committee. One other small matter that I just wanted to touch on, there's been some misreporting about the status of the nominee paperwork. To be clear, all of our nominees have completed the necessary paperwork and submitted it to both the OGE and the FBI. With regard to the OGE, all three of our nominees have cleared the OGE agreement process. On the FBI paperwork, by the end of this week we will only have five nominees left to clear the FBI review and as a reminder, the timing's out of our hands when we hand stuff to OGE and FBI to clear the paperwork. But we're working with both agencies in an expeditious manner. Particularly on Betsy DeVos' OGE paperwork, it was submitted 36 days ago on December 12. She has responded to all follow up questions in a timely way including over weekends and the holiday. This process is typical, it's a back and forth that occurs to clarify questions that come up on the process. So, with that, let me get to any questions that you might have. OPERATOR: Thank you. To signal for a question, please press "star one" on your touchtone telephone. Also, if you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute button is disengaged to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Once again, it is "star one" at this time for questions and we'll pause to give everyone the opportunity to signal. And we'll take our first question from Katherine Skiba with Chicago Tribune Washington Bureau. QUESTION: Good morning, Sean. About 40 members of Congress, including Democratic representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, have stated they will not attend the swearing in and my understanding is that in the wake of president- elect's criticism of Representative John Lewis, there are other lawmakers still deciding whether to attend. So I have two questions, please. What's the president-elect's view of the no-shows and how does their absence impact his desire to be president for all Americans? Thank you. SPICER: Thank you for the question. I think that when you wake up on Friday and see the enormous crowds that are there, you're going to recognize that it is going to be an inauguration for all Americans. Obviously we'd love for every member of Congress to attend, but if they don't, that's some great seats that other folks can hopefully partake in. SPICER: I think you're going to see an enormous outpouring of support and interest in coming to this. We've been overwhelmed by the number of people that want to attend -- attend this inauguration and be part of it in any of numerous ways. So, you know, I -- obviously, it's a shame that these folks don't want to be part of the peaceful transfer of power, but it's within their right and I think that that frees up some great seats for the millions of people who are excited to see this president come to Washington and bring real change. OPERATOR: And our next question will come from Anita Kumar with McClatchy Newspapers. QUESTION: Hey, Sean. Thanks. I'm just wondering if you can look ahead to the first few days, the first week and tell us what -- what to expect. I think you had said previously that he would sign some executive orders, executive actions on Friday. And in an interview that he recently did over the last few days, he said that he would get to work on things like that Monday. So can you just clarify that? And what -- what can we expect over the weekend? SPICER: Yeah, thanks, Anita. I think that there are some things that he will do on Friday. There are executive actions. He may swear-in some members of the Cabinet that have been -- if and when they are confirmed by the Senate. But there's a lot of things that he's going to get right to action on. And then I think on Monday, you're going to see a big flurry of activity. But over the weekend, there are some things that he is going to do with the staff and I think we're still working on the sequencing of that. But I think you're going to see activity starting on Friday. Some of it routine, meaning that there are certain things that have to happen protocol-wise and logistically to facilitate the next administration. So he's going to get to work on Friday. And then over the weekend, I think you'll see a continued -- we'll continue to get that information out via the pool, and whether or not we have additional updates throughout the week, we can provide it to you. But I think you're going to see, you know, a lot of activity. He's eager to get to work and eager to start implementing change. But Monday is where I'd see that the focus should be in terms of some of the bigger issues, but over the weekend he's got -- he definitely has some stuff that he's going to be rolling out. It's just a question of, from a sequencing standpoint, how much he wants to get done on Friday and Saturday. He's got the prayer breakfast, as you know, on Saturday morning and then we'll go from there. But I -- we'll try to get further updates as we move closer to those days. OPERATOR: And next we'll go to Michael Warren with the Weekly Standard. QUESTION: Hi. Thank you. Sean, I just wanted to know what the president-elect's opinion is or what he thinks about Tom Price's proposal for Obamacare replacement? What -- what does he view that as? Does he view that as a starting place for Obamacare replacement? And how does he view some of those -- all of those reforms? SPICER: Thank you, Michael. I think there's a reason that he selected Dr. Price to be his HHS secretary, is because of a lot of the efforts, initiatives and legislation that Dr. Price has laid out. But he's continued to work with Dr. Price and the House and Senate leadership to figure out ways to sequence this thing, and ensure that the goals that he's setting out, which is both greater access and competition and negotiation to drive down costs are met. So, we're going to have details as we go further, but part of the, as I say, I mean, I guess the best way to suggest it is that he was impressed with the work and plans that Dr. Price had put out early-on, and I think that that's going to be something that he -- that's, I don't know whether you want to call that a starting point, but it's definitely a lot of ideas we found helpful. OPERATOR: And next we'll got to Michelle Caruso-Cabrera with CNBC. QUESTION: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. QUESTION: So, it's in the paper today that the president-elect finds the border adjustment provision in the House plan too complicated. Does that mean he's completely against it, that the bill can't go forward without it, or is there room for discussion? Because Paul Ryan's team is already on the record saying that they are very much committed to the border adjustment tax. SPICER: Yeah, thanks, Michelle. Again, I -- I'm not gonna get ahead of this. I think we're having some serious -- some discussions back and forth with key members of Congress, the House and Senate leadership. When we have something to announce, we will. But as you know, I mean, there's always a back and forth between the executive and Congress as to how to get this right and it's something president's committed -- the president-elect's committed to getting done. OPERATOR: And next, we'll go to Zeke Miller with Time. QUESTION: (inaudible) could you provide some more details? Who's preparing them for the president-elect to sign once he's sworn in? And any update on the status of the -- of more White House hirings of key position like staff secretary, other hirings within the (inaudible)? When should we expect those? And finally, for all the various inaugural events this week, will all of them be closed? This would be the -- the dinners in the evening. Will all of them be closed for the press or is there any way to allow pool access to those? SPICER: So let me take that -- the -- before -- the first question you asked was on -- on executive orders, right? And so I think that he is working with the entire team, his (ph) legislative and policy shop. So you've got like, you know, everyone from Rick Dearborn and Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus and Stephen Miller, part of that leadership group, if you will. And then some of the other folks on the policy, you know, team; Peter Navarro and some of the designees (inaudible) have been part of those discussions and they're laying out the sequencing. And obviously, Don McGahn, White House counsel's involved in that process. But there's a group that's leading the effort to lay them out both in terms of what the priorities are and what the scheduling of them. On the hiring front, we'll -- hope to have an announcement in the next couple days, you know, today, tomorrow or Thursday, obviously, on an additional couple batches of White House staff. So we -- we've got -- we should have some -- I anticipate those announcements going soon. Once -- and I've mentioned it before, but the -- there has been a very active engagement as well at the under secretary -- deputy under secretary and assistant secretary level as well to get those slots filled, as well as some key ambassador slots. So there's a lot of work going on beneath the surface to have a lot of positions ready to go to as soon as possible. Not just the White House staff, but again, some of the key staff and appointments at the major departments and -- and agencies. And so we'll try to get you updates as soon as possible. Believe me, I'd -- I would -- I'd like to get these out. And I think part of it is just finalizing some of the issues and paperwork in a lot of the cases. So we've got a robust group of people that I think we'll be getting out in -- either today or tomorrow. And then on those other fronts, those will be ready to go, I think in a lot of cases, once we fill out the remaining spot in the Cabinet. Last is -- I'll -- I'll take a look into whether or not some of these events can be pooled. But I would refer you to the presidential inaugural committee on that. OPERATOR: And next, we'll go to Scott MacFarlane, NBC. QUESTION: Hey, man (ph). A big part of Friday's proceedings are gonna be getting people there by the D.C. Metro system, which has been having breakdowns and a series of problems. Is anybody concerned about how that's gonna function Friday? And is the president-elect concerned about the -- I guess the infrastructure of that system when he takes over? SPICER: Well, again, I mean, there's two things -- two pieces to this, Scott. One is, I think, I would refer you WMATA to make sure that they, you know, what they're status is and their capacity, obviously, that they've done a lot of planning and, you know, former Councilman Jack Evans of all people understands the demands that D.C. has on an event like this. So, I -- I think that would be a good place to start. But I think the president-elect is humbled and honored by the people that are just coming from all over the country to be part of this historic and special day. Not just for him and his family, but for this country and the change that he's bringing. So, I -- I think that we're going to see a just unbelievable tremendous outpouring of support for him. And I think that we have tried to the extent possible through the Presidential Inaugural Committee, I know that they've really been good about warning people about planning in advance to make sure both their travel plans and their arrival times at key events are within a level expectation and planning so that they understand that there's going to be potential delays because of security, traffic, you know, Metro. So, on the Metro front I would -- again, I would ask you to go to WMATA and see if they're ready to -- what they're plans have been. But I think that the president has been a -- just overwhelmed by the amount of support and outpouring of people that want to participate in some way with this historic inauguration. OPERATOR: And I'll turn it back to our presenter's for any additional or closing comments. SPICER: Thank you guys. Again, I look forward to seeing you -- so many of you in person tomorrow and I hope you have great day. We are down to the -- to the final few hours here. I know we're excited and look forward to -- to Friday. So, thank you for joining us and being part of this historic process. Good bye. OPERATOR: And that does conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation.

He took that one step further on Tuesday, sending chills – literally -- through the U.S. dollar rally. Continue Reading Below The greenback jumped to a 13-year high following Trump’s election in November, and last week the president-elect told the Wall Street Journal the currency had strengthened so much American companies can’t compete with those in China. He blamed Beijing for holding down the yuan, its currency, in order to benefit exporters, and said the greenback’s strength is “killing us.” His remarks helped pressure U.S. stocks, which fell further from record highs on Tuesday in a holiday-shortened week, and sent the U.S. dollar index dropping as much as 0.78%. The absence of clarity on Trump’s fiscal-policy promises – which include lower taxes, less regulation and more spending – have limited further gains for both stocks and the dollar. The currency was already on the move lower following Trump’s first press conference as president-elect on January 11, as no new economic policy details were mentioned. The dollar has since lost about one-third of its post-election gains, according to data from BlackRock (BLK). Recent remarks from Federal Reserve officials have also put a damper on the dollar’s upward momentum. On Tuesday, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said expansionary fiscal policy would likely continue to propel the dollar higher, pressuring economic growth and inflation. “I think [Trump’s] comment is spot on,” said Andy Kapyrin, director of research at Regent Atlantic, explaining higher U.S. interest rates amid a low to negative rate environment in the rest of the world makes the dollar an attractive place to park cash but also makes the U.S. less competitive. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT “It’s not literally killing us, but if you rely on exporting to markets abroad or are in competition with industries in Europe, Japan, or China, it does make it more difficult and you’re probably losing out on business,” he said. Kapyrin used U.S.-based aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and France-based Airbus to illustrate the point: Because of the weak euro, which makes exported goods cheaper to foreign countries, Airbus has a trade advantage over its U.S.-based rival because it can offer lower prices for the same kind of good. More on Trump's Market Impact S&P 500 Clings to Biggest Post-Election Rally Since JFK What's Behind the Dow's 20K Delay Fed Cautiously Eyes Trump’s Fiscal Policies Amid ‘Considerable Uncertainty’ “Is it killing us? That’s a bit of a hyperbole, but [the strong dollar] is definitely taking a bite out of growing a business and running it profitably,” he said. If only temporarily, Trump has proved he can dent stock prices with just one tweet. He did it with Boeing when he complained about the price of a new Air Force One fleet, and he did it again to a whole industry when he said pharmaceutical companies were “getting away with murder” with their drug prices. But just like the stocks Trump has targeted in recent weeks have bounced back,  his comments also likely have a limited impact on the dollar’s direction. What’s more, the dollar’s rally isn’t running on fumes just yet, said Blackrock’s Global Chief Investment Strategist Richard Turnill. Instead, he expects to see the currency continue to grind higher with the pace moderating amid bouts of volatility. Corporate tax reform proposals, for example, could give the dollar more room to run higher on optimism over the potential impact to trade, and the repatriation of U.S. corporate profits currently held overseas.  “Yet there is still great uncertainty around the details, timing and potential impact of the incoming Trump administration’s policies. Bottom line: We see potential for currency volatility ahead, but little risk of a sharp and disruptive dollar rally,” Trunill said, noting various estimates of the greenback’s fair value find it about 15% overvalued.  With fourth-quarter corporate earnings season well underway, investors have a keen focus on the strong dollar’s impact to Corporate America’s bottom line. Perhaps reassuring, Turnhill said a mild rise in the currency would likely limit damage to earnings, though rapid gains would be a key risk in the quarters ahead What do you think?

President-elect Donald Trump boards the Trump Tower elevator, going up, after escorting Martin Luther King III to the lobby on Tuesday.  (DOMINICK REUTER / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Ashley Parker Philip RuckerThe Washington Post Tues., Jan. 17, 2017 NEW YORK—Exactly one week after becoming president-elect, Donald Trump stepped outside his namesake fortress here for the first time. He ventured just five blocks, to dinner at the 21 Club — a dark-mahogany-and-red-leather-banquette throwback, where model airplanes and sports memorabilia hang from the ceiling and jackets are de rigueur for men. The vintage haunt, where Trump dined with family members, feels like home. The waiters know his preferred table (No. 14, where Frank Sinatra and Richard M. Nixon once ate) and his regular order (the $36 burger, well done, with fries). So it has been for the president-elect, who has retreated to one comfortable, familiar refuge after another — his soaring Manhattan tower, his white leather-upholstered Boeing jet, his lush golf courses, his opulent beachside castle. Trump is a man isolated, increasingly cosseted away from the voters who lifted him to his seemingly improbable victory. He favours his own people and his own places, creating the veneer of accessibility — his tweets reach millions and he still answers his cellphone — while placing himself in almost entirely habitual settings. He spends most of his days in Trump Tower, with few close friends and few meaningful one-on-one interactions beyond the family members, advisers and loyalists who are whisked by gold elevator to his 26th-floor office for private audiences. Trump rarely leaves, not even for a breath of fresh air; nor does he encounter many people he does not already know or who do not work for him. Article Continued Below Yet Trump remains omnipresent in American life, constantly communicating with the public via Twitter and media interviews without the varnish of news releases or the protection of handlers. Whether it is Meryl Streep’s remarks about him or the question of Russian hacking, no topic is too mundane or charged for him to lend his voice to it. And he answers his personal cellphone, something that acquaintances and colleagues speak of in almost reverential terms. As he prepares to enter the White House, Trump is resisting his advisers’ efforts to take away his cellphone or at least restrict his use of it, said one person close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of private conversations. They worry about national security; he worries about losing touch. When Republican Sen. Bob Corker, needs to reach Trump, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman does not have to go through an aide or schedule a meeting. He said he simply dials Trump’s cellphone directly, and the president-elect answers, even though Corker’s number registers as “No Caller ID.” “I’ve never seen anything relative to access like this. Unbelievable,” Corker told reporters recently. “I don’t think there’s likely been a White House like this, maybe ever, but certainly in modern history.” In many ways, Trump seems most comfortable communicating at a slight remove, with a stage or a screen — television, Twitter, phone — serving as the intermediary between him and the public. Such tools are both his megaphone and his shield, allowing him to blast out a message undiluted with little risk. “He sees the power of mass communication, which goes through screens, and he recognizes its importance,” said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and the chief executive of the website Newsmax Media. “He’s clearly studied the art of it and developed an online and TV persona that’s very powerful. If you look, he’s very much impressed by people who are on TV or come across well on TV, because he thinks it’s such critical marketing.” Trump has shunned some of the traditional photo ops that his predecessors have orchestrated to demonstrate compassion and forge a connection with everyday Americans. He spent Veterans Day in November not laying a wreath at a memorial site, as then-president-elect Barack Obama did in 2008 to pay tribute to fallen soldiers, but staying inside Trump Tower (even though New York’s historical parade was marching right outside along Fifth Avenue). On Thanksgiving and Christmas, he celebrated in private with family members and friends, making no public appearances at military bases or homeless shelters or soup kitchens. Trump Tower as the sun sets on Jan. 12, 2017.  (Jabin Botsford)   “A lot of what you see by previous presidents are platitudes: ‘I’m going to go and pretend I’m supportive of a particular entity and serve food at a soup kitchen,’” said Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager of Trump’s. “Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back so we don’t have soup kitchens. He has not been a person to do staged events for the sake of doing staged events.” Trump’s duality — his wariness of those not in his trusted orbit, yet his insatiable desire for constant contact and feedback — has posed challenges for his advisers and could ultimately leave him detached from everyday voters. He does not use email and rarely surfs the Internet, meaning that telephone calls, television appearances or physical proximity are the best ways to reach him. As his three successive campaign managers quickly learned, whoever controls the flow of information to Trump controls the man — at least as much as he can be contained. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was a trusted campaign adviser to Trump, said he expects the new president’s relationship with Congress to be a mix of salesmanship and accessibility. “Trump will be a larger figure who’s more aloof and more distant, but whose weight and effectiveness is so great he will clearly be a dominating figure,” Gingrich said. “He’ll bounce back and forth between the two worlds. When he comes into the congressional world, he’ll be very effective on the personal level.” But, Gingrich added, “On another level he’ll be very distant and you’ll see him by tweet and you’ll see him on Fox and Friends,” referring to the Fox News weekday morning show. Friends say Trump’s distance stems in part from a certain insularity, with the developer turned politician preferring his own properties, stocked with his own people. Ruddy, who is a member of the private Mar-a-Lago club and whose Newsmax is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., said he has lived in the area for two decades, yet he can count on one hand the number of times he has seen Trump outside of his private Florida retreats. “He’s an old-shoe type of guy — he likes to be in his comfort zone, which are his golf clubs and his homes,” Ruddy said. “He likes people he’s comfortable with and likes, and if he doesn’t feel comfortable around you, he’s not going to be inviting you around.” Trump has only gone out to eat a few times since the election — twice to the 21 Club and once to Jean Georges at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, where the president-elect dined over frog legs and prime sirloin with adversary-turned-job-applicant Mitt Romney. For Trump, like President Obama, the links — whether at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., or Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., near his beloved Mar-a-Lago — are personal sanctuaries. In either place, he is most at ease. He wears boxy “Make America Great Again” caps and open-collar shirts, unwinding with friends over rounds in the morning and then retreating to the clubhouses for casual lunches. “He’s always playing golf courses that bear his name,” sportswriter Michael Bamberger said. “The golf cart has his name on it. The water bottle has his name on it. If the course is crowded, groups will move to the side for him ... When he gets to the dining room, the waitress is right there. Membership has its privileges, but ownership has a lot more privileges.” Bamberger, who has closely studied Trump’s golf habits for years, said the president-elect is deeply knowledgeable about the sport and plays it well. And he uses his time at the golf course to forge bonds and size people up. “He’s a very social creature, a gregarious creature, and golf gives him an opportunity to do that,” he said. One of Trump’s preferred methods of charming, however, is the telephone, which he uses to receive advice and pepper his callers with questions well into the night. Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Trump, likened him to a mix of former presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (with his ability to woo and cajole) and Nixon (with his late-night tendencies). “He is like LBJ,” Stone said. “He loves the telephone. He loves calling people. He really does have a very good manner with people. He can be very likable on the phone.” As Trump hurries to solidify his Cabinet, he has been known to call his nominees unprompted just to check in, asking which senators he ought to lobby to help them win confirmation. “Who do you need me to call? Who do I need to call?” Trump asked one nominee, according to someone familiar with the conversation. Rex Tillerson, Trump’s choice for secretary of state, cited his prospective boss’s almost constant availability during his Senate confirmation hearing when asked how he would handle an impromptu Trump tweet that undermines his own diplomatic efforts. “I have his cellphone number,” the ExxonMobil chief said. “And he’s promised me he’ll answer.” “And,” added Tillerson, “he does.” Read more about: Donald Trump Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

According to the Airbus group, it will soon be one button press on your phone away. The aircraft giant has announced that they will test a flying car prototype in 2017. Their stated goal is to develop the futuretech to help earthbound urbanites avoid city traffic. In 2016, Airbus founded Urban Air Mobility, to develop commercially-viable flying cars. Rather than marketing to consumers, Airbus hopes to develop an aerial equivalent to Uber or Lyft: people order a flying car by using their mobile device. The flying car, codenamed Vahana (after the Sanskrit word meaning "that which carries"), has eight propellers and a distinctly sci-fi look. It is one of two main concepts Airbus is exploring, the other a helicopter-esque vehicle that would act as a literal air bus for multiple passengers.  © Flickr/ Global Panorama Boeing Beats Airbus in $ 22 Billion Aircraft Deal with Indian Budget Carrier Both concepts are Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, meaning they can lift off and land from a standing position, without the use of a runway. VTOL jets such as Boeing's V-22 Osprey and Lockheed Martin's F-35B Lightning II see military use, but the only civilian aircraft to use VTOL technology are helicopters. Airbus CEO Tom Enders sees this as a highly worthwhile endeavor. "With flying, you don't need to pour billions into concrete bridges and roads," he said at the Digital Life Design Conference in Munich. "We are in an experimentation phase, we take this development very seriously." Enders also said that he hoped to have a functional single-person transport by year's end. He has claimed that Airbus wishes to be a company of the future, focusing on developing transportation technologies such as autonomous vehicles. "One hundred years ago, urban transport went underground. Now we have the technological wherewithal to go above ground," he said. "If we ignore these developments, we will be pushed out of important segments of the business." © Photo: Nikolay Kazakov / volocopter.com Flyway or the Highway? German Heli-Car Promises End to Traffic Jams Enders predicted that "in fifteen years, we can do 90-100 passengers with an electric or hybrid aircraft." Airbus has assured the public that their vehicles will be pollution-free and environmentally-friendly. However, they are not the only ones working on flying taxis: Uber has announced their intention to add aerial transportation to their services within the decade, while the Chinese company EHang has developed a working (if unviable) prototype of an autonomous air taxi. The world population is flocking to cities at unprecedented rates, from roughly 30 percent in 1950 to 54 percent in 2015, with a projected 66 percent of humanity living in cities by 2050, according to the United Nations. With population growth comes urban sprawl, longer commutes, and heavier traffic, all huge wastes of resources. ...

He ventured just five blocks, to dinner at the 21 Club - a dark-mahogany-and-red-leather-banquette throwback, where model airplanes and sports memorabilia hang from the ceiling and jackets are de rigueur for men. The vintage haunt, where Trump dined with family members, feels like home. The waiters know his preferred table (No. 14, where Frank Sinatra and Richard M. Nixon once ate) and his regular order (the $36 burger, well done, with fries). So it has been for the president-elect, who has retreated to one comfortable, familiar refuge after another - his soaring Manhattan tower, his white leather-upholstered Boeing jet, his lush golf courses, his opulent beachside castle. Trump is a man isolated, increasingly cosseted away from the voters who lifted him to his seemingly improbable victory. He favors his own people and his own places, creating the veneer of accessibility - his tweets reach millions and he still answers his cellphone - while placing himself in almost entirely habitual settings. He spends most of his days in Trump Tower, with few close friends and few meaningful one-on-one interactions beyond the family members, advisers and loyalists who are whisked by gold elevator to his 26th-floor office for private audiences. Trump rarely leaves, not even for a breath of fresh air; nor does he encounter many people he does not already know or who do not work for him. Yet Trump remains omnipresent in American life, constantly communicating with the public via Twitter and media interviews without the varnish of news releases or the protection of handlers. Whether it is Meryl Streep's remarks about him or the question of Russian hacking, no topic is too mundane or charged for him to lend his voice to it. And he answers his personal cellphone, something that acquaintances and colleagues speak of in almost reverential terms. As he prepares to enter the White House, Trump is resisting his advisers' efforts to take away his cellphone or at least restrict his use of it, said one person close to him, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of private conversations. They worry about national security; he worries about losing touch. When Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., needs to reach Trump, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman does not have to go through an aide or schedule a meeting. He said he simply dials Trump's cellphone directly, and the president-elect answers, even though Corker's number registers as "No Caller ID." Continued below.

Video Watch: Trump denies reports of compromising intel "I've never seen anything relative to access like this. Unbelievable," Corker told reporters recently. "I don't think there's likely been a White House like this, maybe ever, but certainly in modern history." In many ways, Trump seems most comfortable communicating at a slight remove, with a stage or a screen - television, Twitter, phone - serving as the intermediary between him and the public. Such tools are both his megaphone and his shield, allowing him to blast out a message undiluted with little risk. "He sees the power of mass communication, which goes through screens, and he recognizes its importance," said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and the chief executive of the website Newsmax Media. "He's clearly studied the art of it and developed an online and TV persona that's very powerful. If you look, he's very much impressed by people who are on TV or come across well on TV, because he thinks it's such critical marketing." Trump has shunned some of the traditional photo ops that his predecessors have orchestrated to demonstrate compassion and forge a connection with everyday Americans. Video He spent Veterans Day in November not laying a wreath at a memorial site, as President-elect Barack Obama did in 2008 to pay tribute to fallen soldiers, but staying inside Trump Tower (even though New York's historical parade was marching right outside along Fifth Avenue). On Thanksgiving and Christmas, he celebrated in private with family members and friends, making no public appearances at military bases or homeless shelters or soup kitchens. "A lot of what you see by previous presidents are platitudes: 'I'm going to go and pretend I'm supportive of a particular entity and serve food at a soup kitchen,' " said Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager of Trump's. "Donald Trump wants to bring jobs back so we don't have soup kitchens. He has not been a person to do staged events for the sake of doing staged events." Trump's duality - his wariness of those not in his trusted orbit, yet his insatiable desire for constant contact and feedback - has posed challenges for his advisers and could ultimately leave him detached from everyday voters. He does not use email and rarely surfs the Internet, meaning that telephone calls, television appearances or physical proximity are the best ways to reach him. As his three successive campaign managers quickly learned, whoever controls the flow of information to Trump controls the man - at least as much as he can be contained. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who was a trusted campaign adviser to Trump, said he expects the new president's relationship with Congress to be a mix of salesmanship and accessibility. "Trump will be a larger figure who's more aloof and more distant, but whose weight and effectiveness is so great he will clearly be a dominating figure," Gingrich said. "He'll bounce back and forth between the two worlds. When he comes into the congressional world, he'll be very effective on the personal level." But, Gingrich added, "On another level he'll be very distant and you'll see him by tweet and you'll see him on 'Fox and Friends.' " Trump's distance, friends say, stems in part from a certain insularity, with the developer turned politician preferring his own properties, stocked with his own people. Ruddy, who is a member of the private Mar-a-Lago club and whose Newsmax is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., said he has lived in the area for two decades, yet he can count on one hand the number of times he has seen Trump outside of his private Florida retreats. "He's an old-shoe type of guy - he likes to be in his comfort zone, which are his golf clubs and his homes," Ruddy said. "He likes people he's comfortable with and likes, and if he doesn't feel comfortable around you, he's not going to be inviting you around." Trump has only gone out to eat a few times since the election - twice to the 21 Club and once to Jean Georges at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, where the president-elect dined over frog legs and prime sirloin with adversary-turned-job-applicant Mitt Romney. For Trump, like President Obama, the links - whether at Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, N.J., or Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., near his beloved Mar-a-Lago - are personal sanctuaries. In either place, he is most at ease. He wears boxy "Make America Great Again" caps and open-collar shirts, unwinding with friends over rounds in the morning and then retreating to the clubhouses for casual lunches. "He's always playing golf courses that bear his name," sportswriter Michael Bamberger said. "The golf cart has his name on it. The water bottle has his name on it. If the course is crowded, groups will move to the side for him . . . When he gets to the dining room, the waitress is right there. Membership has its privileges, but ownership has a lot more privileges." Video Bamberger, who has closely studied Trump's golf habits for years, said the president-elect is deeply knowledgeable about the sport and plays it well. And he uses his time at the golf course to forge bonds and size people up. "He's a very social creature, a gregarious creature, and golf gives him an opportunity to do that," he said. One of Trump's preferred methods of charming, however, is the telephone, which he uses to receive advice and pepper his callers with questions well into the night. Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Trump, likened him to a mix of former presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (with his ability to woo and cajole) and Nixon (with his late-night tendencies). "He is like LBJ," Stone said. "He loves the telephone. He loves calling people. He really does have a very good manner with people. He can be very likable on the phone." As Trump hurries to solidify his Cabinet, he has been known to call his nominees unprompted just to check in, asking which senators he ought to lobby to help them win confirmation. "Who do you need me to call? Who do I need to call?" Trump asked one nominee, according to someone familiar with the conversation. Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for secretary of state, cited his prospective boss's almost constant availability during his Senate confirmation hearing when asked how he would handle an impromptu Trump tweet that undermines his own diplomatic efforts. "I have his cellphone number," the ExxonMobil chief said. "And he's promised me he'll answer." "And," added Tillerson, "he does." - Washington Post Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Traffic plan in place as Nitro Circus fans descend on Toll Stadium The crowds expected for tomorrow's Nitro Circus show in Whangarei has prompted Whangarei… Hawke's Bay Today Insight: History of Bay droughts Hawke's Bay has had a long history of droughts but the top three according to NIWA since… Bay of Plenty Times Back-to-school costs pinch parents A charity that supports needy children in the Bay says an increasing number of parents… Our Features' Top Stories Driven Bob McMurray: Tough at the bottom of F1 food chain Manor Racing Formula 1 team’s future balances on a knife-edge.
