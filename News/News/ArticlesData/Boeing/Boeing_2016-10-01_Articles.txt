Sales dive leaves widebody aircraft on taxi to nowhere The Financial Times 10/2/2016 By Peggy Hollinger, Industry Editor © Provided by Financial Times Airbus and Boeing are expecting aircraft deals to be slow for up to three years, but the world’s two biggest passenger jet manufacturers are confident that bulging order backlogs will carry them through the dry season. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BOE ▼ 146.92 -0.05 -0.03% Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA 0FGH ▼ 268.51 -4.30 -1.58% Amid falling demand for jets, the European and US aerospace companies are increasing production of their most popular aircraft to record levels, which may reduce the size of their backlogs but also raise profits. “We will stay in a slow period [for aircraft orders] for a couple of years while we burn down the backlog,” says John Leahy, chief salesman at Airbus, in an interview with the Financial Times. “People have been buying at a rate of over 1,000 a year. Of course the order cycle will go down. But . . . we have been able to pause when we need to in a downturn because of the massive backlog.” After six years of booming deals, the order slowdown is being felt most in certain widebody aircraft, raising questions over prospects for some of these big ticket, long-haul passenger jets which sell for $200m to $400m or more. Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing, said this month that he expected sales of twin-aisle aircraft to be tough until 2020, as the company introduces a new generation of large aircraft. “The challenge we have is between now and the end of this decade, that roughly three-year time period, as we go through the transition to the [new] 777X [twin-aisle jet] and some . . . local hesitation in widebody orders,” he said. The reality is that after years of bingeing on new aircraft, airlines are now beginning to realise their expansion plans may have been too ambitious — for the near future at least. The International Air Transport Association, airlines’ main representative body, signalled in June that while passenger traffic will grow at just over 6 per cent in 2016, it is beginning to slow down from the 7 per cent plus rates seen in previous years. “Widebody is the first area airlines stop ordering when capacity is slowing,” says Sash Tusa, an analyst at Agency Partners. “The airline industry was probably over ordered.” Mr Leahy insists there has been no particular slowdown in twin-aisle demand — indeed, Airbus’s orders net of cancellations last year were still higher than in 2011 and 2012. But airlines admit they may have been carried away. “Now the market is a little bit saturated,” says one industry insider. Moreover, combined orders for Boeing and Airbus suggest widebody jet demand began slowing a year earlier than for single-aisle aircraft. At the recent peak in 2013, Boeing and Airbus logged combined net orders for 750 widebody jets. Orders fell in both 2014 and 2015, and so far this year the companies have scraped together deals for a mere 123 jets. In part the slowdown reflects specific problems with certain aircraft. Airbus, for example, has struggled to sell its A380 superjumbo. This summer it put the A380 on life support, cutting annual production rates from 27 in 2015 to 12 by 2018. Airbus also had more cancellations than orders for its widebody A350 jet during 2014 and 2015. Boeing, with a slightly bigger share of the widebody market, has suffered more. It is now talking openly about the possibility of reducing production of the existing generation 777 twin-aisle jet, as customers wait for the more fuel efficient 777X. The US company is also more cautious about plans to increase the rate on the widebody 787 Dreamliner from 12 to 14 a month. Some of the fall off in twin-aisle orders may be that the excitement on the launch of more efficient models — notably the Dreamliner and the A350 — is petering out. But new technology is also challenging these bigger jets: narrow-body aircraft are carrying more passengers and flying further than ever before. Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of Europe’s biggest low-cost carriers, is planning to use the new Airbus A321LR single-aisle jet to fly passengers across the Atlantic. “The average size of aircraft on international routes is getting smaller,” says Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group, a consultancy. “It could be the 321 is used . . . at the expense of the 787.” Rob Morris, head of Flight Ascend Consultancy, says the share of wide-bodies in the global fleet has shrunk from roughly 25 per cent in 1990 to about 19 per cent. This is in part because the single-aisle market has expanded rapidly as low-cost travel has grown. Mr Morris believes the wide-bodies’ share has stabilised, but he acknowledges there may still be some impact from single-aisles’ increased range and capacity. About half of the routes flown by widebody aircraft are less than 5,500km, well within the range of the Airbus A321LR and Boeing’s new narrow-body 737 Max jet. The decline in widebody deals could also be a function of the manufacturers’ huge order backlogs. Airbus and Boeing have orders for a total of 2,500 twin-aisle jets on their books, many of which will not be delivered for years. Airlines might now be postponing new orders, says Mr Morris, to avoid paying escalation fees. These charges, typically calculated at 4 per cent of the price of the aircraft, are designed to protect the manufacturers from future increases in input costs between order and delivery. Nevertheless, airlines will always need bigger jets for the most densely travelled long-haul routes, say airline executives. Congested airports and the rise in the number of passengers make them indispensable. Mr Leahy believes the single-aisle aircraft will never pose a real threat to bigger jets. “Wide-bodies carry freight. They go longer ranges, and that is important for a lot of airlines,” he says. The A321 “is a game changing airplane. It is a very good market but I don’t think it will ever have a major impact on widebody sales either for us or for Boeing.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from the FT The search for a shared emoji language is a sign of the times The Financial Times Premier League agrees record $700m Chinese rights deal The Financial Times Turkish military officers serving Nato ask for asylum The Financial Times Trump picks conservatives and loyalists for law and CIA roles The Financial Times The Financial Times View the Full Site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

One of China's largest airlines has its radar set on the US market CNBC 10/2/2016 Harriet Baskas, Special to CNBC © Provided by CNBC When Chinese president Xi Jinping visited the U.S. last September, his first stop was a Boeing factory north of Seattle, where he toured a 787-8 Dreamliner being delivered to Xiamen Airlines. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 145.90 +0.57 +0.39% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▲ 25.20 +0.17 +0.68% Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▲ 48.77 +0.26 +0.54% Hainan Airlines Co Ltd 900945 ▼ 0.6270 -0.0040 -0.63% A subsidiary of state-backed China Southern Airlines, Xiamen Air is currently among China's largest carriers, a member of the SkyTeam airline alliance with more than 140 Boeing aircraft (and 30 more on order) — and China's only airline with an all-Boeing fleet. Few U.S. travelers have heard of Xiamen Airlines, but the carrier is determined to change that. Last Monday, Xiamen inaugurated its first direct U.S. route between Seattle and Shenzhen, one of China's largest and wealthiest cities. "Shenzhen is known as the 'Silicon Valley' of China, and this new destination will be a tremendous opportunity for both business and leisure travelers to experience our shared values, Port of Seattle Commissioner Fred Felleman told CNBC at a ceremony at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport welcoming the first Xiamen flight. He added Xiamen's arrival would be an added boost to the region's status as "a business and tourism hub." Xiamen is making its move at a time when tourism and business traffic between the U.S. and China is growing quickly. In a recent study, Boyd Group International predicted that annual U.S. arrivals from China will more than double, going from 2.4 million in 2015 to over 6.5 million in 2020. "Over that period of time, more than 23 million Chinese will visit the US," the report added. Located adjacent to Hong Kong, Shenzhen — with a population of 10 million — was China's first special economic zone. It is now a major tourism and technology hub that's home to telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei, internet giant Tencent Holdings and other companies that do business in the Pacific Northwest. And the race is on to be the airline of choice for business and leisure travelers. © Provided by CNBC Before Xiamen's new Shenzhen service, flights from Seattle to cities in China (including Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai) were limited to carriers like Delta Air Lines or China's Hainan Airlines — even though a wide variety of U.S. and Chinese carriers fly between both countries. However, Xiamen's Seattle-Shenzhen new route stands out, in part because it links two high-tech cities for the first time, Kazue Ishiwata, airline service development director for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, told CNBC recently. "Xiamen is not the biggest airline in China. There's Air China, China Eastern, China Southern and Hainan already in Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities," Ishiwata said. "So it benefits a new entry carrier to begin service in a city where there aren't other airlines to compete with on the route." The new route between Seattle and Shenzhen will operate three times a week with a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner configured with four first class seats, 28 business class seats and 236 economy class seats, that will offer complimentary Wi-Fi for first and business class customers. Xiamen Airlines isn't stopping with Seattle. The airline's inaugural North American flight took place in July, between Vancouver and Xiamen, and long-haul service between JFK International Airport and Fuzhou (FOC) is scheduled to begin February 15, 2017. Another Xiamen Airlines route, between Los Angeles and Xiamen, is set to begin sometime in mid-2017. It's part of the strategy that the airline hopes will help it overcome a significant competitive advantage in the fast-paced travel market in the world's largest economy. "The airline has some challenges," said Mike Waddle of AviationPros, a general service agent supporting various airlines in the U.S. market. "Even though they're a very familiar brand in China and throughout Asia, they need to get name recognition for the brand in the United States and North America," said Waddle. That said, "the routing for this first U.S. flight is unique and it seems like a good marriage between two high-tech cities." — Harriet Baskas is the author of seven books, including "Hidden Treasures: What Museums Can't or Won't Show You," and theStuck at the Airportblog.

Here's what it would need to do to catch up over the next three months. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 2, 2016 at 11:20AM For 2016, Boeing (NYSE:BA) set a goal of achieving a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for its commercial jet business. That means it hopes to receive one order for every jet it delivers this year. Nine months into the year, Boeing's chances don't look good. Boeing expects to deliver 740-745 commercial airplanes this year. Meanwhile, as of Tuesday, it had booked 357 net orders in 2016. That puts it less than halfway to its order goal. Boeing needs to sell nearly 400 planes this quarter to meet its 2016 order target. Image source: Boeing. Yet while Boeing faces an uphill battle to reach 740 orders, it still has a shot at getting there. Here's what Boeing would need to do to meet its 2016 order target. Finalize recent sale agreements First, Boeing has a large number of aircraft commitments that have yet to be finalized into firm orders. For example, at this summer's Farnborough Airshow, Boeing announced 182 orders and commitments, but just a fraction of them were new firm orders. There are about 100 outstanding commitments from the air show -- mainly for Chinese airlines -- that still aren't reflected in Boeing's 2016 order total. To count those as firm orders, Boeing needs to finalize the sale terms. Similarly, Boeing's landmark agreement to sell 80 jets to Iran Air hasn't resulted in any firm orders yet. The U.S. government recently approved export licenses for these planes, but Iran still needs to line up financing to close the deal. Finally, Saudi flag carrier Saudia recently announced plans to buy 28 widebodies from Boeing. Apparently, the deal isn't official yet, as Boeing has not recorded any firm orders from Saudia this year. All told, Boeing has about 200 of these pending orders. It will be difficult for Boeing to finalize all of them in the next three months. However, if it can, Boeing would be a lot closer to reaching its full-year order target. Win highly anticipated orders in the Middle East Boeing could also be close to winning big orders from the two top airlines in the Middle East. Qatar Airways is on the verge of ordering at least 30 more Boeing widebodies -- primarily the 787 Dreamliner -- according to Bloomberg. Enigmatic Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker has been displeased with Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) lately, due to delivery delays, so there is little risk of Boeing losing this order to Airbus. Meanwhile, Emirates is likely to place an order for about 70 widebodies before the end of the year. It is choosing between Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and Airbus' A350. Given that Emirates canceled a previous order for 70 A350s in 2014, it seems likely that Boeing has the inside track. It's also possible that Emirates would split an order between Boeing and Airbus. Emirates could soon order up to 70 Dreamliners from Boeing. Image source: Boeing. If Boeing wins the Emirates order and can finalize a deal with Qatar Airways this year, it would have another 100 orders in the bag. Capitalize on the year-end rush Finally, Boeing needs to take advantage of the typical year-end rush to order airplanes. Last year, Boeing finished Q3 with only 447 net orders. However, it pulled in 321 net orders in Q4 to reach a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for the year. Boeing often receives an outsized number of orders in the fourth quarter. To some extent, Boeing may become more aggressive near the end of the year as it tries to meet internal sales targets. Airline planning cycles may also encourage a rush of year-end orders. In 2016, it is more important than ever for Boeing to end the year on a high note. Boeing still has a chance Internally, Boeing executives appear to recognize that it will be very challenging to meet a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio this year. Just about everything would have to go right, including firming up the numerous orders that have been announced but not finalized, capturing big widebody orders from Emirates and Qatar Airways, and rounding up more orders in the year-end rush. In the end, Boeing will probably fall short of its 2016 order target. But investors should still expect to see a big uptick in order activity in the next three months.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Oct 2, 2016 at 10:13AM Blue Origin aims to be the biggest thing in spaceflight since the Apollo missions. Image source: Blue Origin. One thing you have to hand Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos: As the leader of the biggest retailer on the planet by market cap, he sure does know marketing. Bezos, as you know by now, is not just the CEO of Amazon.com. He's also parlayed the billions he made selling books (and everything else) online into the creation of a new space company. Dubbed Blue Origin and operating out of a facility set up in the West Texas desert, Bezos' space concern promises to give space incumbents Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) a run for their money -- and is already running neck and neck with Elon Musk's SpaceX -- albeit, with different objectives. While SpaceX aims to cut the cost of putting satellites in orbit, to date, Blue Origin has focused primarily on developing a reusable rocket to send space tourists up 62 miles to the edge of space, then safely land them back on Earth -- over and over again. Four straight flights of its New Shephard rocket have gone off without a hitch, and put Bezos on the road to creating a viable space tourism business. But it's Bezos' latest plan  that will really wow you. Bigger, faster, better While many companies in the space "space" have chosen to dodge competition with Boeing and Lockheed by focusing on the development of small rockets to carry microsatellites into space (a market the larger companies view as an afterthought), Bezos is going bigger. Building on experience gained flying New Shephard, and pairing it with the BE-4 engine that Blue Origin is developing for Boeing and Lockheed Martin's United Launch Alliance, Bezos now plans to build two new rockets capable of reaching orbit -- and beyond. Bezos' plans first materialized two months ago, when he broke ground for the construction of a new rocket factory. As depicted in the illustration up above, the rockets churned out at the new fab are going to be huge ... and huger: The first, a two-stage New Glenn launch vehicle, will measure 23 feet in diameter and stand 270 feet tall. Powered by seven BE-4 engines, it will produce 3.85 million pounds of thrust at liftoff -- more than twice the power of SpaceX's smaller Falcon 9, nearly twice that of the Boeing-designed Delta IV Heavy, and more than four times the power of a Lockheed Martin-designed Atlas V. And like SpaceX's Falcon, New Glenn's first stage will be reusable. As for the second stage, it will be powered by an additional BE-4 engine, this one optimized to work in a vacuum. Blue Origin says it intends to begin launching New Glenn "before the end of this decade" on both commercial satellite missions, and also "to fly humans into space." Blue Origin's second orbital rocket will also be named "New Glenn," but feature a third stage powered by a single BE-3 engine. (That's the same engine that powers the suborbital New Shephard, but this one will be tweaked to work better in vacuum). Adding this third stage will increase the rocket's total height to 313 feet. And with this addition, Blue Origin cryptically confides that the rocket will be "capable of flying demanding beyond-LEO missions." Bigger, faster, better ... farther? Precisely how far beyond Low Earth Orbit does Blue Origin intend to fly? To geosynchronous orbit, to the Moon, or even farther than that? Blue Origin declines to say. What the company does say, though, is that it has a "vision" of "millions of people living and working in space" -- a vision at least 1,000 times broader than United Launch Alliance's prediction of 1,000 astronauts in space. Blue Origin calls "New Glenn is a very important step" toward that goal. But what's more important to investors is the fact that with New Glenn, Blue Origin appears to be "stepping" into the ring to compete for commercial satellite launches, for transportation of astronauts to the International Space Station, and potentially for trips farther out as well. Even more interesting is the fact that Bezos plans to launch New Glenn "before the end of this decade." This implies the new rocket will arrive almost simultaneously with ULA's Vulcan  rocket, and Arianespace's Ariane 6. All that competition is not going to be good for space companies' profits -- but it could be very good for their customers, and for the development of the space industry as a whole.

The changes will be “bad” for passengers, says the airline’s cabin crew union under plans that will see an extra row of economy seats installed on its Boeing aircraft and the width of each seat reduced by up to 1.5 inches (3.8cm). Chief executive Ivan Chu Kwok-leung said in an exclusive interview: “If you look at the Boeing 777s, which everybody uses from the Gulf to the US to European carriers and ourselves, the standard is 3-4-3. I think we are moving towards that stage, it’s very clear.” The big squeeze: Cathay Pacific considers cramming more seats into economy class long-haul flights A shortage of take-off and landing slots at Hong Kong International Airport means Cathay and local rivals like HK Express, are unable to expand the number of flights with the two runways operating at almost 100 per cent capacity every day. “Slots are very scarce,” Chu said. “We want to generate more seats per slot, that’s the key thing. That’s why we are doing it. It’s very important we do it.” An additional row of seats could add up to 35 more economy seats on regional aircraft and at least 17 more on long-haul flights, adding nearly 1.1 million extra seats per year to the 70 Boeings in the Cathay fleet. The move amounts to 4 per cent more seats a year. On the Hong Kong-Vancouver route, Cathay’s Boeing 777 can carry up to 275 passengers, but Air Canada fits 458 passengers into the same model. Chu explained he wanted to offer the best in economy seats to ensure customers felt comfortable in the smaller seats. Cathay said it was committed to maintaining 32 inches of legroom as standard but the seat width would narrow – estimated to come down from 18.5 inches to around 17 inches per seat, based on changes made by rival airlines. The industry has looked at 10-abreast holdouts like Cathay and Singapore Airlines and wondered if they are delusional Analyst Will Horton The Cathay chief said he was confident he could maximise the cabin real estate to ease the “pain” associated with travelling in a full long-haul economy-class flight through the latest seat and cushion technology. “We will maximise every single centimetre; every single millimetre counts,” Chu pledged. Cathay Pacific has not set out a clear timeline for the changes to economy class seating but it is understood to happen around 2018. Flight attendant Silvia But, vice-chairwoman of the airline’s Flight Attendants Union, said: “If there is one more seat per row, I cannot imagine how narrow it will be. For passengers it’s definitely bad news.” The union member called for the airline to increase the number of cabin crew to serve a higher number of passengers. Will Horton, a Hong Kong-based analyst for CAPA Centre for Aviation, said: “Cathay has been disadvantaged by not doing [10-abreast]. The industry has looked at 10-abreast holdouts like Cathay and Singapore Airlines and wondered if they are delusional. “There are not enough passengers willing to pay a premium for Cathay. The passengers willing to pay more for nine-abreast either aren’t willing to pay enough or are not numerous enough,” he said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 2 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 3 Beijing interpretation on Legislative Council oath taking rattles Hong Kong 4 Hong Kong’s Legco descends into chaos as Beijing intervention looms 5 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 3 Finance, wealth and ... slavery?

BUCHANAN: Outsourcing America’s future 5:08 a.m. EDT October 1, 2016 A Boeing 737 MAX airplane takes off on its first test flight on Jan. 29 in Renton, Wash. Illegal subsidies of the Airbus 320 cost Boeing the sale of nearly 400 commercial jets. (Photo: AP) Is America still a serious nation? Consider. While U.S. elites were denouncing Donald Trump as unfit to serve for having compared Miss Universe 1996 to “Miss Piggy” of “The Muppets,” the World Trade Organization was validating the principal plank of his platform. America’s allies are cheating and robbing her blind on trade. According to the WTO, Britain, France, Spain, Germany and the EU pumped $22 billion in illegal subsidies into Airbus to swindle Boeing out of the sale of 375 commercial jets. Subsidies to the A320 caused lost sales of 271 Boeing 737s, writes journalist Alan Boyle. Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s. These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense. Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, “without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed ... and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market.” In “The Great Betrayal” in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie “sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit.” Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: “Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream.” And another executive said, “If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it.” When Europe’s taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive, “We don’t care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers.” This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours? After this latest WTO ruling validating Boeing’s claims against Airbus, the Financial Times is babbling of the need for “free and fair” trade, warning against a trade war. But is “trade war” not a fair description of what our NATO allies have been doing to us by subsidizing the cartel that helped bring down Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas and now seeks to bring down Boeing? Our companies built the planes that saved Europe in World War II and sheltered her in the Cold War. And Europe has been trying to kill those American companies. Yet even as Europeans collude and cheat to capture America’s markets in passenger jets, Boeing itself, wrote Eamonn Fingleton in 2014, has been “consciously cooperating in its own demise.” By Boeing’s own figures, writes Fingleton, in the building of its 787 Dreamliner, the world’s most advanced commercial jet, the “Japanese account for a stunning 35 percent of the 787’s overall manufacture, and that may be an underestimate.” “Much of the rest of the plane is also made abroad ... in Italy, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom.” The Dreamliner “flies on Mitsubishi wings. These are no ordinary wings: they constitute the first extensive use of carbon fiber in the wings of a full-size passenger plane. In the view of many experts, by outsourcing the wings Boeing has crossed a red line.” Mitsubishi, recall, built the Zero, the premier fighter plane in the Pacific in the early years of World War II. In a related matter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July and August approached $60 billion each month, heading for a trade deficit in goods in 2016 of another $700 billion. For an advanced economy like the United States, such deficits are milestones of national decline. We have been running them now for 40 years. But in the era of U.S. economic supremacy from 1870 to 1970, we always ran an annual trade surplus, selling far more abroad than Americans bought from abroad. In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft. But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America’s elites do not care. As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high. By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America’s future. After Munich in 1938, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax visited Italy to wean Mussolini away from Hitler. The Italian dictator observed his guests closely and remarked to his foreign minister: “These men are not made of the same stuff as the Francis Drakes and the other magnificent adventurers who created the empire. These, after all, are the tired sons of a long line of rich men, and they will lose their empire.” If the present regime is not replaced, something like that will be said of this generation of Americans.

Monarch’s backers have moved quickly since it was plunged into crisis last week amid speculation that the airline was on the brink of bankruptcy. The funds, expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, will be the second round of financing Monarch has raised in a matter of days, and should end doubts about its financial health. It received a separate cash injection from shareholders this weekend, which helped secure a temporary extension to its licence to fly with only hours to go before Friday’s midnight deadline.  The Mantegazza family started Monarch Airlines with just two aircraft in Luton in 1968 The plane order and additional funds should mean that Monarch receives a full Air Travel Organiser’s Licence (Atol) from the Civil Aviation Authority, removing concerns that its fleet could be grounded and thousands of holidaymakers left stranded abroad.  An order for 45 Boeing 737 airliners would be worth around $2bn (£1.54bn) with each plane costing about $50m. The new fleet will be staggered over several years with the first delivery in 2018.  Monarch is in the second year of an intense turnaround plan under new owners Greybull. The investment firm rescued the airline in 2014 as it teetered on the brink of collapse. Greybull pumped in £125m. It has also slashed costs, pulled out of long-haul flights and grounded many of the airline’s older planes.  But like many other airlines, Monarch has faced one of the most difficult travel markets in decades, following a series of terror attacks, Brexit uncertainty and the falling pound. Despite the tough backdrop, it is expected to post pre-tax earnings of £40m this year Concerns grow for Monarch - but are you protected if your airline goes bust?

While school prepares students for the real world, he's learned many of his skills on the job, he said. (Photo: Kimm Anderson, kanderson@stcloudtimes.com)Buy Photo 319 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE BECKER — Even after almost 30 years in the business, Al Scherping admits he is still learning how to perfect his craft. "I've been doing computer numerical control for almost 27 years," Scherping, 46, said. "You never stop learning. People have asked me how long (would it take) before they know what I know. And I say never. Because I'm always learning stuff." Sherping owns CNC COPS LLC, a consulting, operating, programming and support company. He has traveled the world helping clients set up machines to produce various parts. "I flew over to China for eight days to do demos and training over there," Scherping said. "I did go down to Barbados for work. I've made parts for Boeing and Raytheon. I've seen a lot of neat stuff." It's a career that the former farm kid from Swanville always wanted. Buy Photo Al Scherping, owner of CNC COPS LLC, shows some of the wooden items produced using his computer numeric control router on Tuesday, July 26, 2016, in Becker. These were items made for the Boy Scouts. Scherping says his machinist background has taken him to multiple countries where he's seen a great variety of work.  (Photo: Kimm Anderson, kanderson@stcloudtimes.com) After graduating from Central Lakes College in Staples, Scherping spent time at a CNC company in the Twin Cities before relocating to Central Minnesota to work for Komo Machine. Scherping started his business in 2009, shortly after Komo Machine relocated its manufacturing facilities overseas. "Old customers started calling me so I was just like, well, maybe this is what I'm supposed to be doing. And that's when I started CNC COPS," he said. In addition, the father of eight has also started an embroidery shop, Majestic Creations, with his wife Bobbi. CNC work has kept Scherping busy. And demand for his CNC repair background and skills have been a major source of income for his family. Question: What does a CNC machinist do? Answer: A CNC machine is a computer numerical control machine. So the machine is basically set up with numbers and bits and you plug in the numbers to make parts. Q: What would you typically use a CNC machine for? A: I have three different models. I have a (CNC) mill and two CNC routers. The mill would be for steel, aluminium, ferrous and non-ferrous metals. And then my two routers, one of them I use for nonferrous metals and the other one I keep for plastics, woods and materials like that. Cabinet shops would use them. A lot of cabinet shops use CNC routers. There is software, where you can draw out the whole kitchen, lay it all out and it will produce a cut sheet for you. You take that and you give it to the operator and the operator would produce the parts for it. Q: So CNC isn't just for metal? A: It's for any computerized piece of equipment. Q: Was it difficult to find a job after you graduated from Central Lakes College? A: No. There were shops all over. Actually, I left school early. They had a program where you could leave early (and work for a company). The company would actually grade you. So that was part of finishing your course and getting your diploma. And at Komo, I was a supervisor part of the time up there too. So I would get the kids maybe in high school or going to a technical college that would come in for a few hours a day and I had to give them jobs to do. Running machine or whatever. Show them what to do. Q: Is there good money to be made if you are a CNC machinist? A: Yes. There is good money to be made. If you're good. And of course it's going to depend on where you're at in the state or in the country. Q: Are you seeing a big demand right now for CNC machinists? A: A lot of businesses can't find qualified people or even find people that want to do it. If you can give me somebody who wants to learn, I can teach them. But they've got to have the drive to want to learn. Q: What is the most challenging part of your job? A: The funny thing is when I was going to technical college, the second year they offered mold making, tool and die and CNC. Each trimester was something different. When I got to CNC it was not clicking. I didn't want anything to do with it. I just wanted manual machines. Now (for me) the machines are simple. A lot of the challenge is working with the different people, their attitudes and personality. Q: What advice would you give to kids that are interested in doing CNC machining? A: Have an open mind. But that goes with anything. They've got to enjoy this stuff. Follow Vicki Ikeogu on Twitter @VickiSCTimes or on Facebook at facebook.com/sctimesvicki. Call her at 259-3662.

Someone who thinks like me' STEPHANIE MCCRUMMEN Last updated 07:18, October 3 2016 REUTERS Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticizes opponent Hillary Clinton for falling at a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia. In a living room in western Pennsylvania, the Republican National Convention was on TV, and Melanie Austin was getting impatient. "Who's that guy?" she said, watching some billionaire talk about prosperity and tolerance. "Prosperity and tolerance? Forget that s... ." She lit a cigarette. Her boyfriend, Kevin Lisovich, was next to her on the couch, drifting to sleep, a pillow over his head. On the ottoman was her cellphone, her notes on the speakers so far - "LOCK HER UP!!" she had written - and the anti-anxiety pills she kept in a silver vial on her key chain. Michael S. Williamson Melanie Austin sits in her kitchen at home near Brownsville, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 6. She is an avid Donald Trump supporter and thinks he will win her state Nov 8. She was a 52-year-old woman who had worked 20 years for the railroad, had once been a Democrat and was now a Republican, and counted herself among the growing swathe of people who occupied the fringes of American politics but were increasingly becoming part of the mainstream.

Williamson Melanie Austin comforts Kevin Lisovich, a onetime local councilman, who became upset talking about his reversals of fortune.   Like millions of others, she believed that President Barack Obama was a Muslim. And like so many she had gotten to know online through social media, she also believed that he was likely gay, that Michelle Obama could be a man, and that the Obama children were possibly kidnapped from a family now searching for them. "So beautiful," Melanie said as Ivanka Trump walked onto the convention stage to introduce her father, and soon the soaring score of the movie Air Force One was blasting through the TV. Melanie sat up straighter. This is what she had been waiting for. SMH The highlights from the first 2016 US presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. "Here comes Big Daddy," she said, clapping. "The Donald. Big Daddy." Ad Feedback Kevin was snoring. "Here he is, babe," she said. "Donald's here, babe." Trump walked onto the stage, chanting "U-S-A! U-S-A!" "That's right, Donald - USA, baby," Austin said to the Republican nominee for president, who began his speech by marvelling at all the Americans who had gotten him here. "Who would have believed that when we started this journey on June 16 of last year we - and I say we, because we are a team - would have received almost 14 million votes?" Trump said, looking out on the cheering crowd. "I would," Austin said to the TV. "I would, Donald." The first time she had seen him, at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realise how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalised for several weeks after what she called a "rant," a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labelled "medical problem," a doctor had typed "homicidal ideation." Austin thought the whole thing was outrageous. She wasn't a person with homicidal ideation. She was anxious, sure. Enraged, definitely. But certainly not homicidal, and certainly not in need of a hospital stay. "It never crossed my mind that I'm losing it," she said several months after her release, and a big reason for this conviction was the rise of Donald Trump, who had talked about so many of the things she had come to believe - from Obama being a founder of the terrorist group ISIS, to Hillary Clinton being a co-founder, to the idea that US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia may have been murdered in a White House plot involving a prostitute and a pillow. "They say they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow," Trump had told the talk-radio host Michael Savage, who was using his show to explain the scenario to his 5 million weekly listeners, who then spread it on Facebook, where it wound up in Melanie's feed. To Austin, this was the glory of the 2016 presidential election. The truth about so many things was finally being accepted, from the highest levels of the Republican Party on down to the grass roots of America, where so many people like her didn't care what some fact-checker said, much less that one day Trump would suggest that Obama wasn't born in America, and on another say maybe he was. More and more, she was meeting people who felt the same as she did, joining what amounted to a parallel world of beliefs that the Trump campaign had not so much created as harnessed and swept into the presidential election. As Trump saw it, what she had posted about Obama was no different from what a New Hampshire state legislator and Trump campaign adviser had said about Hillary Clinton, that she "should be put in the firing line and shot for treason." "If it's time to lock me up, it's time to lock up the world," Melanie remembered thinking when she had heard that. And so when she was released from the hospital with instructions to "maintain a healthy lifestyle," she did what seemed to her not only healthy but also patriotic. She began campaigning for Trump. "Trumpslide 2016!" she posted on Facebook a few days after she got home in March. "Lets build a winning team and GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!! #Vote for #Donald #Trump for #President!" she posted in May. "#STOPHILARYCLINTON #STOPBERNIESANDERS #SHUTUPMITTROMNEY." In June, Austin heard that Trump was holding a rally in an airplane hangar near Pittsburgh, so off she and Lisovich went. On a blazing Saturday afternoon, her red "Make America Great Again" hat bobbed amid the thousands streaming past hawkers selling "Trump that Bitch" T-shirts and "Bomb the S...Out of ISIS" buttons and a man handing out pamphlets about the apocalypse. Austin took one to fan herself, and she and Lisovich found a spot in the crowd. She looked around. "I feel so inspired and uplifted!" she yelled over the blasting music. "We need hope!" yelled Lisovich, and soon the Air Force One theme began swelling as Donald Trump's Boeing 757 rolled into view. "We want Trump! We want Trump!" the crowd began chanting. "There he is!" Melanie yelled as Trump stepped out of his plane. "Oh, yeah! Donaaaald!" Her voice blended into the thunderous cheers, but as Trump began speaking, and people quieted down, hers became the lone voice calling out from the crowd. "Boo! Booooo!" she yelled when Trump referred to "Crooked Hillary." "Traitoooor!" she yelled when Trump mentioned Obama. And when Trump was saying how great it was going to be on Election Day - "If you pull the right trigger, we're going to have fun together!" - Austin was the one letting it rip from the back of the airplane hangar. "Yeeeeaaaah!" she yelled. A month later, she was backing out of the driveway of her house, a grey-sided two-story, the same one in which she grew up. It was late afternoon, and her check-engine light came on. "Oh, that's all I need," she said during another chaotic day. Her morning had gone by in county court with Lisovich, a onetime local council member and firefighter who was now a laid-off production-shift supervisor checking in with a judge about charges related to using someone's car without permission. "We had to sit through all these arraignments," Austin said of the parade of heroin addicts. "I couldn't believe all the women they brought in. They had tattoos. Blue and green hair. These are zombies, is what they seem to be." After that they went to help Kevin's son fix his decrepit van. "So we tied the muffler up," she said, and that was her day so far. Zombies, a busted muffler and now a check-engine light as she was driving. Through the windshield was a part of Pennsylvania that is more than 90 percent white, ranks among the worst in the state on indicators such as unemployment and premature death, and is near the top in support for Donald Trump, who got two-thirds of the GOP primary vote in April. "My crappy little corrupt community," was how Austin described it, speeding past houses with roofs sagging, porches tilting and buildings rotting into overgrown grass. She slowed as she entered the tiny downtown of Brownsville, population 2,292 and shrinking. "My workplace was right there to the left," she said, pointing to where a railroad office once was. "It was a big red building. Bunch of offices. I don't miss it one bit," she said, speeding up again. "And I have unpleasant thoughts." She had spent her whole life here. She was raised in a family of coal miners and railroad men, graduated from a technical school, and had been working as a secretary when her sister became sick and asked her to take care of her son temporarily. Needing more money, she started working for the railroad, first as a crew dispatcher and eventually as an engineer, running trains full of coal and equipment. She was usually the only woman on a crew, but she prided herself on being tough, so when she heard that some higher-up had called a colleague and asked, "What's Austin wearing today, her green miniskirt?" Melanie laughed it off. She ignored the boss who she said left a Penthouse magazine on her desk. But then came the sexually explicit graffiti about her in the train toilets, and a male colleague's calling her "psycho bitch" over the radio, and another male colleague's flying her underwear like a flag off the train - all of which became part of a sexual-harassment lawsuit Melanie filed against the railroads. In 2002, a jury awarded her US$450,000 in damages, a verdict overturned by a federal judge who did not question the facts of the case but decided that the matter had been handled appropriately. "The jury gave me my one moment in the sun as far as justice was concerned," Austin said. "But the politicians are never going to let a little girl slap two Class I railroads, and they didn't." That was the moment when she began to see so clearly how the world worked, she said, and it wasn't just about the judge. It was about a whole corrupt political system, starting with the governor at the time, Ed Rendell - "that dirty, filthy politician I call Swindell" - who she figured was in the pocket of the railroads and had influenced the judge. And it didn't stop there. Rendell was friendly with Bill Clinton, and Melanie was sure it didn't help her case that Clinton was president and embroiled in sex scandals when she began filing complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. "To see Slick Willy's photo all over, you just wanted to barf," she said. "What could I do?" she said, driving along. "Nothing. I'm just one little girl." Someone honked. "Oh, be quiet!" she yelled out the window. She was late taking her afternoon anti-anxiety pill. "My anxiety's through the roof," she said, and then explained what came after the lawsuit. Her sister became ill with cancer. There were fights with doctors and insurance companies over bills. Her sister died. There was the housing collapse and the banking collapse, and her hours got cut back, and her colleagues were treating her as bad as ever. "Every day was a different scumbum," she said. "I couldn't handle one more d........ ." Her anxiety was getting worse and worse, and then one day in 2011, Austin went to work, and in a moment she cannot recall clearly, ran her train through a red signal. No one was hurt, but she lost her job. "I did cartwheels," she said. "I didn't have to endure this sh-- one more day. Not one more creep crawling up on my engine. Still, it's a hell of a transition from working woman, and then now to have to confront PTSD, anxiety and depression." She went on disability. After a while, she tried to get a job at the local firehouse but came to believe officials were stealing money. She tried to stay on top of her anxiety medication but thought her doctor was committing Medicare fraud. She joined a motorcycle club called Bikers for Christ but found the members to be just "filthy old men." And every day there was Brownsville. "When I was a kid, at Christmas time, you'd have lights and a big 'Season's Greetings' banner hung up here," she said. "There is none of that now. I don't see much pride in this town. I don't see much pride at all." What she did see more and more was not only a collapsing town, but also a collapsing country and world, and when she looked at President Obama, the person presiding over it all, what she saw was someone who seemed "to come out of nowhere." "Nobody knew him! I mean, Dreams from My Father from Kenya?" Melanie said, referring to Obama's memoir. To her, the president seemed so far away, so oblivious to the decay she saw around her that when Donald Trump began suggesting that Obama was not American, it made sense. When Trump and others suggested that Obama was Muslim, to Melanie it seemed plausible. And when Obama started talking about, of all things, gay marriage and letting transgender people into bathrooms, it all came together: The president of the United States was a gay Muslim from Kenya working to undermine America. The more she thought about it, the more certain she became, and with certainty came a feeling of confidence - a sense of liberation that culminated over several days in February, when she decided, "I've been pushed around all I'm going to be pushed around," and began unleashing 20 years of feelings online. "Melanie is taking the world by storm!" she wrote, alongside a cartoon of herself flying. "Yippeeee!" she wrote when Trump pulled ahead in the South Carolina primary. "OUR NATION IS IN TROUBLE," she wrote two days later. "WE ARE STARVING FOR GOOD, HONEST, CARING LEADERSHIP." She posted the name of a local firehouse official with a circle and a slash through it. She wrote to a local council member, "Buzz off blubberlips!" She wrote #hangslickwillynow, and in reference to Hillary Clinton, #hangtheskanknow, and then she turned her attention to Obama. The president should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground, Austin wrote, and soon after that, the state police were knocking on her front door. She was in her nightgown. She was off her anti-anxiety medication. She thought that if she opened the door, the police were going to grab her, so she talked to them through a window. "Oh, they were very placating. 'Hello, Ms. Austin, how are you today?' " she recalled. "They couldn't care less how I was today." The rest of the conversation was a blur, but Melanie remembered that she finally decided there was no use resisting, and as the police led her outside and into the hot back seat of a cruiser, she hummed the old hymn Don't Be Afraid over and over. As she saw it, she was becoming a "political prisoner." Her neighbour John, a childhood friend who was watching the whole thing unfold from his yard, walked over and ducked his head into the police car. He was worried. Austin told him not to be, that God was in control, and that "time will tell the truth." She asked him to take care of her cat, and then the police drove her away. Four months after that, the Republican convention was underway, and Melanie was online with her 2795 Facebook friends and 1430 Twitter followers and all the other people she was meeting every day across America. She was in her garage, where she went most mornings at sunrise to say her prayers and check her social media feeds on her phone. She sat at a big picnic table set with some laminated Holy Land place mats she had gotten during a trip to Israel, and under the Christmas lights in the rafters. "Oh, look," she said, reading a headline. "'A West Virginia member of the House of Delegates says Hillary Clinton should be tried for treason, murder and crimes against the US Constitution and then hung on the Mall in Washington, DC'. " She scrolled. "I want to find out if he's going to the nut house because of it," she said. She lit a cigarette and squinted at the screen. "Look at this," she said, pointing to a photo of Michelle Obama with a caption suggesting she is a man. "It's everywhere." And then she began explaining, step by step, how she had come to believe that the first lady might actually be a man named Michael. She figured it started with the Christian televangelists she had followed since the 1980s. In particular, she loved John Hagee, who had said that the Antichrist would appear as a "blasphemer and a homosexual." And Jerry Falwell, who had blamed the Sept 11 attacks on "the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians." "Also," Austin said, "Falwell disclosed that the first Christmas Bill and Hillary spent in the White House, Hillary collected ornaments from homosexuals all over the world. And those ornaments were hung in the White House foyer." And if that wasn't enough to prove they were "anti-Bible," she said, the Clintons went on to support allowing closeted gay people to serve in the military, which she saw as a watershed moment when America began turning away from God. Then came Obama - "Obama and his gay initiatives," she said - and her suspicions about him deepened with each one. First he supported allowing gays to serve openly in the military. Then gay marriage. Then came the one that struck Austin as the strangest and most sinister of all: allowing transgender people to use bathrooms matching their gender identity. "It's like he wants to classify us - alpha, beta, gamma, delta," she said, referring to the dystopian future described in the novel Brave New World. As she tried to understand it all, the best explanation she found was that Obama himself must be gay, a notion introduced and reinforced by all sorts of stories and photos and videos showing up in her Facebook feed. Of these, few were more convincing than a video of the late comedian Joan Rivers, which was what brought her to the matter of the first lady. "Here we go," she said now, finding it on her phone. She read the headline out loud: "Joan Rivers died two months after calling Obama gay and Michelle a transvestite." And then she scrolled through one YouTube video after another, including a 13-minute 28-second one with more than 1.4 million views that she watched again now. In it, a reporter asks Rivers when America will have its first gay president. "We already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down," Rivers says as she walks away, adding, "You know Michelle is a tranny." "I'm sorry, she's a what?" the reporter asks. "A transgender," Rivers replies. "We all know that." "So," Austin said, explaining why she thought Rivers was serious. "There are societies out there, especially in Hollywood, that we don't know about. Joan is in the LGTB community; she's steeped in it. I watch her stuff on E! Anyone knows that." "So," she continued, "I think if she comes out and says we already have a gay in the White House and Michelle is a tranny, I mean, do you think she's nuts?" She took a drag on her cigarette. "Well, I don't," she said, and turned her attention to the question of the Obama children. "Let's look," she said, and began googling. She started with mrconservative.com, where there was a story, headlined "Evidence Michelle Obama Never Gave Birth to Malia & Sasha," that said: "We have seen pictures of Barack and Michelle dating back far before they had children, like shots from their wedding, but when it comes to what would have been Michelle's childbearing years, there is absolutely nothing. Not one picture of her pregnant or with a newborn baby." It continued: "Ancestry.com and GenealogyBank.com have no records of Malia or Sasha being born," and also said that "Malia and Sasha [bear] little resemblance to their parents," which "could very well be because the two girls were adopted, possibly from Morocco." After reading that, Austin scrolled through links to versions of the story on americasfreedomfighters.com and redflagnews.com and others among the dozens of similar websites that have proliferated in recent years and draw millions of visitors each month. She looked up from her phone. "I think those kids were kidnapped," she said. "We should be looking for those kids' parents." She kept scrolling for more evidence. "Obama gay is on Infowars," she said, pausing for a moment on the conspiracy theory website that now had more than 6.9 million US visitors per month and a daily news program hosted by Alex Jones, who had interviewed Donald Trump. "I just want to finish by saying your reputation's amazing," Trump had told Jones in December. In May, Jones had devoted his show to "the possibility that Michelle Obama was born a man," and as the Republican National Convention began, he had hosted a rally attended by Trump adviser Roger Stone. Austin kept scrolling. Obama Muslim. Obama ISIS. Christian beheadings. A link to an article on a website called commonsenseshow.com detailing how the US government had imported 30,000 guillotines in preparation for martial law, and explaining that a single guillotine "reportedly can chop off the heads of about 100 people per hour," so that "in one ten hour day, 30 million people could be executed." It was afternoon now, and Melanie got herself a glass of iced tea. She thought about the two legislators who had said Hillary Clinton should be executed, and all the memes, and all the stories on all the websites. The more she read, she said, the more certain she was becoming that she was not out of the ordinary, and that her hospitalisation, for instance, was just one more example of an increasingly unjust world. She went over it again: the police cruiser, the injections, the medical bills after. Her hips still hurt. Her gait was off. She was almost out of cigarettes. After a while, her next-door neighbour John stopped by. "John," Austin said. "Do you remember when I was in the police car handcuffed and you came to talk to me?" "Yeah," said John, a laid-off coal miner. "I didn't know what was going on, to tell you the truth. I said, 'Well, something's up. She's p..... somebody off.' " Austin asked him, "Did you feel I needed to be committed?" John looked at her. "That's what Randy thought," he said, referring to a neighbour. "He's the one that said being where you're at is the best thing for you." "John," Melanie said. "I'm on the same meds today that I was on the day they took me out of my house." "Well," John said. "Maybe they thought they had to settle your ass down." "There are a lot of people like me," Austin said. "What's so special about Melanie Austin that she had to be hauled away to the nuthouse?" John didn't answer, and after he left, in the early evening, Austin put on a CD of Chuck Smith, a 1970s preacher she'd long admired who was best known for converting hippies to Christianity. "This is one of the last CDs he made, and it's beautiful," she said, turning up the volume on the classic gospel hymn How Great Thou Art. "That's the moment I'm living for right there, 'When Christ takes me home,' " she said, referencing the lyrics. "I will say, 'Thanks for remembering me.' " She kept scrolling. Hillary Clinton murderer. ISIS chops off heads with dull knife. "I do feel happy and blessed," Melanie said, singing, reading on her phone. She was looking for news about the death of Scalia. She googled "Scalia murdered by prostitute," and soon she was awash in stories about secret White House plots and embalmed bodies and the murder of one of the nation's most powerful people. "Like so many other people around Hillary Clinton," she said. "What are we supposed to think?" She finished her last cigarette and listened to a song about surrender. A fan was blowing. The lights were glowing. "So you see, the media, everybody helped me get to February," she said, referring to the day the state police took her off to the hospital. "I didn't get there on my own. But I'm supposed to be the one to pay the price for it for mouthing off? I need to learn my lesson?" She got up from the table. "It's not that I'm some whacked-out whatever," she said. "I had a lot of help." It was almost dark. "Heaven forbid you should get pissed off and say, 'Up yours,' " she said. She was hungry and thinking about making dinner. "I wonder if Kevin has a cigarette," Austin said, and went back into the house. In the living room the next night, the Republican convention was on the TV. Kevin was asleep on the couch with a pillow over his head, and Trump was on the television accepting the Republican nomination for president. "Praise the Lord," Melanie said. The crowd roared. "Finally," she said. "Someone who thinks like me." Trump began talking about lawlessness, crisis, "terrorism in our cities" and how any leader who doesn't grasp this horror "is not fit to lead our country." "Amen," Austin said, clapping quietly on the couch. "They're traitors." "Safety will be ..." Trump said. "Restored," Melanie finished. "We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore," Trump said. "That's right; cut the crap," Melanie said. "Killings have risen," he went on. "Mmm hmm," Melanie said. "Illegal immigrants . . . innocent young girl. . . . Her killer . . . now a fugitive," he said. Kevin jerked awake. "You all right, hon?" Melanie said. "Yeah, I was dreaming," Kevin said. "One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders," Trump said. "I was kicking someone's ass," Kevin said, and drifted back to sleep. "Our roads ...," Trump said. "Are a mess," Melanie finished. "Hillary Clinton. . .," Trump said. "Lock her up," Melanie finished. "Death, destruction, terrorism and weakness," Trump said. Kevin jerked awake again. "You still fighting?" Melanie said to him. "Yeah," he said, groggy. "You winning?" she said, but Kevin was drifting off again, and as Trump went on about "how the system is rigged," and "wounded American families" and "our own struggling citizens," Melanie said yes, yes, yes, over and over again, until Trump reached the final three words of his speech. "I love you," he said. "He really does love us," Austin said, and soon, the balloons were dropping, Trump was waving to the crowd, and she was switching off the television. She didn't need to hear any more. "It's finished," she said of the 2016 presidential election, in which she was sure Trump would triumph and more and more people across the country would at last see the truth.

That chilly March morning in 2003 is forever etched in Smith’s memory, especially since a photo of the fire’s aftermath is framed on the wall in his office. “It was difficult to see something like that,” says Smith, who eventually rebuilt his shop with hard work and millions of dollars in investments. “It was all gone in just a few hours.” The remaining door frame served as a metaphor of sorts for Smith; given that when one door closed for him, another opened a few months later when he rebuilt, paving the way for a resurrection likely unseen by many in the finishing industry. Smith and his management team not only rebuilt the company, but they distinguished themselves amongst the most elite plating shops in the world, earning the distinction of being the Products Finishing Top Shops Benchmarking Survey’s No. 1 shop in 2016. It was an honor that almost brought Smith to tears, because it validated his struggles over the past decades not only to rebuild and survive in a tough economy, but also to carve out a niche for his employees. “To be recognized as the best shop in the U.S. is something that is a little hard to comprehend at first,” he says. “But I know how hard my employees and team have worked to get us to where we needed to be. It has been a struggle, but it has also been very rewarding. It was well worth it.” Precious Metal Plating Where Electro-Spec is thriving is in the fields of medical, automotive, aerospace, military and RF/microwave industries, often a tough challenge where high quality is demanded on an extremely repeatable basis. The company’s customer base includes the likes of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, Medtronic, Smiths Group, Energizer, Northrop Grumman, Honeywell and TRW. The shop specializes in precious and semi-precious materials such as gold, silver, nickel, copper, its proprietary Tri-M3 tri-alloy, electroless and electrolytic nickel in thicknesses 5 to 500 microinches. They plate over brass, copper, carbon steel, stainless steel, nickel, phosphorous and Kovar (nickel–cobalt ferrous alloy) among others in processes that include barrel, wire, selective and vibratory.   The SBE process is performed in a chamber with ultrasonic action, with a continuous flow of plating solution being pumped into and out of the chamber.   One of the processes that sets Electro-Spec apart from many shops is its specially designed spouted bed electrode (SBE) process for micro-sized active components that are less than 1 cm in size. The SBE process is performed in a chamber using ultrasonic action with a continuous flow of plating solution being pumped into and out of the chamber, which facilitates part movement and therefore provides fresh plating electrolyte during the process. This process is designed for gold, nickel, electroless nickel and copper plating, and is perfect for small parts with features such as flat surfaces, counter bores, tabs, nested parts or complex geometries. “It ensures that each part receives uniform plating coverage on all surface areas, no matter how complex the geometry,” Smith says. “This makes it the ideal process for parts where vibratory or conventional barrel plating is impossible, or even impractical.”   Technic patented the SBE process for plating small components such as electronic connectors, pins, chip capacitors and resistors.    Rapid Circulation of Parts Smith learned of the SBE process from Technic, which patented it for plating small components such as electronic connectors, pins, chip capacitors and resistors. The SBE system replaces a 4- by 6-inch barrel using a special chamber with a load size from 50 to 500 milliliters, and it uses significantly less conductive media. “The SBE plating chamber’s unique design provides for a rapid circulation of the parts over the cathode current feeder without the use of any mechanical movement,” says Dr. George Hradil, Technic’s research director. “Plating solution flow rates carrying the parts through the chamber are exceptionally high, up to 60 liters per minute, which ensures that the parts are always plated in ‘fresh solution,’ irrespective of the configuration and size.” Both of these attributes result in greatly improved part-to-part thickness distribution and a significant reduction in part-to-part coupling, he says, adding that the SBE’s narrower thickness distribution curve allows the SMT producer to target the average plating thickness of a given load much closer to customer minimum thickness requirements than can be done in standard barrel plating equipment. “Another advantage of the SBE plating chamber is the elimination of tin or nickel deposits in the screened area of the chamber,” Hradil says. “Unlike a barrel—where plating takes place when the parts are on the barrel screens—the SBE screens are located in a non-plating area. This greatly cuts down on the maintenance of the plating chamber.”   Used in the SBE process, these baskets are designed for small parts with flat surfaces, counter bores, tabs, nested parts or complex geometries.    Small parts are a specialty of Electro-Spec, shown by the 265 million parts it coated in 2015. But the challenge is not just plating the parts—some of which could be implanted into a human body through a heart device—but doing so in a high-quality, zero-reject environment. That was one of the reasons that Electro-Spec landed atop the Products Finishing Top Shops Benchmarking Survey list. It scored well in each of the four criteria used to determine the benchmarking standards: Current Finishing Technology, Finishing Practices and Performances, Business Strategies and Human Resources/Training. Benchmarking Standards “We used the benchmarking numbers from the Top Shops in 2015 to try to improve all of our processes,” Smith says. “It really is a great tool to be able to measure yourself against others in the industry.” It is also a tribute to the determination of Smith, who holds a bachelor’s degree in government and professional administration from the University of Notre Dame, and who first started working at Electro-Spec in 1994 after he graduated. In 1997, Smith purchased the company from owner David Yates and took the shop from eight people and $1 million in revenue to more than 40 people with a revenue of approximately $5 million, just five years later. But all that growth came to a fiery halt in 2003 when just after midnight a piece of faulty equipment sparked a fire that roared so violently that officials on the scene said it caused some tanks to explode and the surrounding neighborhood to be evacuated. All that remained standing was the metal door frame, but the tragedy didn’t deter Smith. While he was forced to lay off half his workers, he immediately began searching for a site to rebuild, and found it several days later just up the road, a 28,000-square-foot facility that was double what he had before. While the rebuilding took place, the company was essentially out of business for a year. “The big thing was to stay in contact with our customers as much as we could,” says Darren Habig, Electro-Spec’s director of business development. “We drove parts to another plater for our customers, and really anything we could do for them. We all had lists of our customers, and we would talk to them all regularly about our rebuilding efforts.” Company Reinvention Smith and his team chose to reinvent Electro-Spec, and borrowed and invested millions of dollars in new equipment and automation to build what they deemed the best state-of-the-art plating facility in the U.S. He and his management team targeted OEMs that demanded repeatable high-quality coatings, and then showed them what the company could do. “We sought companies that demanded a high level of control and automation to the plating process,” he says. “Our team really pulled together to make this work. It was because of them, not me, that we are here today.” Electro-Spec was given the Indiana Blue Chip Business Award in 2004 because of its determination to recover from the fire, and Smith was given the Businessman of the Year award by the City of Franklin that same year. Electro-Spec focuses on teamwork in every phase of the operation, including a commitment toward continual improvement by providing Six Sigma training (green and yellow belt) for all employees. “Whether they are a new hire or an employee with 25 years of service, every employee plays an integral part in the development and growth of the company,” Smith says. “As a group we inspire each other, and as a team we aspire to succeed.” The company also grew thanks to its success in four areas: Aerospace, where it is a supplier to several of the leading aerospace companies for years, and are involved in several cutting edge technologies Medical, specializing in micro-electronic medical components to implantable components and bio-hazard/germicidal components Automotive, as leading plating supplier to many Tier One and Two automotive companies, including successful conversions for many different methods and processes that have impacted Ford, GM and Chrysler on safety-critical components RF/Microwave, a continuation of over 40 years where it has worked with many of the world’s leading telecommunication companies   “We have done a very good job of not only staying in contact with our customers, but also working very closely with our suppliers to learn about the new chemistries they may have that could help our customers, or even go after new ones,” says Mary Gordon, Electro-Spec’s plant manager and director of operations. “But we spend a lot of time testing these new chemistries before we take them to our customers, just to make sure they can do what we want it to do.” Testing Processes Habig says Electro-Spec has built its entire strategic plan around working closely with customers to test new processes and see where improvements can be made, or where they might not work in full production. “We ask a lot of questions of our customers about what they are working on, or what they are working with,” Habig says. “It helps us better understand their need today, and in the future.” Things slowed when the recession of 2008 hit, but Electro-Spec quickly grew almost 70 percent in the ensuing years, going from approximately $6 million in sales to over $10 million. The growth was fueled in 2012 when Electro-Spec purchased the plating division of a company in Kansas and relocated its operations to a new, larger facility in Franklin, where it has nearly doubled its space to about 60,000 square feet and has 12 acres if it needs to expand again. Smith says the company is now doing business on an international basis and has 85 employees with sales over $12 million. A lot of that growth comes from several unique patented processes that Electro-Spec’s engineering team has come up with. When the team identified a need for a plating process that would enhance the performance of RF connectors, it developed Tri-M3 finish, which is 55 percent copper, 30 percent tin, and 15 percent zinc. “For years, electronic component manufacturers have essentially had two plating choices: nickel or silver,” he says. “Both of these options have their strengths and weaknesses, but government pressure to eliminate nickel plating—coupled with soaring silver costs—has made both of these choices less palatable.” He says Tri-M3 presents a superior substitute to nickel and silver plating, in nearly all applications, with a shelf life that far exceeds traditional silver plating. Smith says the process has a low surface friction, that is approximately 70 percent that of silver, with high conductivity, superior abrasion resistance, excellent solderability and low internal stress, which allows for forming of plating components. Antimicrobial Finishes for Medical Smith is also president and CEO of Steriplate, which he formed in 2013, focusing on the design, development and implementation of antimicrobial finishes for medical and commercial applications. Smith holds a provisional patent application for the Steriplate technology and has filed a utility patent application for the Steriplate technology. He also recently testified in front of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Research and Technology about technology for patient safety at Veterans Hospitals, especially that which is designed to stop hospital acquired infections (HAI) among veterans. “There is the ability of many types of metals to provide a continuous antimicrobial surface to help prevent the spread of HAIs,” Smith says. “There are infinite possibilities of utilizing metal as an antimicrobial finish in a variety of applications inside and outside the human body.”     For information on Electro-Spec, visit electro-spec.com, or call 317-738-9199.   Originally published in the October 2016 issue.        Comments are reviewed by moderators before they appear to ensure they meet Products Finishing’s submission guidelines.

The plane made a symbolic stop at Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport in the only East African country with no national airline to speak of. I guess it was a way of further luring the Ugandan market away from RwandAir’s main competitor Kenya Airways.  Ethiopian Airways also did the same when it acquired its Airbus A350XWB in June and landed at Entebbe. Indeed the Ugandan market has been up for grabs since AirUganda closed shop.   Personally, I have been glad to witness the tremendous journey that Rwanda’s flag carrier has made over the recent years. As a reporter, I covered its rebranding from Rwandair Express to RwandAir in June 2009. Soon after, I was on the airport tarmac with a small Canon Powershot camera and a voice recorder when the company bought its first aircraft – a second hand 50-seater Bombardier CRJ200 jet. The has basically grown from wet leasing aircraft from other aviation companies to buying second hand aircraft and now to making orders straight from manufacturers like Boeing in US and Airbus in France. By the end of the year RwandAir will have a fleet of 10 aeroplanes after it receives the second Airbus (A330-300). One of the major justifications for growing the presence of RwandAir has been to cushion the country’s growing tourism potential. Tourism is a key foreign exchange earner for Rwanda and having a functional airline as part of the sector’s infrastructure is important. As a region it was refreshing to see that as RwandAir launched Ubumwe, Tanzania’s President John Magufuli was also launching at the Julius Nyerere International Airport two new Bombardier Q400 NextGen aircrafts from Canada.   President Magufuli pledged to revive the country’s national carrier, Air Tanzania and his government has already allocated money for the purchase of a 160-seater aircraft and another with over 240 seats. There is also a plan to construct more airports across Tanzania to open up the vast country’s tourism potential. In Kenya, news that a new former Safaricom CEO Michael Joseph is set to join the board of troubled Kenya Airways was received with a level of excitement. Mr Joseph’s name came up during the airline’s Annual General Meeting held on Thursday. The hope is that he will do his magic and turn around the company like he did when he grew Safaricom into the region’s most profitable company. Kenya Airways is not the only carrier in the region that is making losses and so beyond acquisition of new planes, all regional airlines need to quickly find strategies that will see them run commercially and profitably as soon as possible.   Regional governments also have to invest in the aviation industry fully. The region’s tourism prospects cannot be detached from investment in aviation. Investment in the upgrading of international and regional airports is very important. As an industry that is growing globally the need for skilled labour is more crucial now than before. Skilled labour in this sector means not just training of pilots but also engineers, technicians, ground handling personnel, airhosts and hostesses, ticketing agents and even journalists who are well versed with aviation dynamics.  As East Africa, we do not have to just compete on aircrafts yet the industry is much bigger than what we see in the air. We must not forget that when it comes to tourism we are in competition with Southern Africa and North Africa. It is quite encouraging that Rwanda is in advanced stages of constructing a new airport in Bugesera and that Kenya is upgrading its regional airports to international standards to allow big aircraft to land there when the need arises. What remains is the elephant in the room that has kept air travel in the region arguably the most expensive in the world. The talk of making the region one airspace and thus eliminating some of the exorbitant airport taxes would go a long away in boosting the aviation industry in the region. When the price of airline tickets comes down, more East Africans will be in position to enjoy the comfort of facilities like Ubumwe beyond retweeting and re-sharing photos. After all Ubumwe means unity. Follow @ssojo81 Please enable JavaScript to view the Comments powered by Disqus.

"The investigation cannot abstract from whatever versions on the basis of a paradigm Russia is responsible," he said in an interview with the First Channel. "It is impossible to have an investigation based on the paradigm, where in several minutes after the tragedy certain countries claim at official levels Russia is responsible." "In that case, it is doomed to failure, lack of objectivity." Preliminary findings On Sept. 28, the Joint Investigation Team consisting of representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Australia, Malaysia and Belgium, presented its first preliminary results of the criminal investigation into the MH17 crash in Donbass. The JIT claims that the plane was shot down with a BUK missile brought from Russia’s territory. The investigators said the missile was launched from the Pervomayskoye village to the south of Snezhnoye, which was controlled by self-defense militias at that time. The JIT has not studied the data provided by Russia that rejected this version. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it doubts that the conclusions of the investigators are objective. "The data, which the investigation team presented at a briefing on Wednesday, had been taken from two main sources: the Internet and Ukraine’s security services. Therefore, the objectivity of that data and consequently the conclusions made on its basis cannot but be doubtful," the ministry’s official spokesman Igor Konashenkov stressed. He also assured that no Russian air defense systems have ever crossed the Ukrainian border. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing -777 flight MH17, which was on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in Donbass on July 17, 2014. All the 283 passengers and 15 crew members, nationals of ten countries, died in the crash.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency reported Saturday that the “Saegheh” drone was built by the Guard’s aerospace division and is similar to the RQ-170 Sentinel spy drone. The report did not elaborate on the new drone’s range. Iran claimed to have shot down an RQ-170 drone in December 2011 and broadcast footage of the recovered aircraft. It also claims to have captured three Boeing-designed ScanEagle drones. Tehran said in 2014 that it had successfully tested its own version of the drone. It said it managed to reverse-engineer the RQ-170 Sentinel, seized in December 2011 after it entered Iranian airspace from neighboring Afghanistan, and that it is capable of launching its own production line for the unmanned aircraft. Iranian state TV shows what purports to be an intact ScanEagle drone aircraft, December 4, 2012 (AP/Al-Alam TV) Iran says it has captured several American drones in recent years, including a ScanEagle — a less sophisticated aircraft — after it entered Iranian airspace over the Persian Gulf. Tehran says it is also copying the ScanEagle and is putting its version into service. AFP contributed to this report.

(NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA United States) Abstract: In the 1980s NASA Aeronautics was actively involved in full-scale wind tunnel testing of promising VSTOL aircraft concepts. This presentation looks at two, a multi-role fighter and a subsonic tactical transport. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with some of the rationale that ultimately led to the selection of competing concepts for production, namely the V-22 Osprey and the F-35 Lightning. The E7-A STOVL multi-role fighter was the product of an aircraft development program in the late 1980s by NASA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Canadian Department of Industry Science and Technology (DIST), and industry partners General Dynamics and Boeing Dehavilland. The program was conducted an in response to increasing US-UK interest in supersonic STOVL fighters. The objective was to design an aircraft that could replace most existing close air support-air combat fighters with a single aircraft that had some of the qualities of an air superiority fighter and the deployment flexibility of a VSTOL aircraft. The resulting E7-A concept was a delta-wing supersonic fighter that used a fuselage-mounted thrust augmenting ejector and a ventral deflecting jet nozzle for vertical lift. The Grumman Aircraft Company, the Navy, and NASA developed the Design-698 (D-698) subsonic tactical transport in response to the Navy's Type A VSTOL utility aircraft requirement. The objective was to develop a subsonic utility transport with the operational flexibility of a helicopter, but with greater speed and range. The D-698 employs two high-bypass turbofan engines mounted on a dumbbell that rotates through ninety degrees for vertical takeoff and cruise flight. Movable vanes positioned in the exhaust flow provide control in hover with the need for reaction control jets. The presentations concluding comments suggest that technology advances in the last thirty-years may justify the value of revisiting some of these concepts.

Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle, commander of Air Force Air Combat Command (ACC), late last week declared the QF-16 Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) initially operationally capable. The QF-16 is an unmanned F-16 used, in this program, for providing threat-representative presentation for developmental and operational test and evaluation for weapons systems as mandated by law, Department of Defense documents said of the FSAT program. According to the main contractor, Boeing: “The QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target will provide the next generation of combat training and testing for U.S. warfighters. Retired F-16 aircraft are converted into QF-16 aerial targets for the purpose of testing newly developed weapons and tactics. The QF-16 will replace the existing QF-4 fleet, and provide a higher capability, fourth generation aerial target that is more representative of today’s targets and threats.” The decision by ACC certifies 15 QF-16s ready and available for target operations, according to an ACC release. They are assigned to Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and flown by the 82nd Aerial Target Squadron under the 53rd Wing. In this sense, initial operational capability (IOC) means that the squadron now has 15 aircraft “plus trained pilots and maintainers to provide unmanned QF-16 aerial targets in the Gulf Range from Tyndall AFB," Lt. Col. Matthew Garrison, 82nd Aerial Target Squadron commander at Tyndall, told C4ISRNET in an email. “This also required that we have the hardware, software and technicians to maintain and operate the target control system. There were several intermediate steps along the way including unmanned QF-16 target missions supporting JSF [joint strike fighter] testing that supported the recent F-35A IOC declaration.” The new QF-16 fleet replaces the QF-4 fleet that served the same purpose. ACC assured that QF-16 is the introduction of fourth-generation fighter capabilities in the aerial target mission maintaining all capabilities of the baseline F-16 including supersonic flight and 9 G maneuverability. Garrison added that “[w]e are already full steam ahead because we are supporting back-to-back QF-16 target missions tomorrow for [ Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile] AMRAAM involving USN F-18s and new software for USAF F-16s.” “This leap forward in airframe capabilities, combined with advanced electronic pods, will allow us to properly test and evaluate our 5th generation aircraft and weapons,” he said. The QF-16 has been thought of to contribute to the Air Force’s loyal wingmen program, which seeks to pair unmanned fourth-generation fighters with fifth-generation manned platforms. Within this construct, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work has described it as a battle node network in line with the third offset strategy “where you take an F-16, make it totally unmanned — F-16 is a fourth-generation fighter – and pair it with an F-35 – a fifth-generation, what I would call battle network node — and those two operating together,” he said at a Washington Post event. This concept can help navigate around anti-access/area denial environments, which aim to extend the range of adversarial forces and capabilities, by serving as a missile truck for fifth-generation fighters that are limited in their payload capability and accompanying them at high rates of speed currently unique vis-à-vis other unmanned platforms. “We have not participated in any technology demonstrations with the Loyal Wingman program but have provided them with answers to specific questions when asked,” Garrison said. “Generally these have been centered on our target control system. We also discussed some general lessons learned about maintaining and operating large, unmanned aerial platforms.” L-3 awarded special ops binoculars contract by Michael Peck L-3 has been awarded a $49.5 million contract for night vision binoculars for special operations for… Share Tweet Attribution of Russia in DNC hack has curtailed Kremlin's hacking, Clapper says by Mark Pomerleau The Director of National Intelligence told Congress Russian hacking activity in cyberspace has curta… Share Tweet Next Article Email LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Subscribe to Newsletters Subscribe to Magazine Editorial Contacts RSS Feeds Contact Us Customer Service Home IT/Networks C2/Comms UAS/ISR ISR Robotics Satellites Sensors UAS GEOINT Cyber DISA Insights WhitePapers Webcasts Special Multimedia Reports Events Multimedia Special Multimedia Reports Show Reporters Videos Photo Galleries Newsletters Services About Us Advertise with Us Contact Us Digital Edition Privacy Policy Ad Choices Terms of Service Our Partners Federal Times Defense News Not A U.S. Government Publication A Sightline Media Group Site © 2016 Sightline Media Group Site Powered by

Standing in a cluster near the runway at the Cape Girardeau Regional Airport is a small group of World War II veterans. While swapping old war stories from the good old days they were waiting. Eagerly waiting for the arrival of the iconic B-17 bomber.   “It's just a wonderful opportunity,” said Floyd Smith a World War II veteran. “I wish the whole city could turn out and watch this thing land. It's something that you just don't see. There it comes right there. And it's something you don't see everyday. You know? And I just wish so many kids could see that. Oh what a wonderful sight.” In its heyday, the B-17 bomber was a force to be reckoned with. During World War II, the flying fortress dropped more than 600,000 tons of bombs in Europe. Virtually helping to turn the tide of the war. But these days only a handful of those heavy bombers are flyable. One of them is Sentimental Journey. She’s one of the most authentically restored B-17’s out there today. Recently, the iconic warbird found its way to the airport as part of the Flying Legends Victory Tour.   Shelby Bolkey is the loadmaster of the Sentimental Journey. She’s a redhead with a fiery personality to match. And she’s passionate about are her heroes. “My dad was in the Navy,” Bolkey said. “My father-in-law was there when they took the bridge at Remagen. One of the bloodiest battles that was the first bridge across the Rhine river. And so they're both gone. And so to be able to honor their memory is this is part of it. This plane is a symbol of all of them, but you know how can you not? They gave us a free world. How can you not honor them?”   Larry Perkins is the pilot of Sentimental Journey, and he’s been flying her for nearly 26 years. “If it weren't for B-17's carrying out their missions, you and I'd be speaking German right now,” Perkins said. “It was very important to the war and they took some terrible losses. I believe there were about 4,000 of them shot down. And you know on each of those airplanes there's 10 people.” Perkins served in the Army during the Vietnam War. He said he’s honored to fly his fellow veterans a plane ride of a lifetime.   “I would have liked to have been young enough to join them,” Perkins said. “You couldn't fly or serve with better people. And the people who come out have such rich stories.” Unlike other B-17’s you see in old war photos or movies, this aluminum beauty is bare-metal.   “At the end of the war they didn't take time to paint the airplanes,” Perkins said. “The last P-51's built, the last B-17's built were all bare-metal.” While we’re talking about her look, her nose art is of the famous ‘40s pinup model with the Million Dollar Legs, Betty Grable. “You notice that she has her posterior toward the camera,” Perkins said.   At the time, it was rumored Grable was pregnant, but it was never confirmed. However, the plane’s namesake comes from the Doris Day and Les Brown ‘40s hit Sentimental Journey. But don’t let her age or beauty fool you. She’s a solid warbird. “It's about as safe an airplane as you can fly in,” Perkins said. “It has 4 engines. It'll fly real well on two-engines. And if you remember the battle damage that the airplanes flew home with, the airplane is literally built like a bridge.”   A Boeing design, Sentimental Journey was built in 1944 in Long Beach, California. Because of manufacturing she didn’t see any combat. Instead she was sent over to the Pacific theater for the rest of the war. Three years later she became an aerial mapping plane. “Her last military job she was the mothership to remotely control another B-17 through a nuclear blast,” said Bolkey.   For nearly two decades, Sentimental Journey was used to fight forest fires for a company in California. She was relieved from her duties of dropping slurry on those fires when they discovered that the slurry was corrosive to her aluminum exterior. So they moved her to a field. Birds made a home in her engine. Her tires were flat and her propellers were bent. The company eventually decided to auction her off. “At the auction two guys were bidding to get her,” Bolkey said. “One literally wanted to turn her into beer cans. The other one was our first leader and he had the dream that we could bring her back to life and we could fly her.” Airbase Arizona got her. They cleaned her up and flew her to her current home in Mesa, Arizona. It took 18 years to fully restore her back to her former glory. And now she serves as a flying museum for veterans and civilians. When you step onto the plane the first thing you’ll see our guns and ammunition. The seats are more like nets and the inside is pretty crammed. Bolkey who was our guide motions us to take a seat, buckle up and enjoy the view as we fly over Cape Girardeau. When the flight was over she gave us her flight attendant speech. “We know you have a choice when you fly,” Bolkey said. “So the next time you decide to go blasting through the air in an unpressurized aluminum tube, we hope you'll fly with Airbase Arizona.” After the flight, Smith said he left the plane with a different perspective. “I didn't realize how important it was to the overall victory that we had to have you know,” Smith said. “Now this is just one airplane of course. [But]  then I think about all of them doing the same thing and the guys on the ground dying. And I realize how important this bomber is.” While he enjoyed spending the day catching up with old comrades, there was one veteran that was on his mind--Clifford Heinrich. Heinrich was 18 at the time of the war. Serving as a tail gunner on B-17, his plane crashed coming back from a mission. “We went on a mission and we came back to England,” Heinrich said. “[We] made it back to England alright. And we crashed and we crashed when we get there.” By the time the plane hit the ground he made it to the plane’s radio room where a nearby nurse found him. “[The] nurse was there near where we crashed,” Heinrich said. “And she's the one that pulled me out.” Heinrich was the only one to make it out alive from his 10 man crew. He spent the next 14 months in a hospital. For more than six decades his efforts went unrecognized. Earlier this year that changed when he received a Purple Heart medal among others. To this day it’s still unknown as to what exactly caused the crash. But it’s stories like Heinrich’s that remind this crew what it’s really all about. Underneath the wide open bomb bay doors, Bolkey pointed out the scattered names of veterans and their comrades. “[The] people who have come out and flown with his us that have actually been veterans and flown in a B-17, we have them sign our doors,” Bolkey said. “This is our wall of honor.” This one was Earl’s. He was a pilot of a B-17. “We saw him on July 7, 2014,” Bolkey said. “He was the pilot. He listed all of his crew members including the three that were killed in action. So when they went down. He lost let's see his radio operator. His left waist gunner and the ball turret gunner.” All of this hits home for Bolkey. Her husband served 22 years in the military and her son served in Iraq. “I sent my son off to Iraq,” Bolkey said. “ And within four days he lost his best friend. And within two weeks he lost four of his troops. And he said ‘I grew up watching World War II movies where I had to you know watch the guy write the letter home.’ He said ‘[I] never knew how hard that was until I had to write four.’ You know luckily he came home.” For many of these veterans Sentimental Journey is more than just a piece of history. It’s a place to say goodbyes. “We had a gentleman that came and struggled to get his walker out of his car, and struggled his way all the way up to the plane, and he put his hand on the star in the back,” Bolkey said.  And I waited until he stood up and I said I would help get back to his old crew position if he wanted to, and he said ‘I came to say goodbye to ghosts.’ You know and you think about that.” Tags:  Going Public B-17 Bomber WWII Airbase Arizona Sentimental Journey TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2016 KRCU About KRCU Driving Directions Annual Reports Contact Us

(1:33) Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email comment Oct 1, 2016 Ivan MaiselESPN Senior Writer Close Senior college football writer Six-time FWAA award winner Graduate of Stanford University Follow on Twitter Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email print comment SEATTLE -- Washington honored the players who won the 1991 national championship team at halftime Friday night. They ambled out on the FieldTurf at Husky Stadium, 65 middle-aged men who looked nothing like a No. 1 team. The 10th-ranked guys in purple who embarrassed No. 7 Stanford, 44-6, however, might have something to say about the College Football Playoff. Do not refresh this page -- that score is correct, the largest margin of victory over a top-10 team in Washington history. It reflects the complete dominance that the Huskies exerted over the Cardinal on both sides of the line, in the kicking game, in time of possession and every other way you can measure two teams on the same field. "That was special," Washington head coach Chris Petersen said. "I'm really proud of how hard they played, how good they played. We're still a work in progress, but that was a good step forward." You could say that. Washington scored quick and scored slow. The Huskies gained two yards (424) for every one they allowed (213). They held Stanford junior Christian McCaffrey to 49 yards on 12 carries, and it might have been the best 49-yard game in the history of Heisman candidates. When the Stanford offensive line wasn't busy not opening holes for McCaffrey, they were giving up eight sacks of Ryan Burns (six) and Keller Chryst (two). Fans stormed the field after Washington routed Stanford. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren McCaffrey being McCaffrey, he still finished with 223 all-purpose yards. But if you keep returning kickoffs, that means the other team is scoring. McCaffrey returned a total of three kickoffs in Stanford's first three games. He returned five Friday night for 144 yards, including a 57-yarder. "Those kids were playing really inspired ball by the energy in that stadium," Petersen said of his team. "They were excited to play Stanford, but it hasn't been like that since I've been here (three seasons)." This was Husky Stadium from the glory years, the noise bouncing off the metal overhangs on each grandstand and sounding like the Boeing jets for which this area is known. "I mean, it's been loud," said Washington junior safety Budda Baker, who grew up in nearby Bellevue, "but that was some other type of loud. That was Seahawks-type loud." The crowd of 72,027, the biggest since Washington opened the renovated stadium three years ago, reveled in the Huskies' dominance, a callback to this program's glory days in the early 1990s. Hey, anyone can have a bad quarter-century. Washington did have that Rose Bowl season in 2000, when the Huskies finished No. 3. What followed was a steady slide into oblivion, bottoming out with an 0-12 record in 2008. Steve Sarkisian returned the Huskies to respectability before he bolted for USC after five seasons. And now, in his third season on Montlake, Petersen has built a team that looks a lot like his Boise State teams, the ones that went 92-12 (.885) and won two BCS bowls in eight seasons. "I think these guys, our team, has a lot to 'em," Petersen said. "Those are the flashes we've been seeing, feeling for a long time. It's nice when it all kind of comes together at home in this environment. I think it was really cool that the '91 team was here." Washington's Connor O'Brien and Azeem Victor tackle Stanford's Christian McCaffrey. Jennifer Buchanan/USA TODAY Sports Stanford endured a complete meltdown. The Cardinal made glaring physical and mental mistakes in all three phases of the game, and it didn't help that Stanford lost four starters to injury last week. "Well, that was about as poorly as we could play from start to finish," Stanford coach David Shaw said. Like having to call timeout on fourth down during two possessions in Huskies territory because Burns couldn't get the play off. Like Stanford left tackle A.T. Hall, perhaps not hearing the snap count, never coming out of his stance as defensive end Joe Mathis ran around him and smashed into Burns. Like Huskies wide receiver John Ross racing through the depleted Cardinal secondary unimpeded, except for the two plays on which Stanford interfered with him. Ross made four catches for 82 yards and caught one of Jake Browning's three touchdowns. Both Cardinal starting cornerbacks missed the game because of injury, and Ross, the junior with 4.3 speed, kept plenty of space between him and the guys who could play. Editor's Picks Hype, realized: Washington blows out Stanford for signature win The Washington hype is only going to intensify after the No. 10 Huskies rout seventh-ranked Stanford. Like finally forcing a Washington punt in the third quarter, which hit Stanford blocker Ben Edwards in the back, allowing the Huskies' Lavon Coleman to recover it at the Stanford 40. Washington scored five plays later to go ahead 30-0. Washington even won the coin toss. "Honestly, it's still kind of sinking in," said defensive tackle Elijah Qualls, who made five tackles. "I've definitely never been on the field when the crowd rushed it, so that was kind of interesting. I almost got run over." The fans tumbled onto the turf to celebrate knocking off the team that has won three of the past four Pac-12 titles. Washington has seven regular-season games left, beginning next week with a visit to historic rival Oregon. The Huskies leave this game in charge of the Pac-12 North, but Petersen doesn't want to hear anything about this performance announcing the arrival of an old power. He is leaving Saturday morning to recruit. It is back to business as usual. It has to be. "We're not there," Petersen said. "I'm not saying we're there. I know how this thing goes. You sleep on anybody, feeling like we got it, we got it figured out. I know what comes next." Not if the Huskies play as they did Friday night. They looked like the Huskies of old.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. HOUSTON COUNTY, Georgia (CNN) When vintage World War II bombers known as B-25 Mitchells thrill fans on the U.S. airshow circuit, they honor the legacy of one of the most daring military missions in American history. At Georgia's Perry-Houston County Airport on Friday a B-25 named Show Me sat at the end of Runway 36. Its powerful propeller twin engines shook the seats as the bomber waited to takeoff -- a little bit like Jimmy Doolittle and his raiders did in 1942 aboard the USS Hornet. Eighty men volunteered for that mission -- what turned out to be a one-way air attack -- vengeance for Japan's strike on Hawaii that crippled the U.S. Navy fleet and left 2,403 dead. For them, Pearl Harbor was their 9/11. After four months, it was time for payback. The mission -- depicted in the 2001 film "Pearl Harbor" -- called for 16 US B-25s to take off from an aircraft carrier near Japan. The planes would bomb five Japanese cities and fly on to China, where the men would connect with friendly forces who would help them get home. On April 18, 1942, Doolittle and co-pilot Richard E. "Dick" Cole sat in the cockpit of their B-25 going over a preflight check list with the engines running. "I was setting the engine cowl flaps and watching to make sure the engines didn't overheat," said Cole, now 101 years old and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel. "It was a bit hectic," he said, because crews were scrambling. The mission launch was moved up by 12 hours because of fears that Tokyo had been tipped off. As a result, the B-25s would have to take off hundreds of miles farther from Japan than planned. That meant the planes wouldn't have enough fuel to guarantee they'd land safely in China. "We were the first plane," Cole said. "I remember I was hoping that we had done everything that we needed to do to make the takeoff. " A versatile airplane Aboard our Friday B-25 flight in Georgia, Show Me's pilot, Craig O'Mara, kept his feet on the brakes while pushing the throttles forward --- revving up the ridiculously loud engines. "The noise is intense," said David Thompsen, another Show Me pilot, because engine exhaust pipes aim toward the cockpit and crew cabin. With a green light from air traffic controllers, O'Mara released the brake and unleashed the aircraft. The 72-year-old plane raced 2,000 to 2,500 feet down the runway, accelerating to about 120 mph before completely leaving the ground. Owned by the Commemorative Air Force, Show Me appears at airshows nationwide to promote the Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity which helps give a voice to disabled US vets returning from war. This weekend, the plane is one of the stars of the Thunder Over Georgia airshow at nearby Robins Air Force Base. During its heyday, the B-25 was a respectable warplane -- distinguished by its twin-tail and versatility. "It became the most heavily armed airplane in the world, was used for high- and low-level bombing, strafing, photoreconnaissance, submarine patrol, and even as a fighter," according to Boeing. Of nearly 10,000 B-25s built by North American Aviation, Show Me (which was not on the Doolittle Raid) is among fewer than 50 that can still fly. From our Georgia airport, it's about 300 miles to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where Doolittle's raiders trained in secret seven decades ago to learn cross-country navigation without radios or landmarks and how to execute short takeoffs from ships. "The highest risk for pilots during takeoff from a carrier would have been an engine failure at a slow speed," Thompsen said. Engine failure would force pilots to abort takeoff. They risked losing control of the plane which could allow it to veer into key structures on the ship. The mission begins A typical B-25 takeoff uses about 2,000 feet of runway, Thompsen said. But the Hornet's deck allowed the planes as little as 300 feet to get airborne --- otherwise they'd drop off the edge and crash into the ocean. Amazingly, the mission pilots had been trained to be able to take off as slowly as 75 mph with as little as 250 feet of runway. Have pilots ever tried that with Show Me? "No we haven't," Thompsen said. "That's a high-risk maneuver and we don't do that. We try to treat her gently." With the natural winds, combined with speed from the moving ship, the B-25s only needed to get up to about 23 mph to fly off the Hornet, Cole said. Japan was about 650 miles away. A flag on the deck green-lighted the takeoff. It was time. Both Cole and Doolittle kept their hands on the engine throttles to make sure the levers didn't accidentally slip downward and -- in case of engine failure -- to quickly bring the plane to a stop. With his engines revving hard, Doolittle released the brakes, sending the plane barreling toward the ship's edge. Seconds later, the first raiders were airborne. 'A little bit scary' They made one circle over the Hornet and then pointed the airplane toward Japan. Soon, all 15 remaining planes followed. The grueling mission had begun. "I remember thinking we had just separated ourselves from civilization," Cole said. "The range of our short-wave radio was only about 45 miles and we were going to be more than 45 miles away from civilization for eight or 10 hours." "In a way it was a little bit scary," he said. But they were fully committed. There was no turning back. To avoid detection, the raiders flew extremely close to the Pacific --- sometimes dangerously low. At speeds around 190 mph, Doolittle flew about 200 feet above the water. Incredibly, some pilots flew as low as 50 feet. One stiff wind or mistake in the cockpit could've sent the 14-ton bombers crashing into the ocean. 'Drop the bombs' At about noon, Doolittle and Cole's crew were the first of the raiders to reach Tokyo. Still flying low, they encountered no air attacks, Cole said. Apparently, the element of surprise was intact. Bombardier Fred Braemer found a target and "Col. Doolittle pulled up to 1,500 feet and said, 'Drop the bombs,'" Cole recalled. At one point over Tokyo, Cole spotted several Japanese aircraft high above. "Apparently they did not see us," he said. The B-25's bomb bay is pretty much completely enclosed: "The bomb bay doors are hydraulically operated and they move very fast," Thompsen said. "When they close, they're kind of like a guillotine." Overall, the raiders' 16 planes hit factory areas, oil-storage facilities and military installations. Despite plenty of anti-aircraft fire from the ground, all the planes reached their targets without being shot down. The raiders had accomplished their mission. They disproved Japan's claims that the mainland was impervious to enemy attack. They also had dealt America's first blow in response to Pearl Harbor -- raising morale back home. "I felt that we made a pretty good retaliatory strike," Cole said. Jumping out of a plane in the dark during a storm But the mission was far from over. They still had to get home -- via China. When Doolittle and Cole's plane reached the Chinese coast they were running low on fuel. Worse, it was dark and they were surrounded by a powerful storm. With no safe landing zone in sight, Doolittle ordered his crew to bail out at 9,000 feet, traveling about 166 mph. "All kinds of ideas go through your head" before you jump out of an airplane into the dark during a thunderstorm," Cole said. "Number one, you hoped that the 'chute would work and number two, you hoped you'd have a sense to know what you were going to hit in the terrain below you when you bailed out." "Fortunately for me, I didn't have to worry about hitting the ground," he said. "My 'chute opened fine and it caught on a small pine tree which made my landing very easy." Cole spent the night in his parachute, suspended about 10 feet off the ground. The next day he met up with friendly Chinese Nationalist troops who also found Doolittle and the rest of the crew. A few days later they all were escorted to a U.S. military aircraft, which flew them to safety. The legacy Overall, 11 crews bailed out of their bombers. Four planes crash-landed. One crew flew to the Soviet Union. Of the 80 raiders, three were killed in action. Eight were captured; one starved to death in a Japanese prison camp and three were executed. As if they hadn't done enough, after recovering from their mission, many raiders, including Cole, rejoined the war to fight again. After the war, the surviving raiders lived out the rest of their lives, pursuing careers, building families, enjoying their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The survivors would reunite to toast their victory and their comrades. Two weeks ago, the Air Force honored the mission's legacy by naming its new long-range B-21 bomber The Raider, which is expected fly as soon as the mid-20s. Last June, former B-25 gunner/engineer David Thatcher died at age 94, making Cole the last living raider. When you can look back on a life like Cole's, you've likely learned a few lessons along the way. The man who helped lead the Doolittle raiders offered some advice. "As you go through life," Cole said, "expect the unexpected." Copyright 2016 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved.

Still images from the video of the blast were the reason for the request. The images show a shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building belonging to United Launch Alliance (ULA), the newspaper said citing three industry sources familiar with the investigation. Read more Watch as massive fireball engulfs SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket (VIDEOS) The building is used for refurbishing rocket motors and is located about a mile from the Cape Canaveral Launchpad, where the SpaceX rocket exploded. Its roof has the launchpad in a clear line of sight. The encounter between the SpaceХ employee and the representatives of ULA was described as “cordial, not accusatory” in the report. Nevertheless, the SpaceX employee was not allowed in. ULA instead invited Air Force investigators, who found nothing suspicious on the roof. The Falcon 9 rocket exploded during fueling ahead of an engine test fire. About a week into the explosion, SpaceX chief Elon Musk said the company did not rule out sabotage as a possible cause while describing the incident as “the most difficult and complex” in the company’s 14-year history. Investigators have since reported that they have narrowed down the cause to a breach in the helium line of the second stage. SpaceX is being assisted by NASA and the US Air Force with the probe. Neither would comment on the ULA building visit, citing the ongoing investigation. Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2016 SpaceX and ULA are competing for launch contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. ULA, an alliance between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, enjoyed a decades-long monopoly providing space services for the US military, until SpaceX sued the Air Force in 2014 for the right to compete. SpaceX’s cause won sympathy among some US lawmakers, who criticized ULA for its dependence on Russian-made engines used in the Atlas V rockets. The Falcon 5 explosion has cast doubt over SpaceX’s other ambition – to provide manned space launches for NASA, according to Ars Technica. The US space agency is mulling buying trips to the International Space Station from Russia in 2019, the website reporting citing industry sources. Since retiring the Space Shuttle program in 2011, NASA has had no domestic capability to fly manned space mission and has purchased trips in Russian Soyuz capsules. SpaceX and Boeing are both developing capsules that would make the US a fully space-capable nation again. Boeing has pushed back its schedule from late 2017 to early 2018, and the SpaceX disaster seems to make a similar delay inevitable. NASA planners are concerned that neither company will be able to deliver on time and are considering a Russian contingency plan. Negotiations over additional Soyuz launches would have to take place soon considering that each spaceship requires several years of planning and production time.

No one was hurt in the September 1 blast, which came as the unmanned Falcon 9 rocket was being fueled ahead of a standard, pre-launch test in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Musk is rushing to revolutionize the launch industry by making rocket components reusable. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket explodes at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on September 1, 2016 ©NASA TV (NASA TV/AFP/File) And the accident -- the second of its kind since SpaceX was founded in 2002 -- came just over a year after a Falcon 9 rocket failed after liftoff on June 28, 2015, destroying a Dragon cargo capsule bound for the International Space Station (ISS). Before that, SpaceX had logged 18 successful launches of the Falcon 9 -- including six of 12 planned supply missions to the ISS carried out as part of a $1.6 billion contract with NASA. During their investigation SpaceX officials found something suspicious they wanted to check out, the Post said, quoting three industry officials with knowledge of the episode. SpaceX had still images from video that seemed to show a shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building belonging to ULA, the Post said. ULA is a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. So a SpaceX employee visited ULA facilities at Cape Canaveral, Florida and asked for access to the roof at one ULA building that had a close line of sight to the SpaceX launch.

A preliminary investigation by SpaceX has found the hole in the cryogenic system, which cools the upper oxygen tank of the rocket, occurred just moments before the explosion and appears to have triggered a catastrophic chain of events. Exactly what caused the breach is still a mystery, the company has said.  SpaceX's founder and CEO, Elon Musk (pictured), called the failure 'the most difficult and complex' the company has ever had There has been intense speculation that an object had hit the rocket during fueling. Now, it has been revealed that SpaceX had still images from video that appeared to show an odd shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building belonging to ULA, a joint project between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the Post reported.   A source familiar with the incident told the Post that the SpaceX employee told ULA officials that the company was trying to run down all possible leads and that they aren't trying to accuse ULA of anything.  ULA denied the access to the SpaceX employee and called Air Force investigators, who inspected the roof and didn't find anything connecting it to the rocket explosion, the Post reported.  Nearly a week after the explosion, Musk asked the public to send in any video or audio of the blast so that his company could continue to investigate.  SpaceX's launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was destroyed (pictured) by the explosion. It has been revealed that SpaceX had still images from video that appeared to show an odd shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building belonging to ULA ULA (file photo) denied the access to the SpaceX employee and called Air Force investigators, who inspected the roof and didn't find anything connecting it to the rocket explosion. But SpaceX has said they have not ruled out sabotage  The company also said they haven't ruled out sabotage.  Musk wrote on Twitter that he was 'particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off'. 'May come from rocket or something else,' he added.  Earlier this week, Musk said that finding out what went wrong is the company's 'absolute top priority'. 'We've eliminated all of the obvious possibilities for what occurred there,' he said. SpaceX is leading the investigation with help from the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration. Despite the investigation, SpaceX has said it intends to return to flight as soon as November.  Read more: Implication of sabotage adds intrigue to SpaceX investigation - The Washington Post Share or comment on this article e-mail 403 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

Toggle navigation HOME SPECIAL REPORTS BUSINESS AND FINANCE ANALYSIS ARTS AND CULTURE BLOGS MULTIMEDIA Video Photos SPORTS Cameroon airline halts flights to France Irate passengers protesting outside Cameroon airline Camair-co office in Yaoundé on September 7, 2015 over flight cancellations. FILE | NATION MEDIA GROUP  NDI EUGENE NDI in Yaoundé Saturday, October 1   2016 at  13:57 comment Cameroon’s national airline Camair-Co has suspended flights to Paris. The airline has been grappling with financial and managerial crisis since it launched operations in March 2011. Reports say the firm's most profitable route is Douala-Paris, the flag-carrier’s lone intercontinental route. An extra-ordinary board meeting in Douala on Friday, agreed that the Paris route be suspended for the company to concentrate on its domestic routes. Board Chairman Mefire Oumarou said Camair-Co would focus on expansion of domestic destinations. Safety challenges He said the new routes to the northwestern and western cities of Bamenda and Bafoussam would be launched soon. Camair-Co is the successor to Cameroon Airlines, the central African country’s pioneer flag-carrier, which was dogged by losses and safety challenges. Five years later, observers say there were no indication that Camair’s successor would be profitable. Camair-Co operated three planes untill the end of last year; the aged Boeing 767-300ER named The Dja, which it inherited from Camair, and two 737-700s leased from US-based Aviation Capital Group. Serious handicap The firm later acquired two small Chinese-built MA 60 planes, which were commissioned in January, raising the company’s fleet to five. So far, the fleet has been cited as a serious handicap for the company, occasioning endemic flight cancellation, making the airline less competitive. In one embarrassing incident in September last year, angry customers stormed Camair-Co’s office in Yaoundé and threatened to torch it over frequent flights cancellations. Management hurdles Only recently, the Cameroon Civil Aviation Authority (CCAA) banned Camair-co from flying to the Europe for what it termed non-compliance with safety standards. The airline management and the Cameroon Transport Ministry, however, insisted that the ban was due to some administrative and management hurdles. The regulatory body later lifted the ban. An independent assessment by US firm Boeing Consulting revealed that Camair-Co posted $59 million loss between 2012 and 2014. The US consortium proposed a new business strategy, that government bailout Camair-co and also inject $101 million into the corporation.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Letter: NAFTA a success By Eric Samuelsen For the Deseret News Published: Oct. 1, 2016 12:05 a.m. Updated: Sept. 30, 2016 7:59 p.m. 13 Comments During Monday's debate, Donald Trump consistently interrupted Hillary Clinton, mostly to deny having said things he had, in fact, actually said. What I found more alarming were the factual errors in his policy proposals. Key to his entire message, for example, is his assertion that NAFTA had been a disaster, costing millions of American jobs. But this isn't true. Manufacturing has grown by 50 percent since NAFTA passed. NAFTA also improved Mexico's economy, which slowed illegal immigration to a trickle, thus making Trump's "big wall" proposal ludicrously unnecessary. He said that Mexico is building the largest manufacturing plant in the world. In fact, Tesla's building the largest plant, in California; second and third are a Boeing plant in Washington and a Mitsubishi plant in Illinois. He spoke of massive job losses in Ohio and Michigan, states with unemployment rates of 4.7 percent and 4.5 percent. He seems to think that China is a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It isn't, and one of the goals of the TPP is to force China to engage in fairer trade practices. He accuses China of devaluing its currency; in fact, the Chinese are doing the opposite. He said our energy policy was a disaster; energy prices have been falling for years. The entire focus of his campaign is trade policy, something he clearly knows nothing about. But we shouldn't be surprised. He doesn't seem to know anything about any area of policy. Why, again, would anyone vote for him? Eric Samuelsen Provo 13 Comments Like that? Read this.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 3 October 2016 Garuda’s US return to generate 5% of 2017 revenue MONTREAL: Garuda, Indonesia’s national carrier, expects its return to the United States next year with three flights a week to generate about 5% of the airline’s top-line passenger revenue for 2017, its chief executive said. The airline is now negotiating rights to start service from Jakarta to Los Angeles via Japan, chief executive officer Arif Wibowo said in an interview. He said that the new flights would be a “milestone” for Garuda, which reported US$3.81bil in total operating revenues in 2015. Garuda’s plans follow an August announcement by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that Indonesia’s aviation safety performance now meets international standards, allowing its carriers to fly to the United States. The FAA removed the ability of the country’s carriers to fly to the United States in 2007. Garuda is also considering a route to New York via Europe, where it flies to Amsterdam and London. “What we are aiming is to ... grab market between Indonesia and the US,” Wibowo told Reuters late Thursday on the sidelines of a United Nations aviation assembly in Montreal. “We can start from three flights per week. Eventually we are also aiming to become a daily flight.” Traffic between the United States and Indonesia is about 400,000 passengers a year, he said. Garuda is publicly traded but the Indonesian government is its largest shareholder with a 60% stake. The fast-growing carrier is in negotiations with planemaker Boeing Co and rival Airbus Group SE for at least 22 wide-body planes to replace A330s that the carrier has on an operating lease, Wibowo said. – Reuters Tags / Keywords: aviation Related Stories Swiss company RUAG to make Malaysia its regional MRO centre MAS bets on China, eyes IPO in 2019 Capt Izham Ismail named Malaysia Airlines COO Izham appointed Malaysia Airlines chief operations officer Mavcom revises airport passenger service charges You May Be Interested Ringgit, KLCI continue to fall MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Democracy means follow the Constitution, says Salleh Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away Property Related advertisement Latest News Opec moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer Wall St flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Most Viewed in Business Ringgit continues slide Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot SC appoints Gumuri as AOB executive chairman Prestariang wins RM3.5bil deal to revamp Immigration’s IT system Musa tables RM3.78bil surplus budget for Sabah Ringgit opens lower against US dollar Prince Alwaleed sees Saudi currency depeg as last resort MDEC and UOA Holdings to set up gaming hub Ringgit, KLCI continue to fall advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

(AP/Marcia Dunn) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics SpaceX Amos-6 US Air Force MIAMI, Florida – The mysterious explosion of a SpaceX rocket last month took an odd turn with a “cordial” encounter between staff of Elon Musk’s firm and fierce rival United Launch Alliance over a mysterious glow on a ULA building nearby during the blast, The Washington Post reported. The rocket carried Israel’s Amos-6 satellite, which was destroyed in the explosion. No one was hurt in the September 1 blast, which came as the unmanned Falcon 9 rocket was being fueled ahead of a standard, pre-launch test in Cape Canaveral, Florida, two days ahead of its scheduled launch. Musk is rushing to revolutionize the launch industry by making rocket components reusable. And the accident — the second of its kind since SpaceX was founded in 2002 — came just over a year after a Falcon 9 rocket failed after liftoff on June 28, 2015, destroying a Dragon cargo capsule bound for the International Space Station (ISS). The Amos-6, Israel’s largest ever satellite, and the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on which it was perched go up in flames after the rocket exploded on the launch pad during a static fire test at a launch facility at Cape Canaveral in Florida on September 1, 2016. (YouTube screen capture) Before that, SpaceX had logged 18 successful launches of the Falcon 9 — including six of 12 planned supply missions to the ISS carried out as part of a $1.6 billion contract with NASA. During their investigation SpaceX officials found something suspicious they wanted to check out, the Post said, quoting three industry officials with knowledge of the episode. SpaceX had still images from video that seemed to show a shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building belonging to ULA, the Post said. ULA is a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. So a SpaceX employee visited ULA facilities at Cape Canaveral, Florida and asked for access to the roof at one ULA building that had a close line of sight to the SpaceX launch. The visit was cordial, not accusatory. The ULA people denied access, but notified the Air Force, which inspected the roof and found nothing connected to the blast, the Post said.

One must ask, is Trump correct or do we continue to occupy the apex of the first world? Is there evidence to support Mr. Trump's claim? Let me offer exhibit A.   According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Two years after the University of Missouri closed the state’s lone hospital for treating tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, state health officials are looking at opening a new facility. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is seeking bids for a study that could provide officials with a roadmap for opening a new treatment center to replace the current process of sending patients to other states. It comes amid a nationwide increase in the number of people contracting the airborne bacterial disease that attacks the lungs. According to the request, Missouri has averaged 90 active tuberculosis cases in each of the past three years Missouri has been more fortunate than many other states in this regard. Why?  Because Missouri a series of strict laws against illegal alien encroachment, going back to 2007.  As a result Missouri has avoided many of the pitfalls -- including third-world diseases -- that are plaguing other states. But the power of the central government has grown to the point where it has managed to circumvent many of the laws put in place by the states and so the problems plaguing other states are starting to dribble in. Let's face it; tuberculosis is now a Third World disease. In the U.S. the number of cases of TB were cut in half between 1953 and 1968 due to better antibiotics and better medical care. (It is interesting to note that Operation Wetback repatriated up to 2 million trespassing aliens starting in 1954, thus helping to reduce the number of such cases.) The reduction in TB rates turned around in the mid '80s as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (which was not handled like any other infectious epidemics where authorities follow the chain of contagion and restrict the activities of the infected; AIDS was allowed to burn through the populace out of fears of stigmatizing homosexuals.) Still, rates remained low. Only now we see them rising -- and HIV is fairly under control, so that is not the cause. According to the CDC 88% of all antibiotic-resistant TB in the U.S. comes from immigrants. And that is just one infectious disease. Consider that last year we had 15 cases of bubonic plague in the U.S. Bubonic plague is clearly a third-world disease, one long absent in America. Another facet of Third Worldism is the export of raw materials rather than manufactured goods. America is now almost completely an exporter of coal, because the Federal government has used regulatory power to strangle the industry. In 2008 then President Obama famously stated: “If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that’s being emitted.” He has since gone on to crush an entire industry. Peabody Energy and Arch Coal -- the largest and second largest coal companies on Earth -- both went into bankruptcy recently. We now export raw coal because we can't use it for anything. And Lead. The Doe Run smelter -- the last in America -- closed a couple of years ago as a result of pressure from the Federal government. America now cannot smelt lead, but rather is forced to sell the raw materials to others who process it. That is third world. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump scolded Ford for moving all its small car manufacturing to foreign countries. Well, that is what they are doing. It's what happens when you are providing an unfriendly environment to manufacturing businesses. Then there is language. One of the characteristics of a third-world country is the preponderance of languages; multiple languages exemplify disunity, thus dividing the nation. Well, the U.S. is at least the fifth largest Spanish speaking country on Earth and may well be second only to Mexico with between 35 and 50 million speakers.  In fact, one in five households do not speak English at home. While this is not solely the fault of Barack Obama, the problem (and it is a problem) has clearly metastasized under Il Duce. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is calling for more spending on infrastructure, despite Obama’s trillion-dollar stimulus which supposedly funded "shovel ready jobs" and rebuilt these ailing roads and whatnot. If we can't make basic repairs to infrastructure with a trillion dollars, how do we differ from a third-world country? And violence. As I have noted, East St. Louis has levels of violence comparable to Honduras and other hellholes. We all know how many murders are occurring in Chicago, for instance, and we know of the rioting in Baltimore, in Charlotte, and in Ferguson. How does this differ from the war-torn, strife-filled third world? Well, partly there is the rule of law. Unfortunately, Mr. Obama simply ignores the rule of law when it inconveniences him, granting an amnesty to illegals despite laws duly passed by Congress, for instance. He has simply gone ahead with many things he wanted, such as military action in Libya without Congressional approval, or forcing Boeing to shut down a factory for being non-union in 2011, or giving Mexican criminals thousands of illegal weapons in Fast and Furious. What about the drone strikes killing American citizens without due process? What about his use of executive orders to release people duly imprisoned by courts of law? How about his circumventing Congress to seize land? And under Mr. Obama wealth has concentrated to just a few crony fat cats while everyone else lives hand to mouth due to underemployment. Even the liberal Huffington Post had to admit this fact. Rich oligarchs are another example of third worldism. No Third World country is complete without vote fraud to keep the ruling junta in power. Consider the fact that fraud may well be the reason Obama won re-election last time.  A nation without the rule of law is a banana republic. Banana republics are inherently third world. So Hillary and the Left may dismiss Mr. Trump's argument that America is becoming third world, but the facts belie their claims.  In the presidential debate last Monday Donald Trump warned America that she's "become a third-world country" to the guffaws and disdain of the liberals, the media (but I repeat myself) and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who later accused Trump of talking smack about the country she wants to loot, er, lead. One must ask, is Trump correct or do we continue to occupy the apex of the first world? Is there evidence to support Mr. Trump's claim? Let me offer exhibit A.   According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Two years after the University of Missouri closed the state’s lone hospital for treating tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, state health officials are looking at opening a new facility. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is seeking bids for a study that could provide officials with a roadmap for opening a new treatment center to replace the current process of sending patients to other states. It comes amid a nationwide increase in the number of people contracting the airborne bacterial disease that attacks the lungs. According to the request, Missouri has averaged 90 active tuberculosis cases in each of the past three years Missouri has been more fortunate than many other states in this regard. Why?  Because Missouri a series of strict laws against illegal alien encroachment, going back to 2007.  As a result Missouri has avoided many of the pitfalls -- including third-world diseases -- that are plaguing other states. But the power of the central government has grown to the point where it has managed to circumvent many of the laws put in place by the states and so the problems plaguing other states are starting to dribble in. Let's face it; tuberculosis is now a Third World disease. In the U.S. the number of cases of TB were cut in half between 1953 and 1968 due to better antibiotics and better medical care. (It is interesting to note that Operation Wetback repatriated up to 2 million trespassing aliens starting in 1954, thus helping to reduce the number of such cases.) The reduction in TB rates turned around in the mid '80s as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (which was not handled like any other infectious epidemics where authorities follow the chain of contagion and restrict the activities of the infected; AIDS was allowed to burn through the populace out of fears of stigmatizing homosexuals.) Still, rates remained low. Only now we see them rising -- and HIV is fairly under control, so that is not the cause. According to the CDC 88% of all antibiotic-resistant TB in the U.S. comes from immigrants. And that is just one infectious disease. Consider that last year we had 15 cases of bubonic plague in the U.S. Bubonic plague is clearly a third-world disease, one long absent in America. Another facet of Third Worldism is the export of raw materials rather than manufactured goods. America is now almost completely an exporter of coal, because the Federal government has used regulatory power to strangle the industry. In 2008 then President Obama famously stated: “If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that’s being emitted.” He has since gone on to crush an entire industry. Peabody Energy and Arch Coal -- the largest and second largest coal companies on Earth -- both went into bankruptcy recently. We now export raw coal because we can't use it for anything. And Lead. The Doe Run smelter -- the last in America -- closed a couple of years ago as a result of pressure from the Federal government. America now cannot smelt lead, but rather is forced to sell the raw materials to others who process it. That is third world. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump scolded Ford for moving all its small car manufacturing to foreign countries. Well, that is what they are doing. It's what happens when you are providing an unfriendly environment to manufacturing businesses. Then there is language. One of the characteristics of a third-world country is the preponderance of languages; multiple languages exemplify disunity, thus dividing the nation. Well, the U.S. is at least the fifth largest Spanish speaking country on Earth and may well be second only to Mexico with between 35 and 50 million speakers.  In fact, one in five households do not speak English at home. While this is not solely the fault of Barack Obama, the problem (and it is a problem) has clearly metastasized under Il Duce. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is calling for more spending on infrastructure, despite Obama’s trillion-dollar stimulus which supposedly funded "shovel ready jobs" and rebuilt these ailing roads and whatnot. If we can't make basic repairs to infrastructure with a trillion dollars, how do we differ from a third-world country? And violence. As I have noted, East St. Louis has levels of violence comparable to Honduras and other hellholes. We all know how many murders are occurring in Chicago, for instance, and we know of the rioting in Baltimore, in Charlotte, and in Ferguson. How does this differ from the war-torn, strife-filled third world? Well, partly there is the rule of law. Unfortunately, Mr. Obama simply ignores the rule of law when it inconveniences him, granting an amnesty to illegals despite laws duly passed by Congress, for instance. He has simply gone ahead with many things he wanted, such as military action in Libya without Congressional approval, or forcing Boeing to shut down a factory for being non-union in 2011, or giving Mexican criminals thousands of illegal weapons in Fast and Furious. What about the drone strikes killing American citizens without due process? What about his use of executive orders to release people duly imprisoned by courts of law? How about his circumventing Congress to seize land? And under Mr. Obama wealth has concentrated to just a few crony fat cats while everyone else lives hand to mouth due to underemployment. Even the liberal Huffington Post had to admit this fact. Rich oligarchs are another example of third worldism. No Third World country is complete without vote fraud to keep the ruling junta in power. Consider the fact that fraud may well be the reason Obama won re-election last time.  A nation without the rule of law is a banana republic. Banana republics are inherently third world. So Hillary and the Left may dismiss Mr. Trump's argument that America is becoming third world, but the facts belie their claims.  Share |  Twitter |  Facebook | Comments | Print |  Email FOLLOW US ON About Us | Contact | Privacy Policy | RSS Syndication © American Thinker 2016

(Photo courtesy E. Johnson/flickr) By Cole Lauterbach SPRINGFIELD – They’re from Texas — and they’re coming for your job. A delegation of business advocates and corporate executives took to the streets of Chicago and the surrounding suburbs last week to lure Illinois businesses to the Lone Star State. They’re looking to capitalize on Illinois’ stagnant job growth and reputedly unfriendly business environment to convince the state’s job creators to pack up and move to Texas. Texas Economic Development Corporation President Tracye McDaniel led the charge. McDaniel said that in addition to low workers’ compensation insurance costs for businesses and no state income tax, Texas’ worker-freedom laws have a special appeal to Illinois businesses. “Texas stands top on the list as a right-to-work state,” McDaniel said. “It’s a major consideration for site selectors, C-level executives and decision makers from across the country.” McDaniel said the biggest key to luring businesses from all over the world to Texas is to listen to the voices of their own job creators and create policies that will let them prosper. “Our main advantage is for our corporate executives at the table with us designing our business-development strategies,” McDaniel said. If the latest IRS data says anything, it’s that McDaniel is succeeding. Recent IRS records showed that more than 10,000 people recently moved from Illinois to Texas, with net migration gains from 46 other states as well. McDaniel said a number of Illinois businesses already have one foot in her state, citing aviation giant Boeing, sporting-goods company Wilson and manufacturer W.W. Grainger as Illinois companies with operations in Texas. Bloomington-based State Farm has also expanded operations into Texas. McDaniel wouldn’t say whether Texas lured away any businesses this week, but did say it was a productive trip to Illinois.

"The last thing we need are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear armed," Clinton said at a fundraiser in February, as quoted by The Hill newspaper. She added that new nuclear arms race was a very threatening scenario, according to the political daily. The United States is modernizing its nuclear Triad with particular emphasis on US Air Force needs. In October 2015, Northrop Grumman, a US global aerospace and defense technology company, was awarded a development contract to build the next generation B-21 strategic bomber, while Lockheed Martin and Boeing said they planned to submit proposals to develop the new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System (ICBM), now called the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). ...

This only means the Clinton campaign knows she will lose if something doesn't change. She really is a terrifying woman. They are trying to soften her image and lie about Trump being more of a risk. There's no question that Hillary Clinton is a hostile person and her staff knows it better than anyone. the wording of the headline is interesting. Candidate Clinton as opposed to what she would do as POTUS Clinton.

CP is the real deal. Everyone needs to remember who was behind these ruthless war crimes. This was more or less the introduction to endless wars of NATO's plans for the 21st century. The 20 year anniversary will be in about 2 1/2 years. The article in the link is by people who lived it and have to endure the effects. They're the people that Hillary Clinton sees as expendable. If the anti-war movement that exists is looking for an anti-war candidate, Clinton surely is not the right choice. Reply jas 16:22 01.10.2016 | 1 | Edit | Delete Clinton likes to mention her experience. Major parts of that experience are the Yugoslavia destruction (war crime), NAFTA (big business destroying smaller business), Iraq, Libya and Syria (chaos and terror in the Middle East). Also, there's Benghazi, where one of the men in the world who really knew the truth about Libya was killed. Like most psychopaths, she's progressing in the intensity of her participation. I have no doubt that she will start a nuclear war if elected. It's about the only line she hasn't crossed yet.
