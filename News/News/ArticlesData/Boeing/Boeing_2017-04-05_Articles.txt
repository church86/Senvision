(Reuters) A hybrid electric aircraft startup founded by an Indian-origin entrepreneur has received investments from aerospace giants — Boeing and JetBlue owing to its goal to develop alternative propulsion aircraft. Zunum Aero, founded by Ashish Kumar three years ago in Kirkland, Washington is working to develop a an electric hybrid aircraft with potential for performance and efficiency improvements in a range of aerospace applications. “I consider us very fortunate to have backers like JetBlue and Boeing,” Kumar told the Business Insider. “We have been engaged with both companies for about a year, and both are as passionate as we are in this opportunity to reinvent regional air travel,” Kumar said. The startup intends to use the financing to further develop its proposed regional aircrafts that hold 10 to 50 passengers for flights up to 1,000 miles. The jets primarily operate on battery power with an aviation diesel or turbine range-extending power generator available as backup, a report in Fortune said. Boeing said it made the investments in the startup through the ventures arm of a new group called ‘Boeing HorizonX’, an innovation cell focused on accelerating potentially transformative aerospace technologies, manufacturing innovations and emerging business models. Boeing HorizonX is partnering with JetBlue Technology Ventures to invest in Zunum Aero. “At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted, and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,” it said in a statement. Also Watch: “As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilised airports and reinvent regional travel,” JetBlue said. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX vice president Steve Nordlund said Zunum’s hybrid electric technology was leading the way in the up-and-coming segment, according to the Business Insider report. According to his profile on Zunum Aero website, Kumar has held leadership roles in Microsoft, Google, Dell, and McKinsey. His startup experience includes helping the launch Aeroxchange, now the largest electronic marketplace for the aviation industry. He has a PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the Cornell University.

As long as oil prices don’t go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines <SIAL.SI> in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. “These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes,” Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. “You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility.” For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas’ international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specialising in transport at the University of Sydney’s business school. “It’s something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas,” he said. FUELLING DOUBTS Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modelling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours – a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. “In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices,” said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. “If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic.” He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. HEADWINDS Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines’ configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Boeing’s 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. “We think our airplane has the legs and the capability,” said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. “If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology.” Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane’s range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don’t have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. BEST PRICING Qantas’ Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. “It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn’t do a competition at the right time,” Joyce said. “That gets you the best pricing and … the most capable aircraft.” Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. “The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe,” Joyce said. “(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs.” (Reporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Ian Geoghegan) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around £42 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Alan Joyce, Qantas's CEO, told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility." The Sydney Opera House Credit: Reuters For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specialising in transport at the University of Sydney's business school. "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," he said. How to | Pass the time on a 17-hour flight Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modelling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. "In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices," said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. "If they stay at $50 (£30) a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic." He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. Top 10 | The world’s longest flights Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Watch | Timelapse video shows super-fast construction of a BA 787-9 Dreamliner 03:59 Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. "We think our airplane has the legs and the capability," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. "If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology." Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. The most influential airliners of all time Qantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. "It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time," Joyce said. "That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft." Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. "The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe," Joyce said. "(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs."

The planes, which will have 10 to 50 seats, are scheduled for launch in the early 2020s. Zunum is three years into development. With its regional aircraft, Zunum aims to democratize access to fast, affordable travel over distances of 700 miles at launch, to more than 1,000 miles by 2030. Among the many advantages hybrid aircraft will offer, according to Zunum, are the following: Decrease door-to-door travel times on busy corridors by 40 percent and cut travel time on less-trafficked corridors by 80 percent; Sharply reduce operating costs, enabling ticket prices 40-80 percent below current fares; Cut emissions by 80 percent, falling to zero over time as battery densities improve; and Cut community noise 75 percent, enabling all-hours access to smaller airports. Zunum's Dream Zunum is developing technologies to create a regional electric air network that will offer an affordable alternative to highways and high-speed rail. It will operate both as a point-to-point service and as a feeder to hub airports. The company has a long-term partnership with the Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems, an NSF-sponsored research center at the University of Illinois. It also works with a network of collaborators across leading universities and government labs. Zunum has been working with the United States Federal Aviation Authority since 2014 to drive development of certification standards for electric aircraft, a complete set of which is expected by 2018. The first electrics are likely to become certified in 2020. Deconstructing Zunum's Vision "This is interesting but ... let's face it, Lithium-ion batteries do not have the best record on commercial airlines," remarked Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Further, Li-Ion battery cells have to be encased in liquid for safety, which "makes them very heavy and inefficient for aircraft," he told TechNewsWorld. What's needed are batteries "with the energy capacity of a Li-ion that don't have the thermal runaway characteristics," McGregor suggested. Still, "I like the idea of migrating to hybrid planes and I think the smaller regional planes are a good fit for regional airports not served by the larger airlines," he continued. "Zunum's financial backers, Boeing and JetBlue, could make this a reality." Boeing on Wednesday launched HorizonX to invest in early-stage technology companies. Cutting Into the Airline Industry If its plans succeed, Zunum could be a disruptive influence in the airline industry. "Think of the impact Tesla's having on the auto industry," McGregor pointed out. "The same could happen to aircraft." Zunum "will also likely disrupt buses, passenger trains and even some shared ride and taxi car services," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "You could have a fleet of these planes instead of buses transport company employees and turn some of the parking lots into short airfields," he told TechNewsWorld. "Google seems to have anticipated this with their Moffett Field location in Silicon Valley." However, "some place like Dubai, South Korea or China will likely do this in production first," Enderle predicted, "largely because these countries are typically far more aggressive with technology and transportation." The Rush to Electric Hybrid Planes Interest in electric plane development has been increasing in recent years. NASA Langley researchers successfully flew a 10-engine electric plane in 2015. Aurora Flight Sciences and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, are working on the XV-24A LightningStrike VTOL experimental plane. Zee Aero is working on its own electric hybrid aircraft. Airbus is working on a hybrid commercial plane through its E-Fan project. In November, aerospace engineers and designers meet in Cologne, Germany, at the Electric & Hybrid Aerospace Technology Symposium 2017.

Zunum has been working with the United States Federal Aviation Authority since 2014 to drive development of certification standards for electric aircraft, a complete set of which is expected by 2018. The first electrics are likely to become certified in 2020. Deconstructing Zunum's Vision "This is interesting but ... let's face it, Lithium-ion batteries do not have the best record on commercial airlines," remarked Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Further, Li-Ion battery cells have to be encased in liquid for safety, which "makes them very heavy and inefficient for aircraft," he told TechNewsWorld. What's needed are batteries "with the energy capacity of a Li-ion that don't have the thermal runaway characteristics," McGregor suggested. Still, "I like the idea of migrating to hybrid planes and I think the smaller regional planes are a good fit for regional airports not served by the larger airlines," he continued. "Zunum's financial backers, Boeing and JetBlue, could make this a reality." Boeing on Wednesday launched HorizonX to invest in early-stage technology companies. Cutting Into the Airline Industry If its plans succeed, Zunum could be a disruptive influence in the airline industry. "Think of the impact Tesla's having on the auto industry," McGregor pointed out. "The same could happen to aircraft." Zunum "will also likely disrupt buses, passenger trains and even some shared ride and taxi car services," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "You could have a fleet of these planes instead of buses transport company employees and turn some of the parking lots into short airfields," he told TechNewsWorld. "Google seems to have anticipated this with their Moffett Field location in Silicon Valley." However, "some place like Dubai, South Korea or China will likely do this in production first," Enderle predicted, "largely because these countries are typically far more aggressive with technology and transportation." The Rush to Electric Hybrid Planes Interest in electric plane development has been increasing in recent years. NASA Langley researchers successfully flew a 10-engine electric plane in 2015. Aurora Flight Sciences and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, are working on the XV-24A LightningStrike VTOL experimental plane. Zee Aero is working on its own electric hybrid aircraft. Airbus is working on a hybrid commercial plane through its E-Fan project. In November, aerospace engineers and designers meet in Cologne, Germany, at the Electric & Hybrid Aerospace Technology Symposium 2017.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:10 AM, April 6, 2017 Updated: 6:45 AM, April 6, 2017 SYDNEY - Both Airbus <AIR.PA> and Boeing <BA.N> now offer aircraft that appear capable of flying non-stop commercial flights from Sydney to London - the "Holy Grail" for Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd <QAN.AX>. As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines <SIAL.SI> in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility." For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travelers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specializing in transport at the University of Sydney's business school. "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," he said. FUELLING DOUBTS Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modeling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. "In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices," said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. "If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic." He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. HEADWINDS Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. "We think our airplane has the legs and the capability," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. "If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology." Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. BEST PRICING Qantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. "It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time," Joyce said. "That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft." Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalize the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. "The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe," Joyce said. "(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs."

As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable, and could be on schedules within five years, aviation experts say. Airbus has increased the range of its A350-900ULR to 9,700 nautical miles (17,960 kms) from the 8,700 nautical miles announced when it sold the plane to Singapore Airlines in 2015 for delivery next year, a spokesman told Reuters. Including headwinds, the Sydney-London flight is equivalent to 9,600 nautical miles. "These aircraft, we think, are potentially real goers on these routes," Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told Reuters of the A350-900ULR and the bigger but less advanced Boeing 777-8. "You know from what they have done on other aircraft that Sydney-London and Melbourne-London has real possibility." For Qantas, a non-stop Sydney-London route that cuts three hours off the flight time would allow it to charge a premium and differentiate its product from the around two dozen other airlines plying the so-called Kangaroo route with stop-offs in Singapore, Dubai and Hong Kong. The route accounts for only 13 percent of Qantas' international capacity, but carries the prestige QF1 flight number and is important to its global brand. Qantas could charge around a 20 percent price premium for a non-stop Sydney-London flight as it would attract business and premium leisure travellers wanting to complete the trip as fast as possible, said Rico Merkert, a professor specialising in transport at the University of Sydney's business school. "It's something that can be presented as a unique selling point for Qantas," he said. FUELLING DOUBTS Qantas begins non-stop flights from Perth to London next year, using the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. For this scheduled flight, the Dreamliner will have fewer seats than usual, will use the most advanced flight path modelling methods, and will reduce the weight in areas seemingly as minor as the dishes and forks. The Perth flight will take 17 hours - a far cry from the four days and seven stops it took when Qantas created the Kangaroo Route to London in 1947. Qantas can offset the higher cost of carrying more fuel to complete the flight by saving on stopover costs, such as airport charges, ground handling, taxes, crew hotel rooms and lounge usage. "In terms of economics, much depends on fuel prices," said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. "If they stay at $50 a barrel or less, it should be possible to keep costs reasonable. But as fuel goes up, the disadvantages of flying a very heavy plane begin to make ultra-long haul problematic." He said the flight should remain economic at prices below around $70 a barrel, though Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the actual level could be far higher as one-stop rivals would also be squeezed by higher oil prices. Singapore Airlines ended its New York and Los Angeles flights using the four-engined A340-500 in 2013 when oil prices topped $107 a barrel. The carrier is now waiting for delivery of the far more fuel-efficient twin-engined A350-900ULR next year. HEADWINDS Qantas is pushing the planemakers hard on a stretch goal of completing the Sydney-London flight with 300 seats to give it the highest possible revenue and fleet flexibility. However, Fehrm said the aircraft would likely fall short of that goal if Qantas wanted to avoid a fuel stop on the westbound leg when headwinds are strongest. If such stopovers became frequent enough, Qantas would lose its ability to charge a premium on the route. Two aviation industry sources said the Airbus A350-900ULR would fit more than 250 passengers on the Sydney-London route, up from the 170 mainly business-class seats on Singapore Airlines' configuration for flights to New York and Los Angeles. Boeing's 777-8, due to enter service early in the next decade, could carry around 280 passengers on the westbound leg of the Sydney-London flight, the sources said. The sources declined to be named because the configuration details are not finalised. Airbus and Boeing declined to comment specifically on the seat count. "We think our airplane has the legs and the capability," said Dinesh Keskar, Boeing Senior Vice President Sales Asia-Pacific and India. "If the 787-9 can do Perth-London, we think that when the 777-8 comes out in the 2021 timeframe we will have a lot more improvement in technology." Airbus, Boeing and engine manufacturers are constantly investing to reduce fuel usage, extending a plane's range and its ability to perform in hot conditions like the Middle East. That means the planemakers don't have to invest specifically for any Qantas order, the size of which is still unclear. Pushing the seat count towards 300 would also give Qantas the flexibility to use these aircraft on other long routes, such as a mooted Sydney-New York flight, as it looks to replace six ageing 747-400ER planes and eventually its fleet of 12 A380s. BEST PRICING Qantas' Joyce has raised publicly the possibility of ordering the 777-8 for ultra-long haul flights for the last two years, but the A350-900ULR has entered the equation more recently. "It has added competition, and we would be crazy if we didn't do a competition at the right time," Joyce said. "That gets you the best pricing and ... the most capable aircraft." Qantas has yet to launch a formal tender process for the prestige order, as it waits for Boeing to finalise the specifications on the 777-8. But the first Sydney-London flights are possible around 2022, Joyce said. "The Kangaroo route is probably the most competitive on the globe," Joyce said. "(Flying non-stop) takes us off this superhighway of very competitive conditions of capacity which is priced, in many cases, under costs."

The Chicago-based defense and aerospace company says the latest production model of F/A-18s improves upon previous versions of the F-18 in a multitude of ways. The jets carry more fuel, a greater payload, and feature new stealth sensors for China’s J-20 stealth fighter and Russia’s PAK-FA. © AP Photo/ Ross D. Franklin Too Big to Fail? Pentagon Pours Another $100M Into F-35 Fighter's Repairs The original contract for all three variants awarded to Lockheed gave the company exclusive right to sell F-35s as a winner-take-all type deal. But since US President Donald Trump berated the F-35 and asked Boeing to price out a Super Hornet, Boeing may find a way to sell more F-18s to the Pentagon. The company is confident a “general acceptance” exists among procurement officials to buy several hundred Block III F/A-18 for carrier wings instead of Lockheed’s F-35C, a Boeing vice president told the National Interest on Tuesday. On April 1, Sputnik reported that a document had been circulating in Washington touting the F/A-18s ability to fill “significant capabilities gaps” left behind by the F-35. The F/A-18s would be an “affordable solution to the inventory challenge” currently staring down the Navy, Boeing’s lobbyists contended in the white paper passed around Capitol Hill. The Navy initially agreed to buy 2,158 F-35s over the program’s lifetime. Buying F/A-18 and F-16s instead of F-35s saves $48 billion over a 10-year period, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis from October 2014. © Flickr/ Lockheed Martin F-35 War Games: Beleaguered Fighter Jet Commands Skies with 15:1 Kill Ratio As the competition between Lockheed and Boeing intensifies over who will supply the US Navy with its future carrier fleet, Boeing argues its newly unveiled Block III F-18s have better range and payload capacity, despite lacking the F-35’s stealth characteristics. One feature on which Boeing is trying to sell officials is that flying with other F-35s requires less stealthiness for other aircraft in the fleet. At the Red Flag battle simulation held at Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas, officials noted that the F-35’s scouting ability comprised one of its most valuable features. Once the joint strike fighter shot all its munitions, it hovered around the area to identify multiple threats at once. This allowed F-22s and other legacy fighters to clean up the rest. ...

Was to replace another YAK VTOL that was successfully used. Then they decided to cramp it with all modern electronics and stealth. Thing began to fail. About capabilities of T50, really? How BOEING knows this? When ALL sensors etc , most are still under developments for the T50? They NOT even defined. BUT Russia should had SHUT UP!!! Boeing is in Russia spying, brain draining etc. ONLY and IDIOT SAVANT would believe, WASHINGTON, would allow BOEING to dev and sell technologies in Russia. TRUMP wants them ONLY in U.S. GET THAT?

Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O. Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's GE.N venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX. "These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies," he said. Upskill's software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters. "Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual," Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production.   Continued...

The question is what will replace the orbiting space laboratory? On Tuesday, just a week after NASA announced plans to develop a “deep space gateway” in the vicinity of the moon in collaboration with commercial and international partners, one of the space agency’s partners has unveiled concepts for such an outpost. In a statement accompanying the concept images for the deep space gateway — which would serve as a waypoint for crewed Mars missions — and transport vehicle, which would ferry humans to the red planet and beyond, Boeing said that the systems would "help achieve NASA’s goal of having robust human space exploration from the Moon to Mars." View photos BoeingDeepSpaceGateway-high-resMore A concept image showing Boeing's Deep Space Gateway. Photo: Boeing Although the images are far from detailed, there are a few key things that Boeing has made clear — one, that the habitat would be delivered to cislunar space by NASA’s Space Launch System (a rocket that, once operational, would be the most powerful one ever built); and two, both the deep space gateway and the transport vehicle would be powered by Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) systems. View photos BoeingDeepSpaceTransitVehicleonApproach-high-resMore A concept image of Boeing's Deep Space Transit Vehicle. Photo: Boeing An SEP system utilizes both, solar cells and an ion drive. An array of solar cells converts collected solar energy to electrical power, which is used to ionize atoms of a propellant such as xenon, that are then expelled to produce thrust. This technology, which was used in NASA’s Dawn spacecraft, has the potential to significantly reduce cost of deep space missions by reducing the launch weight of spacecraft. “The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division, said in the statement. The SLS, a successor to NASA's now-defunct Space Shuttle program that is expected to be ready by launch by 2018, is crucial for realizing NASA’s deep-space exploration ambitions — including crewed missions to Mars. The SLS’ engines will be the same that powered the Space Shuttle program. These engines have been used during 135 space shuttle missions between 1981 and 2011, and four of them, providing a combined thrust of 2 million pounds, will be used to power the rocket.

Like us on Facebook. Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now West Plano's $3 billion Legacy West development has landed another big name business. Boeing will locate the headquarters for its newly formed global services division in the 250-acre mixed-use project at the Dallas North Tollway and State Highway 121. The aerospace giant will join Toyota, JPMorgan Chase, Liberty Mutual Insurance and FedEx with offices in the new development. Boeing will occupy office space in the Legacy Urban Village - a development of shops, apartments, restaurants and office space at the northwest corner of the tollway and Legacy Drive. The aircraft firm announced in December that it was setting up the new global services business unit to expand its revenues from servicing aircraft and related businesses. Boeing currently has only about a 7 percent share of the global commercial and defense services market, which is expected to be valued at close to $2.5 trillion over the next decade, according to industry estimates. The company has said it hopes to triple the revenue from its global services unit - which has 20,000 employees around the world - to nearly $50 billion over the next five years.  The new Plano office will be the headquarters for that division. The Chicago-based aircraft maker plans to have the new division up and running with a few dozen professionals by later this year. Boeing said it picked the Plano location because of its central, strategic location. "We have a fixed focus on serving our customers worldwide, and this location assists in our mission of providing uncompromising service worldwide," division president Stan Deal said in a statement. The company said the Plano office will be well suited to serve Boeing's major "commercial customers and defense partners, and serves as a transportation hub that will allow the company to reach customers quickly and efficiently." The new division will provide training, supply chain management, aircraft modernization and data optimization for its customers. Global Services includes two Boeing companies that already have a significant presence in North Texas - Aviall and Jeppesen. "Texas continues to be a global powerhouse in business expansion and relocation because of our economic policies that encourage industry leaders, like Boeing, to expand their operations here," Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement. The new Plano-based division is Boeing's third major business unit, along with commercial aircraft and defense. Luring the aerospace firm's division is another huge win for Legacy West, which started construction in early 2014 and will be mostly finished by the end of this year. The project is being developed by Karahan Cos., developer KDC and Columbus Realty Partners. Boeing will be located in the same building where Toyota is housing its high-tech Toyota Connected division headquarters. The company is taking the top floor of the office and retail building. "It doesn't get any better than Boeing," said Legacy West developer Fehmi Karahan. "It's such an iconic American name. "Having one of their division headquarters to move to us is extremely prestigious and makes a huge statement." Landing the new Boeing headquarters is even more poignant for North Texas. In 2001 the Dallas area was one of the finalists for Boeing's headquarters move from Seattle. After looking at potential locations in downtown Dallas and in Las Colinas, Boeing offices decided to move to Chicago was more to their liking.  The loss of the high-profile corporation hit hard in Dallas' boardrooms and political arena and spurred the revitalization of downtown. Boeing is locating its new office in the Legacy West Urban Village which is at the Dallas North Tollway and Legacy Drive.  Karahan Cos. Boeing's new global services division provides a variety of services.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Boeing Selects Plano, Texas, Site for Global Services Headquarters Operations set to begin in July PLANO, Texas, April 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] has selected a site in Plano, Texas, for the headquarters of its new Global Services business unit, which will be operational in July. Boeing Global Services headquarters will be located in the Legacy West mixed- use development in West Plano. Global Services President and CEO Stan Deal, several of his leadership team members and some support staff will be located at the site, which will serve as a central hub for approximately 20,000 employees located around the globe. "Texas continues to be a global powerhouse in business expansion and relocation because of our economic policies that encourage industry leaders, like Boeing, to expand their operations here," said Texas Governor Greg Abbott. "As governor, I will continue to promote a low-tax and reasonable regulatory environment that removes barriers to entry and provides certainty for developing industries. I am proud to welcome Boeing's new Global Services unit to Texas and look forward to working with them further to continue their expansion in the Lone Star State." Boeing selected the greater Dallas area because it's centrally located within Boeing's U.S. footprint, has good proximity to major operations for commercial customers and defense partners, and serves as a transportation hub that will allow the company to reach customers quickly and efficiently. "We are excited to establish the Global Services headquarters in Plano," said Deal. "We have a fixed focus on serving our customers worldwide, and this location assists in our mission of providing uncompromising service worldwide." Boeing will host an opening ceremony at the new location once Boeing Global Services is operational in July.

By Alistair Charlton April 5, 2017 17:03 BST Zunum Aero promises to massively cut the cost of air travel with hybrid-electric planesZunum Aero A hybrid-electric aeroplane startup with financial backing from Boeing is gearing up to take us into a new 'golden age' of aviation, cutting travel times by 40% and fares by up to 80%. Coming out of stealth mode on 5 April, Washington-based Zunum Aero believes it can transform the regional and short-haul airline industries by building small electric planes to shuttle passengers between local airports, avoiding international hubs and their high landing fees and passenger queuing times. Zunum Aero, which also has backing from US airline JetBlue, hopes to have created an electric-hybrid airplane for carrying 10 passengers up to 700 miles by the early 2020s, before expanding to produce 50-seat aircraft with a range of over 1,000 miles by 2030. As well as dramatically reducing running costs by replacing jet fuel with electricity, the company hopes to decrease door-to-door travel time by flying between some of the US's 5,000 "underutilised" regional airports. The company says its plans will "pave the way to a golden era of fast and affordable electric air travel." Chief executive and founder Ashish Kumar said: "The shift of the industry to large aircraft and long ranges driven by gas turbines has concentrated almost all air traffic to just 2% of our airports, creating a massive transport gap over regional distances where there is no high-speed alternative. As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago." Kumar describes hybrid propulsion as "an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-size aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners." In a press release, the company explained: "Designing aircraft for walk-on, walk-off travel from nearby airports addresses the major pain points of modern air transit while filling a vast regional transport gap. "For example, passengers can expect to travel from regional airports in the Boston area to Washington, DC for half the fare and in half the time it takes today door-to-door. For those on the West Coast, Silicon Valley to the LA area drops to two and a half hours door-to-door, from over five hours today." Ticket prices to fall by 80% Zunum Aero, which has been operating below the radar for three years, believes it can reduce the door-to-door journey time in "busy corridors" by 40%, and by as much as 80% in areas with less air traffic. Lower operating costs could see fares fall by between 40% and 80%, the company claims, while emissions will tumble by 80% initially, then "drop to zero over time as battery densities improve". The company also promises a 75% drop in local noise pollution, allowing for open-all-hours access at smaller airports. "Boeing HorizonX is investing in Zunum because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space. This technology and customer approach has the potential to transform the market for small, short-haul aircraft that can use smaller regional airports," said Steve Nordlund, Vice President, Boeing HorizonX. "At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted and we seek new technologies that look to change the game," said Bonny Simi, President, JetBlue Technology Ventures. "As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally-friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilised airports and reinvent regional travel."

But the current U.S. sanctions regime will make it very hard for Boeing to finalize any deals in Iran. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Apr 5, 2017 at 11:40AM For more than a year, Boeing (NYSE:BA) has been trying to break into the newly opened Iranian aircraft market. However, still-strong tensions between the U.S. and Iran have hindered the company's efforts to take advantage of strong demand for new planes in Iran. On Tuesday, Boeing announced its second memorandum of agreement with an Iranian airline. But unless the U.S. government moves toward reconciliation with Iran, Boeing's agreements with Iranian carriers may never turn into firm orders. The Iranian market awaits Worldwide, aircraft order activity is slowing after a multiyear order spree that began in 2011. As a result, Boeing and Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) have been fighting hard to make every sale they can in order to meet their ambitious production goals. Global aircraft order activity is slowing after years of strong sales. Image source: Airbus. The two companies got a huge break in early 2016 as the world powers began to lift economic sanctions on Iran. Decades of sanctions have left Iran's airlines with obsolete, decrepit fleets, which they are eager to refresh with modern, fuel-efficient jets from Boeing and Airbus. Airbus very quickly reached an agreement to sell 118 planes spanning its full product lineup to Iranian flag carrier Iran Air. Airbus and Iran Air eventually finalized an order for 100 aircraft in December 2016, and Iran Air took delivery of its first new plane -- an Airbus A321 -- just one month later. Iranian airlines seem to be equally interested in Boeing airplanes. However, so far, Boeing is having trouble closing any deals due to political and regulatory hurdles. Boeing tries to do business in Iran Last June, Boeing signed a memorandum of agreement to sell 80 airplanes to Iran Air. While the total size of the deal was smaller than Iran Air's Airbus order, it included 30 orders for Boeing's highly profitable 777 family -- a product line that recently has been plagued by slow sales. Boeing announced in December that it had reached a contract with Iran Air for this order. However, the order still hasn't shown up in Boeing's official order book, indicating that some "contingencies" still need to be resolved. Iranian airlines are ready to buy dozens of Boeing planes -- if they can line up financing. Image source: Boeing. Chief among these problems is the difficulty of arranging financing. While the U.S. has eased its economic sanctions on Iran, its financial sanctions remain intact. The U.S. banking system cannot be used for any deals with Iran. Even foreign banks have been worried that they would run afoul of the U.S. financial sanctions if they try to do business there. Thus, Boeing's recent announcement that Iran Aseman Airlines plans to purchase 30 737 MAXs is not especially meaningful. Unless the financing issues can be worked out, these planes will never be delivered. The "good" news is that the first delivery for this order is scheduled for 2022, giving Boeing and the airline plenty of time to try to line up financing. Victim of bad public policy Airbus has been able to get around the problem of financing aircraft sales -- albeit with difficulty -- by conducting the transactions in euros. Boeing doesn't have that luxury, putting it at a competitive disadvantage. To be blunt, Boeing is the victim of terrible public policy in the U.S. Congress, which has made it very difficult for U.S. companies to do business with Iran, and many congressional Republicans want to crack down even further on trade with Iran. Boeing's deals with Iran have aroused particularly vehement opposition from lawmakers who claim that planes sold to Iran could be used for military or terrorist purposes. Leaving aside the merits of this argument, Iran is now getting new planes from Airbus that are functionally equivalent to Boeing planes. The only thing the U.S. financial sanctions are doing in this case is pushing Iranian airlines to buy from Airbus rather than Boeing. This could have very real consequences in terms of job losses. Iran Air wants to buy 777s that Boeing desperately needs to sell. If the two companies are unable to find a way around U.S. financial sanctions, Boeing will probably have to reduce 777 production further, and cut even more jobs in the next year or two. Hopefully, cooler heads will prevail and Congress will eventually dismantle the sanctions, which are doing very little other than encouraging Iran to buy other countries' products. But given the long-running history of enmity between the U.S. and Iran, investors shouldn't count on Boeing delivering planes to Iranian airlines anytime soon.

Carlton Everhart said in an interview about his meeting with Trump, who was president-elect at the time. Trump traveled in his own Boeing 757 when he ran for president, and he once operated an airline providing shuttle service on the East Coast. Trump met with military leaders including Everhart at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida after tweeting earlier that month: “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” But Trump didn’t realize the $4 billion wasn’t just the cost for two modified 747-8 passenger planes built by Boeing, Everhart recounted in the interview Tuesday at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters.

Everhart said he told Trump a four-engine aircraft was needed because “I’ve got to support your role as commander-in-chief.” He said he told the president-elect that “this is an alternate flying White House” that has to support continuity of government operations “no matter what happens,” including during an attack on the U.S. The general said the requirements for the presidential aircraft are set by the White House Military Office. A lot of time and money have been spent reviewing those, Everhart said. Trump also asked, “Why can’t I go to another vendor?” While the Air Force found Boeing was the only U.S. aircraft manufacturer able to provide the planes, Everhart said Trump was “thinking business in his head” because “he wanted to come from a position of negotiations to try and get the price down.” Trump has a history as a shrewd buyer of second-hand aircraft that he retrofits to his gold-plated standards. In fact, the Boeing 757 that ferried him on the campaign trail was a hand-me-down from billionaire Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The hourly shuttle service, which he purchased from the failing Eastern Airlines in 1988, was less successful, lasting just four years. After meeting Everhart, Trump decided to bring in Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and “‘talk to him about this pricing,'” the general recalled. In February, Trump claimed he negotiated $1 billion in savings, an assertion that the service said at the time it couldn’t verify. “They were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One,” Trump said at a rally on in Florida that month. “Can you believe this?” Advertisement Continue reading Instead, Trump said, “we got that price down by over $1 billion, and I probably haven’t spoken, to be honest with you, for more than an hour on the project.

The price is still too high.” The Government Accountability Office estimated in a report last week that the program will cost $3 billion, based on the Air Force’s latest estimates independent of Trump’s efforts.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) General: Trump asked ‘lots of questions’ on Air Force One Wed Apr 5th, 2017 9:44am Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Tony Capaccio / Bloomberg Donald Trump asked “a lot of questions” that showed his general knowledge about aviation issues when he grilled the Air Force’s mobility chief in December about what he considered an overpriced new Air Force One, the four-star general said. “He’s an aviation enthusiast,” Gen. Carlton Everhart said in an interview about his meeting with Trump, who was president-elect at the time. Trump traveled in his own Boeing 757 when he ran for president, and he once operated an airline providing shuttle service on the East Coast. Trump met with military leaders including Everhart at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida after tweeting earlier that month: “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” But Trump didn’t realize the $4 billion wasn’t just the cost for two modified 747-8 passenger planes built by Boeing, Everhart recounted in the interview Tuesday at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. It also includes the modifications needed to outfit it with advanced security and communications systems and funds to pay for decades of operations and support. “I said, ‘Sir — because it’s amortized over a 30-year program,’” Everhart recalled. “‘It’s just not two airplanes’” to replace two aging aircraft, but “‘it’s everything that comes with those airplanes over a 30-year period.”’ Still, Everhart said Trump asked good questions, such as “Why can’t it be a two-engine versus a four-engine” aircraft? Everhart said he told Trump a four-engine aircraft was needed because “I’ve got to support your role as commander-in-chief.” He said he told the president-elect that “this is an alternate flying White House” that has to support continuity of government operations “no matter what happens,” including during an attack on the U.S. The general said the requirements for the presidential aircraft are set by the White House Military Office.

HorizonX will be an “innovation cell” that will combine money, business development, and incubator programs to help Boeing get to a where it sees the world in 2116. To mark its 100th anniversary last year, the manufacturer shared an optimistic vision of the future in its promotional materials. “You can fly across town in minutes, or across the globe in under an hour. Whole communities are living on Mars and solar satellites are providing Earth with unlimited clean power,” a video on the HorizonX site proclaims. Before it’s setting us on Mars, Boeing will be investing in Washington, D.C.-based Upskill, developer of the Skylight platform of which Boeing is also a customer. Skylight allows an enterprise to connect its applications to augmented reality headsets in a way that’s useful to frontline workers. Boeing is deploying Sklyingt and AR headsets across multiple locations for its manufacturing plants, maintenance and repair facilities, and distribution centres. One pilot project at a wiring harness assembly operations facility saw early results of a 25 per cent improvement in production time and better quality results. A Youtube video from Boeing explains how the workers use voice interaction with their AR headsets, allowing them to keep both hands on the wiring work they’re doing. The amount of Boeing’s investment in Upskill wasn’t disclosed, but combined with an investment from another Upskill customer in GE, the firm is describing it as a Series B funding round. GE is also an Upskill customer, using it to power a mix of AR headsets. The second investment Boeing HorizonX announced today is in Zunum Aero, a Kirkland, Wash.-based aerospace firm that’s developing an aircraft with alternative propulsion. Its proposed regional aircraft would transport between 10-50 passengers within 1,000 miles and is powered by a battery-first hybrid propulsion system.

About us Membership Contact us Thu April 6, 2017 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia McCain endorses Boeing's new Iran deal, says it’s ‘completely legal’ Politics April 5, 2017 TEHRAN – Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who has been a leading voice against the Iran nuclear deal, threw his full support behind Boing’s new agreement with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, saying there is little Congress can do to block the plane sale.  “I have opposed the Iranian agreement and I am not interested in doing anything to help the Iranians but what they’ve done is completely legal,” McCain said, according to a Bloomberg report. “They’ve got the money and it’s not a weapons system, so it doesn’t require any involvement from the Congress.  Also, Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat from Maryland, said there isn't much Congress can do to stop the deal. Senator Marco Rubio, however, told reporters in the Capital: “It’s concerning,” when asked about the deal. Asked if he could or would do anything to block it, the Florida Republican said, “Maybe.” Boeing Co. landed its second jetliner sale to the Iranian airline since the 1970s, a $3 billion deal that sets up a test of the planemaker’s ties with President Donald Trump. The pact with the airlines to purchase 30 of Boeing’s 737 Max planes adds to a separate $16.6 billion agreement with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion under the Obama administration in December, which the Chicago-based manufacturer is still finalizing.  The new agreement also provides the Iranian airline with an option to buy 30 additional 737 Max planes. Deliveries of the single-aisle jet are scheduled to start in 2022.  If completed, the transactions would be the first U.S. aircraft exports to Iran since the Shah era, overtaken by the Islamic revolution in 1979. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based in the U.S. The body also manages trades and transactions dealing with foreign states, organizations, and individuals targeted by U.S. foreign policy and national security goals and operates as an agency of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The recent deal, is the first sizable U.S. business transaction announced with the Islamic republic since Donald Trump was elected president.  In its statement Tuesday, Boeing touted the potential of the 737 deal with Iran to boost U.S. jobs, saying the agreement “creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” citing Commerce Department calculations.  Boeing’s latest accord with Iran puts the Trump administration in the awkward position of choosing between taking a harsher stance against Iran and boosting a major manufacturer, one of the U.S.’s largest exporters. On the campaign trail, Trump maligned the nuclear agreement as “horrible” and threatened to renegotiate.  However, by disrespecting the nuclear deal, if Trump chooses to do so, he will be considered in the eye of the Americans as not making good on his campaign promises to boost manufacturing jobs.  Also, one thing that makes it less likely for the Trump administration to thwart the deal is competition with France’s Airbus, which competes closely with Boeing for international business. In January 2016, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion), three of which already delivered.  “Boeing has to be everywhere that Airbus is,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the nonprofit Lexington Institute, which receives funding from Boeing. One such big deal between the U.S. and Iran is expected to unlock the floodgates for trade with Tehran.  Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. “This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran’s regional role,” Leilaz said. However, financing the multibillion-dollar purchases will be a challenge given the restrictions still in place on lenders doing business with Iranian companies, said aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia, Bloomberg reported.  Aircraft lessors may be hesitant to provide financing if the threat of renewed sanctions raises a risk they couldn’t reclaim the planes if Iranian carriers defaulted.

Cobham, a U.K. specialist in aerial refueling equipment and electronic-warfare systems, plans to retrain key sales staff, modify the terms and conditions that it applies to new contracts and pare expenses to reduce bid prices, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the measures aren’t public. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Chief Executive Officer David Lockwood is seeking to bolster his company’s standing with defense contractors Lockheed Martin Corp.,  Raytheon Co., Northrop Grumman Corp. and  Boeing Co. after a number of contract stumbles. Cobham missed out on the latest phase of a program to upgrade U.S. defenses against anti-ship missiles, while a wrangle with Boeing over a contract to supply refueling gear resulted in a 150-million pound ($187 million) charge. Cobham is acting after a survey last year showed clients found the Wimborne, England-based company’s terms onerous and difficult to accommodate, one of the people said. Its pricing structure is also hurting sales prospects, while poor program execution has led to more than 50 million pounds of delayed revenue from overdue orders, they said. The measures come as Lockwood, who took over in December, implements a wider cost-cutting drive following a run of five profit warnings in 18 months. The earnings revisions culminated in writedowns and adjustments of more than 830 million pounds on Feb. 16 that included the Boeing hit and sent Cobham stock to its biggest intraday drop for at least 28 years. Cobham referred Bloomberg to its March 2 earnings statement where the company highlighted “improved customer relationships” as a priority for 2017. In the release, Lockwood said he had “encouraging early engagements” with a number of clients. The company declined to comment further. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

To launch the group, Boeing HorizonX announced it had made venture investments in two early-stage technology companies: Washington DC-based virtual reality software developer Upskill and Kirkland, Washington-based alternative propulsion aircraft developer Zunum Aero. Boeing HorizonX will be led by Steve Nordlund, previously Boeing VP of strategy for Boeing Defense, Space & Security. The group will operate as part of Boeing’s Corporate Development & Strategy arm, with an additional reporting alignment to the company’s Engineering, Test & Technology division. “Boeing HorizonX is tasked with ensuring we are fully engaged with opportunities from early-stage companies, market trends and emerging technologies while also fostering more rapid and effective internal innovation,” Boeing chairman, president and CEO Dennis Muilenburg said. Upskill is the developer of enterprise software for augmented reality wearables, or “smart glasses,” that can offer enhanced productivity, quality and safety in manufacturing, field service and logistics, Boeing said.  For the Zunum Aero investment, Boeing HorizonX partnered with New York-based JetBlue Airways’ technology ventures arm, JetBlue Technology Ventures. Zunum Aero is developing “hybrid to electric” aircraft “that sip fuel only when they have to, will use even less over time as batteries upgrade and will one day go completely without,” according to its website. “Boeing HorizonX is investing in Zunum because we feel its technology development is leading [the] emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space,” Norlund said. “This technology and customer approach has the potential to transform the market for small, short-haul aircraft that can use smaller regional airports.” Zumum has been actively engaged with the FAA since 2014 to drive development of certification standards for electric aircraft. According to the company, “a complete set of standards for electric aircraft are expected by 2018, and the first electrics are likely to certify in 2020, in time for the first Zunum aircraft to roll off a production line.” “Our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,” JetBlue Technology Ventures president Bonny Simi said. “We believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally-friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilized airports and reinvent regional travel.” "The Boeing HorizonX team will build on Boeing's advanced technology and … aerospace expertise in design, development and manufacturing while bringing in outside perspectives and leveraging the speed and agility of a wide range of companies and research organizations," Boeing Corporate Development & Strategy chief technology officer and SVP Greg Smith said.

The Deep Space Gateway as shown above aims to be a habitat that Boeing wants to send to cislunar space. It could house crucial research for space exploration and be a docking site for other space vehicles similar to the International Space Station (ISS). Trending: Massive explosion from unknown source billions of light years away baffles astronomers The plan is to dock the Deep Space Transport vehicle Boeing at the gateway to someday send humans to Mars from there. Depending on the atmospheric conditions on the red planet, astronauts can either stay on board or send a lander to Mars for surface missions. The transport vehicle will be built in such a way that astronauts are protected from deep space's harsh environment. The gateway will on the other hand be a long lasting, flexible, reusable and sustainable infrastructure that can operate for decades of human spaceflight.

Missions to the lunar surface can be launched with the ability to return to Earth in days as against months as estimated by Nasa. The space agency plans to launch at least one Space Launch System (SLS) mission to the deep space gateway every year.

With a stealthy replacement rolling off assembly lines, though, its days seemed to be numbered. Now, thanks to an unexpected lift from President Donald Trump's administration, the latest version of the fighter jet could catch a second wind. Trump is seeking $2.32 billion for 24 new F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet aircraft in a supplemental budget request for fiscal year 2017. That comes after months of Trump tweets and talk about pricing out a “comparable” Super Hornet to compete with the new radar-resistant, sensor-packed F-35. That request — and the Trump administration’s $54 billion proposed fiscal year 2018 defense spending increase — is subject to further budget negotiations in Congress and is far from assured. “That assumes that they can get Congress to raise the budget caps for defense, and they pay for that in part by cutting the non-defense side of the budget,” said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The defense increase can’t happen if the Trump administration isn’t willing to compromise on some of the other budget issues.” However, there is support in Congress to beef up the military, and the Navy brass intends to have a mix of F-35s and F/A-18s for years. There’s also a simple matter of replacing worn-out planes. Navy officials have said 62 percent of its F/A-18s can’t fly because of maintenance needs from constant use, a major reason that they are asking to buy more Super Hornets, Harrison said. Meanwhile, the planes’ manufacturers continue to lobby. A report last week in trade publication Breaking Defense said F/A-18 maker Boeing Co. gave White House officials a paper with arguments for buying fewer Navy versions of the F-35 and more Super Hornets, saying that mix would be able to handle more battle tasks at a lower cost. When asked about the report, Boeing said in a statement that “at the administration’s request, we have provided information about how Boeing can help address critical near-term naval aviation needs.” The F/A-18 Hornet flew its first combat mission in the late 1980s. It made its mark in the early 1990s during the Gulf War, when four planes demonstrated their versatility by identifying and destroying two Iraqi aircraft in air-to-air combat before continuing on to complete their original ground bombing mission. A major redesign of the F/A-18, known as the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet made its first flight in 1995. The upgraded plane is larger than its predecessor, with more powerful engines and increased range and payload capacity. There were more than 540 F/A-18 Super Hornets in the Navy’s inventory as of September. Boeing also has an electronic jamming derivative, the EA-18G Growler. “When the Navy developed Super Hornet, it was looking for a versatile, tactical aircraft that could reduce the cost of maintaining its air fleet,” said Loren Thompson, military analyst at the Lexington Institute, which receives funding from Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp., builder of the F-35. “Half a dozen different aircraft that used to fly off carrier decks have been replaced by the Super Hornet,” Thompson said. In recent years, Boeing has searched for ways to keep the F/A-18 line running. In 2013, Boeing flew a prototype of a new version called the Advanced Super Hornet, designed to be less visible to radar with additions such as an enclosed weapons pod. The Chicago aerospace giant later changed course, deciding to build an upgrade called the Block 3 Super Hornet that would fill gaps in the Navy’s carrier air wing. Shifting its focus from stealth, the new plane will have increased network capability to gather and share data with other planes like the F-35, as well as a new cockpit system with a touch-screen display and a sensor that can find and target threats without depending only on radar. The Block 3 Super Hornet will no longer have the enclosed weapons pod from the Advanced Super Hornet design, but will still have fuel tanks that lay close to its body to increase range. Those upgrade efforts seemed to pay off when Trump began targeting the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, using the Super Hornet as a lower-cost foil. In January, Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review comparing the operational capabilities of the Navy version of the F-35 with those of the Super Hornet. In a memo to the deputy secretary of Defense, Mattis said the review would assess whether an “advanced Super Hornet” could “provide a competitive, cost-effective, fighter aircraft alternative.” That review is still in progress. At her nomination last week before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Air Force Secretary choice Heather Wilson seemed to offer support to the F-35 when she expressed doubt that stealth capability could be added “retroactively” to older planes. Analysts say the Mattis review is likely to find that an improved Super Hornet will not have the stealth capabilities needed to replace the F-35C for the Navy. “What the report will confirm is that Super Hornet is going to be in the Navy’s fleet until after 2040,” said Thompson of the Lexington Institute. “And the F-35 won’t so much replace the Super Hornet as just share responsibilities.” Dan Gillian, F/A-18 and EA-18G program manager at Boeing, said the Block 3 Super Hornet is designed to work in a “complementary fashion” with the F-35. Already, F-35 production delays have led to more Navy F/A-18 E/F orders to manage a shortfall of strike fighters. In February, Boeing won a $678 million contract for seven Growlers and five Super Hornets. The company said in its 2016 annual report that as of Dec. 31 its backlog included 23 F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the Navy. Gillian said the current rate of production is two Super Hornets a month, though that number could be increased to three a month to deal with the shortfall.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Boeing also is working on foreign orders for the Super Hornet for Kuwait and Canada, and has drawn interest from Finland, Switzerland and India. Many of the Block 3 capabilities are likely to be attractive to international customers, Gillian said. Production on the new version of the Super Hornet, as well as upgrades to current F/A-18 E/F aircraft, could start as soon as the early 2020s, he said. Those new capabilities will be sourced through the same suppliers. Southern California suppliers There are 274 F/A-18 suppliers in California and 20,000 jobs are tied to the program, according to Boeing. More than 200 of those suppliers are in the southern part of the state. One, Brek Manufacturing Co. in the Los Angeles-area city of Gardena, has machined parts for the F/A-18 program for more than 20 years, Boeing said. Some of the largest suppliers are in nearby El Segundo: Raytheon Co., which works on the plane’s radar and “conformal” fuel tanks; and Northrop Grumman Corp., which produces the rear and center section of the fuselage, the plane’s vertical tails, and integrates all the related systems. Northrop Grumman’s approximately half-mile-long facility may be the longest redwood structure in the world; it dates from the early 1940s and was originally built to produce the Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber. The company had delivered 2,229 fuselages to Boeing as of March 15. “The brains of the airplane — the ability to think, the ability to shoot, the ability to maneuver — and more importantly, the sensors, the ability to see, that’s California-based technology,” said Jack Cronin, partner at Fairmont Consulting Group in Boston. More turbulence could be ahead. Future U.S. military aircraft orders for fiscal year 2018 will depend on the budget that eventually emerges from Congress. Increasing defense spending, as Trump has requested, will require 60 votes in the Senate to raise the budgets caps that were last modified two years ago, said Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Essentially re-litigating the 2015 budget deal could be a “hard deal to broker,” he said. “What they had to do last time is they had to give increases on the non-defense side of the budget, which is exactly the opposite of what Trump is proposing,” Harrison said.   Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

The memorandum of agreement will also provide the Iranian carrier with rights to procure 30 additional Boeing-built 737 MAX planes, Boeing said Tuesday. Boeing entered into the transaction after the U.S. government validated that Iran had satisfied requirements of a 2015 nuclear agreement. The company expects to begin deliveries by 2022 and will seek approval from the Treasury Department’s office of foreign assets control over its deal with the airline that is expected to create approximately 18,000 U.S. jobs. Aerospace analysts said Boeing’s sales deals with Iran would test the priorities of President Donald Trump, who has vowed to protect U.S. industries and employees from foreign competition and apposed a nuclear agreement with the Middle Eastern country, according to a report by Rick Gladstone for the New York Times. The potential deal with Iran Aseman Airlines came months after Boeing signed a potential $16.6 billion contract in December 2016 to produce and supply 80 passenger aircraft to Iran Air.

(AP Photo/Hasan Sarbakhshian) Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession "America First" April 05, 2017 Ready to make a deal? The parties Boeing: US national aerospace champion and jet export dominator. Iran: a Middle Eastern theocracy with a population of 77 million and a tendency to work against the national security interest of the United States. The swap Boeing will send 30 of its 737 jetliners, with an option to send 30 more, to Iran’s Aseman Airlines, for a sticker price of $6 billion. (Boeing sold $65 billion worth of commercial aircraft, delivering roughly 750 jets, in 2016, for perspective.) The problem Geopolitics. Until recently, Iran was a prominent subject of economic sanctions that would have scotched this deal from ever happening. Those sanctions helped force Iran to sign an agreement to limit its nuclear program with world powers represented by the United States, the European Union, China, and Russia. That deal went into effect in January 2016, and while it appears to retain the confidence of most signatories when it comes to nuclear proliferation, it hasn’t stopped Iran from doing things like backing Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian autocrat waging a bloody civil war. Critics of Boeing’s deal immediately noted that Boeing’s announcement came the same day as a horrific chemical attack waged by Assad’s regime against civilians. Jetliners can carry both civilians and military personnel, like the Iranian guard units currently fighting in Syria. Boeing will need the US Treasury department to sign off on both this deal and the deal it made to sell 80 planes to Iran’s state airline last year. But US president Donald Trump has been an outspoken critic of nuclear diplomacy with Iran and has called on the agreement to be scrapped. That is easier said than done, since so many world powers are invested in it. But his administration could make it more difficult for American firms to do business in Iran. The outcome Given Trump’s eagerness to boost manufacturing work and exports, Boeing is wagering that any political concerns will be outweighed by the 18,000 jobs that it says the sale will support—and by the knowledge that restricting US manufacturers won’t stop rival European firms like Airbus and Siemens from making major sales to Iran. Meanwhile, Boeing has been waging a charm offensive against Trump, tolerating his claims to have renegotiated a still-in-development deal to build a new Air Force One, for instance. But it’s not Boeing, but rather outrage over Syria’s war and Iran’s troublemaking, that could finally force Trump to choose between his criticism of foreign powers and his blustery economic nationalism.

Premier Jay Weatherill and Boeing will on Thursday sign an agreement that has been secured through the state’s investment attraction agency and Defence SA. Five of the workers will be relocated from Queensland but the rest will be new hires. Boeing is the world’s biggest aerospace company and the State Government hopes its arrival in Adelaide will trigger spin-off job creation in the broader defence sector and start-ups in other hi-tech industries. The Government is refusing to reveal how much was paid out of its $26 million economic investment fund to lure Boeing, saying the transaction details are “commercial in confidence”. Boeing’s newest civilian airliner the 787-10 Dreamliner. AP Photo/Mic SmithSource:AP Mr Weatherill will sign a deed with Boeing managing director Darren Edwards on Thursday and the company’s new Currie St office is scheduled to officially open in the coming week. The Premier said the company’s arrival was a massive vote of confidence as SA sought to transition from old industries like heavy manufacturing to sophisticated services and products. “Boeing’s move builds on SA’s reputation as the defence state and supports our push to create the industries and the jobs of the future,” Mr Weatherill said. “Boeing is a global brand and their decision to choose SA for their expansion demonstrates confidence in our state’s future.” The 250 jobs in SA will be added over five years and include project managers, systems designers, software engineers and researchers conducting aircraft support. There will also be staff involved in research and development, product support and systems integration. Mr Edwards said work to be undertaken at the new office would include “advanced experimentation and prototyping” of new products and the hub would become a test bed for innovation in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance services and products. He said the expansion built on its existing SA work on the E-7A Wedgetail, P-8A Poseidon and Collins Class subs. The first RAAF P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft from Boeing touched down at RAAF Base Fairbairn, Canberra, last year.Source:News Corp Australia Boeing is a leading manufacturer of commercial jet airliners, military aircraft and defence, space and security systems around the world. The company employs 140,000 people across the globe. The SA jobs rollout will come as work is expected to ramp up on new shipbuilding and submarine construction at Techport, but as the doors are slammed shut at carmaker Holden later this year. SA already has developed an aerospace hub at Edinburgh, where parts are produced for the massive joint strike fighter jet project. The State Government’s Defence 2025 strategy seeks to make SA “a national hub for airborne maritime surveillance and weapons system test and evaluation”. The Government says Boeing’s new technology hub will be established in Adelaide’s CBD and support “advanced military systems and leading-edge research and development” in the field. Mr Weatherill said Boeing’s employees would work closely with universities. “Boeing’s expansion in SA will create opportunities for highly-skilled workers in the defence and research sector, with flow on effects to the supply chain and broader economy,” he said. “It also signals the increasing aerospace presence in SA. “As we transition towards our hi-tech advanced manufacturing future these are the types of high-calibre opportunities that will attract and encourage our young graduates and students to work in SA.” Boeing’s operations in Australia are its largest outside of the United States. It employs more than 3000 people nationally, the majority based in Queensland.

Zunum Aero aircraft are designed to take aviation into the future: enabling frequent service to the nation’s network of over 5,000 underutilized regional and general aviation airports. These 10 - 50 seat aircraft will pave the way to a golden era of fast and affordable electric air travel, reversing the 70 year consolidation of air services. Zunum Aero is backed by Boeing BA, -0.91% and JetBlue Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of JetBlue Airways JBLU, +0.29% ; both believe that regional travel is ripe for transformation. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170405005365/en/ With multiple patented technologies already in place, Zunum Aero has designed an innovative class of hybrid-electric aircraft and is developing technologies to create a regional electric air network. These aircraft, as part of new regional electric air networks, will offer a fast, flexible and affordable alternative to highways and high-speed rail, operating point-to-point and as feeders to hub airports. "The shift of the industry to large aircraft and long ranges driven by gas turbines has concentrated almost all air traffic to just two percent of our airports, creating a massive transport gap over regional distances where there is no high-speed alternative. As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago," said Ashish Kumar, CEO and founder, Zunum Aero. "Hybrid propulsion is an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-sized aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners.” By shifting traffic from hubs to regional airports, Zunum Aero is democratizing access to fast and affordable travel. Designing aircraft for walk-on, walk-off travel from nearby airports addresses the major pain points of modern air transit while filling a vast regional transport gap. For example, passengers can expect to travel from regional airports in the Boston area to Washington, DC for half the fare and in half the time it takes today door-to-door. For those on the West Coast, Silicon Valley to the LA area drops to two and a half hours door-to-door, from over five hours today, or to Lake Tahoe in just two hours at a fraction of today’s cost. Additional estimates of impact include: Zunum Aero is three years into development with an experienced, multidisciplinary team across aircraft, aircraft engines and electric vehicle disciplines, including leaders of two flying electric vehicle programs and the leader of a NASA-funded program on drives for electric airliners. In addition to backing by Boeing through its Boeing HorizonX innovation cell and JetBlue Technology Ventures, Zunum has a long-term partnership with the Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems, an NSF Engineering Research Center at the University of Illinois, and a network of collaborators across leading Universities and government labs. The team has also been actively engaged with the FAA since 2014 to drive development of certification standards for electric aircraft. A complete set of standards for electric aircraft are expected by 2018, and the first electrics are likely to certify in 2020, in time for the first Zunum aircraft to roll off a production line. “Boeing HorizonX is investing in Zunum because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space. This technology and customer approach has the potential to transform the market for small, short-haul aircraft that can use smaller regional airports,” said Steve Nordlund, Vice President, Boeing HorizonX. “At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,” said Bonny Simi, President, JetBlue Technology Ventures. “As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally-friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilized airports and reinvent regional travel.” About Boeing Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems.

VFA 136 will remain assigned to Carrier Air Wing One at NAS Oceana. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Deven Leigh Ellis/Released) WASHINGTON (CNN) — An increasing number of F/A-18 fighter jet pilots are suffering from potentially dangerous oxygen deprivation during flight, a safety issue that is raising new questions around the future of the US Navy’s aging air fleet. Testifying before lawmakers last week, Navy officials described a rising rate of “physiological episodes” affecting pilots who fly all models of F-18 aircraft, especially the Boeing-built Super Hornet, an aircraft that has seen public support from President Donald Trump. “Since May 1, 2010, all models” of the F-18 “show steady, yearly increases in the number of physiological episodes,” according to their testimony, which was first reported by Bloomberg ahead of last week’s House Armed Services subcommittee hearing. They also reported a growing number incidents involving pilots of Boeing’s EA-18G Growler, an aircraft that specializes in jamming and disrupting various capabilities of enemy jets. The reported physiological episodes are categorized in two general groups, those related to “pilot breathing gas” and those caused by “unscheduled pressure changes in the flight station,” according to Rear Adm. Michael Moran. “These phenomena jeopardize safe flight,” he said. A team of Navy investigators has assessed 382 cases so far, and has determined that 130 involved some form of oxygen contamination, and 114 involved a failure of the jet’s system that maintains cabin pressure. But the investigation into the root cause of this issue has yielded few tangible results. The “lack of overall progress” is “of great concern,” said Rep. Niki Tsongas, the House armed services panel’s top Democrat, during last week’s hearing. According to Moran, determining the cause of these incidents has been complicated by the fact that “symptoms related to depressurization, tissue hypoxia and contaminant intoxication overlap.” Hypoxia results from deficiency in the amount of oxygen delivered to cells and can induce potentially fatal complications. The Navy has implemented several procedural measures in an attempt to respond to the rising number of incidents involving the aircraft that makes up the core of its fighter fleet. This includes additional training for pilots on the dangers of hypoxia and how to recognize symptoms while flying simulator aircraft. “Moving forward we will continue to fly while applying every resource to solve this challenging problem,” said Moran. Often described as the backbone of naval aviation, the various F-18 aircraft make up most of the service’s strike fighter fleet. The F/A-18 Super Hornet was designed to have a lifespan of roughly 6,000 flight hours, but today, jets are being stretched to fly between 8,000 and 9,000 hours to fulfill mission expectations as a result of fewer operational aircraft, budget restrictions and delays to the fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Late last year, then-President-elect Trump stoked controversy when he said in a tweet that Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter — the Pentagon’s flagship fighter program and the most expensive weapons system in history — could be replaced with a modified version of Boeing’s rival aircraft. “Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35 I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!” Trump tweeted. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in December 2016 that if the Defense Department were to curtail plans to add more F-35s, and instead purchase more Boeing Super Hornets and Lockheed F-16 fighters, taxpayers would save an estimated $29 billion. Defense Secretary James Mattis has commissioned a review of the $400 billion F-35 program in an effort to cut costs. But Mattis has also called the F-35 — a joint Navy, Air Force and Marines program touted as the most lethal and versatile aircraft of the modern era — “critical” for US air superiority and for its ability to integrate with allies who are buying the jet. The US Navy is already considering the purchase of 10 to 15 additional Boeing-made Super Hornets annually through 2020 because of delays in getting the F-35C model used on aircraft carriers. Boeing, which has continuously updated the Super Hornet with new electronics, bigger fuel tanks and new stealthy features, has pitched the Navy jet as a more affordable alternative to the F-35. Currently, only the Navy operates the Super Hornet. Trump asked Congress for an additional $13.5 billion this year to, in part, build and modernize additional F-35s and F/A-18s. The Navy estimates a portion of their current F/A-18 fleet will remain in use through 2030. CNN’s Jon Ostrower contributed to this report.

[Photo: Flickr user Jetstar Airways] By Daniel Terdiman04.05.17 | 7:30 am Boeing has launched a new venture fund that will invest in aerospace technology, innovations in manufacturing, and cutting-edge business models. Known as Boeing HorizonX, the so-called “innovation cell” will look at companies that expect to hit the market with a product within 5 to 15 years. “The name is unique and purposeful,” said HorizonX vice president Steve Nordlund, “as our mission is really to look beyond the horizon for us and the company from an innovation standpoint.” The fund’s first two investments are in Zunum Aero and Upskill. Zunum is a Kirkland, Washington-based startup that is developing hybrid-electric passenger planes. Zunum expects to disrupt the regional transportation market by the early 2020s with 10- to 50-seat planes that will utilize the United States’ 5,000 regional airports, potentially slashing prices and door-to-door times in half. Upskill is based in Washington, D.C., and develops enterprise software for augmented reality wearables. Boeing has already been working with Upskill on initiatives that have helped the aviation giant cut the time required to wire its planes by as much as 25%. Nordlund said there’s no clear plan for additional investments. The fund will put its resources into companies that are pursuing interests that align with those of Boeing. Those include artificial intelligence and machine learning, autonomy, and additive manufacturing. HorizonX is also intended to support a major global services business unit that Boeing will be launching later this year.

Trump traveled in his own Boeing 757 when he ran for president, and he once operated an airline providing shuttle service on the East Coast. Trump met with military leaders including Everhart at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida after tweeting earlier that month: “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” But Trump didn’t realize the $4 billion wasn’t just the cost for two modified 747-8 passenger planes built by Boeing Co., Everhart recounted in the interview Tuesday at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. It also includes the modifications needed to outfit it with advanced security and communications systems and funds to pay for decades of operations and support. “I said, ‘Sir -- because it’s amortized over a 30-year program,’” Everhart recalled. “‘It’s just not two airplanes’” to replace two aging aircraft, but “‘it’s everything that comes with those airplanes over a 30-year period.”’ Still, Everhart said Trump asked good questions, such as “Why can’t it be a two-engine versus a four-engine” aircraft? ‘Flying White House’ Everhart said he told Trump a four-engine aircraft was needed because “I’ve got to support your role as commander-in-chief.” He said he told the president-elect that “this is an alternate flying White House” that has to support continuity of government operations “no matter what happens,” including during an attack on the U.S. Businessweek: Trump Force One Is Ready for Takeoff Photographer: Joe Raedle/Getty Images The general said the requirements for the presidential aircraft are set by the White House Military Office. A lot of time and money have been spent reviewing those, Everhart said. Trump also asked, “Why can’t I go to another vendor?” While the Air Force found Boeing was the only U.S. aircraft manufacturer able to provide the planes, Everhart said Trump was “thinking business in his head” because “he wanted to come from a position of negotiations to try and get the price down.” Gold-Plated Standards Trump has a history as a shrewd buyer of second-hand aircraft that he retrofits to his gold-plated standards. In fact, the Boeing 757 that ferried him on the campaign trail was a hand-me-down from billionaire Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen. The hourly shuttle service, which he purchased from the failing Eastern Airlines in 1988, was less successful, lasting just four years. After meeting Everhart, Trump decided to bring in Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg and “‘talk to him about this pricing,’” the general recalled. In February, Trump claimed he negotiated $1 billion in savings, an assertion that the service said at the time it couldn’t verify. “They were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One,” Trump said at a rally on in Florida that month. “Can you believe this?” Instead, Trump said, “we got that price down by over $1 billion, and I probably haven’t spoken, to be honest with you, for more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in, who are fantastic. I got Boeing in. But I told Boeing it’s not good enough. We’re not going to do it. The price is still too high.” The Government Accountability Office estimated in a report last week that the program will cost $3 billion, based on the Air Force’s latest estimates independent of Trump’s efforts. The Air Force and Boeing are still negotiating the price of the two basic airframes, Everhart said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Boeing HorizonX has made a venture investment in Washington, D.C.-based Upskill, a provider of enterprise software for augmented reality wearables focused on enhancing productivity, quality and safety in manufacturing, field service and logistics. Boeing has been working with Upskill for more than two years to evaluate the use of its technology across multiple locations nationally. In addition, Boeing HorizonX is partnering with JetBlue Technology Ventures to invest in Zunum Aero, a Kirkland, Wash.-based company that is pursuing the development of alternative propulsion aircraft, with potential for performance and efficiency improvements in a range of aerospace applications. “Our ability to identify, shape and harness game-changing innovations wherever they are developed is key to sustaining and growing our leadership in aerospace,” said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chairman, president and CEO. “Boeing HorizonX is tasked with ensuring we are fully engaged with opportunities from early-stage companies, market trends and emerging technologies while also fostering more rapid and effective internal innovation.” Boeing HorizonX is led by Steve Nordlund, who takes this role after serving as vice president of strategy for Boeing Defense, Space & Security. Prior to his strategy role, Nordlund led Boeing’s Autonomous Systems division. He has led strategy and business development organizations in both defense and commercial airplane business units at Boeing and helped launch venture-backed Insitu, Inc., which developed the ScanEagle and Integrator unmanned aerial systems. Boeing acquired Insitu in 2008. Boeing HorizonX will operate as part of the Corporate Development & Strategy group, which reports to Greg Smith, chief financial officer and executive vice president of Corporate Development & Strategy at Boeing, with alignment also to Boeing’s chief technology officer and senior vice president of Boeing Engineering, Test & Technology, Greg Hyslop. In line with Boeing’s plan for investing in future growth, Boeing HorizonX will have three focus areas: making targeted investments in new ventures and startups; seeking unique business opportunities for the company’s aerospace technology; and assessing disruptive innovations and business strategies. “The Boeing HorizonX team will build on Boeing’s advanced technology and depth of aerospace expertise in design, development and manufacturing while bringing in outside perspectives and leveraging the speed and agility of a wide range of companies and research organizations,” Smith said. “As part of our company strategy to accelerate growth and productivity, we intend to be flexible and move quickly to identify technologies, business models and market opportunities that hold the promise of creating and delivering more value for our customers and other stakeholders.” www.boeing.com/HorizonX Contact:  Chaz Bickers Boeing Communications +1 312-544-2002 charles.n.bickers@boeing.com Follow us on Twitter @Boeing SOURCE Boeing     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on April 5, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: April 5, 2017 @ 10:13 pm Filed Under: Airline Industry, Boeing, Business, Economics, English, Global Economy, MIL OSI, MIL OSI Economics, Open Source Intel NEXT ARTICLE → Airbus wins Crystal Cabin Award in several categories at Aircraft Interiors Expo 2017 About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts Boeing Forms New Innovation Cell; Invests in Tech Companies Upskill, Zunum Aero Airbus wins Crystal Cabin Award in several categories at Aircraft Interiors Expo 2017 Community feedback to guide improvements at Canberra’s six dog parks Serial dumper fined $40,000 Brainstorming workshop on the access of local and regional governments in Africa to Climate Finance © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Zunum Aero Developing Hybrid-Electric Aircraft for Fast and Affordable Travel Up To 1,000 Miles SEATTLE–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Zunum Aero, a pioneer in electric aviation, is developing regional hybrid-electric aircraft for the early 2020s, offering unmatched door-to-door speeds and reduced costs for flights from 700 miles at launch, to over 1,000 miles by 2030. Zunum Aero aircraft are designed to take aviation into the future: enabling frequent service to the nation’s network of over 5,000 underutilized regional and general aviation airports. These 10 – 50 seat aircraft will pave the way to a golden era of fast and affordable electric air travel, reversing the 70 year consolidation of air services. Zunum Aero is backed by Boeing (NYSE: BA) and JetBlue Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU); both believe that regional travel is ripe for transformation. With multiple patented technologies already in place, Zunum Aero has designed an innovative class of hybrid-electric aircraft and is developing technologies to create a regional electric air network. These aircraft, as part of new regional electric air networks, will offer a fast, flexible and affordable alternative to highways and high-speed rail, operating point-to-point and as feeders to hub airports. „The shift of the industry to large aircraft and long ranges driven by gas turbines has concentrated almost all air traffic to just two percent of our airports, creating a massive transport gap over regional distances where there is no high-speed alternative. As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago,” said Ashish Kumar, CEO and founder, Zunum Aero. „Hybrid propulsion is an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-sized aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners.” By shifting traffic from hubs to regional airports, Zunum Aero is democratizing access to fast and affordable travel. Designing aircraft for walk-on, walk-off travel from nearby airports addresses the major pain points of modern air transit while filling a vast regional transport gap. For example, passengers can expect to travel from regional airports in the Boston area to Washington, DC for half the fare and in half the time it takes today door-to-door. For those on the West Coast, Silicon Valley to the LA area drops to two and a half hours door-to-door, from over five hours today, or to Lake Tahoe in just two hours at a fraction of today’s cost. Additional estimates of impact include: 40% decrease in door-to-door travel times on busy corridors, and by as much as 80% on less trafficked ones; Much lower operating costs enabling fares 40% to 80% below current prices; 80% lower emissions, dropping to zero over time as battery densities improve; and 75% drop in community noise, opening up all-hours access to smaller airports. Zunum Aero is three years into development with an experienced, multidisciplinary team across aircraft, aircraft engines and electric vehicle disciplines, including leaders of two flying electric vehicle programs and the leader of a NASA-funded program on drives for electric airliners. In addition to backing by Boeing through its Boeing HorizonX innovation cell and JetBlue Technology Ventures, Zunum has a long-term partnership with the Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems, an NSF Engineering Research Center at the University of Illinois, and a network of collaborators across leading Universities and government labs. The team has also been actively engaged with the FAA since 2014 to drive development of certification standards for electric aircraft. A complete set of standards for electric aircraft are expected by 2018, and the first electrics are likely to certify in 2020, in time for the first Zunum aircraft to roll off a production line. “Boeing HorizonX is investing in Zunum because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space. This technology and customer approach has the potential to transform the market for small, short-haul aircraft that can use smaller regional airports,” said Steve Nordlund, Vice President, Boeing HorizonX. “At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,” said Bonny Simi, President, JetBlue Technology Ventures. “As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally-friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilized airports and reinvent regional travel.” About Boeing Boeing is the world’s largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems.

In another study conducted at GE Renewable Energy, a technician experienced a 34 percent productivity improvement while installing wiring into wind turbine top boxes. Other benefits include increased production quality, better utilization of employees and faster training for new seasonal workers. To date, seven different business units within GE are working with Upskill to deploy Skylight. „Upskill offers innovative products that GE uses and finds valuable, which means we can pass onto our customers’ efficiencies within their own operations,” said Ralph Taylor-Smith, managing director for GE Ventures. „With Upskill, we can also support our Brilliant Factory strategy by offering technology that puts data to work in a transformational way, enabling workers to be more agile and effective in their jobs, be it in the factory, the warehouse or in our field service operations.” „The investment means that Upskill continues to be well-capitalized, enabling it to maintain its position as an industry leader and invest the resources needed for product superiority and commercial scale,” said Dr. Magid Abraham, Executive Chairman of Upskill. Like GE and Boeing, many other multinational companies are working with Upskill to drive efficiency improvements across their industrial workforce with an average performance improvement of 32 percent. Using Skylight on AR glasses, companies can address a variety of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including productivity, quality, compliance, knowledge management and employee on-the-job training. This infusion of new capital will allow Upskill to focus on growing its team to support product development and customer solutions, expand its offerings and enhance its ability to deliver large-scale deployment of Skylight globally.

Home National Security Politics Issues Culture Columns Washington Free Beacon National Security Politics Issues Culture Columns Store Cancun Spring Breakers Chanting ‘Build the Wall’ Turns Out to Be Fake News Complaint: Liberal ‘Hate Monitoring’ Group Repeatedly Violated Tax Exempt Status During 2016 Elections Asia Times: Trump to Xi: Rein in North Korean Nuclear Threat or U.S. Will Airplane Sales to Iran Put Under Critical Review By Trump Admin Source: Boeing should be 'on notice' as Trump team reassesses Obama policy Share Tweet Email An Iranian flag and missile / Getty Images BY: Adam Kredo Follow @Kredo0 April 5, 2017 5:00 am The Trump administration is undertaking a critical review of Obama administration-era policies permitting the sale of American airplanes to Iran, which have been used in the past to ferry weapons to terrorists and conduct other illicit activities, according to U.S. officials familiar with the situation. U.S. airline manufacturer Boeing announced on Tuesday that it had reached a memorandum of understanding with Iran guaranteeing the sale of up to 60 planes pending review by the Trump administration. Sources who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon speculated the latest announcement, which was announced earlier in the day by Iran, could be meant to pressure U.S. officials to sign off on the deal. While the newly installed administration had come under fire earlier this year for seeming to continue Obama-era policies meant to approve these sales, U.S. officials now tell the Free Beacon that all past and future deals are coming under review by the new administration as part of a larger assessment of the landmark Iran nuclear deal. The review of sales between Boeing and Iran represent a first step to possibly canceling the deals, which have come under criticism by U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts who maintain the Islamic Republic will use the American aircraft to boost its air force and illicit weapons trade, according to multiple sources who spoke to the Free Beacon. "Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control [OFAC] will be reviewing aviation licensing as part of the National Security Council's ongoing interagency review of the Iran deal," a Treasury Department official told the Free Beacon. The move represents a departure from the Obama administration's policy, which promoted the sale of airplanes to Iran across the United States and Europe. The review of these deals appears to be part of a larger ongoing review of the entire Iran nuclear deal, which is being undertaken by the White House. The Trump administration could move to reverse many of the promises made by the United States to Iran under the previous administration, including airplane sales and other concessions aimed at promoting business in Iran. While the Treasury Department was unable to comment on specific licenses and ongoing determinations pursuant to the Boeing deal, officials pointed out that the latest announcement is not a final deal. Any sale of planes by Boeing to Iran will be subject to review and require a license from the Treasury Department, officials said. One senior White House official told the the Free Beacon that the most recent Boeing deal with Iran will be held for review along with the entire Iran nuclear deal. "The review of existing Iran policy is ongoing–and this MOU will be part of that process," said the official, who was not authorized to speak on record. "Obviously the administration wants American companies to get large contracts, but we have to put the of the American people first." Companies such as Boeing are still legally permitted to negotiate and enter into agreements with Iran as it relates to the sale of airplanes so long as the Iranian entities are not currently subject to U.S. sanctions. However, the final sale of these planes requires specific consent from the Treasury Department. The Obama administration had rushed to push through these types of sales before leaving office. President Donald Trump has advocated a tougher line and these sales could be nixed as a result of Iran's ongoing support for terrorism across the Middle East. One senior congressional source familiar with the situation told the Free Beacon that the Trump administration's latest move should serve as a warning to Boeing. "Treasury is finally committing to a full review of current licensing policies for aircraft sales to Iran," the source said. "Boeing executives should be on notice: it's not just this new request that they will need approval on, but the previous one for Iran Air as well." Rep. Peter Roskam (R., Ill.), a vocal opponent of the Boeing-Iran deal, told the Free Beacon that Boeing’s continued push to deal with Iran is "outrageous." "On the same day Bashar al-Assad's Air Force dropped chemical weapons onto children, an American company announced its intent to sell airplanes to Assad's patrons in Tehran," Roskam said late Tuesday. "Iran continues to use commercial aircraft to support Assad's atrocities in Syria and other terror proxies around the globe." Congress will continue its work to prevent the sale of planes to Iran, particularly in light of its ongoing use of civilian aircraft to ferry weapons and other illicit arms across the region. "We will do everything within our power, and we hope the administration will do everything within its power, to prevent the sale of even more airplanes to state-owned companies in the Islamic Republic," Roskam said. Boeing has not backed off its commitment to these sales, despite fierce opposition in Capitol Hill and now in the White House. One senior congressional adviser who has been working on the matter told the Free Beacon that Boeing's aggressive lobbying campaign is beginning to backfire. "Boeing has apparently calculated that their lobbying power can overcome the opposition of majorities in Congress and the American public, to say nothing of the Trump administration's NSC and Treasury," said the source, who was not authorized to speak on record. "Maybe [Boeing is] right—though that's not the mood on the Hill," the source explained. "But banks will have to make a different calculation, since they don't have the protection of the country's most powerful lobbyists, and the Trump Treasury Department doesn't fuck around with banks that facilitate Iranian terrorism, which is exactly what it means to give Iran airplanes. The fines would probably be in the billions." This entry was posted in National Security and tagged Boeing, Iran, Trump Administration. Bookmark the permalink.

Zunum Aero, backed by Boeing and JetBlue Technology Ventures, is developing hybrid-electric aircraft for fast and affordable travel up to 1,000 miles (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 05, 2017 05:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Zunum Aero, a pioneer in electric aviation, is developing regional hybrid-electric aircraft for the early 2020s, offering unmatched door-to-door speeds and reduced costs for flights from 700 miles at launch, to over 1,000 miles by 2030. Zunum Aero aircraft are designed to take aviation into the future: enabling frequent service to the nation’s network of over 5,000 underutilized regional and general aviation airports. These 10 - 50 seat aircraft will pave the way to a golden era of fast and affordable electric air travel, reversing the 70 year consolidation of air services. Zunum Aero is backed by Boeing (NYSE: BA) and JetBlue Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU); both believe that regional travel is ripe for transformation. With multiple patented technologies already in place, Zunum Aero has designed an innovative class of hybrid-electric aircraft and is developing technologies to create a regional electric air network. These aircraft, as part of new regional electric air networks, will offer a fast, flexible and affordable alternative to highways and high-speed rail, operating point-to-point and as feeders to hub airports. "The shift of the industry to large aircraft and long ranges driven by gas turbines has concentrated almost all air traffic to just two percent of our airports, creating a massive transport gap over regional distances where there is no high-speed alternative. As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago," said Ashish Kumar, CEO and founder, Zunum Aero. "Hybrid propulsion is an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-sized aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners.” By shifting traffic from hubs to regional airports, Zunum Aero is democratizing access to fast and affordable travel. Designing aircraft for walk-on, walk-off travel from nearby airports addresses the major pain points of modern air transit while filling a vast regional transport gap. For example, passengers can expect to travel from regional airports in the Boston area to Washington, DC for half the fare and in half the time it takes today door-to-door. For those on the West Coast, Silicon Valley to the LA area drops to two and a half hours door-to-door, from over five hours today, or to Lake Tahoe in just two hours at a fraction of today’s cost. Additional estimates of impact include: 40% decrease in door-to-door travel times on busy corridors, and by as much as 80% on less trafficked ones; Much lower operating costs enabling fares 40% to 80% below current prices; 80% lower emissions, dropping to zero over time as battery densities improve; and 75% drop in community noise, opening up all-hours access to smaller airports. Zunum Aero is three years into development with an experienced, multidisciplinary team across aircraft, aircraft engines and electric vehicle disciplines, including leaders of two flying electric vehicle programs and the leader of a NASA-funded program on drives for electric airliners. In addition to backing by Boeing through its Boeing HorizonX innovation cell and JetBlue Technology Ventures, Zunum has a long-term partnership with the Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems, an NSF Engineering Research Center at the University of Illinois, and a network of collaborators across leading Universities and government labs. The team has also been actively engaged with the FAA since 2014 to drive development of certification standards for electric aircraft. A complete set of standards for electric aircraft are expected by 2018, and the first electrics are likely to certify in 2020, in time for the first Zunum aircraft to roll off a production line. “Boeing HorizonX is investing in Zunum because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space. This technology and customer approach has the potential to transform the market for small, short-haul aircraft that can use smaller regional airports,” said Steve Nordlund, Vice President, Boeing HorizonX. “At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,” said Bonny Simi, President, JetBlue Technology Ventures. “As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally-friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilized airports and reinvent regional travel.” About Boeing Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems.

 Boeing and JetBlue just invested in a tiny electric-jet startup that could revolutionize air travel Benjamin Zhang Apr. 5, 2017, 5:00 AM 56,679 facebook linkedin twitter email print Zunum Aero's hybrid-electric regional jet.Zunum On Wednesday, the hybrid electric-aircraft startup Zunum Aero announced that it had received an investment from Boeing and JetBlue. "I consider us very fortunate to have backers like JetBlue and Boeing," Zunum Aero founder and CEO Ashish Kumar told Business Insider. "We have been engaged with both companies for about a year, and both are as passionate as we are in this opportunity to reinvent regional air travel." JetBlue's investment in the three-year-old startup was made through its Silicon Valley-based venture-capital fund led by Bonny Simi, the Olympian turned pilot turned airline executive. The amount was undisclosed. "At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted, and we seek new technologies that look to change the game," Simi said in a statement. "As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilized airports and reinvent regional travel." In a statement, Boeing HorizonX vice president, Steve Nordlund, echoed Simi's sentiments, adding that Zunum's hybrid electric technology was leading the way in the up-and-coming segment. Boeing HorizonX is the Chicago-based airplane maker's new venture capital arm.  Zunum's proposed regional aircraft would hold 10 to 50 passengers with a range of up to 1,000 miles. According to Kumar — whose résumé includes leadership stints at Dell, Google, and McKinsey and a Ph.D. from Cornell in mechanical and aerospace engineering — the jet will be powered by a battery first series hybrid propulsion system. This calls for the aircraft to run primarily on battery power with an aviation diesel or turbine range-extending power generator on call if necessary. JetBlue Airbus A321.JetBlue Since the aircraft isn't expected to fly until the next decade and will have a service life of roughly 20 years, Zunum is designing its aircraft to be "future-proof" — meaning the aircraft will be designed in a way that will allow it to adopt new technology. For instance, the aircraft will initially feature hybrid propulsion designed to deliver 80% lower emissions than comparable traditional aircraft. But with advancements in battery technology, the range-extending internal combustion engine can be replaced with an extra battery pack, thereby lowering emissions to zero, Kumar said. In addition, Zunum's propulsor technology is expected to reduce the aircraft's noise emissions by 75% — important for operations into airports with stern noise restrictions. Zunum's CEO believes his company's nature-friendly electric jet also makes economic sense for airlines and their passengers. In recent years, many carriers have moved away from operating small 50-seat regional jets in favor larger aircraft that offer lower unit costs. Zunum says that by cutting out the need for large volumes of jet fuel, its aircraft can cut an airline's operating costs by 40% to 80% a flight. Even though airlines will have to swap out battery packs once or twice a year, Kumar believes his electric jets can deliver better unit costs than the latest jumbo jets from Airbus and Boeing. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner production line in Everett, Washington.Boeing In addition, the Zunum jets are designed for operation out of small general aviation or regional airports. This cuts down on passenger commute times, time spent in long security lines, and the need to connect through a larger hub. In fact, Kumar says that by taking advantage of general aviation airports, the planes could deliver door-to-door speeds that are two to four times as fast as those of highways, high-speed rail, or conventional aircraft. According to Simi, JetBlue Technology Ventures, which launched early last year, targets investments that it believes can help JetBlue function better as an airline or provide its passengers with a better experience. With Zunum, it may have found an investment that can do both. Oddly enough, however, JetBlue operates a fleet made up entirely of Airbus and Embraer aircraft. If Zunum Aero works out, it may finally be time for JetBlue to acquire aircraft with Boeing's fingerprints on it. Get the latest Boeing stock price here.

Poseidon aircraft worldwide. The contract covers modernisation of at least 17 P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the US, Australia, and the UK. Boeing's military aircraft mobility, surveillance, and engagement division and P-8 programme manager Jamie Burgess said: “The P-8A is a textbook example of Boeing’s commercial derivative expertise. “Every day our customers get to fly incredible aircraft that perform exceptionally well and are built by the best of Boeing.” The US Navy will receive 11of the aircraft, while the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) will expand its P-8A fleet by four units. The UK Royal Air Force is expected to receive the first of two P-8A jets in 2019. "Every day our customers get to fly incredible aircraft that perform exceptionally well and are built by the best of Boeing." The deal includes options for 32 additional aircraft, which if exercised would increase the total contract value to $6.8bn. It also includes procurement of long-lead parts for future orders, Boeing stated. Based on Boeing’s next-generation 737-800 commercial airplane, the P-8A is claimed to offer advanced anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. Powered by two CFM56-7 engines, the P-8 can fly up to 41,000ft and travel up to 490 knots. Able to operate in all flight regimes, the model can also self-deploy up to 4,500 miles from base without refuelling. To date, Boeing delivered 53 Poseidons to the Navy and two to the RAAF. The US Navy has deployed multiple squadrons worldwide since operations began in 2013 and recorded more than 96,000 flight hours to date, according to the statement. Image: A P-8A Poseidon in flight.

Zunum Aero Developing Hybrid-Electric Aircraft for Fast and Affordable Travel Up To 1,000 Miles Boeing and JetBlue Technology Ventures-backed startup offers flexible travel to thousands of communities starting in the early 2020s Zunum Aero, backed by Boeing and JetBlue Technology Ventures, is developing hybrid-electric aircraft for fast and affordable travel up to 1,000 miles (Photo: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Zunum Aero, backed by Boeing and JetBlue Technology Ventures, is developing hybrid-electric aircraft for fast and affordable travel up to 1,000 miles (Photo: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 05, 2017 05:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Zunum Aero, a pioneer in electric aviation, is developing regional hybrid-electric aircraft for the early 2020s, offering unmatched door-to-door speeds and reduced costs for flights from 700 miles at launch, to over 1,000 miles by 2030. Zunum Aero aircraft are designed to take aviation into the future: enabling frequent service to the nation’s network of over 5,000 underutilized regional and general aviation airports. These 10 - 50 seat aircraft will pave the way to a golden era of fast and affordable electric air travel, reversing the 70 year consolidation of air services. Zunum Aero is backed by Boeing (NYSE: BA) and JetBlue Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU); both believe that regional travel is ripe for transformation. With multiple patented technologies already in place, Zunum Aero has designed an innovative class of hybrid-electric aircraft and is developing technologies to create a regional electric air network. These aircraft, as part of new regional electric air networks, will offer a fast, flexible and affordable alternative to highways and high-speed rail, operating point-to-point and as feeders to hub airports. "The shift of the industry to large aircraft and long ranges driven by gas turbines has concentrated almost all air traffic to just two percent of our airports, creating a massive transport gap over regional distances where there is no high-speed alternative. As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago," said Ashish Kumar, CEO and founder, Zunum Aero. "Hybrid propulsion is an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-sized aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners.” By shifting traffic from hubs to regional airports, Zunum Aero is democratizing access to fast and affordable travel. Designing aircraft for walk-on, walk-off travel from nearby airports addresses the major pain points of modern air transit while filling a vast regional transport gap. For example, passengers can expect to travel from regional airports in the Boston area to Washington, DC for half the fare and in half the time it takes today door-to-door. For those on the West Coast, Silicon Valley to the LA area drops to two and a half hours door-to-door, from over five hours today, or to Lake Tahoe in just two hours at a fraction of today’s cost. Additional estimates of impact include: 40% decrease in door-to-door travel times on busy corridors, and by as much as 80% on less trafficked ones; Much lower operating costs enabling fares 40% to 80% below current prices; 80% lower emissions, dropping to zero over time as battery densities improve; and 75% drop in community noise, opening up all-hours access to smaller airports. Zunum Aero is three years into development with an experienced, multidisciplinary team across aircraft, aircraft engines and electric vehicle disciplines, including leaders of two flying electric vehicle programs and the leader of a NASA-funded program on drives for electric airliners. In addition to backing by Boeing through its Boeing HorizonX innovation cell and JetBlue Technology Ventures, Zunum has a long-term partnership with the Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems, an NSF Engineering Research Center at the University of Illinois, and a network of collaborators across leading Universities and government labs. The team has also been actively engaged with the FAA since 2014 to drive development of certification standards for electric aircraft. A complete set of standards for electric aircraft are expected by 2018, and the first electrics are likely to certify in 2020, in time for the first Zunum aircraft to roll off a production line. “Boeing HorizonX is investing in Zunum because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space. This technology and customer approach has the potential to transform the market for small, short-haul aircraft that can use smaller regional airports,” said Steve Nordlund, Vice President, Boeing HorizonX. “At JetBlue Technology Ventures, our goal is to be part of a disruptive force rather than the one being disrupted and we seek new technologies that look to change the game,” said Bonny Simi, President, JetBlue Technology Ventures. “As a company that is also deeply committed to innovation in sustainable travel, we believe that Zunum and its quiet, environmentally-friendly aircraft will light up a vast network of underutilized airports and reinvent regional travel.” About Boeing Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems.

President to Face Conflict Over $3 Billion Deal With Aseman Airlines By Shreesha Ghosh @Shreesha_94 On 04/05/17 AT 5:20 AM Close Aerospace giant Boeing, announced Tuesday the confirmation of a tentative agreement with Iran Aseman Airlines to sell 30 737 jetliners. The delivery of the aircrafts has been scheduled to commence from 2022. The $3 billion deal also came with an option of 30 more 737 MAX aircrafts, but at a later date. In December 2016, Boeing agreed to a separate $16.6 billion deal for 80 passenger jets for Iran Air. Boeing's initiative to negotiate with Iranian companies was the first attempt to export American aircraft to the country in 40 years since Iranian King, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's era. The recent deal puts the U.S. president’s policy of promoting manufacturing jobs in conflict with the vow to take a stronger stand on the Islamic Republic. Boeing claimed that the deal "creates or sustains" around 18,000 jobs in the U.S. It will be a test for Trump to decide, which policy to favor while deciding the sanction of the deal. Read: Boeing 777-Size Drones Might Cut Airfreight Price In Half "This deal presents Trump with the mother of all dilemmas," said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy based in Washington. "It would create a lot of jobs — he’s all about that," Kupchan said, according to Bloomberg. "But planes are inherently dual-use, can ferry troops around, and Trump is dug in on curbing Iranian influence in the region. It’s a big bet by Boeing, and the firm probably has an uphill fight on its hands," he added. If the White House foils Boeing’s agreement, it also risks tilting the playing field in favor of Europe’s Airbus Group SE, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation research consultancy in Fairfax, Va. "Trump campaigned on getting tough with Iran," Aboulafia said, "But at the end of the day, these are manufacturing jobs. It’s really hard to say, ‘Yes, we are giving this work to the Europeans,'" he added. The negotiations were authorized by the U.S. government and founded on the 2015 nuclear agreement. The agreement relaxed many economic authorizations against Iran in return for the country’s confirmable pledge that its nuclear activities will only be peaceful in nature, according to New York Times. Even though it is not cited in the Boeing announcement but payment is still a significant hurdle for both sides. Iran cannot use the American banking system under the regulations that still apply to the country. So, transactions have to be carried out overseas and in currencies other than dollar. American critics of Iran in Congress and elsewhere have repeatedly objected to Boeing’s plans to sell new aircraft to Iran, arguing that at least some of the planes could be diverted for illicit military use. "On the same day Bashar al-Assad’s air force dropped chemical weapons onto children, an American company announced its intent to sell airplanes to Assad’s patrons in Tehran," Peter Roskam of Illinois, an influential Republican who has long opposed Boeing’s intentions in Iran, told the Times. But Boeing assured that necessary safeguards are in place to prevent any misuse of the aircrafts and that the agreement was signed in accordance with the nuclear agreement of 2015.

Campbell, who admits he is 'socially rather inept', bought the plane for $100,000 in his early 20s after hearing about a Mississippi hairdresser who did the same thing.  Ambitious engineer Bruce Campbell has transformed a retired Boeing 727 into a 'bona fide castle' where he lives in the middle of the woods The 66-year-old turned the huge three-engine commercial airliner into an unusual home in a suburban wooded area outside of Portland, Oregon Complete with a bed, a kitchen, a laundry area and a shower, the self-confessed nerd has lived in the remarkable aircraft for 15 years He is still working to install a working lavatory in the aircraft and to restore some of the plane's original interior elements, like seating and lights.  Campbell spends the other part of the year in Japan, where he is also looking to buy and similarly re-use a retired Boeing 747 fuselage. On board, Campbell leads a modest life. He sleeps on a futon, bathes in a makeshift shower and cooks with a microwave or toaster, eating mostly canned food and cereal. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Semi-decapitated teen tells police his shocking attack story Watch video Body cam shows deadly officer-involved shooting with fleeing man Watch video Shocking video shows effects of stomach acid mixed with coke Watch video Shocking video shows 'Spice zombies' frozen by illegal drug Watch video Police officer stops press conference to arrest man Watch video A former stunt double saves falling construction worker Watch video A perrrrrfect new toy: Cat loves playing with baby Calvin in his swing Watch video Ravenous crocodiles swarm a defenceless zebra by the Mara River Watch video Feisty feline tries to attack the postwoman through the window!

Campbell was in his early 20s when he paid around $23,000 for the 10 acres on which his plane rests. His original plan was to make a home from freight vans, but then he decided a plane would be better. A van still sits nearby, covered in growth. Before he took the plunge, he described himself as 'skinny, easily intimidated physically' and 'never married'. He says he has spent most of his life 'sufficiently amused with technical pursuits and technical toys'. Campbell, who admitted he was 'socially rather inept', lives a secluded lifestyle in the woods Campbell lives in this plane six months every year (pictured in the cockpit), and spends the other part of the year in Japan, where he is also looking to buy and similarly re-use a retired Boeing 747 fuselage He has stripped out many of the seats so he can enjoy 1,066 square feet of 'exhilarating aerospace quality' He explained: 'With the vital aid of very dear friends, and a fearless spirit made rather easy by deeply painful events, I recently embarked on fresh adventures and bold quests in new lands.'  He paid $100,000 for the aircraft in 1999 - with the cost of wing and tail removal and moving setting him back a further $120,000 - taking the total to $220,000. The ambitious engineer had the plane shipped from Miyazaki Kuukou dock in Japan to the US, and towed it to its current location in the woods.  Describing the decision to live in a plane rather than a typical wooden cabin, Campbell explained: 'My feeling is, pick a path based upon what makes the most sense to you.  'Ignore the provincially entrapped thoughts of the herd - don't follow the herd into a life of tedium, or possibly over the edge of a cliff. Boldly forge your own path - one which seems to you to promise a better future, irrespective of the aimless wanderings of the herd.  Campbell was in his early 20s when he paid around $23,000 for the 10 acres on which his plane rests. Pictured, the cockpit Before he took the plunge, he described himself as 'skinny, easily intimidated physically, never married, and for most of my life sufficiently amused with technical pursuits and technical toys, and socially rather inept' He paid $100,000 for the aircraft in 1999 - with the cost of wing and tail removal and moving setting him back a further $120,000 - taking the total to $220,000 Describing his decision to live in the plane, he advised not 'following the herd' and instead 'boldly forging your own path' 'The herd is inherently incapable of blazing new trails to our future. Only bold independent thinkers can do that. Ignore the herd.' The cabin and cockpit feature 1,066 square feet of 'exhilarating aerospace quality', he explained on his website. Comparing the aircraft's materials to a wooden cabin, he said: 'I don't mean to offend, but wood is in my view a terrible building material. 'Rectangular stick homes can't withstand sever winds, they frequently kill people when they explode into flames, they're easily broken into by burglars, they're leaky, and they degrade quickly.' The transition wasn't easy. While restoring the plane, Campbell spent years living in a mobile home. When that became infested with mice, he moved into the aircraft, despite lacking a building permit.

When that became infested with mice, he moved into the aircraft, despite lacking a building permit. Pictured right, the stairs leading to the plane The huge aircraft is propped up on blocks of pillars in a space cleared out amid the densely packed woods  'Mine is to change humanity's behavior in this little niche,' he said as he stood beside the plane, lamenting the need to power wash its exterior and trim the dense foliage. Campbell is one of a small number of people worldwide who have transformed retired aircraft into a living space or other creative project, although a spokesman for the Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association was unable to say precisely how many planes are re-used this way. AFRA, an organization made up of industry leaders including Boeing that focus on sustainable end-of-service practices for airframes and engines, estimates that 1,200 to 1,800 aircraft will be dismantled globally over the next three years, and 500 to 600 will be retired annually over the next two decades. 'AFRA is happy to see aircraft fuselages re-purposed in a range of creative ways,' said AFRA spokesman Martin Todd.  While Campbell has created a website with details on rebuilding planes, he's not the only one with such a vision as aircrafts have been made into homes in Texas, Costa Rica and the Netherlands. Taking it one step further, there is an airplane boat in Florida. 'I think most people are nerds in their hearts in some measure,' Campbell said. 'The point is to have fun.'  Campbell is one of a small number of people worldwide - from Texas to the Netherlands - who have transformed retired aircraft into a living space or other creative project Comparing the aircraft's materials to a wooden cabin, he said: 'I don't mean to offend, but wood is in my view a terrible building material'  'Rectangular stick homes can't withstand sever winds, they frequently kill people when they explode into flames, they're easily broken into by burglars, they're leaky, and they degrade quickly,' he added Share or comment on this article e-mail 150 shares Most watched News videos Driving tutor caught shouting and swearing at kids on horseback Shocking video shows 'Spice zombies' frozen by illegal drug Disturbing footage of attempted child abduction in Philadelphia Police officer stops press conference to arrest man Shocking video shows effects of stomach acid mixed with coke Bus driver KICKS passenger after throwing him off the bus Kendall Jenner stars in Pepsi's 'Live for Now Moments Anthem' ad Semi-decapitated teen tells police his shocking attack story Touching moment grieving mum sees robin on her son's grave Couple caught getting frisky in university building Horrific moment bullfighter is gored by 1,000lb bull in Madrid Heston Blumenthal confuses The Project desk with awkward interview Widower staying with his own daughter, 13, is accused of...

The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm's work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. "On the one hand, there's the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran," said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. "They'll have to make tough decisions." Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran's Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran's third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country's flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some €22.8 billion ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the US Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes' components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is US politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran "on notice" when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. "This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran's regional role," Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. "According to the US Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States," it said. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon US government approval." Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said ultimately the sales wouldn't change Iran's status in the Gulf, already home to three major long-haul carriers, or greatly affect Boeing's bottom line. "This is not a market that means a great deal anymore," he said. "It attracts headlines — and it has all kinds of political headaches and conflicts associated with it — but Iran as a world hub of aviation isn't what it was."

The question is what will replace the orbiting space laboratory? On Tuesday, just a week after NASA announced plans to develop a “deep space gateway” in the vicinity of the moon in collaboration with commercial and international partners, one of the space agency’s partners has unveiled concepts for such an outpost. In a statement accompanying the concept images for the deep space gateway — which would serve as a waypoint for crewed Mars missions — and transport vehicle, which would ferry humans to the red planet and beyond, Boeing said that the systems would "help achieve NASA’s goal of having robust human space exploration from the Moon to Mars." A concept image showing Boeing's Deep Space Gateway. Photo: Boeing Although the images are far from detailed, there are a few key things that Boeing has made clear — one, that the habitat would be delivered to cislunar space by NASA’s Space Launch System (a rocket that, once operational, would be the most powerful one ever built); and two, both the deep space gateway and the transport vehicle would be powered by Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) systems. A concept image of Boeing's Deep Space Transit Vehicle. Photo: Boeing An SEP system utilizes both, solar cells and an ion drive. An array of solar cells converts collected solar energy to electrical power, which is used to ionize atoms of a propellant such as xenon, that are then expelled to produce thrust. This technology, which was used in NASA’s Dawn spacecraft, has the potential to significantly reduce cost of deep space missions by reducing the launch weight of spacecraft. “The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing’s space exploration division, said in the statement. The SLS, a successor to NASA's now-defunct Space Shuttle program that is expected to be ready by launch by 2018, is crucial for realizing NASA’s deep-space exploration ambitions — including crewed missions to Mars. The SLS’ engines will be the same that powered the Space Shuttle program. These engines have been used during 135 space shuttle missions between 1981 and 2011, and four of them, providing a combined thrust of 2 million pounds, will be used to power the rocket.

A March 20 audit by the VA inspector general had found that nearly a third of calls to the Veterans Crisis Line as recently as November were bounced to backup centers run by an outside contractor, as well as other problems including weak leadership and inadequate data to measure the quality of calls. The rollover calls happen when phone lines are busy, leading to possible waits of 30 minutes or more. It was an early test for new VA Secretary David Shulkin, who has made suicide prevention a signature issue at the troubled agency, riven with scandal in recent years since reports of delays in treatment at veterans' hospitals. Approximately 20 veterans take their lives each day. Testifying before a House panel, Steve Young, VA's deputy undersecretary for health for operations and management, pointed to a dramatic turnaround in calls answered by the hotline since November. He said it was now a "rare instance" that calls are bumped to a backup center and that calls are answered by live counselors within 8 seconds, on average.

The stone has an an unusual distinction: It has attracted even higher bids in the past. Hong Kong-based jewelry retailer Chow Tai Fook had the HK$553 million winning bid for the Pink Star after a five-minute contest that included three phone bidders, Sotheby's said Tuesday. The oval-shaped diamond dethroned the Oppenheimer Blue, which fetched $58 million in May at Christie's. In a quirk of auction history, the record price for the Pink Star is some $12 million lower than the $83 million offer Sotheby's adjudicated it for in 2013. That sale collapsed because the buyer, diamond-cutter Isaac Wolf, never paid, and Sotheby's had to reclaim the stone. The sale gives the auction house some respite after it failed to sell other major gems last year, including the biggest rough diamond found in more than 100 years and a blue diamond ring that once belonged to Hollywood actress Shirley Temple. × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

The agreement also includes options for 32 additional aircraft, as well as money for long-lead parts for future orders. After exercising all options, the total contract value will be $6.8 billion. This comprehensive award reflects a commitment by Boeing and the Navy to achieve pricing and production stability, two keys of successful program performance. “The P-8A is a textbook example of Boeing’s commercial derivative expertise,” said Jamie Burgess, vice president of Boeing Military Aircraft’s Mobility, Surveillance & Engagement division and the P-8 program manager. “Every day our customers get to fly incredible aircraft that perform exceptionally well and are built by the best of Boeing.” The Navy will receive 11 aircraft, while Australia will expand its P-8A fleet with four more. The U.K.’s first two P-8A jets are part of the agreement, with first delivery set for 2019. Boeing so far has delivered 53 Poseidons to the Navy and two to the Royal Australian Air Force. Based on Boeing’s Next-Generation 737-800 commercial airplane, the P-8A offers the world’s most advanced anti-submarine, anti-surface warfare and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. The U.S. Navy has deployed multiple squadrons around the globe since operations began in 2013, accumulating more than 96,000 flight hours to date. The Indian Navy currently flies the P-8I variant of the aircraft. They have received eight aircraft to date and in July 2016 signed a contract for four additional P-8Is.

MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Ty Wright. By WP Bloomberg Apr 1, 2017 at 7:54 am | Print View If President Donald Trump gets confrontational with Chinese President Xi Jinping over trade at their Mar-a-Lago summit in Florida in April, the Chinese leader will have potential allies in some surprising places — namely, Austin, Sacramento and Olympia. The economic ties that bind China to the U.S. are primarily regional and run deep. Now, with a wild card in the White House, the Chinese want even more leverage should bilateral trade relations get hammered. China’s Ministry of Commerce says it’s working to expand various investment agreements with California, Texas, Iowa and other states, deals it estimates were worth $2.5 billion to U.S. and Chinese businesses in 2016 alone. “‘A good relationship between two nations is based on close connection between their peoples,’” said Sun Jiwen, a spokesman for the ministry, citing an old Chinese saying. “Province-state and intercity economic partnerships provide an important foundation for China-U. S. economic ties.” While the outreach is a continuation of regional ties promoted for several years by Xi, it’s taken on added urgency as Trump’s economic team weighs whether to follow through on campaign-trail promises of tariffs of as much as 45 percent on Chinese goods. Part of the thinking is that making more American friends outside Washington could slow the push for protectionist measures, according to a person involved in the ministry’s campaign who asked not to be identified discussing its internal deliberations. If such cooperation flourishes, “it will not be easy for anyone to shake,” says He Weiwen, a former ministry official who’s now deputy director of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization. Attention has focused on the massive trade deficit in trade of goods with China — $347 billion in 2016, almost half of the U.S. total. But China, with its 1.37 billion people, is also among the top three export markets for 33 states. Texas oil and gas producers, Michigan automakers and Georgia paper mills would all suffer if China were to impose import restrictions in response to American tariffs. China has also ramped up its investments in the U.S. — by one estimate, they tripled last year to $45.6 billion — which helps create the jobs Trump has promised. U.S.-China trade ties aren’t solely between Zhongnanhai and the White House. They’re forged in places like Moraine, Ohio, where American workers are employed by Fuyao Glass, a Chinese-owned company that bought part of a shuttered General Motors plant in 2014. Many of China’s cross-border investments are welcomed locally and aren’t the kind of deals that draw scrutiny from the U.S. government, which reviews foreign purchases for national security concerns. In Lancaster, California, a desert town north of Los Angeles hit hard by the financial crisis, the Republican mayor, R. Rex Parris, in 2008 began courting the Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD Co., which is part-owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. “Saved our city,” he says of BYD’s electric bus plant in Lancaster. BYD now employs almost 500 there and anticipates tripling that within three years. “I’m telling people, ‘you’re going to have to not want a job to not have one,’” says Parris, who expects the local unemployment rate to drop to 2 percent. China’s Ministry of Commerce began formalizing the provincial-state ties in 2012, when Xi visited the U.S. and talked with governors including Iowa’s Terry Branstad, an old friend from a 1980s cultural exchange, about boosting trade opportunities. California, Texas, Iowa, Michigan, New York, the state of Washington and the city of Chicago have since signed agreements with the Ministry of Commerce, calling for regular trade visits, business matchmaking and other exchanges. The deals cover 25 Chinese provinces and cities, which sent 22 delegations to the U.S. in 2016 while the U.S. organized 14 trips to China, according to the ministry. Officials and executives from Shanghai made two visits last year to Chicago, which helped convince the popcorn maker Garrett Popcorn to choose the city for its first store in mainland China, according to a statement from Shanghai’s commerce commission. In the manufacturing hub of Guangdong, officials plan a slate of cooperative activities this year, among them setting up a regional trade office in Los Angeles, hosting a biotech delegation from Massachusetts and sending representatives to an “Invest in America” summit sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Guangdong Commerce Department said in a written statement. Bob Honts, the owner of Texas Lone Star Enterprises in Austin, Texas, accompanied Texas governor Rick Perry on a trade mission to China in 2014. Honts, whose company raises investment money under the EB-5 visa program, says Chinese immigrants have put $200 million into real estate, oil exploration and other ventures in the state. “To ignore the Chinese is like you’ve got this racecar and you’re using three cylinders out of eight,” says Honts, a Republican. “You can’t do that. We need to work with China.” Trump hasn’t resolved tension in his administration between hard line advisers like Stephen Bannon, who has called for “economic nationalism,” and such moderate voices as Branstad, who’s now slated to become Trump’s ambassador to China. Few companies have more to lose from a trade war than Boeing, which makes most of its commercial jetliners in Washington state and has collected $60.2 billion from deliveries to China since 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. That far outweighs the $800 million to $1 billion that Boeing spends a year on aircraft parts made in the People’s Republic, joint ventures and other operations. At Boeing Field in Seattle, many of the 737s lined up for testing are Chinese domestic carriers. But if would-be Chinese buyers get caught in the middle of a trade war, “they will simply buy Airbus,” says Gary Locke, a former governor of the state who was also ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama. The state’s director of commerce, Brian Bonlender, went to China in preparation for a visit from provincial officials that had been planned for June but now has been pushed back to September and a planned trade mission led by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee in August. Bonlender says his counterparts at the ministry in China have been more “engaged” and “helpful” since Trump’s election — and seem especially focused on finding Chinese businesses with advanced ideas for investment projects and bringing them to the state’s attention. “We’re very encouraged” by the increased outreach, Bonlender says, adding that it’s likely due in part to the “changing tenor of international engagement” under Trump.

Most Popular ULA By David Grossman Apr 4, 2017 Proving that inspiration can come from all places, Boeing has adapted amusement park zip lines for use as emergency exit systems on its CST-100 Starliner crewed spacecraft. Boeing is working closely with United Launch Alliance (ULA)—the company's joint venture with Lockheed Martin to build rockets—to certify the Starliner for crewed missions to the International Space Station in the coming years. One thing they still need to do? Develop an emergency egress system. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The zip lines were installed by Terra Nova LLC, which has previously built the largest zip line in the world at 8,350 feet long in Mexico. If the hardware is good enough to take people a mile and a half over the hills of Chihuahua, Mexico, it's good for astronauts in an emergency. In the event of an emergency before the rocket engines are lit, such as a fire in the capsule, astronauts can leave though an emergency exit and zip line down to safety from the top of the rocket. Most Popular There's already an abort system in place for after the rocket engines are ignited—the astronauts are ejected from the capsule to parachute down to safety. But NASA also requires a method of escape for before the ignition. The requirement makes sense to ULA. "If we have pressure instability in tanks, I think that's probably the biggest one; shorts in an electrical system, things like that, things that could cascade and develop into a pretty significant event," said Gary Wentz, ULA vice president. Terra Nova's new zip lines are modified to suit ULA and Boeing's unique needs. The system would be mounted on the crew access tower, close to the rocket. In an emergency scenario, the astronauts could feel their way through the smoke (the system is designed to be navigable by touch), exit their hatch, strap themselves to a seat and pull a pair of brake-control handles to start down the wire. While less scenic than the forests of West Virginia, if the quick trip can meet NASA's rigorous standards than it might become a regular feature on future trips to space.

The Boeing 9N-ACB was flown to Bangkok airport last Friday and has remained grounded since then. Sources at NAC said that the management failed to replace “protective breathing equipment” that is installed on airplanes to supply oxygen to crewmembers. The breathing device should be replaced every 10 years. “Knowing that the device life has expired and it needed to be changed, the management did not show any concern,” said the source. It would not take more than an hour to install the protective breathing equipment if the device was brought in Nepal, said the sources. “However, the aircraft was flown to Bangkok airport last Friday knowing that that the life of the device has expired.”   According to NAC officials, the device has been ordered from Atlanta in the US. Sources said that the management negligence would cost millions in losses for the corporation. “The plane has been grounded at the peak tourist season and all its bookings have been cancelled.” Likewise, the corporation has to pay hefty parking charges at the airport. The issue was also discussed at the NAC’s board meeting on Sunday. “It’s sheer negligence from the management and also a serious issue that could cost dearly to the national flag carrier,” said Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, a board member of NAC representing Tourism Ministry. “The issue will be investigated.” NAC Spokesperson Rabindra Shrestha said that the 9N-ACB Boeing has been grounded at the Bangkok airport due to some technical reason. He did not elaborate the technical reason, but said that the device that needs to be replaced has been ordered already. The carrier to auction one of its Boeing 757 Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) has said an auction notice will be issued this week to sell one of its two vintage Boeing 757s. The corporation had received the go-ahead from its board of directors last month to sell the plane. The national flag carrier has set a minimum sale price of $1.7 million for its 30-year-old Karnali bearing registration number 9N-ACA. “All the documents required to issue auction notice has been finalized,” said NAC Spokesperson Rabindra Shrestha. “We have planned to issue global notice on Thursday.” The 9N-ACA arrived in Nepal in 1987 and flew on long-haul routes, displaying the national flag at world airports. The 757 holds 190 passengers and is of the ‘combi’ variety with a forward cargo hatch. The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized, narrow body twin-engine jet built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was in production from 1981 to 2004.

Olivier Douliery/Bloomberg Trump administration drops human rights in new Bahrain F-16 deal Turkish trader suspected of bypassing Iran sanctions hires Rudy Giuliani as attorney Indifferent to Assad, anti-Iran: Trump's Syria policy baffles experts Iran's Aseman Airlines has signed a tentative deal to buy at least 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets, in the first new business with the U.S. plane maker since President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance towards Iran.  Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy.  Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said on Tuesday representatives of Aseman and Boeing had signed an agreement in Tehran covering as many as 60 jets, including options, after a year of negotiations.  Boeing described the deal as a "memorandum of agreement," meaning it is only outline for the time being and subject to government approvals. It covers plans for Aseman to buy 30 aircraft with options for a further 30, it added.  FILE PHOTO: A member of the media uses a smartphone to take a photograph of a Boeing Co. 737 Max aircraft during preparations ahead of the Farnborough International Airshow 2016 in Farnborough, U.K., Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg If completed, the main part of the deal for 30 jets would be worth $3.4 billion at list prices, though airlines typically pay around half that. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities.  Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact, but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord, which the U.S. aerospace industry says would support his agenda for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs.  Washington last month imposed separate sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities following a ballistic missile test. Iran retaliated with its own sanctions.  In a statement on the Aseman deal, Boeing cited U.S. Department of Commerce data suggesting an "aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States".  Turboprop Talks Boeing deliveries to Aseman would start in 2022, although the U.S. plane maker must first apply for licenses from the U.S. Treasury allowing it to proceed with the sale.  One of the Boeing's 737 MAX 9 model, the company's newest commercial airplane, sits outside its production plant, in Washington, U.S., March 2017.Elaine Thompson/AP "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval," it said.  In December the European Union banned Aseman from flying to the EU due to safety concerns, highlighting gaps in Iran's ageing fleet following decades of sanctions.  The latest deal comes as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's government strives to highlight improvements resulting from the nuclear pact in the run-up to May presidential elections. So far IranAir has received three new Airbus jets under the deal.  Rouhani is likely to run a campaign highlighting economic benefits of the nuclear deal, which opened Iran to foreign investment. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said Rouhani must do more to improve the economy.  Negotiators from European turboprop maker ATR were meanwhile due in Tehran to wrap up a deal to sell 20 aircraft to IranAir, industry sources said. The first aircraft has been sitting on the tarmac in Toulouse, France, for weeks, waiting for the talks to be completed.  A deal for the airframes has already been reached but there has been uncertainty over the status of a separate deal needed for the engines, to be supplied by Pratt & Whitney Canada.  The company is a subsidiary of United Technologies, one of a handful of aerospace and defense groups covered by last month's retaliatory sanctions by Tehran against U.S. firms, though Iran has not explicitly targeted civil aircraft engines. Iranian officials have told Reuters finalizing the ATR deal depends on getting a contract for engine spares and long-term maintenance of the engines once the planes are delivered.  Pratt & Whitney Canada had no immediate comment.  Reuters Reuters Send me email alerts for new articles by Reuters Send Close Email * Please enter your email Reuters For a list of Haaretz newsletters, click here.

Boeing Co. announced Tuesday, April 4, 2017 that it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines for 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Chicago-based Boeing said the deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File ) TEHRAN, Iran – Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. “On the one hand, there’s the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. “They’ll have to make tough decisions.” Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation. Aseman is Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet. , flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran “on notice” when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. “This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran’s regional role,” Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” it said. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Stay Informed.

Roston - Apr 4, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Boeing has taken the wraps off its new Deep Space Gateway, a concept habitat that could serve as a crucial component for getting humans to Mars. According to Boeing, the company will use NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) to send the Deep Space Gateway up into space ‘in the early 2020s,’ doing so in four launches with components to assemble the habitat. Humans could use this as a stopping point of sorts on their way to Mars. The Deep Space Gateway can be thought of as something like the International Space Station, in that it could help with the exploration of space and accept shipments of various sorts, as well as accommodating humans who are on their way to other parts of space. For example, Boeing says this habitat could end up being ‘the waypoint for Mars missions.’ The company envisions a docking system not unlike what is found on the ISS, and it could be used to take on the Deep Space Transport vehicle for an eventual mission to Mars. The habitat would keep astronauts safe from space’s many harsh elements. That is all a vision for the distant future, however. On the immediate level, Boeing says the Deep Space Gateway will be sent into space near the Moon, where it’ll help provide a space for conducting critical research, and could also be used as part of commercial and government partnerships for the aforementioned mission (or others) into deep space. The habitat will be powered by a Solar Electric Propulsion system, the technology for which is partly being developed alongside NASA.

Unlike previous iterations of the Advanced Super Hornet—which Boeing was positioning to compete head-to-head with the stealthy single engine F-35—this version is a more modest effort designed to work with the Joint Strike Fighter and the Naval Integrated Fire Control Counter Air (NIFC-CA) network. “We’ve been working with the Navy over the last year—year-and-a-half—to understand what does the carrier air wing need from a complementary perspective with the F-35, with the [EA-18G] Growler, E-2D and Block III is that” Dan Gillian, Boeing’s F/A-18E/F program manager told The National Interest at the Navy League’s Sea Air and Space conference. “Block III is that complementary asset.” Compared to the 2013 version of the jet, Boeing is placing less emphasis on stealth, but the aircraft does retain some of the older concepts low observable enhancements, Gillian said. “That’s not what the future fight is about,” Gillian said. “The threat has migrated all over the place. Enough stealth is important but you don’t need it all the time all the stealth you could possibly get.” The major features that the new version retain from the 2013 concept are conformal fuel tanks. The new conformal fuel tanks add 3,500lbs of fuel to the jet and extend the aircraft’s range by nautical miles. “The conformal tanks are important since to need to get weapons out at range,” Gillian said. The new Block III also adds a new computer, new large-area cockpit display, a high-band width Tactical Targeting Network Technologies (TTNT) datalink, a new fuel tank-mounted long-wave infrared search and track system (IRST) and new integrated defensive electronic countermeasure Block IV suite. Additionally, the Block III Super Hornet will be built with a life-extended 9000-hour airframe life. Perhaps the most important upgrade is long-range IRST system—which is designed to be a counter-stealth sensor, Gillian said. the Navy considers to essential to countering new enemy stealth aircraft such as the Chinese J-20 and Russian PAK-FA. Gillian that Boeing and Navy solved many of the traditional issues associated with infrared sensors—but didn’t go into detail. Company officials have previously said the new IRST is able to derive accurate range data—enough to cue weapons. Gillian said that all of the new Block III aircraft Boeing delivers to the Navy will have these enhanced features, however, they could be retrofitted to older aircraft during a mid-life upgrade. The Block III could enter production in the 2020s, but that package of systems could begin retro fits shortly after. “By doing both those things, you could bring the inventory levels of the Block III up much faster,” Gillian said. The Navy has yet to decide how many Block III jets it will need, but the company can move relatively quickly in ramping up production. “We think we can get one squadron per carrier by the early to mid 20s,” Gillian said.

Thankfully, Boeing's all over it: On April 3, the company revealed its concepts for a lunar outpost and a deep space explorer. I'm not one to dole out compliments, but damn do they look good. Image: Boeing While details are still pretty thin on the timeline for these bad boys, there are a few things we know for sure: Boeing plans to use NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) — which, upon completion, will be the most powerful rocket the agency has ever built — in order to send a habitat into the Moon's orbit. This outpost, dubbed the Deep Space Gateway, will be similar to the International Space Station (ISS) in that it will create a space to do scientific research while providing a destination for transportation vehicles to dock. In theory, Boeing's Deep Space Transport vehicle could stop there on its way to the Red Planet, likely carrying humans. "The ability to simultaneously launch humans and cargo on SLS would allow us to assemble the gateway in four launches in the early 2020s," Pete McGrath, director of global sales and marketing for Boeing's space exploration division, said in a statement. Image: Boeing According to Boeing, both the Deep Space Gateway and the Deep Space Transport vehicle will utilise solar electric propulsion technology. The Deep Space Transport vehicle will have some sort of unspecified system to protect passengers from the harsh radiation from deep space, as it could pose a significant risk to their health. Then again, anything that has to do with the cold, unfeeling vacuum of the final frontier is going to come with some sort of risk. Though it will definitely take a while to get this space station and its intrepid explorer into space, I'm sure it will be worth the wait.

The Memorandum of Agreement, which includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAXs, is subject to government approval. Boeing in a statement said it had been authorised by the US government to negotiate the agreement following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord signed in 2015. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval,” the statement said. If the order is approved, deliveries would start in 2022. Boeing has already signed an order with an Iranian carrier since the US lifted restrictions on sales there. In December 2016 Iran Air ordered 80 Boeing aircraft including 50 737 MAX 8s and 30 777s. Delivery of those planes will start next year. Airbus has also done significant business in Iran recently with a December deal to sell 100 aircraft, worth up to USD$18 billion at list prices. Iran Air received the first of that order, an A321, in January.

(Associated Press files) By NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL, NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL, Associated Press Published: April 4, 2017, 4:50 PM A   A TEHRAN, Iran — Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. “On the one hand, there’s the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. “They’ll have to make tough decisions.” Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Home to 80 million people, Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wild card is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran. In February, the Trump administration said it was putting Iran “on notice” when it sanctioned more than two dozen people and companies in retaliation for a ballistic missile test. Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz said he believed the deal would encourage other Western companies to enter Iran despite the political rhetoric. “This will boost the previous agreement between Boeing and Iran Air while indicating the Trump administration is willing to continue to work with Iran despite various differences on the missile program and Iran’s regional role,” Leilaz said. Boeing seemed to be addressing Trump in its statement on the sale. “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” it said. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, a single-aisle plane which undergoes final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. Aboulafia, the aviation analyst, said ultimately the sales wouldn’t change Iran’s status in the Gulf, already home to three major long-haul carriers, or greatly affect Boeing’s bottom line. “This is not a market that means a great deal anymore,” he said. “It attracts headlines — and it has all kinds of political headaches and conflicts associated with it — but Iran as a world hub of aviation isn’t what it was.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

The layoffs include 1,500 mechanics and more than 300 engineers. Back in December , the company told employees it would thin out the workforce by the end of the year because of dwindling sales prospects and tough competition. The company said competitors at Airbus were streamlining their own operations.  Right now, Boeing employs more than 71,000 workers at its Washington plant.  Just last month, President  Donald Trump traveled  to Boeing's South Carolina plant to tout the company's accomplishments.

The agreement, marking its first plane sale to Iran under President Trump, also provides the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional planes. *Read more*: Boeing hits back at Airbus claims it would relish Brexit fallout According to the US department of commerce, an aerospace sale of this size creates or sustains around 18,000 jobs in the US. There had been uncertainty over the new administration's tolerance for US business dealings in Iran. Boeing had previously agreed a $16.6bn sale in Iran after the nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration, something Trump has been a vocal critic of. Boeing said it had negotiated the memorandum of agreement under authorisation from the US government, "following a determination that Iran had met its obligations under the nuclear accord signed in 2015". Iran's deal with world powers, limiting its enrichment of uranium in return for the removal of some international sanctions, allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. The aerospace giant said it continued to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran's airlines and any contracts with the carriers are contingent upon government approval. At the very beginning of Trump's presidency, some of his policy announcements had caused uncertainty for the company; risking disrupting business relations with China which is Boeing's biggest single jetliner customer. And in December, Trump tweeted threatening to cancel plans for new presidential jets. Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg reached out to the President and has since developed closer ties. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072 The President visited Boeing's campus in South Carolina last month to attend the unveiling of Boeing's new 787-10 Dreamliner, cementing more positive relations. *Read more*: Trump wants Boeing's Air Force One contract cancelled over cost » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Recent related news Boeing Roundup: $3 billion 737 deal with Iran… Poseidon sub-hunter jet deal worth $2 billionChicago-based Boeing (NYSE: BA) has operations around the country.

By Tas Bindi | April 5, 2017 -- 23:44 GMT (16:44 PDT) | Topic: Innovation (Image: Zunum Aero) Boeing's new HorizonX venture capital unit, joined by JetBlue Airways, has invested an undisclosed amount in Zunum Aero, a Kirkland, Washington-based startup that is developing short-haul electric aircraft to sell to major carriers for service on frequently travelled regional routes such as Boston to Washington DC, and San Francisco to Los Angeles. The three-year-old startup is currently building an aircraft that can accommodate 10 to 50 passengers as well as travel up to 700 miles initially, and as much as 1,000 miles by 2030. what's hot on zdnet Microsoft opens up more on data it's collecting with Windows 10 'We're opening up our data': This power firm is letting anyone plug into its figures iPhone, Android hit by Broadcom Wi-Fi chip bugs: Now Apple, Google plug flaws The 10 best smartphones of 2017 so far Given many carriers now favour larger aircraft that offer lower unit costs over small regional jets, Zunum said its aircraft would fill a "vast regional transport gap", with the potential to reduce travel times in busy corridors by as much as 40 percent, and by 80 percent in areas with less traffic. In addition, the startup claims that reduced operating costs -- thanks to no fuelling -- would enable 40 percent to 80 percent below current retail prices. The aircraft will initially feature hybrid propulsion, which Zunum said will deliver 80 percent lower emissions than existing aircraft. However, advancements in battery technology will mean that the aircraft's combustion engine can be replaced with an extra battery pack, thereby bringing emissions down to zero, the startup said. Zunum expects to complete its first plane by 2020, with the prototype to be finished in the next couple of years. The startup said it has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration on development of certification rules for electric aircraft, with a complete set of standards expected by 2018. As the automotive industry heads towards electric cars, electric aviation remains in its infancy -- not helped by existing battery weights and strict regulatory requirements. But moves are being made by a number of companies including Siemens, which recorded a successful trial of a 50kg electric motor in a light aircraft in Germany in July last year, and Airbus, which flew an electric motor-powered single-seat aircraft across the English Channel in 2015. Australian company MagniX also built a prototype motor for electric-powered planes recently, in conjunction with the University of Queensland and aerospace company Ferra. The motor will be trialled inside a light aircraft in 2020, MagniX said. In addition to Zunum, HorizonX has invested an undisclosed amount in Upskill, another Washington-based startup that provides software for industrial augmented reality wearables. Its technology aims to boost productivity for manufacturers, field services, and logistics companies. Boeing has used Upskill's software, Skylight, to reduce production time by 25 percent for technicians installing 130 miles of wiring in the company's 747-8 jumbo jets. The aerospace giant said its St Louis, Missouri-based VC unit, which is being led by former VP of strategy for Boeing Defense, Space, and Security Steve Nordlund, will have three focus areas: Investing in new ventures, identifying business opportunities for the company's aerospace capabilities, and assessing innovations such as autonomy, artificial intelligence, and additive manufacturing. "Our ability to identify, shape, and harness game-changing innovations wherever they are developed is key to sustaining and growing our leadership in aerospace," said Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chairman, president, and CEO. "Boeing HorizonX is tasked with ensuring we are fully engaged with opportunities from early stage companies, market trends, and emerging technologies while also fostering more rapid and effective internal innovation."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 April 2017 by Military News Arab World Diaspora’s Strong Attachment to Home could Play Role in Regional Development In the thick of the global immigration debate, the many benefits that diaspora populations bring to their host and home countries are at risk of being forgotten. The governments of most countries in the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) with large numbers of citizens scattered abroad—Palestine, Morocco, Iraq, Egypt, and Algeria—do little to reap the economic benefits of the bonds of kinship. With a diaspora equal to at least 5% of its total population, or 20 million people, the MENA region has a much higher proportion of its citizens living in the diaspora than the world average. Mobilizing MENA’s diaspora would tap the expertise and networks of its professionals worldwide, broadening their role beyond that of sending remittances back home. Remittances are valuable, particularly in times of hardship as a source of foreign exchange. MENA’s emigrants and their descendants sent about US$53 billion in remittances to relatives and friends back in their countries of origin in 2014, their value in Lebanon and Jordan making up about  15% of GDP in each country. A new World Bank Group report, Mobilizing the Middle East and North Africa Diaspora for Economic Integration and Entrepreneurship, argues that governments in MENA should give more formal recognition to the fact that their diaspora could play a much broader role in the transfer of other funds, like direct investment, as well as knowledge or “brain gain”, skills, and professional networks. Moving beyond remittances There are some examples of this in the MENA region already. A recent large investment by aircraft manufacturers Bombardier of Canada to produce aircraft parts in Morocco likely followed an earlier investment made by Boeing in 2001 that owed much to contacts established by an expatriate Moroccan at Boeing, leading to the contract, itself negotiated by the Moroccan government. “Personal ties can make global business easier,” states the report. “For me, the key information is it’s not just about remittances or governments in MENA thinking of the diaspora occasionally, only when they need it,” said Mariem Malouche, lead author of the report. “It’s about governments really reaching out to people and engaging them. There are millions of people living in the diaspora and they can play much more of a role in development.” According to Malouche, what surprised her most in researching the report on MENA was “the very high commitment of citizens living in the diaspora and how involved and engaged they are, not only with their country of origin but also with their city of origin.” A survey conducted among members of the MENA diaspora for the report concluded exactly this; the single most important factor in their interest was the sentiment of belonging. And the one reform that would most increase their involvement was for their respective governments to make them feel relevant, like active partners and actors capable of contributing in a broader variety of ways to the development of the local economy. Lebanon is an example of this: its established diaspora numbers millions of people around the world. Members of its diaspora said that giving Lebanese mothers married to non-Lebanese the right to pass their Lebanese citizenship on to their children would make a big difference to them. Other Lebanese living abroad said they would like the right to vote back home. The Philippines provides an example of good practice. With about 10 million of its citizens living and working abroad, its diaspora is equal to about 10% of its population, and it taps the potential by recognizing the positive role it can play. The Philippines manages its relations with its diaspora at cabinet level, allowing its citizens abroad dual citizenship and overseas voting. It acknowledges what the diaspora brings to its society as a whole but also what it needs to receive: for diaspora to function well, the report says host governments should be committed to treating migrant and diaspora populations well. The Philippines advocates in favor of the rights of its citizens abroad. Most importantly for its migrants themselves are the benefits they receive, such as global legal assistance, the portability of their pensions, and help to one day return home and reintegrate. More effort needed by governments Morocco, whose government says it has 2.8 million citizens in the diaspora, and Tunisia, 1.2 million citizens abroad, both have government offices for their diaspora communities, and allow dual citizenship and overseas voting. Algeria also makes some effort to engage its diaspora of about 1.7 million, though people who consider themselves French-Algerian sometimes choose not to vote in Algeria. But it takes more to encourage the diaspora to overcome its deep mistrust of MENA governments. Formal recognition of diaspora communities would reassure them and is also something “elite diaspora” are particularly sensitive to. At the moment, members of the diaspora cite “mentoring” and “joint collaboration” as their most common forms of involvement with people back home. Many are prepared to part with some money. In MENA, even amounts of up to $10,000 can give entrepreneurs a start. Unemployment in many MENA nations is high, particularly among young college graduates and women. These are groups of people who MENA citizens living abroad should find it easy to identify with—in part because the majority of MENA citizens working in the diaspora are young professionals themselves. If just 1 % of MENA’s diaspora is engaged more fully in the development of their countries of origin, that alone would mobilise 200,000 professionals, the actions of a few, as the report puts, making all the difference. Despite reservations, MENA respondents in the diaspora feel strongly connected to their countries of origin 85% of respondents said giving back to their country of origin is important to them 86% said they would like to be more connected to their country of origin 68% said they were willing to invest capital and trade with country of origin About one quarter said they would be willing to invest $10,000–$50,000 About half said weak business environment in country of origin is main obstacle Source: Mobilizing the Middle East and North Africa Diaspora for Economic Integration and Entrepreneurship CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious El fuerte apego de las diásporas del mundo árabe a sus países de origen podría ayudar al desarrollo regional Next PostNext Mobilizing the Middle East and North Africa Diaspora for Economic Integration and Entrepreneurship Search Recent Posts What Does Someone do If an Immigration Waiver Is Not Possible, Waiver-Strategy Explains LivVoIP.com Opens Corporate Offices in Whittier FLIR Systems to Release First Quarter 2017 Financial Results on Wednesday, April 26, 2017 Friedman LLP to be a Co-Organizer and Co-Producer of 21st Annual East Coast Gaming Congress, May 24-25 Canadian General Investments: Investment Update – Unaudited Business Directory Business Contacts Proudly powered by WordPress

Business Sixteen Years Later, Boeing Picks North Texas For A Division HQ Aerospace giant, which left Dallas at the altar in 2001, will locate its new Global Services unit in West Plano. By Glenn Hunter Published in Commercial Real Estate April 5, 2017 5:48 pm When the Boeing Co. picked Chicago over Dallas and Denver for its new corporate headquarters back in 2001, it rattled Big D into a period of self-reflection that, some say, helped jump-start new development in the central business district area. (The wife of Boeing’s then-CEO was said to have considered Dallas’ downtown a cultural backwater compared to the Windy City’s.) So, North Texas got a kind of revenge Tuesday when the aerospace giant announced it had selected a site here for the headquarters of its new Global Services business unit. The new division will be in Plano, not Dallas—but, hey, it’s close enough. Boeing’s new unit, which will be the company’s third major business division when it becomes operational in July, will occupy 18,000 square feet on a top floor at the 5905 Legacy Drive building in Legacy West, a mixed-use development in West Plano. President and CEO Stanley A. Deal leads the  Global Services unit, which was formed in November from the customer services groups within Boeing’s existing defense, space, and commercial sectors to “provide agile, cost-competitive services to commercial and defense customers worldwide,” the company said. About 50 people, including Deal, several of his leadership team members, and some support staff, will work in the leased space, which will serve as a central business hub for about 20,000 employees worldwide. Boeing will join other major tenants in the $3 billion Legacy West project including Toyota North America, FedEx Office, JPMorgan Chase, Liberty Mutual, Ryan LLC, and SAP America. In a statement, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said, “Texas continues to be a global powerhouse in business expansion and relocation because of our economic policies that encourage industry leaders, like Boeing, to expand their operations here.” Boeing already has a presence in North Texas with its Aviall and Jeppesen companies.

The hub, to open next week, will support advanced military systems and undertake research and development. The South Australian government is financially backing the project through Investment Attraction South Australia and Defence SA. Premier Jay Weatherill and Boeing Defence Australia managing director Darren Edwards signed a deed on Thursday locking in the two-way commitment. Mr Edwards said the American company's move into SA was a "long time coming". "This is the start of a journey for us. This is the start of growing much bigger in the state," he told reporters. Mr Weatherill said the Boeing hub would create flow-on effects for SA's economy and improve prospects for its university graduates. "What it's about is young people being able to stay here in Adelaide and get a great job," he told reporters. "It's always been a great place to live, it's becoming a really exciting place to live. The thing that's been missing is the great job." Boeing's biggest presence outside of the USA is in Australia, with Queensland boasting the lion's share of the 3000 Australian roles it maintains. The company, which manufactures commercial airliners, military aircraft and defence, space and security systems, has 140,000 employees worldwide. The SA government does not reveal how much it draws from its investment attraction fund to lure individual companies to the state, on commercial-in-confidence grounds. But it said its funding for the Boeing office would be linked with the company hitting certain employment milestones. Mr Edwards said the company was confident it would hit and exceed the targets. "Probably before five years we'll be trying to see if we can't push above that 250," he said. Beyond its deed with the government, Boeing announced on Thursday it would chip $500,000 into technology start-up accelerator Techstars' coming defence and security program in Adelaide. The Adelaide program, running from July to October, will help 10 companies create and commercialise state-of-the-art defence and security technology. © AAP 2017 South Australia Jobs Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

Zunum Aero is designing and building 10- to 50-seat planes for trips of 700 miles initially and as much as 1,000 miles by 2030. The aircraft would fill a “vast regional transport gap” and reduce travel times in busy corridors by as much as 40%, and by 80% in areas with less traffic, Zunum said in a statement Wednesday. Boeing and JetBlue are joining a rush by aviation and aerospace companies to scout investments in early-stage ventures and keep tabs on technology with the potential to transform transportation. European planemaker Airbus Group SE created a fund, capitalized with an initial $150 million commitment, and opened a Silicon Valley center in 2015. “Our charter is looking beyond the horizon,’’ said Steve Nordlund, who heads Boeing HorizonX, the Chicago-based manufacturer’s new venture-capital arm. “We’re looking at traditional, non-traditional partnerships that help us accelerate innovation and market opportunities.’’ In addition to Zunum, HorizonX is investing in Upskill, a company that combines augmented reality such as Google Glasses and wearable technology to boost productivity for manufacturers, field services and logistics companies. Boeing has used its offerings to cut production time by 25% for mechanics installing 130 miles of wiring in each of the company’s 747-8 jumbo jets. Popular Now What Could be Done about China's Theft of Intellectual Property? How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization Three Strategies for Employee Engagement Disruptive Innovations The new Boeing unit, which reports to Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, replaces Boeing Ventures. That St. Louis-based investment division was narrowly focused on supporting defense and space entrepreneurs like Insitu, Inc., a maker of unmanned aerial vehicles that Nordlund helped start and sell to Boeing in 2008. Boeing HorizonX will have three focus areas: investing in new ventures and startups, exploring fresh business opportunities for the company’s aerospace capabilities and assessing disruptive innovations and business strategies. It is exploring technologies including autonomy, artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing and alternative propulsion systems -- such as the hybrid-electric system that would power Zunum’s aircraft. Founded in 2013, Zunum expects to complete its first plane by 2020. The Kirkland, Washington-based company said it’s been working with the Federal Aviation Administration on development of certification rules for electric aircraft, with a complete set of standards expected by 2018. Serious Challenges “It’s a wonderful opportunity,” said Andrew Alleyne director of the National Science Foundation’s Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems. “But it comes with some serious technology challenges.” Developing an electric or hybrid-electric plane will require controlling battery weight, managing heat buildup and integrating power subsystems efficiently, said Alleyne, a professor at the University of Illinois. Composite materials used for the fuselage can magnify heat problems, he said. “If we can solve those here in the U.S., it puts us at a serious competitive advantage,” Alleyne said. Zunum and Boeing both are members of the center, which focuses on increasing the power density of the electrified transportation system in the U.S. “We believe that, just like Tesla is disrupting the auto industry, electric propulsion will disrupt the regional airline industry,” Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures, said in an interview, referring to carmaker Tesla Inc. “By investing now, we will literally have a seat at the table to see how this technology evolves.” Regional Flights Commercial aviation is focused on about 150 larger U.S. airports, said Simi, who oversees the JetBlue subsidiary started in February 2016. Zunum’s planes may bolster service to many of the nation’s 5,000 regional and general aviation hubs by reducing operating costs. The aircraft will have 80 percent lower emissions initially and will cut noise by 75 percent, Zunum said. JetBlue isn’t disclosing how much it’s investing. It will hold a minority stake in Zunum and a seat as a board observer. Zunum’s aircraft would compete in the market for smaller planes, where Boeing doesn’t have any product offerings. Hybrid-electric propulsion, which is being studied by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and others, has the potential to transform larger aircraft now powered by giant turbine engines. While Boeing is taking a minority stake in Zunum, it wouldn’t build the electric planes. “They’re looking at some disruption in that lower end of the market,’’ Nordlund said by phone. “We want to be close to them to see, number one, if we can be helpful in their success as one of their investors, as well as the innovation that we think they can bring forward.’’     Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Zunum Aero was founded in 2013 by Ashish Kumar, who previously worked at Microsoft and Google. The startup hopes to create a “regional electric air network,” offering travelers other options besides highways and high-speed rails. Read: NASA News: Tests For Lockheed Martin X-Plane Design For Quiet Supersonic Aircraft Begin The electric planes would fly up to 700 miles when it launches, and could go more than 1,000 miles by 2030. The aircraft would have 10 to 50 seats and will make electric air travel “fast and affordable,” Zunum Aero said. Zunum Aero, based in Kirkland, Wash., plans on doing this by tapping into 5,000 underused U.S. airports. "The shift of the industry to large aircraft and long ranges driven by gas turbines has concentrated almost all air traffic to just two percent of our airports, creating a massive transport gap over regional distances where there is no high-speed alternative,” said Kumar, CEO of Zunum Aero, in a statement. “As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago. Hybrid propulsion is an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-sized aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners.” Illustration of Zunum Aero hybrid-electric aircraft. Photo: Zunum Aero In an example, Zunum Aero said travelers would be able to fly from regional airports in the Boston area to Washington D.C. for half the fare and in half the time it currently takes door-to-door. The amount of time it takes to get from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles would also decrease with the hybrid aircraft, the company said.

Airfares with Zunum Aero would be at 40 percent to 80 percent lower than current prices, the company said. The startup has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration since 2014 to work on certification standards for electric aircraft. The company said it expects a complete set of standards for electric aircraft by next year, with first electrics likely to certify in 2020 when Zunum planes go on the market.

Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, DC-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp. Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Upskill said its software platform brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters. "Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual," Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production. Boeing declined to specify the investment amounts. "But this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts," spokesperson Chaz Bickers said. "While the levels of investment generally are not material to Boeing's financials, they generally will be to our target investments."

Canada’s definitive information source for Engineers, Product Designers & OEMs Design Engineering News Products Features Events More DEX Expo Digital Edition E-Newsletter Contacts Advertise E-newsletter Related Topics General Related Industries Aerospace Tagged with Boeing Iran Boeing signs $3 billon deal with Iranian airline Iran's Aseman Airlines purchased 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with first delivery expected in 2022. 0 April 4, 2017 by Nasser Karimi And Jon Gambrell, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS TEHRAN, Iran — Boeing Co. said on Tuesday it has signed a new, $3 billion deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines to supply 30 737 MAX aircraft to the carrier, the first major sale by a U.S. company to the Islamic Republic under new President Donald Trump. Photo courtesy of John Parker/Boeing. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration. Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured a Boeing plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. It said the first deliveries of the single-aisle aircraft to Aseman would start in 2022. Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, which undergo final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. “According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States,” Boeing said in a statement. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval.” Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told The Associated Press that the deal came following several round of talks over the past year between the airline and Boeing. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019, contradicting Boeing. The European Union blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal comes as part of the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. After the atomic accord, Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flag carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 per cent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve this latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wildcard is U.S. politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to the Islamic Republic.   News from © Canadian Press Enterprises Inc. 2016 Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags Boeing Iran Related Boeing, Airbus offer positive outlook for aircraft demand WTO rules Boeing offered illegal tax breaks in US Boeing reveals new U.S. military aircraft design Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:00 AM, April 6, 2017 Updated: 5:30 AM, April 6, 2017 SEATTLE - Boeing Co <BA.N> said on Wednesday it had launched a venture capital arm and invested in two tech startups, a fresh sign of the importance big companies see in keeping up with rapidly evolving technology for designing and making products. Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp <JBLU.O>. Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's <GE.N> venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX. "These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies," he said. Upskill's software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters. "Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual," Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production. Boeing declined to specify investment amounts, "but this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts," spokesman Chaz Bickers said. Nordlund was formerly vice president of strategy for Boeing's defense, space and security business and was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008. He also has worked in sales at IBM <IBM.N> and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

Dave Majumdar April 5, 2017 TweetShareShare Even as the U.S. Air Force is considering retiring its fleet of Boeing F-15C Eagles, the venerable air superiority fighter is showing just how capable it remains after decades in service. Last month, testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Air National Guard director Lt. Gen. Scott Rice and Air Force deputy chief of staff for operations Maj. Gen. Scott D. West told the Congress that the service is looking at potentially retiring the F-15C in favor of upgraded Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons. That’s despite the older jets’ grossly superior capabilities in the air combat arena. The Air Force potential move is part of an overarching service-wide cost savings drill. “We do have capacity in the F-16C community to recapitalize that radar to serve the same function as the F-15 has done and thereby reduce the different systems that we have to sustain and operate, so that makes it more efficient,” West told the Congress. But even just a year ago, Air Force officials including then Air Combat Command commander Gen. Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle and his predecessor Gen. Mike Hostage would often state that the service needed more dedicated air superiority assets because of the shortage of Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptors. The service ultimately procured less than half of the F-22s it needed to recapitalize it air superiority fleet and replace the F-15C. As such, both Carlisle and Hostage had often stated that the F-22/F-15C team would be continue as the Air Force’s air superiority force indefinitely. It is a combination that performs spectacularly well as a recent Air Force exercise once again demonstrated during a recent Weapons Systems Evaluation Program (WSEP) exercise—also known as Combat Archer—and a follow-on multinational exercise at Eglin AFB, Florida. The exercise included not only F-22s and F-15Cs, but also F-16s and Lockheed Martin F-35s. To add to the mix, the Royal Canadian Air Force deployed a number of Boeing CF-18 Hornets to the exercise. “The second piece of the deployment was large force exercises and 4-ship training which is the core fighting force in the Eagle,” said Col. William Bladen, 104th Fighter Wing, Operations Group Commander, in an Air Force release. “With several other fighter airframes on the Gulf Coast, we were able to put together daily outnumbered scenarios that we cannot produce up here at Barnes. The last day of the trip we flew 4 F-15s and 4 F-22s against 14 ‘red air’ fighters. For our training, we allowed the red air to regenerate after being killed by a blue air fighter. The final results of that mission: Blue Air killed 41 enemy aircraft and lost just one. While pretty phenomenal, perfection is our goal so the debrief focused on how we could have had a 41-0 ratio." The exercise reiterated just how lethal the F-22/F-15C combination truly is. Indeed, the Air Force recognizes that fact. It is likely that floating the idea of retiring the F-15C—which is considered by many to be the single greatest air superiority fighter ever built—might simply be a ‘test balloon’ to coax more funding out of the Congress. It’s very possible that the F-15C will the flying well past the mid-2020s that the Air Force is proposing as a potential retirement date.   Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for The National Interest.

In 2002 his wife Svetlana, 10-year-old son Konstantin and four-year-old daughter Diana were killed when the passenger plane they were travelling in collided at a right angle with a freight plane in mid-air. The crash over the German town of Uberlingen killed 71 victims, most of whom were Russian schoolchildren. Mr Kaloyev was one of the first relatives to arrive at the scene, and discovered the body of his daughter, still intact as trees had broken her fall, almost two miles from where the accident happened. Svetlana's body landed in a corn field, and Konstantin's body hit the road in front of a bus shelter. He was devastated. Konstantin and Diana Kaloyev were aged eight and four when they died (Photo: AFP) Vitaly Kaloyev and family (Photo: Unknown) A native of Vladikavkaz, near the border with Chechnya, at the time of the plane crash he had just concluded a two-year contract to work as a builder and architect on a project in Barcelona. He had decided to prolong his stay in Spain, and asked his family to fly out and join him for a month's holiday. He was waiting for them at Barcelona airport when he learned of the crash. It is almost impossible to imagine the grief he felt but some clue came in the online eulogy he wrote for his son. Shrines in the bedroom of tragic Svetlana, Diana and Konstantin Kaloyev in their home in Vladikavkaz. (Photo: AFP) Of Konstantin, who learned to speak at 18 months, read fairytales aged three, loved dinosaurs and at aged five played computer games, he wrote: "He would have become a good, well-educated person, useful to society, were it not for this tragedy, which I cannot get over. I have no strength." After the tragedy, Kaloyev stopped work, refused to shave and constantly wore black. He turned the family home in the Caucasian town of Vladikavkas into a shrine dedicated to his dead wife and children. The story of the plane crash now forms the basis of a new film Aftermath staring Arnold Schwarzenegger Photographs showed their beds covered with children's dolls, a schoolboy's chessboard, and boxes of his wife's favourite scent. The engineer used his life savings to pay for an elaborate tombstone displaying portraits of his family. It was that debilitating grief which led him two years later to the Swiss town of Kloten to confront the man he held responsible and avenge his family. Relatives of victims at the wreckage of the crashed Russian Tupolev 154 passenger plane, close to Uberlingen, after a commemorative service at the accident site in 2002 (Photo: AFP) Peter Nielsen, 36, was on duty alone in the Zurich control room on the night of the Überlingen crash when he gave only 44 seconds' warning to a Bashkirian Airlines aircraft and a DHL cargo craft that they were too close. The Russian flight would have been full of chatter travelling from Moscow to Barcelona carrying 60 passengers and nine crew, 45 of the passengers were children on a school trip and piloted by an experienced crew.

An employee of Swiss airspace control company Nielsen was manning two workstations while a colleague rested next door. He did not notice the two planes travelling at 36,000 feet were on collision course until they were less than a minute apart. The portrait, bed and toys of a 4-year-old Diana who died in the plane crash (Photo: Universal Images Group Editorial) An investigation which followed found he told the passenger plane crew to descend by a 1,000ft to avoid a collision but second after they changed course the in-built traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) told him to climb instead. Meanwhile on the Boeing the TCAS told that crew to descend too. Had both aircraft followed those automated instructions, the collision would not have occurred but instead, unaware of the TCAS instructions, Nielson repeated his instructions to the Russian plane and the crew ignored the automated warning. At 11.35pm the planes collided at almost a right angle at an altitude of 34,890 feet with the Boeing's tail vertical stabilizer slicing completely through Flight 2937 just ahead of the wings. The Russian plane broke up in mid-air with the nose section falling vertically and the rear section with the engines continuing, stalling and then plumetting. Meanwhile Captain Paul Phillips, 47, a father of three, and his Canadian-born co-pilot Brant Campioni would had a terrifying three-minute dive to ground unable to control their plane and knowing death was inevitable. Paul Phillips, DHL B757-200 captain, and his wife Ami (Photo: DHL) In the days and weeks after the crash investigators highlighted failings Nielsen's handling of the unfolding situation. He admitted his responsibility saying: "As a father I sense that this loss leaves a gap that will hurt. "On the night of the accident, I was part of a network of people, computers, monitoring and transmission devices and regulations. A family portrait shows Vitaly Kaloyev's with his wife Svetlana and son Konstantin (Photo: Reuters) "All these parts must work together seamlessly and without error, and they must be synchronised. "As an air traffic controller, it is my task and duty to prevent such accidents. "So many children lost their lives and so many hopes for the future were erased." He had a nervous breakdown shortly afterwards and spent a long time in therapy and on antidepressants and never returned to work in his former job. Heartbroken families demanded answers and one father tired to attack officials at a memorial service and sacks of hate mail and threats arrived at the offices of Skyguide the air traffic control firm. Nielsen was never publicly named but after the collision, his initials and a photograph of his flat were published in Swiss newspapers.

Kaloyev then hired a Moscow private investigator to find Nielsen's address outside Zürich. On the afternoon of February 24, 2004, a neighbour of the Nielsen family spotted an unfamiliar face and asked the man what he wanted. Brant Campioni, DHL B757-200 First Officer, died int he plane crash (Photo: DHL) He waved a piece of paper with the air traffic controllers name on it and she pointed to his front door. Kaloyev sat down in the garden. Nielsen, who had lived in Switzerland since 1995, and has just returned from a trip spotted the intruder, went outside and asked what he wanted. His three children accompanied him into the garden as well, but his wife Mette tried to call them back — still inside when she heard a "kind of scream". Vitaly Kaloyev and his daughter Diana near their home in Vladikavkaz. (Photo: AFP) She rushed outside and found her husband dying in a pool of blood having been stabbed with a 14cm blade in the stomach, heart and face. Kaloyev fled the scene but was captured by police at Zurich airport and was charged with murder. Margarita, wife to his brother Yuri, told a newspaper: "Vitali suffered everything alone. And after two years, he was in such a state that I would not be surprised if he would behave irrationally. "Anyone can put himself in his place: in a minute to lose all your family." At his trial Kaloyev said he wanted Nielsen to apologise to him for the death of his family. Kaloyev told the court his bundle of photographs had fallen to the ground and had made him feel as if his children were being 'thrown around in their coffins'. He said he was overcome by and could not remember what happened after that.

Throughout his two-day trial, Kaloyev looked at photographs of his smiling 10-year-old son, four-year-old daughter, and wife who were killed in the crash. He said he felt pity for Mr Nielsen's three children. Answering questions from the judge, Kaloyev said the plane crash above Lake Constance had ended his life. Vitaly Kaloyev as he talks to media at the airport in Moscow upon returning to Russia after being released from a Swiss prison (Photo: AFP) He said his children were the youngest on board Flight 2937, so there was no need for him to identify the bodies. Kaloyev said he was crushed by the loss of his family: "I have been living in the cemetery for almost two years, sitting behind their graves" In October 2005 he was sentenced to eight years in prison but just three years later he was released after appealing that his mental condition has not been sufficiently considered in sentencing. Vitally Kaloyev shakes hands with relatives upon his arrival to a home town of Vladikavkaz in 2007 following his release from jail. (Photo: AFP) Returning to his home in North Ossetian city of Vladikavkaz, Kaloyev was met with enthusiastic crowds who cheered him as a hero and it is where he lives today. In 2007 four air traffic controllers were spared prison sentences despite being convicted of manslaughter by negligence over the mid-air collision. Three executives, identified only by their initials, were given 12-month suspended sentences for contributing to the chain of errors and a fourth was fined £5,500 for failing to report a defective phone. For Kaloyev though, whose story forms the basis of the new Arnold Schwarzenegger film Aftermath, justice had already been done. In 2012 he told an interviewer "Killing him didn’t make me feel any better."

Log In Subscribe TwitterFacebook Search The Buzz U.S. Air Force Plans to Build at Least 400 New High-Tech ICBMs Kris Osborn April 5, 2017 TweetShareShare The new ICBMs will be deployed roughly within the same geographical expanse in which the current weapons are stationed. In total, dispersed areas across three different sites span 33,600 miles, including missiles in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Minot, North Dakota and Great Falls, Montana. The commander of U.S. Strategic Command, Air Force Gen. John E. Hyten, said the United States has about the right numbers of nuclear weapons, but they need to be modernized. A Pentagon statement said the General asked reporters to imagine what the world was like in the six years preceding the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. “In those six years, the world in conflict killed somewhere between 60 million and 80 million people,” he said. “That’s about 33,000 people a day, a million people a month.” The world has seen bloody conflicts -- Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom were awful, but nowhere near the level of carnage the world had experienced, he said. “The submarines are the most survivable element of it; the ICBMs are the most ready; the bombers are the most flexible,” he said. “When you put those pieces together, it gives our nation the ability to withstand any attack and respond if we are attacked, which means we won’t be attacked.” The Future of ICBMs:  The Air Force is now evaluating formal proposals from three vendors competiting to build hundreds of new, next-generation Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles designed to protect the US homeland well into the 2070s and beyond, service officials said. Submissions from Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed are now being reviewed by Air Force weapons developers looking to modernize the US land-based nuclear missile arsenal and replace the 1970s-era Boeing-built Minuteman IIIs. If one were to passively reflect upon the seemingly limitless explosive power to instantly destroy, vaporize or incinerate cities, countries and massive swaths of territory or people -- images of quiet, flowing green meadows, peaceful celebratory gatherings or melodious sounds of chirping birds might not immediately come to mind. After all, lethal destructive weaponry does not, by any means, appear to be synonymous with peace, tranquility and collective happiness. However, it is precisely the prospect of massive violence which engenders the possibility of peace.  Nuclear weapons therefore, in some unambiguous sense, can be interpreted as being the antithesis of themselves; simply put – potential for mass violence creates peace – thus the conceptual thrust of nuclear deterrence. It is within this conceptual framework, designed to save millions of lives, prevent major great-power war and ensure the safety of entire populations, that the U.S. Air Force is now vigorously pursuing a new arsenal of land-fired, Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, or ICBMs In an interview with Scout Warrior several months ago, Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein, Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, cited famous nuclear strategist Bernard Brodie as a way to articulate the seismic shift in thinking and tactics made manifest by the emergence of nuclear weapons. Considered to be among the key architects of strategic nuclear deterrence, and referred to by many as an “American Clausewitz,” Brodie expressed how the advent of the nuclear era changes the paradigm regarding the broadly configured role or purpose of weaponry in war. Weinstein referred to Brodie’s famous quote from his 1940s work “The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order.” --- "Thus far the chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From now on, its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose.” The success of this strategy hinges upon the near certainty of total annihilation, should nuclear weapons be used. ICBMs are engineered to fly through space on a total flight of about 30 mins before detonating with enormous destructive power upon targets. “If another nation believes they can have an advantage by using a nuclear weapon, that is really dangerous. What you want to do is have such a strong deterrent force that any desire to attack with nuclear weapons will easily be outweighed by the response they get from the other side. That's the value of what the deterrent force provides,” Weinstein said in an exclusive interview with Scout Warrior. Althought Weinstein did not take a position on the pior administration's considerations about having the U.S. adopt a No First Use, or NFU, nuclear weapons policy, Air Force Secretary Deborah James has expressed concern about the possiblity, in a news report published by Defense News. Limiting the U.S. scope of deterrence, many argue, might wrongly encourage potential adversaries to think they could succeed with a limited first nuclear strike of some kind. Ground-Based Strategic Deterrence:  It is within the context of these ideas, informing military decision-makers for decades now, that the Air Force is in the early stages of building, acquiring and deploying a higher-tech replacement for the existing arsenal of Minuteman III ICBMs. Weinstein pointed out that, since the dawn of the nuclear age decades ago, there has not been a catastrophic major power war on the scale of WWI or WWII.

Zunum Aero Advertisement Boeing Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. are investing in a startup developing an electric-powered aircraft with the potential to transform short-haul flights. Zunum Aero is designing and building 10- to 50-seat planes for trips of 700 miles initially and as long as 1,000 miles by 2030. The aircraft would fill a “vast regional transport gap” and reduce travel times in busy corridors by as much as 40% — and by 80% in areas with less traffic — Zunum said in a statement Wednesday. Boeing and JetBlue are joining a rush by aviation and aerospace companies to scout investments in early-stage ventures and keep tabs on technology with the potential to transform transportation. European planemaker Airbus Group SE created a fund, capitalized with an initial $150 million commitment, and opened a Silicon Valley center in 2015. “Our charter is looking beyond the horizon,’’ said Steve Nordlund, who heads Boeing HorizonX, the Chicago-based manufacturer’s new venture-capital arm. “We’re looking at traditional, non-traditional partnerships that help us accelerate innovation and market opportunities.’’ Popular Now GE Digital's Secret Weapon Three Strategies for Employee Engagement How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization In addition to Zunum, HorizonX is investing in Upskill, a company that combines augmented reality such as Google Glasses and wearable technology to boost productivity for manufacturers, field services and logistics companies. Boeing has used its offerings to cut production time by 25% for mechanics installing 130 miles of wiring in each of the company’s 747-8 jumbo jets. The new Boeing unit, which reports to Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, replaces Boeing Ventures. That St. Louis-based investment division was narrowly focused on supporting defense and space entrepreneurs like Insitu, Inc., a maker of unmanned aerial vehicles that Nordlund helped start and sell to Boeing in 2008. Boeing HorizonX will have three focus areas: investing in new ventures and startups, exploring fresh business opportunities for the company’s aerospace capabilities and assessing disruptive innovations and business strategies. It is exploring technologies including autonomy, artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing and alternative propulsion systems — such as the hybrid-electric system that would power Zunum’s aircraft. Founded in 2013, Zunum expects to complete its first plane by 2020. The Kirkland, Washington-based company said it’s been working with the Federal Aviation Administration on development of certification rules for electric aircraft, with a complete set of standards expected by 2018. Love tech? Keep up with the manufacturing technology world with the M&T Newsletter, in your inbox every Friday morning “We believe that, just like Tesla is disrupting the auto industry, electric propulsion will disrupt the regional airline industry,” Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures, said in an interview, referring to carmaker Tesla Inc. “By investing now, we will literally have a seat at the table to see how this technology evolves.” Commercial aviation is focused on about 150 larger U.S. airports, said Simi, who oversees the JetBlue subsidiary started in February 2016. Zunum’s planes may bolster service to many of the nation’s 5,000 regional and general aviation hubs by reducing operating costs. The aircraft will have 80% lower emissions initially and will cut noise by 75%, Zunum said. JetBlue isn’t disclosing how much it’s investing. It will hold a minority stake in Zunum and a seat as a board observer. Zunum’s aircraft would compete in the market for smaller planes, where Boeing doesn’t have any product offerings. Hybrid-electric propulsion, which is being studied by NASA and others, has the potential to transform larger aircraft now powered by giant turbine engines. While Boeing is taking a minority stake in Zunum, it wouldn’t build the electric planes. “They’re looking at some disruption in that lower end of the market,’’ Nordlund said by phone. “We want to be close to them to see, number one, if we can be helpful in their success as one of their investors, as well as the innovation that we think they can bring forward.’’ By Mary Schlangenstein and Julie Johnsson Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

New startups want to reduce emissions and noise by electrifying aircraft, but better batteries remain a stumbling block. by Jamie Condliffe April 5, 2017 Recommended for You A Robot with Its Head in the Cloud Tackles Warehouse Picking Meet the Guys Who Sold “Neuralink” to Elon Musk without Even Realizing It Is This the Anti-Aging Pill We’ve All Been Waiting For? Self-Driving and Electric Cars Are Going to Have Tons of Strange Effects on Society Can This Dumb Phone Free Us from Smartphone Addiction? Fasten your seat belts, ensure tables are stowed—and check the batteries for charge. At least, that’s what the preflight checklist might be for a pair of plucky new startups promising to build passenger electric airplanes inside a decade. Zunum Aero, backed by both Boeing and JetBlue, today announced plans to build a fleet of electric planes that could each ferry 10 to 50 people as far as 700 miles. Zunum plans to make use of underutilized airports in the U.S. in order to provide more efficient regional travel, a kind of bus service in the air. It's aiming to start operating flights by the early 2020s. Zunum joins Wright Electric, fresh out of Y Combinator, which last month described its own plans to build electric airplanes. Wright's aircraft would be larger, capable of carrying 150 people on journeys of up to 300 miles—enough to allow it to fly trips between London and Paris. It hopes to be flying within 10 years. They’ll find themselves up against competition from larger established players. In the past, Boeing has experimented with fuel-cell light aircraft and, more recently, Airbus has been testing an entirely battery-powered two-seater called E-Fan. Their goals are laudable. The aviation industry accounts for greenhouse gas emissions similar to those produced by the whole of Germany, so even cutting emissions from just regional flights would be a start on helping clean up the planet. And electric airplanes make less noise than their regular counterparts, so residents of the relatively quiet regional airports being targeted by Zunum shouldn’t find themselves disturbed too much. Both Zunum and Wright are gambling on improving battery technology to make their business proposals truly fly. As we’ve reported in the past, the technology required to fly small two- or four-seater electric airplanes has advanced, and the idea certainly isn’t as farfetched as it once seemed. But hauling 50 people or more is a much bigger challenge, one that will require much larger aircraft and far more power. While solar panels may have helped a lightweight airplane to circumnavigate the world, they’re not a practical option for larger craft. Realistically, that means better batteries will be required in order for all-electric commercial aviation to take off. But big advances in commercial battery technology have proved hard to come by, and it’s not clear how long it might be before the next one. If a battery breakthrough isn't forthcoming, Zunum and Wright may be forced to use hybrid technologies—which could deliver some, but not all, of the advantages the companies are promising—to get their businesses off the ground.

By: Bloomberg | Dallas | Updated: April 5, 2017 7:31 pm Zunum Aero is designing and building 10- to 50-seat planes for trips of 700 miles initially and as much as 1,000 miles by 2030. ( Source: Zunum) Boeing Co. and JetBlue Airways Corp. are investing in a startup developing an electric-powered aircraft with the potential to transform short-haul flights. Zunum Aero is designing and building 10- to 50-seat planes for trips of 700 miles initially and as much as 1,000 miles by 2030. The aircraft would fill a “vast regional transport gap” and reduce travel times in busy corridors by as much as 40 percent, and by 80 percent in areas with less traffic, Zunum said in a statement Wednesday. Boeing and JetBlue are joining a rush by aviation and aerospace companies to scout investments in early-stage ventures and keep tabs on technology with the potential to transform transportation. European planemaker Airbus Group SE created a fund, capitalized with an initial $150 million commitment, and opened a Silicon Valley center in 2015. Also Read: Tesla is coming to India this summer, confirms Elon Musk in tweet “Our charter is looking beyond the horizon,” said Steve Nordlund, who heads Boeing HorizonX, the Chicago-based manufacturer’s new venture-capital arm. “We’re looking at traditional, non-traditional partnerships that help us accelerate innovation and market opportunities.” In addition to Zunum, HorizonX is investing in Upskill, a company that combines augmented reality such as Google Glasses and wearable technology to boost productivity for manufacturers, field services and logistics companies. Boeing has used its offerings to cut production time by 25 percent for mechanics installing 130 miles of wiring in each of the company’s 747-8 jumbo jets. Disruptive Innovations The new Boeing unit, which reports to Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith, replaces Boeing Ventures. That St. Louis-based investment division was narrowly focused on supporting defense and space entrepreneurs like Insitu, Inc., a maker of unmanned aerial vehicles that Nordlund helped start and sell to Boeing in 2008. Boeing HorizonX will have three focus areas: investing in new ventures and startups, exploring fresh business opportunities for the company’s aerospace capabilities and assessing disruptive innovations and business strategies. It is exploring technologies including autonomy, artificial intelligence, additive manufacturing and alternative propulsion systems — such as the hybrid-electric system that would power Zunum’s aircraft. Also Read:  BMTC unveils India’s first electric bus Founded in 2013, Zunum expects to complete its first plane by 2020. The Kirkland, Washington-based company said it’s been working with the Federal Aviation Administration on development of certification rules for electric aircraft, with a complete set of standards expected by 2018. “We believe that, just like Tesla is disrupting the auto industry, electric propulsion will disrupt the regional airline industry,” Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures, said in an interview, referring to carmaker Tesla Inc. “By investing now, we will literally have a seat at the table to see how this technology evolves.” Regional Flights Commercial aviation is focused on about 150 larger U.S. airports, said Simi, who oversees the JetBlue subsidiary started in February 2016. Zunum’s planes may bolster service to many of the nation’s 5,000 regional and general aviation hubs by reducing operating costs. The aircraft will have 80 percent lower emissions initially and will cut noise by 75 percent, Zunum said. JetBlue isn’t disclosing how much it’s investing. It will hold a minority stake in Zunum and a seat as a board observer. Also Read: Next-generation, garnet-based batteries to power cars, devices Zunum’s aircraft would compete in the market for smaller planes, where Boeing doesn’t have any product offerings. Hybrid-electric propulsion, which is being studied by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and others, has the potential to transform larger aircraft now powered by giant turbine engines. While Boeing is taking a minority stake in Zunum, it wouldn’t build the electric planes. “They’re looking at some disruption in that lower end of the market,” Nordlund said by phone. “We want to be close to them to see, number one, if we can be helpful in their success as one of their investors, as well as the innovation that we think they can bring forward.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Boeing JetBlue Zunum Aero Best of Express Alwar gau rakshak attack did not happen: Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi EntertainmentVinod Khanna suffering from cancer?

The Kirkland, Washington-based company said it’s been working with the Federal Aviation Administration on development of certification rules for electric aircraft, with a complete set of standards expected by 2018. Serious Challenges “It’s a wonderful opportunity,” said Andrew Alleyne director of the National Science Foundation’s Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems. “But it comes with some serious technology challenges.” Developing an electric or hybrid-electric plane will require controlling battery weight, managing heat buildup and integrating power subsystems efficiently, said Alleyne, a professor at the University of Illinois. Composite materials used for the fuselage can magnify heat problems, he said. “If we can solve those here in the U.S., it puts us at a serious competitive advantage,” Alleyne said. Zunum and Boeing both are members of the center, which focuses on increasing the power density of the electrified transportation system in the U.S. “We believe that, just like Tesla is disrupting the auto industry, electric propulsion will disrupt the regional airline industry,” Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures, said in an interview, referring to carmaker Tesla Inc. “By investing now, we will literally have a seat at the table to see how this technology evolves.” Regional Flights Commercial aviation is focused on about 150 larger U.S. airports, said Simi, who oversees the JetBlue subsidiary started in February 2016. Zunum’s planes may bolster service to many of the nation’s 5,000 regional and general aviation hubs by reducing operating costs.

Zunum Aero’s electric passenger plane hopes to offer cheaper flights by 2020 Posted 18 hours ago by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story At Ramtin Naimi’s Abstract Ventures, investing and philanthropy go hand in hand Zunum Aero, a company backed by funding from Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue’s tech venture arm, has revealed its plans to create a hybrid electric aircraft designed for regional flights with plans to fly by 2020. The aircraft would have a range of around 700 miles at launch, and the plan is to get that up to over 1,000 miles by 2030, which means it could service many popular commuter routes in the U.S., potentially. The Zunum Aero plane is designed around the idea that by routing more traffic to regional hub airports, and providing much lower operating costs for smaller craft with between 10 and 50 seats that do short-haul trips, between locations like L.A. and Silicon Valley, air travel can become much more efficient and convenient for commuters.  Zunum says that air travel between hubs as an alternative to slower options like overland rail and highways hasn’t really gotten any better in the last 50 years, but it hopes to change the economics with its electric drive technology. The use of electric drive systems will help Zunum Aero achieve hard targets including a 40 percent decrease in the overall travel time between spots on busy commuter corridors, or by up to 80 percent on routes that have less traffic. Costs will be reduced by between 40 to 80 percent, too, which could accommodate a corresponding decline in fares. Even with the hybrid tech, the planes will result in 80 percent decreased emissions vs. purely gas-powered regional jets, with the ultimate aim of working on 100 percent battery power with zero emissions once battery density capability catches up. Finally, Zunum Aero promises a 75 percent drop in community noise, which could dramatically increase both the hours of operation for smaller regional airports, and the willingness of communities to allow the existence of hubs to begin with, and larger planes with higher seating capacity on existing routes. In addition to funding from Boeing and JetBlue, Zunum has a team that includes a leader from a previous NASA-backed project on developing electric drives for airliners, and a long-term partnership in place for research on electric systems power optimization with the University of Illinois. It’s also been in close contact with the FAA since 2014 to work on certification standards for electric aircraft, so it’s up to date on the regulatory environment, too, and is helping shape what that looks like. Cheap, quiet, environment-friendly air travel sounds like a dream, but let’s hope this is a dream that becomes reality in the timeframe Zunum is targeting. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Yahoo and AOL combine to become Oath | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Transportation Popular Posts Featured Stories Boeing and ULA show off their emergency rocket rescue zipline VIDEO | 1:56 | News SpaceX spent ‘less than half’ the cost of a new first stage on Falcon 9 relaunch 8 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Uber finds one allegedly stolen Waymo file – on an employee’s personal device 12 hours ago | Kate Conger Google says its custom machine learning chips are often 15-30x faster than GPUs and CPUs 13 hours ago | Frederic Lardinois YouTube’s live TV streaming service goes live in five US cities for $35 per month 14 hours ago | Greg Kumparak Latest From TechCrunch Twitter launches a ‘lite’ mobile web app that’s optimized for emerging markets 14 minutes ago | Jon Russell Uber responds to the New York Times article about how it psychologically manipulates drivers 2 hours ago | Catherine Shu Africa Roundup: Google expands, 500 Startups tours, BRCK launches SupaBRCK 2 hours ago | Jake Bright Twitter ads starring Trump pop up in Tokyo train stations 4 hours ago | Taylor Hatmaker Comment moderation powered by Up Next At Ramtin Naimi’s Abstract Ventures, investing and philanthropy go hand in hand Posted 18 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Manager of Marketing Ops and Analytics (REMOTE) @ Plex at Plex (San Francisco, CA, United States) Digital Strategies / Webmaster Director at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Carolinas Realty (Charlotte, NC, United States) IT Services Support Tech - Alfred Music (a Peaksware company) at Peaksware (Los Angeles, CA, United States) SysAdmin DevOps at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) SysAdmin DevOps at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip Activations Blog International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

The CH-53K will go up against the Boeing CH-47F Block 2 Chinook Extended Range for Germany's upcoming heavy-lift helicopter requirement. Source: IHS Markit/Gareth Jennings Sikorsky has welcomed the US government's decision to authorise production of its CH-53K King Stallion as a means of turning the narrative upside down that its heavy-lift helicopter is still developmental while its Boeing CH-47F Block 2 Chinook competitor is a fielded and proven offering for Germany. Speaking to Jane's the day before the Milestone C decision was made on 5 April, Frank Crisafulli, business development lead for heavy-lift helicopters at Sikorsky said that the production decision means it is the CH-53K rather than the CH-47F Block 2 that is the ready and mature solution for Germany's Schweren Transporthubschrauber (STH) replacement programme for the country's ageing CH-53G heavy-lift platforms. "The Milestone C production decision ... is a big deal as it counters the argument that the CH-53K is immature while the CH-47F Block 2 is mature. It actually turns that argument on its head, as the CH-47F Block 2 is still awaiting its development decision. The CH-53K is the only truly heavy-lift production helicopter that is flying and on the market today," Crisafulli said. Germany is expected to issue a formal request for proposals (RFP) for an expected 41 helicopters (with options to take the buy-up to 60) in 2018, with the selected platform entering Bundeswehr service in about 2023. The CH-53K and CH-47F Block 2 Extended Range (ER) are the only platforms competing for the EUR4 billion (USD4.3 billion) requirement. The CH-53K and CH-47F Block 2 are based on legacy platforms that have been in service since 1966 and 1962, respectively. However, while the Boeing product is the latest iteration of a helicopter that has been continually upgraded and modernised throughout the course of its operational life, Sikorsky's is essentially a new aircraft with the latest technology and systems. "I was in Iraq [as a US Marine Corps CH-53E pilot], and I love the CH-47 - it's a great helicopter," Crisafulli said. Want to read more?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION How Zunum Aero plans to revolutionize air travel with electric planes and regional airports Paul Sawers@psawers April 5, 2017 2:00 AM Tags: Boeing, JetBlue, JetBlue Technology Ventures, top-stories, Zunum Aero Image Credit: Shutterstock A new aviation startup is launching out of stealth today with plans to facilitate a U.S. regional hybrid-electric aircraft network by the beginning of the next decade. Founded out of Kirkland, Washington in 2013, Zunum Aero is striving to “take aviation into the future” with 10-50 seat aircraft that use thousands of quieter regional airports to transport people up to 700 miles starting from the early 2020s. The company says it expects to increase the range to 1,000 miles by 2030. In a nutshell, Zunum Aero is looking to better utilize underused airport inventory. Currently more than 95 percent of all U.S. air traffic emanates from only 2 percent of the country’s 5,000 airports. The long-term aim of Zunum Aero is to build a regional electric air network, offering travelers a 40 percent decrease in door-to-door travel time by using a smattering of local airports, while also promising 80 percent lower emissions. Additionally, the company says it has lower in-house operating costs, which will mean up to 80 percent cheaper fares. Above: Zunum aircraft The model that Zunum Aero is working on is more or less designed to replicate that of bus travel — “walk-on, walk-off” aircraft that don’t require a 2.5 hour journey to the nearest major airport. By way of example, passengers can expect to travel from regional airports in the Boston area to Washington, DC for “half the fare and in half the time it takes today door-to-door,” according to a statement issued by the company. “The shift of the industry to large aircraft and long ranges driven by gas turbines has concentrated almost all air traffic to just two percent of our airports, creating a massive transport gap over regional distances where there is no high-speed alternative,” said Zunum Aero cofounder and CEO Ashish Kumar. “As a result, door-to-door times for most journeys are no better than they were 50 years ago. Hybrid propulsion is an industry-changing solution, enabling mid-sized aircraft on regional routes to have better cost efficiencies than airliners.” Zunum Aero hasn’t revealed how much financial backing it has, but it says that both Boeing and JetBlue, via its JetBlue Technology Ventures subsidiary, have invested in the company. “Boeing is investing in Zunum because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space,” explained Steve Nordlund, VP of strategy at Boeing. “This technology and customer approach has the potential to transform the market for small, short-haul aircraft that can use smaller regional airports.” Who needs roads? Though autonomous cars and electric road-faring vehicles have been grabbing most of the transport-related tech headlines of late, there has also been a quiet surge in innovations across the aviation realm too. Earlier this year, Airbus confirmed plans to test a prototype of a self-piloted flying car by the end of 2017, as it looks to invest in solving the growing gridlock on city roads. This followed shortly after fledgling startup Lilium Aviation announcing a $10.7 million funding round for its vertical take-off and landing jet. Elsewhere, Massachusetts-based Terrafugia has been developing working prototypes of roadable aircraft for more than a decade, and it recently received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that paves the way for it to get unmanned passenger vehicles in the skies by 2018. Keen not to be left behind in any transport-related advances, Uber recently released a whitepaper that considers a time when on-demand urban air transportation is commonplace, with networks of small electric aircraft taking off and landing vertically, bypassing the need for airports at all and opening up routes between cities and suburbs. “On-demand aviation has the potential to radically improve urban mobility, giving people back time lost in their daily commutes,” the paper reads. “Just as skyscrapers allowed cities to use limited land more efficiently, urban air transportation will use three-dimensional airspace to alleviate transportation congestion on the ground.” Above: Uber’s fantastical future vision Google cofounder Larry Page is backing not one, but two secret flying car startups: Zee was founded in 2010 with a view toward “designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B,” as the blurb on the company’s homepage states. It’s currently working on a “small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically,” according to a Bloomberg report. Page is also reportedly backing a second secret flying car startup called Kitty Hawk, which is based just a stone’s throw from Zee in Silicon Valley. Zunum Aero has been working with the FAA since 2014 as it looks to help push through certification standards for electric aircraft, an outcome that’s expected next year. And it anticipates that its first aircraft will hit the market in around 2020. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

The MOU, penned in Tehran, also provides the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional 737 MAXs and the American plane maker is to start delivering the airplanes from 2022. According to Aseman’s office of public relations, issues regarding technical support and training were also covered in the deal.   Boeing announced on Tuesday that the company will look to the Office of Foreign Assets Control for approval to perform under this transaction. Earlier in December 2016, the Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran Air) signed a $16.6 billion deal to buy 80 passenger planes from Boeing. The deal included the purchase of 50 narrow-bodied 737 planes and 30 long-range 777s which are due to be delivered in a 10-year period starting from 2018. Iran Air-Boeing agreement was the first of its kind since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and came after most international sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of its nuclear deal with world powers.

Elaine Thompson AP i By NASSER KARIMI and JON GAMBRELL Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TEHRAN, Iran Boeing Co. has signed a $3 billion deal with an Iranian airline for 30 new aircraft, officials said Tuesday, in the first major sale by a U.S. company in the Islamic Republic since the Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Tehran. The deal for the 30 737 MAX aircraft, which includes an option for another 30, could force Trump to choose between two major campaign promises: Taking a harder line against Iran or defending American manufacturing jobs. Some engine parts for the 737 MAX are designed and built by Boeing in North Charleston. The new agreement comes on top of the $16.6 billion sale Boeing previously made in Iran following the landmark nuclear deal struck under the Obama administration. President Donald Trump long has criticized the atomic deal, though he toured Boeing’s North Charleston plant in February and touted the firm’s work as proof of a coming American manufacturing renaissance. “On the one hand, there’s the attraction of jobs and export orders for American goods. On the other hand, of course, they were elected partly on the promise of getting tough on Iran,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst and vice president of analysis at the Virginia-based Teal Group. “They'll have to make tough decisions.” Chicago-based Boeing struck the deal with Iran’s Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation. Aseman, Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet, flies domestic and international routes. Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi said the deal came following several rounds of talks with Boeing over the past year. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019. Boeing said the first delivery would be in 2022. The European Union blacklisted Aseman in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month. The new Boeing deal was made possible by the nuclear agreement reached between Iran and world powers. Boeing struck a December deal with Iran Air, the country’s flagship carrier, for 80 passenger planes worth $16.6 billion. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s. In January, Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, later said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the initial sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the U.S. Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. The Treasury similarly would need to approve the latest deal. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts.

(AP) TEHRAN: Boeing Co. said on Tuesday it has signed a deal worth $3 billion with Iran’s Aseman Airlines to supply 30 737 MAX aircraft to the carrier, the first major sale by a US company to Tehran under President Donald Trump. The new agreement comes on top of the sale worth $16.6 billion Boeing previously made in Iran following the nuclear deal struck with Tehran under the Obama administration. Boeing said the deal also includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes. It said the first deliveries of the single-aisle aircraft to Aseman would start in 2022. Boeing lists 3,621 unfilled orders for the 737 MAX aircraft, which undergo final assembly in Renton, Washington. The first is expected to be delivered to Norwegian Air Shuttle in May. “According to the US Department of Commerce, an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the US,” Boeing said in a statement. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval.” Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told the AP that the deal came following several rounds of talks over the past year between the airline and Boeing. He said the firms signed the deal March 18 and the first aircraft will be delivered in 2019, contradicting Boeing. The EU blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December because of safety concerns. The airline did not operate flights to European destinations at the time. Less than a week after that decision, the airline sealed a deal to lease seven planes made by European manufacturer Airbus. Those aircraft are expected to begin arriving next month.

Washington granted permission for Boeing and Airbus to make the sales in September. Both manufacturers needed the approval of the US Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the airplanes’ components are of American origin. Iran represents one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for deals worth billions of dollars. Another wildcard is US politics. Trump has threatened to renegotiate terms of the Iran deal, while some lawmakers have suggested putting new sanctions in place and criticized Boeing for selling aircraft to Iran.

Boeing, a leading commercial aerospace company and a top American exporter, said in a statement that the agreement, which requires U.S. government approval, would create about 18,000 American jobs. The company’s agreement with Aseman Airlines, an Iranian carrier described as the nation’s third-largest, is the first to be announced by any big American business with Iran since President Trump took office in January. Boeing announced an agreement last December to sell 80 commercial aircraft to Iran Air, the national carrier, a deal valued at $16.6 billion. Commercial aircraft sales to Iran are permitted under the nuclear agreement reached in 2015 involving Iran and major global powers, including the United States. The agreement relaxed many economic sanctions against Iran in return for the country’s verifiable pledges that its nuclear work would be peaceful in nature. Trump has repeatedly denounced the nuclear agreement, describing it as a giveaway to a country that he and his aides have called a leading state sponsor of terrorism and a destabilizing force in the Middle East. But Trump also has vowed to protect U.S. industries and workers from foreign competition. Aerospace analysts said that together, Boeing’s deals with Iran amount to a test of the Trump administration’s priorities. If Boeing is forbidden to sell the aircraft to Iran, plane makers in other countries might fill the gap. “There was always going to be a clash over this issue,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group, an aviation research consultancy in Fairfax, Va. “Trump campaigned on getting tough with Iran,” Aboulafia said, but “at the end of the day, these are manufacturing jobs. It’s really hard to say, ‘Yes, we are giving this work to the Europeans.’ ” The Boeing announcement contrasted with other signs of growing hostility between the Trump administration and Iran. Last month, the United States imposed sanctions on 25 Iranian entities and individuals over what the White House called illegal Iranian missile tests. Trump included Iran on the blacklist of Muslim-majority countries subject to his proposed visa ban, which is currently blocked in the courts. It was not clear from the Boeing announcement whether the tentative deal with Aseman Airlines had been negotiated under Trump or under President Obama. Boeing officials did not immediately return emailed requests for comment. The announcement, posted on Boeing’s website, said Aseman intended to purchase 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft valued at $3 billion, with rights to purchase an additional 30. Deliveries would be scheduled to start in 2022. Aseman currently has a fleet of 31 aircraft, a mixture of Boeing, Airbus and Fokker models with an average age of 25 years, according to the website Planespotters.net. The Boeing deal requires permission from the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department. U.S. critics of Iran in Congress and elsewhere have repeatedly objected to Boeing’s plans to sell new aircraft to Iran, arguing that at least some of the planes could be diverted for illicit military use.

It is the first major sale to Iran by a US company under the new Trump administration. Reportedly the European Union has blacklisted Aseman from European skies in December last year due to safety concerns. It is not the first time Boeing has been active here. It previously agreed a $16.6bn sale in the Islamic Republic when Barack Obama was in power and after he struck a nurcear deal with Tehran  - an agreement which Trump has criticized. Boeing said today's deal includes purchase rights for an additional 30 737 MAX aircraft for Tehran-based Aseman, which flies domestic and international routes and revealed first deliveries would start in 2022.

(Photo: Randall Hill/Reuters/Newscom) Commentary By Diane Katz / @Dianeskatz Diane Katz, who has analyzed and written on public policy issues for more than two decades, is a research fellow in regulatory policy at The Heritage Foundation. Read her research. The annual conference of the Export-Import Bank begins Thursday, which is an opportune time to catch up with the federal agency that doles out billions of dollars in subsidies to benefit foreign governments and titans of industry. Of particular interest are transaction details that the bank won’t reveal, as well as its relatively limp support for small business. Over at the bank’s downtown District of Columbia headquarters, most everyone is concerned about what President Donald Trump will do. The Ex-Im charter is authorized through September 2019, but there are three vacancies on the five-seat board of directors. The lack of a quorum limits the size of bank deals to $10 million or less, including export loans and loan guarantees as well as capital and credit insurance. (That’s how it is supposed to work, in any event.) Ex-Im opponents are hoping that the president will, at the very least, maintain the status quo—although the best course of action would be to eliminate the bank altogether. (More on that below.) But the Ex-Im lobby is pushing for Trump to nominate board candidates and negotiate their Senate confirmation. Doing so would free up billions of dollars in subsidies for Boeing Co., General Electric Co., Caterpillar, and the like—that is, multinational corporations that do not lack access to capital and which can finance exports without taxpayer handouts. On the other hand, Congress could—at least conceivably—exercise leadership and phase the bank out of existence. It is not as if there is a shortage of private export financing: U.S. exports totaled $2.2 trillion in fiscal year 2016, with Ex-Im supporting just 0.22 percent ($5 billion). Who benefitted from that $5 billion? Ex-Im officials are keeping mum, although the transactions are supposed to be public. But if allowed to operate in secret, citizens and their representatives in Congress cannot determine whether the bank is complying with the $10 million transaction limit or with the other rules it has violated in the past. The Heritage Foundation made repeated requests in the past five weeks for information on 48 transactions in fiscal year 2016 that far exceeded the $10 million limit. For example, both JPMorgan Chase & Co. and TD Bank, N.A. were awarded a whopping $500 million on Dec. 14, 2015, and Wells Fargo & Co. was awarded $200 million on the same day. Several others were awarded between $15 million and $150 million. According to Ex-Im officials, some of the awards in question represent taxpayer-backed insurance for U.S. banks that issue letters of credit used overseas to finance foreign firms’ purchases of American exports. However, Ex-Im’s public database does not identify the borrowers or exporters, products or countries, involved in at least half of those 48 transactions, and multiple requests for details were in vain. Ex-Im representatives claim that prior boards of directors have authorized bank staff to unilaterally approve short-term transactions that exceed $10 million. But they also said that individual transactions under this so-called delegated authority are subject to limits of $10 million for corporate entities, $25 million for financial institutions, and $35 million for sovereign entities. Alas, without transaction details, neither Congress nor the public can determine whether the awards of $500 million, $200 million, $150 million, and the like were proper. Also in fiscal year 2016, there were five transactions listed in the bank database as approved by the board—although there was no board quorum to approve deals at the time. Borrower Lender Amount Program Zeeco Inc. J.P. Morgan Chase $72 million Working Capital Loan Thrustmaster of Texas ZB, National Association $27 million Working Capital Loan Jyoti Americas, Llc. Cadence Bank $18.9 million Working Capital Loan Frontier Spinning Mills PNC Bank $13.5 million Working Capital Loan Aeromexico Banco Nacional do Mexico $10.2 million Medium-term Loan Guarantee According to a bank representative, the working capital loans were approved by the board when a quorum existed, and represent installments of multiyear authorizations. However, the decision dates for the four transactions are listed as fiscal year 2016, and prior entries for the same companies do not indicate a multiyear authorization. The one medium-term transaction, for Aeromexico, refers to an amendment to a transaction approved by the board in 2014, according to an Ex-Im representative. The nature of the amendment is unknown, although the representative did say that Ex-Im staff exercised their (supposed) delegated authority to approve the (supposedly proper) amendment. Throughout the two-year debate over reauthorization of the Ex-Im charter, proponents incessantly claimed that small business was the bank’s “core mission.” That simply wasn’t true. Just 20 percent or less of total financing went to small businesses. But lacking a quorum, and thus barred from dispensing billions of dollars in export subsidies to the big guys, one might think that bank officials would maximize its small-business assistance. But that didn’t happen. The bank reported $2.7 billion in authorizations to benefit small business in fiscal year 2016, which was about half of the level of small-business support from two years before. Obviously, they aren’t banging down Ex-Im’s door for help. The vast majority of small-business exporters do not need—and do not receive—taxpayer subsidies. Indeed, small businesses ranked “exporting my products/services” as the least problematic of 75 business problems assessed in an annual survey by the National Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation. The cost of health care ranked as the most severe problem. The debate about Ex-Im isn’t about helping small business. It is about the powerful bond between big business and big government. Ex-Im subsidies are neither the biggest nor worst manifestation of corporate welfare. But change in Washington is tortuous, and ending Ex-Im is a practical and rational target at present for reasons both material and ideological. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, some members of Congress believe that a few legislative tweaks will remedy all that is wrong with the bank. Ex-Im officials have thwarted past attempts by Congress to impose reforms. More importantly, no amount of bureaucratic tinkering can shield taxpayers from bailouts in the event that bank reserves run dry—as occurred in the 1980s—nor will it protect American businesses from the disadvantages of the U.S. government subsidizing their foreign competitors. There isn’t an economist alive who could coherently argue that Ex-Im subsidies don’t distort credit and labor markets—and always to the detriment of those who remain independent of the welfare state. That is why Trump and Congress must eliminate the bank, both to prove that cronyism can be restrained, and because it would most benefit the nation.

The range of feedstock is vast, and in the four years to 2015, more than 20 airlines have made over 2500 commercial passenger flights with blends of up to 50 per cent biofuel. READ MORE: • Plan to power aircraft with trash The quest for a replacement for the traditional kerosene-based jet fuel took flight in February, 2008, when Virgin Atlantic became the first airline to fly a commercial airliner with biofuel. The airline used a mixture of coconut and babassu oil in one of the four main fuel tanks of a jumbo jet. Later that year Air New Zealand flew a Boeing 747 with a 50/50 mix of jatropha biofuel and conventional jet fuel for two hours, and successfully completed a series of performance tests. Since then, both airlines have started the long chase for new sources of alternative fuel. But commercial scale jet biofuel remains a work in progress - timetables for its introduction tend to blow out by years. According to International Air Transport Association figures, as of last year there were five production pathways technically certified and another 16 on the drawing board. But so far, the quantity of biofuel produced is only a drop in the bucket, compared with the 1.5 billion barrels of jet fuel used every year. Continued below. Related Content Brian Fallow: Cut the livestock, grow more trees Z Energy hopes to start producing biofuel soon after months of delays Video Air travel set to get greener Producing commercial quantities of biofuel - and importantly, being able to pump it through existing infrastructure - is becoming more pressing. Most of the airline industry has signed up to ambitious targets. From 2020, any increase in airline CO2 emissions will need to be offset by activities such as tree planting, to soak up the carbon dioxide aircraft pump into the atmosphere at the rate of close to 800,000 tonnes a year. The United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organisation estimates the agreement would cost airlines between US$5.3 billion ($7.5b) and US$23.9 billion annually by 2035. Emissions from international flights - the main source of such pollution - account for about 2 per cent of global greenhouse gases and are forecast to triple by 2050. Biofuels have been shown to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80 per cent over their full life cycle. If commercial aviation were to get just 6 per cent of its fuel supply from biofuel by 2020, this would reduce its overall carbon footprint by 5 per cent. Last year, more than 60 nations representing over 80 per cent of aviation traffic pledged to voluntarily participate in the system when it begins in 2020, including the United States, China and most of Europe. The deal, which has drawn criticism from India and Russia, becomes mandatory for most nations in 2027. Despite the cost, companies said a single international standard would be cheaper and easier to follow than a jumble of programmes implemented by different countries. Fuel is the biggest single cost for airlines, and while the latest generation planes are up to 20 per cent more efficient than the aircraft they replace, and optimal flight paths can play a big role, biofuel is seen as a the only energy solution to mitigate the industry's emissions growth in the medium term.

Unlike ground transport, which is rapidly shifting to battery technology, aviation has no alternative to liquid fuels. IATA estimates that electric commercial aircraft are unlikely before 2040, when battery weight and safety issues could be solved. "The main challenges to a wide deployment of alternative jet fuels are not technical but commercial and political," says IATA. "Currently a number of alternative jet fuel production pathways are more expensive than fossil JetA/A1." Relatively depressed oil prices over the past 18 months are also working against biofuel development. It is estimated that ethanol made from corn, one of the cheapest of the alternatives, becomes cost competitive when oil prices rise past US$65 a barrel. They've been around US$50 or less for much of the past year, hitting the higher mark only for a short time in 2015. And biofuel has hit other structural roadblocks. Air New Zealand was not the only airline interested in jatropha, a plant which grows in tropical and subtropical regions. Investors piled in around 2007 and 2008, investing in huge plantations. But it was found that, though the plant could grow in arid conditions, it needed more fertile soils and better irrigation to produce the oil-rich seeds required for biofuel, therefore pitching it into competition with crops grown for large populations in those regions. Food crops such as corn, sugarcane, soybeans, palm oil and sugarbeet have also been used for biofuel - mainly used in ground transport - and likewise have competed with food production. Air New Zealand, with Virgin Australia, is now searching for alternatives and the airlines are upbeat about the prospects of producing aviation biofuel locally, following their year-long joint investigation. The airlines have completed an extensive review of more than 30 responses received from organisations in this country, Australia, the US, Canada and Europe. They will now work with short-listed companies on strengthening the commercial case for investment following the request for information.

Air New Zealand's head of sustainability, Lisa Daniell, says the airlines achieved their key objectives in testing market readiness and gaining a better understanding of potential supply opportunities. "The [request for information] has helped stimulate industry dialogue on the production of sustainable aviation fuel in the Australasian region. Importantly, the process has also greatly expanded our understanding of the technologies and processes involved and the potential timeframes to scale up to the volumes required," she says. In this country, Z Energy is developing a plant in Wiri that makes biodiesel from animal fat and is leading the pack here, having produced a large test batch before Christmas. David Binnie, general manager of supply and distribution at Z Energy, says alternative aviation fuel will be a long game for those who want to get into the field. He says some of the building blocks of biodiesel technology are transferable. "If we chose to adapt the biodiesel plant to something else, there's still some unknowns about that." The growth in flying - at a time when battery power will increasingly replace liquid fuel in ground transport - means there is big scope in the long term. "It's really high potential in terms of the scale of it," says Binnie. "On the jet stuff, we're just embarking on that journey but in the next six months to a year we'll make some choices on that." Another New Zealand company, LanzaTech, is at the forefront of a pioneering technology in partnership with Virgin Atlantic. It was founded in New Zealand but is now based in the United States and has a production facility in China where it has already produced a batch of 5700 litres of jet fuel derived from waste industrial gases from steel mills, using a fermentation process. The airline hopes to run its first proving flight this year following work with Boeing and a range of other industry players. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Bezos, who is worth $75 billion, said he expects to spend $2.5 billion to develop a rocket that can lift satellites – and eventually people – into orbit. Eleven-minute rides for space tourists are planned to start next year, he said, with an eye toward making the company a profitable long-term business though ticket sales have yet to begin. “My business model right now for Blue Origin is that I sell about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock and I use it to invest in Blue Origin,” he said. “It’s very important that Blue Origin stand on its own feet and be a profitable, sustainable enterprise. That’s how real progress gets made.” Read: Asteroids Are Flying Past Earth More Often Than Usual Virgin Galactic is selling space tourism tickets for $250,000, which includes three days of training and a 2 1/2 hour flight, while NASA got a deal from SpaceX for flights to the moon, $74.7 million for five astronauts. Russian space tourist Dennis Tito bought a ticket aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in 2001 for a reported $20 million. Bezos told reporters he wants to make space travel as common as airline flights, hoping to bring the cost down by 99 percent with the use of reusable rockets, the Colorado Springs, Colorado, Gazette reported. Read: Boeing Unveils Concept Images For Cislunar Habitat, Deep Space Transport Vehicle "My singular focus is to have people in space. To make that model work, we have to do other things, so satellite customers will cover some of the costs in the early innings," Bezos said. "The demand for this will be up to the customers. I have thrown plenty of parties that no one came to, but I don't think that will be case." Unlike Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which plans to go to Mars, Blue Origin will focus on sub-orbital flights, Bezos said. He said his space tourists will need only an hour of training before flight. "I want to see an entrepreneurial explosion in space," he said. "Most things you now do in space have a high cost of admission. If we can reduce the cost of launch by a factor of 10 or 100, it will be a completely new world -- a golden age of space exploration." Blue Origin had been planning to start testing crewed flights this year, but that probably won’t happen, SpaceNews reported. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is hoping the New Shepard space craft will begin 11-minute tourist flights next year. Above, Ariane Cornell (center) gives tours to the media of Blue Origin's Crew Capsule mockup at the 33rd Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, April 5, 2017. Photo: Isaiah J. Downing/Reuters “We’re going to go through the test program, and we’ll put humans on it when we’re happy,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to be 2017 at this point. It could be.” Bezos said there’s no rigid schedule for development of the New Shepard propulsion system, and he’s constantly reminding his team they’re not involved in a race. “This vehicle is going to carry humans. We’re going to make it as safe as we can make it,” he said. “We’re not going to take any shortcuts. We’re going to put humans on this vehicle when we’re ready and not a second sooner.” The New Shepard crew capsule was on display at the symposium. It has six seats in a horizontal position, large windows and computer monitors. Passengers will be able to float around the cabin for about 4 minutes during a typical flight. Adding a second stage would allow the rocket to put small satellites into orbit although the company’s New Glenn vehicle is the more likely candidate for such duty, Bezos said.

It's a 1,340-foot line that's able to carry up to 20 people to safety, all designed by zip line company Terra Nova, which also happen to have built the longest zip line in the world.  As a press release by the United Launch Alliance notes, the system can build up some serious speed: "In just 30 seconds, the rider reaches top speeds of 40 mph. The riders control their speed by releasing pressure on the handles, with the ability to glide to a gentle stop at the landing zone. There are 30 feet of springs on each cable located in the landing area to gradually slow a rider down if they forget to brake." And as this video by NASA and Boeing posted to YouTube by collectSPACE shows, it looks pretty fun, too: Though, as one of my colleagues points out, there is the potential risk of astronauts starting a fire just to have a chance to try the system out.  NOW WATCH: Children who eat too much sugar are developing diseases that only alcoholics used to get More From Business Insider NASA will destroy a $3.26 billion Saturn probe this summer to protect an alien water world A giant 'hole' on the sun just fired a burst of wind past Earth traveling over 1.5 million mph Amateur astronomers just found objects in space that could lead to the biggest discovery of our Solar System in over 150 years Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Information regarding the Companys track record and plan for continued value creation is available in its presentation to shareholders dated March 27, 2017. The presentation and other materials are available at www.arconic.com/annualmeeting. The Company urges shareholders to vote "FOR the Companys nominees and governance proposals on the WHITE proxy card. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170405006253/en/ Arconic Leadership Has Delivered $8 Billion in Shareholder Wealth Over the Last 8 Years The full text of the letter follows: April 5, 2017 Dear Fellow Arconic Shareholder: You have an important decision to make regarding your investment in Arconic at the upcoming Annual Meeting. The Arconic Board of Directors and management team are committed to shareholder value creation while upholding the highest ethical standards and principles of good governance. We want to ensure shareholders have the facts to make an informed decision, while Elliott Management continues to make misleading statements about Arconic. The Arconic Board and management team have outlined a detailed roadmap for the future success of the Company that we believe will enhance value for all shareholders. Core to this strategy is a focus on the right markets with advantageous growth characteristics  like the aerospace and automotive industries. We believe Arconics expertise in innovation and strong customer relationships will drive above-market growth in sales, and the Company will continue productivity enhancements and cost reduction actions to help drive profits. As a result of the Company's leadership team successfully executing the complex, multi-year transformation of Alcoa Inc., and the launch of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is in a strong position to continue driving value for shareholders. What is Elliott doing? Elliott is promoting a misleading view of Klaus Kleinfelds track record of Total Shareholder Return ("TSR). In calculating TSR, three key questions should be asked: What is the start date for the analysis? What is the end date for the analysis? What are the relevant indices for comparison purposes? Regarding the first question, Arconics Board determined that the 62 percent1 plunge in the price of aluminum during Mr. Kleinfelds first months as CEO, and the impact of high financial leverage that Mr. Kleinfeld inherited, resulted in a dramatic stock price decline that was outside of managements control. Therefore, our shareholder return analysis starting point is March 18, 2009, the point at which Alcoa Inc. was recapitalized. Second, in terms of end dates, we cannot imagine an analysis that does not include the separation of Alcoa Inc. into Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, given that it was a critical milestone in the Companys strategic plan that has created significant value for shareholders. Third, separate from Elliotts biased selection of start and end dates for its TSR analysis, we also looked at value creation for Alcoa Inc.s shareholders since March 18, 2009, and found that Alcoa Inc. TSR outperformed both the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the overall S&P Metals & Mining Index since 2009.2 These well-established third-party sector indices serve as appropriate benchmarks for evaluating relative performance, given Alcoa Inc. was included in the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the S&P Metals & Mining Index every year leading up to the separation. The fact is that CEO Klaus Kleinfeld has led Alcoa Inc., now Arconic, to create approximately $8 billion3 in shareholder wealth over the last eight years, reflecting total shareholder returns of 182 percent.4 In addition to Alcoa Inc. creating more value for shareholders than the S&P 500 Metals & Mining and the S&P Metals & Mining Indices,5 if you are a new shareholder and invested in Arconic on its first day of trading on November 1, 2016,6 you have seen a return of 57 percent. Arconics performance is significantly better than both the S&P 500 Industrials Index and the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense Index in that same timeframe.7 In fact, in a presentation to Alcoa Inc. on November 9, 2015, Elliott applauded the Board and current Arconic leadership for creating shareholder value: "Elliott would like to commend the Board and management team for the significant steps taken to build a better Alcoa [Inc.] and maximize value for shareholders.8 Has Elliott offered a plan? It has become increasingly evident that Elliott Management  an activist hedge fund investor  has no serious plan for the future of Arconic and instead has relied largely on misleading attacks on Arconics track record. The Boards extensive review of Elliotts claims has made it clear to us that they do not understand Arconics business or what is needed to maximize value for shareholders. In addition to using a misleading shareholder value creation analysis, Elliott: Misuses and misunderstands industry data Compares Arconic to companies that are different in structure or industry Advocates for a CEO who is legally restricted from serving as Arconics CEO Fails to appreciate that close, collaborative partnerships with customers are critical for our future success Even setting aside Elliotts many misrepresentations and attacks throughout its campaign, Elliott has not produced any operational plan for the future of Arconic. Does Elliott understand Arconics business? Elliott has shown a clear lack of understanding of Arconics business. Elliott made numerous revisions to its investor presentations to try to correct its flawed and misleading analysis of Arconics business, and it has concealed the changes. For example, Elliott revised its "perceived opportunity in Arconics Global Rolled Products ("GRP) business from $750 million in cost savings down to $245 million in cost savings, and it slashed the share price "percentage upside that Elliott believed it could deliver from GRP margin improvement by over 65 percent.9 The fact is that this business is already in-line or better than its 10 largest competitors. And, Arconics management team has a strategy in place to further improve the cost and margin structure by approximately $100 million by 2019.10 In addition, Elliott compares the profitability of Arconics Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS) segment with the profitability of Precision Cast Parts (PCP), without acknowledging the significant differences between the two businesses. In reality, Arconic EPS is different in scale and business mix to PCP. In most segments where the two businesses are comparable, Arconics margins are in-line or better than PCPs. In segments where there are differences, Arconic has been attacking the margin gap through technology investments, increased capacity utilization, strategic acquisitions and organic expansions. A recent report by aerospace analysts at Cowen and Company11 highlighted Elliotts misleading analysis: "The margin gap between ARNCs EPS segment and PCP (F15) cannot be eliminated for a host of reasons. In effect, the benchmark that Elliott cites is an unrealistic bar.  It has become clear that Elliott in fact has no idea how to actually operate Arconic to create value for shareholders. What is the nature of Elliotts agreement with Larry Lawson? It appears that Elliotts only concrete plan is to replace Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconics current CEO, with Larry Lawson, a former Spirit AeroSystems CEO, who is legally restricted from serving as Arconics CEO due to a non-compete agreement with his former employer. Elliott failed to provide the full details of its relationship with Mr. Lawson when it began calling for him to become Arconics CEO. When Elliotts agreement with Mr. Lawson was finally made public, it revealed the troubling fact that if Mr. Lawson became Arconics CEO, he would remain on Elliotts payroll for years. In fact, Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification payments and, in total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years. Shareholders must therefore ask how Elliotts proposed compensation arrangements with Mr. Lawson would influence his actions if he were to become CEO, and whether he would truly serve the interests of ALL Arconic shareholders. Does Elliotts analysis consider the importance of customer relationships? Customers are the lifeblood of our business. Our largest customers, key to our future success, including Airbus Group, The Boeing Company, United Technologies Corp., and GE Aviation have proactively expressed their support for the work Arconic is doing with them, its importance to their businesses and their respect and support for Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconics CEO: "What I particularly value is Klaus deep understanding of the critical levers to support OEM goals. As CEO of Airbus, I fully support his continued leadership of Arconic. - Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus Group, March 2017 "Klaus Kleinfeld and his team haveimproved our business relationship by focusing in the right areas, increasing our collective competitiveness and delivering innovation and greater value to the customers we serve together. - Dennis Muilenburg, Chairman, President & CEO, The Boeing Company, March 2017 "[We] support Klaus and the rest of Arconic management as they remain focused on the investments that will secure sustainable, long-term growth for UTC, for Arconic, and for our entire industry. - Greg J. Hayes, Chairman, President & CEO of United Technologies Corp., March 2017 "Investments in technology and rate readiness are more important than ever within the supply chains of our growing aviation industryGE supports Klaus and the Arconic commitment to those priorities and the long-term future of our industry. - David Joyce, GE Vice Chair and GE Aviation President & CEO, February 2017 What other misinformation is Elliott communicating? Because Elliott has no credible plan for Arconic, Elliott has sought to distract shareholders by mischaracterizing an agreement with Oak Hill. This is a false claim designed to mislead. When Arconic and Oak Hill resolved a working capital adjustment relating to the Firth Rixson transaction in August 2016, one of the many terms of the agreement was a commitment by Oak Hill to vote its Arconic shares in the manner recommended by the Arconic Board, which has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of Arconics shareholders. No additional value was given to Oak Hill by Arconic for the voting commitment and Oak Hill only held about two percent of Arconics shares and was free to sell them - and thereby terminate the commitment - at any time. In the end, the voting commitment did not have any effect at all. There was no election of directors or contested vote after it was entered into and, after carefully reviewing the commitment in the context of the current proxy contest, management and the Arconic Board decided to release Oak Hill from its commitment in order to facilitate the fullest participation by all shareholders in the current proxy contest. In short, Elliott has made false claims and mischaracterized an ordinary course agreement in a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from what is really at stake in this proxy contest: who are the best qualified director nominees to oversee the execution of the Companys strategy to enhance shareholder value. Arconics Board and management offer you a clear plan for the continued success of the Company and further enhancement of shareholder value. Elliott offers no operational plan, flawed and misleading analysis, and an ineligible CEO candidate on its own payroll. We believe the choice is clear. To protect the future of Arconic and the value of your investment we urge you to vote the WHITE proxy card TODAY. Thank you. The Independent Directors of Arconic Inc.:         Patricia F.

ForwardLooking Statements This communication contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as "anticipates, "believes, "could, "estimates, "expects, "forecasts, "guidance, "goal, "intends, "may, "outlook, "plans, "projects, "seeks, "sees, "should, "targets, "will, "would, or other words of similar meaning. All statements that reflect Arconics expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, forecasts relating to the growth of end markets and potential share gains; statements and guidance regarding future financial results or operating performance; and statements about Arconics strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: (a) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions generally; (b) unfavorable changes in the markets served by Arconic; (c) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in profitability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness and operations anticipated from restructuring programs and productivity improvement, cash sustainability, technology advancements, and other initiatives; (d) changes in discount rates or investment returns on pension assets; (e) Arconics inability to realize expected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (f) the impact of cyber attacks and potential information technology or data security breaches; (g) political, economic, and regulatory risks in the countries in which Arconic operates or sells products; (h) the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations, and environmental remediation; and (i) the other risk factors discussed in Arconics Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Arconic disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this communication is derived from Arconics consolidated financial information but is not presented in Arconics financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered "non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules. Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume.       1   LME aluminum cash price dropped 62% between July 2008 and February 2009.

 Astronauts now have a sweet 1,340-foot zip line they can use to evacuate space shuttles Kevin Loria Apr. 5, 2017, 6:09 PM 2,070 facebook linkedin twitter email print collectSPACE/YouTube No one wants to have to evacuate a burning spacecraft at the last minute before launch.  But if you had to do it, the zip line — or "Emergency Egress System" — designed to help astronauts evacuate the Boeing Starliner spacecraft in case of emergency would be the way you'd want to do it. It's a 1,340-foot line that's able to carry up to 20 people to safety, all designed by zip line company Terra Nova, which also happen to have built the longest zip line in the world.  As a press release by the United Launch Alliance notes, the system can build up some serious speed: "In just 30 seconds, the rider reaches top speeds of 40 mph. The riders control their speed by releasing pressure on the handles, with the ability to glide to a gentle stop at the landing zone. There are 30 feet of springs on each cable located in the landing area to gradually slow a rider down if they forget to brake." And as this video by NASA and Boeing posted to YouTube by collectSPACE shows, it looks pretty fun, too: Though, as one of my colleagues points out, there is the potential risk of astronauts starting a fire just to have a chance to try the system out.  Get the latest Boeing stock price here.

Engineers at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station recently finished testing an exit system designed to quickly transport astronauts to safety in case of a launch emergency.  The zip line is being prepped for crew members of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, which will be launched toward the International Space Station atop the Atlas V rocket. The zip line begins 172 feet in the air, on top of a tower crew members will use to board the Starliner, and ends about 1,300 feet away. It's made up of four cables. Each cable has five seats, meaning the system can transport up to 20 people at a time. After strapping in, riders control their speed by releasing pressure on the handles. Springs at the end of the line help to stop the rider if they forget to brake.  Why Performance Matters When Building Your SD-WAN More from Silver Peak Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

(Michael Vadon/ Flickr)   This article was first posted by AlterNet. Again and again on the campaign trail, Donald Trump made promises he couldn’t keep, playing on the ignorance of his base and revealing his own glaring misunderstanding of policy. The GOP candidate repeatedly vowed to strongarm companies into keeping jobs at home instead of sending them to Mexico, renegotiate NAFTA and impose stiff import taxes on foreign goods. It was a message that appealed widely to Trump supporters, blending the illusion of economic hope with the rubric of “America First” nationalism. Problem is, nothing about Trump’s vision has anything to do with reality, and U.S. jobs continue to be sent across the border. As Bloomberg reports: Illinois Tool Works Inc. will close an auto-parts plant in Mazon, Illinois, this month and head to Ciudad Juarez. Triumph Group Inc. is reducing the Spokane, Washington, workforce that makes fiber-composite parts for Boeing Co. aircraft and moving production to Zacatecas and Baja California. TE Connectivity Ltd. is shuttering a pressure-sensor plant in Pennsauken, New Jersey, in favor of a facility in Hermosillo. Those companies aren’t alone. Indianapolis-based firm Rexnord is moving 300 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico, despite a December tweet by Trump meant to shame the company into staying. That company is located just up the road from Carrier, the air conditioning manufacturer Trump falsely claimed to have bribed into keeping 1,100 jobs in its home state. Like nearly every victory claimed by the president, it too was a lie. As CNN Money notes, only 800 factory jobs were saved while 500 are still being shifted south. Trump’s falsehood moved a local union leader to declare POTUS had “lied his ass off.” “Trump and Pence, they pulled a dog and pony show on the numbers,” Chuck Jones, president of the local steelworkers union, told the Washington Post. “I almost threw up in my mouth.” More smoke-and-mirrors shenanigans surround Trump’s recent boasts of job-saving at Ford Motor Company. “Big announcement by Ford today,” Trump wrote in an intentionally misleading tweet. “Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!” But those jobs—there are just 130 of them—had nothing to do with Trump. The same is true of the company’s decision to put the brakes on a plan to transport 700 jobs to Mexico, announced after Trump criticized the move on social media. As Reuters notes, “both projects were part of 2015 negotiations with the UAW, when Ford said it would invest $9 billion in U.S. plants over four years.” If, as Trump seems to think, a president deserves credit for every new job created when he is in office, then the point for this one goes to Obama. Trump may also be backing off of promises to raise tariffs on incoming goods and renegotiate NAFTA. The shift in tone comes on the heels of a series of calamitous failures that have come to define this bumbling presidency. Days ago, according to the New York Times, “a draft letter suggesting a softening of his views began circulating among members of Congress this week.” The report goes on to state that the draft proposal appears “to propose keeping much of the agreement in place.” Like what you’ve read?

Information regarding the Company’s track record and plan for continued value creation is available in its presentation to shareholders dated March 27, 2017. The presentation and other materials are available at www.arconic.com/annualmeeting. The Company urges shareholders to vote “FOR” the Company’s nominees and governance proposals on the WHITE proxy card. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170405006253/en/ The full text of the letter follows: April 5, 2017 Dear Fellow Arconic Shareholder: You have an important decision to make regarding your investment in Arconic at the upcoming Annual Meeting. The Arconic Board of Directors and management team are committed to shareholder value creation while upholding the highest ethical standards and principles of good governance. We want to ensure shareholders have the facts to make an informed decision, while Elliott Management continues to make misleading statements about Arconic. The Arconic Board and management team have outlined a detailed roadmap for the future success of the Company that we believe will enhance value for all shareholders. Core to this strategy is a focus on the right markets with advantageous growth characteristics – like the aerospace and automotive industries. We believe Arconic’s expertise in innovation and strong customer relationships will drive above-market growth in sales, and the Company will continue productivity enhancements and cost reduction actions to help drive profits. As a result of the Company's leadership team successfully executing the complex, multi-year transformation of Alcoa Inc., and the launch of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is in a strong position to continue driving value for shareholders. What is Elliott doing? Elliott is promoting a misleading view of Klaus Kleinfeld’s track record of Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”). In calculating TSR, three key questions should be asked: What is the start date for the analysis? What is the end date for the analysis? What are the relevant indices for comparison purposes? Regarding the first question, Arconic’s Board determined that the 62 percent [1] plunge in the price of aluminum during Mr. Kleinfeld’s first months as CEO, and the impact of high financial leverage that Mr. Kleinfeld inherited, resulted in a dramatic stock price decline that was outside of management’s control. Therefore, our shareholder return analysis starting point is March 18, 2009, the point at which Alcoa Inc. was recapitalized. Second, in terms of end dates, we cannot imagine an analysis that does not include the separation of Alcoa Inc. into Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, given that it was a critical milestone in the Company’s strategic plan that has created significant value for shareholders. Third, separate from Elliott’s biased selection of start and end dates for its TSR analysis, we also looked at value creation for Alcoa Inc.’s shareholders since March 18, 2009, and found that Alcoa Inc. TSR outperformed both the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the overall S&P Metals & Mining Index since 2009. [2] These well-established third-party sector indices serve as appropriate benchmarks for evaluating relative performance, given Alcoa Inc. was included in the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the S&P Metals & Mining Index every year leading up to the separation. The fact is that CEO Klaus Kleinfeld has led Alcoa Inc., now Arconic, to create approximately $8 billion [3] in shareholder wealth over the last eight years, reflecting total shareholder returns of 182 percent. [4] In addition to Alcoa Inc. creating more value for shareholders than the S&P 500 Metals & Mining and the S&P Metals & Mining Indices, [5] if you are a new shareholder and invested in Arconic on its first day of trading on November 1, 2016, [6] you have seen a return of 57 percent. Arconic’s performance is significantly better than both the S&P 500 Industrials Index and the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense Index in that same timeframe. [7] In fact, in a presentation to Alcoa Inc. on November 9, 2015, Elliott applauded the Board and current Arconic leadership for creating shareholder value: “Elliott would like to commend the Board and management team for the significant steps taken to build a better Alcoa [Inc.] and maximize value for shareholders.” [8] Has Elliott offered a plan? It has become increasingly evident that Elliott Management – an activist hedge fund investor – has no serious plan for the future of Arconic and instead has relied largely on misleading attacks on Arconic’s track record. The Board’s extensive review of Elliott’s claims has made it clear to us that they do not understand Arconic’s business or what is needed to maximize value for shareholders. In addition to using a misleading shareholder value creation analysis, Elliott: Even setting aside Elliott’s many misrepresentations and attacks throughout its campaign, Elliott has not produced any operational plan for the future of Arconic. Does Elliott understand Arconic’s business? Elliott has shown a clear lack of understanding of Arconic’s business. Elliott made numerous revisions to its investor presentations to try to correct its flawed and misleading analysis of Arconic’s business, and it has concealed the changes. For example, Elliott revised its “perceived opportunity” in Arconic’s Global Rolled Products (“GRP”) business from $750 million in cost savings down to $245 million in cost savings, and it slashed the share price “percentage upside” that Elliott believed it could deliver from GRP margin improvement by over 65 percent. [9] The fact is that this business is already in-line or better than its 10 largest competitors. And, Arconic’s management team has a strategy in place to further improve the cost and margin structure by approximately $100 million by 2019. [10] In addition, Elliott compares the profitability of Arconic’s Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS) segment with the profitability of Precision Cast Parts (PCP), without acknowledging the significant differences between the two businesses. In reality, Arconic EPS is different in scale and business mix to PCP. In most segments where the two businesses are comparable, Arconic’s margins are in-line or better than PCP’s. In segments where there are differences, Arconic has been attacking the margin gap through technology investments, increased capacity utilization, strategic acquisitions and organic expansions. A recent report by aerospace analysts at Cowen and Company [11] highlighted Elliott’s misleading analysis: “The margin gap between ARNC’s EPS segment and PCP (F15) cannot be eliminated for a host of reasons…. In effect, the benchmark that Elliott cites is an unrealistic bar. ” It has become clear that Elliott in fact has no idea how to actually operate Arconic to create value for shareholders. What is the nature of Elliott’s agreement with Larry Lawson? It appears that Elliott’s only concrete plan is to replace Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconic’s current CEO, with Larry Lawson, a former Spirit AeroSystems CEO, who is legally restricted from serving as Arconic’s CEO due to a non-compete agreement with his former employer. Elliott failed to provide the full details of its relationship with Mr. Lawson when it began calling for him to become Arconic’s CEO. When Elliott’s agreement with Mr. Lawson was finally made public, it revealed the troubling fact that if Mr. Lawson became Arconic’s CEO, he would remain on Elliott’s payroll for years. In fact, Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification payments and, in total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years. Shareholders must therefore ask how Elliott’s proposed compensation arrangements with Mr. Lawson would influence his actions if he were to become CEO, and whether he would truly serve the interests of ALL Arconic shareholders. Does Elliott’s analysis consider the importance of customer relationships? Customers are the lifeblood of our business. Our largest customers, key to our future success, including Airbus Group, The Boeing Company, United Technologies Corp., and GE Aviation have proactively expressed their support for the work Arconic is doing with them, its importance to their businesses and their respect and support for Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconic’s CEO: “What I particularly value is Klaus’ deep understanding of the critical levers to support OEM goals. As CEO of Airbus, I fully support his continued leadership of Arconic.” - Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus Group, March 2017 “Klaus Kleinfeld and his team have…improved our business relationship by focusing in the right areas, increasing our collective competitiveness and delivering innovation and greater value to the customers we serve together.” - Dennis Muilenburg, Chairman, President & CEO, The Boeing Company, March 2017 “[We] support Klaus and the rest of Arconic management as they remain focused on the investments that will secure sustainable, long-term growth for UTC, for Arconic, and for our entire industry.” - Greg J. Hayes, Chairman, President & CEO of United Technologies Corp., March 2017 “Investments in technology and rate readiness are more important than ever within the supply chains of our growing aviation industry…GE supports Klaus and the Arconic commitment to those priorities and the long-term future of our industry.” - David Joyce, GE Vice Chair and GE Aviation President & CEO, February 2017 What other misinformation is Elliott communicating? Because Elliott has no credible plan for Arconic, Elliott has sought to distract shareholders by mischaracterizing an agreement with Oak Hill. This is a false claim designed to mislead. When Arconic and Oak Hill resolved a working capital adjustment relating to the Firth Rixson transaction in August 2016, one of the many terms of the agreement was a commitment by Oak Hill to vote its Arconic shares in the manner recommended by the Arconic Board, which has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of Arconic’s shareholders. No additional value was given to Oak Hill by Arconic for the voting commitment and Oak Hill only held about two percent of Arconic’s shares and was free to sell them - and thereby terminate the commitment - at any time. In the end, the voting commitment did not have any effect at all. There was no election of directors or contested vote after it was entered into and, after carefully reviewing the commitment in the context of the current proxy contest, management and the Arconic Board decided to release Oak Hill from its commitment in order to facilitate the fullest participation by all shareholders in the current proxy contest. In short, Elliott has made false claims and mischaracterized an ordinary course agreement in a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from what is really at stake in this proxy contest: who are the best qualified director nominees to oversee the execution of the Company’s strategy to enhance shareholder value. Arconic’s Board and management offer you a clear plan for the continued success of the Company and further enhancement of shareholder value. Elliott offers no operational plan, flawed and misleading analysis, and an ineligible CEO candidate on its own payroll. We believe the choice is clear. To protect the future of Arconic and the value of your investment we urge you to vote the WHITE proxy card TODAY. Thank you.

Forward–Looking Statements This communication contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “guidance,” “goal,” “intends,” “may,” “outlook,” “plans,” “projects,” “seeks,” “sees,” “should,” “targets,” “will,” “would,” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that reflect Arconic’s expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, forecasts relating to the growth of end markets and potential share gains; statements and guidance regarding future financial results or operating performance; and statements about Arconic’s strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: (a) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions generally; (b) unfavorable changes in the markets served by Arconic; (c) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in profitability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness and operations anticipated from restructuring programs and productivity improvement, cash sustainability, technology advancements, and other initiatives; (d) changes in discount rates or investment returns on pension assets; (e) Arconic’s inability to realize expected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (f) the impact of cyber attacks and potential information technology or data security breaches; (g) political, economic, and regulatory risks in the countries in which Arconic operates or sells products; (h) the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations, and environmental remediation; and (i) the other risk factors discussed in Arconic’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Arconic disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this communication is derived from Arconic’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in Arconic’s financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume.

C-class aerospace parts are segmented into four major heads which are hardware components, bearings, electronic components and machined parts for both commercial and military aircraft. C-class parts are small in size and have low cost, but are one of the most critical components used in an aircraft. They are situated across the aircraft including fuselage, wings, landing gear fittings, control surfaces, flight control actuating systems, and air-intake areas near the engine. Hardware components constitute nearly half of the c-class parts used in the aircraft industry and constitute parts including fasteners, bolts, screws, nuts, rivets, springs, valves, washers, etc. Fasteners, the largest category of hardware components, include a wide range of highly engineered aerospace parts that are designed to hold together two or more components. Bearings mainly include airframe control bearings, rod ends, ball bearings, needle roller bearings, bushings, and precision bearings. Electronic components include mainly connectors, relays, switches, circuit breakers, and lighted products. Machined parts mainly include brackets, milled parts, shims, stampings, and turned parts. Changing dynamics in the global aerospace and defense industry have an impact on the c-class parts market. For instance, major OEMs, such as Boeing and Airbus are incorporating high amount of composite materials in their next generation aircraft. Composites rich aircraft generally require fewer c-class parts than an aircraft made of traditional non-composite materials. The parts used in next generation aircraft are generally priced higher than c-class aerospace parts used in non-composite aircraft structures. The global aerospace & defense c-class parts market offers a healthy growth opportunity of 4.4% CAGR during the forecast period of 2016 to 2021 and reach US$ 12.1 billion. Increasing commercial and regional aircraft deliveries, technology advancement, and growing aerospace & defense fleet size are the key drivers in the global aerospace & defense C-class parts market. Hardware components dominate the global aerospace & defense c-class parts market in 2015, followed by bearings, electronic components, and machined parts. North America is expected to remain the leading region in the aerospace & defense c-class parts market since it is the manufacturing hub of major tier players and aerospace & defense OEMs. The supply chain of this market comprises raw material manufacturers, c-class part manufacturers, distributors, tier players, aerospace OEMs, and airline companies. The key distributors are Wesco Aircraft, Kellstrom industries, and Aviall Services and the key aerospace OEMs are Boeing, Airbus, Comac, Bombardier, Embraer, ATR, Lockheed Martin, Cessna, and Gulfstream. The key aerospace & defense c-class part manufacturers are Precision Casts Parts (PCC) Fasteners, Arconic Fastening Systems, Lisi Aerospace, RBC Bearings, Stanley Black & Deker, Eaton Corporation, and Amphenol Corporation. New product development, collaboration with tier players and OEMs, and long term contacts are the key strategies adopted by the major players to gain competitive edge in the market.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Arconic Board Issues New Letter to Shareholders NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The Arconic (NYSE: ARNC) Board of Directors today issued a new letter to shareholders. Information regarding the Company’s track record and plan for continued value creation is available in its presentation to shareholders dated March 27, 2017. The presentation and other materials are available at www.arconic.com/annualmeeting. The Company urges shareholders to vote “FOR” the Company’s nominees and governance proposals on the WHITE proxy card. The full text of the letter follows: April 5, 2017 Dear Fellow Arconic Shareholder: You have an important decision to make regarding your investment in Arconic at the upcoming Annual Meeting. The Arconic Board of Directors and management team are committed to shareholder value creation while upholding the highest ethical standards and principles of good governance. We want to ensure shareholders have the facts to make an informed decision, while Elliott Management continues to make misleading statements about Arconic. The Arconic Board and management team have outlined a detailed roadmap for the future success of the Company that we believe will enhance value for all shareholders. Core to this strategy is a focus on the right markets with advantageous growth characteristics – like the aerospace and automotive industries. We believe Arconic’s expertise in innovation and strong customer relationships will drive above-market growth in sales, and the Company will continue productivity enhancements and cost reduction actions to help drive profits. As a result of the Company’s leadership team successfully executing the complex, multi-year transformation of Alcoa Inc., and the launch of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is in a strong position to continue driving value for shareholders. What is Elliott doing? Elliott is promoting a misleading view of Klaus Kleinfeld’s track record of Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”). In calculating TSR, three key questions should be asked: What is the start date for the analysis? What is the end date for the analysis? What are the relevant indices for comparison purposes? Regarding the first question, Arconic’s Board determined that the 62 percent1 plunge in the price of aluminum during Mr. Kleinfeld’s first months as CEO, and the impact of high financial leverage that Mr. Kleinfeld inherited, resulted in a dramatic stock price decline that was outside of management’s control. Therefore, our shareholder return analysis starting point is March 18, 2009, the point at which Alcoa Inc. was recapitalized. Second, in terms of end dates, we cannot imagine an analysis that does not include the separation of Alcoa Inc. into Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, given that it was a critical milestone in the Company’s strategic plan that has created significant value for shareholders. Third, separate from Elliott’s biased selection of start and end dates for its TSR analysis, we also looked at value creation for Alcoa Inc.’s shareholders since March 18, 2009, and found that Alcoa Inc. TSR outperformed both the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the overall S&P Metals & Mining Index since 2009.2 These well-established third-party sector indices serve as appropriate benchmarks for evaluating relative performance, given Alcoa Inc. was included in the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the S&P Metals & Mining Index every year leading up to the separation. The fact is that CEO Klaus Kleinfeld has led Alcoa Inc., now Arconic, to create approximately $8 billion3in shareholder wealth over the last eight years, reflecting total shareholder returns of 182 percent.4 In addition to Alcoa Inc. creating more value for shareholders than the S&P 500 Metals & Mining and the S&P Metals & Mining Indices,5 if you are a new shareholder and invested in Arconic on its first day of trading on November 1, 2016,6 you have seen a return of 57 percent. Arconic’s performance is significantly better than both the S&P 500 Industrials Index and the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense Index in that same timeframe.7 In fact, in a presentation to Alcoa Inc. on November 9, 2015, Elliott applauded the Board and current Arconic leadership for creating shareholder value: “Elliott would like to commend the Board and management team for the significant steps taken to build a better Alcoa [Inc.] and maximize value for shareholders.”8 Has Elliott offered a plan? It has become increasingly evident that Elliott Management – an activist hedge fund investor – has no serious plan for the future of Arconic and instead has relied largely on misleading attacks on Arconic’s track record. The Board’s extensive review of Elliott’s claims has made it clear to us that they do not understand Arconic’s business or what is needed to maximize value for shareholders. In addition to using a misleading shareholder value creation analysis, Elliott: Misuses and misunderstands industry data Compares Arconic to companies that are different in structure or industry Advocates for a CEO who is legally restricted from serving as Arconic’s CEO Fails to appreciate that close, collaborative partnerships with customers are critical for our future success Even setting aside Elliott’s many misrepresentations and attacks throughout its campaign, Elliott has not produced any operational plan for the future of Arconic. Does Elliott understand Arconic’s business? Elliott has shown a clear lack of understanding of Arconic’s business. Elliott made numerous revisions to its investor presentations to try to correct its flawed and misleading analysis of Arconic’s business, and it has concealed the changes. For example, Elliott revised its “perceived opportunity” in Arconic’s Global Rolled Products (“GRP”) business from $750 million in cost savings down to $245 million in cost savings, and it slashed the share price “percentage upside” that Elliott believed it could deliver from GRP margin improvement by over 65 percent.9 The fact is that this business is already in-line or better than its 10 largest competitors. And, Arconic’s management team has a strategy in place to further improve the cost and margin structure by approximately $100 million by 2019.10 In addition, Elliott compares the profitability of Arconic’s Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS) segment with the profitability of Precision Cast Parts (PCP), without acknowledging the significant differences between the two businesses. In reality, Arconic EPS is different in scale and business mix to PCP. In most segments where the two businesses are comparable, Arconic’s margins are in-line or better than PCP’s. In segments where there are differences, Arconic has been attacking the margin gap through technology investments, increased capacity utilization, strategic acquisitions and organic expansions. A recent report by aerospace analysts at Cowen and Company11 highlighted Elliott’s misleading analysis: “The margin gap between ARNC’s EPS segment and PCP (F15) cannot be eliminated for a host of reasons…. In effect, the benchmark that Elliott cites is an unrealistic bar. ” It has become clear that Elliott in fact has no idea how to actually operate Arconic to create value for shareholders. What is the nature of Elliott’s agreement with Larry Lawson? It appears that Elliott’s only concrete plan is to replace Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconic’s current CEO, with Larry Lawson, a former Spirit AeroSystems CEO, who is legally restricted from serving as Arconic’s CEO due to a non-compete agreement with his former employer. Elliott failed to provide the full details of its relationship with Mr. Lawson when it began calling for him to become Arconic’s CEO. When Elliott’s agreement with Mr. Lawson was finally made public, it revealed the troubling fact that if Mr. Lawson became Arconic’s CEO, he would remain on Elliott’s payroll for years. In fact, Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification payments and, in total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years. Shareholders must therefore ask how Elliott’s proposed compensation arrangements with Mr. Lawson would influence his actions if he were to become CEO, and whether he would truly serve the interests of ALL Arconic shareholders. Does Elliott’s analysis consider the importance of customer relationships? Customers are the lifeblood of our business. Our largest customers, key to our future success, including Airbus Group, The Boeing Company, United Technologies Corp., and GE Aviation have proactively expressed their support for the work Arconic is doing with them, its importance to their businesses and their respect and support for Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconic’s CEO: “What I particularly value is Klaus’ deep understanding of the critical levers to support OEM goals. As CEO of Airbus, I fully support his continued leadership of Arconic.” – Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus Group, March 2017 “Klaus Kleinfeld and his team have…improved our business relationship by focusing in the right areas, increasing our collective competitiveness and delivering innovation and greater value to the customers we serve together.” – Dennis Muilenburg, Chairman, President & CEO, The Boeing Company, March 2017 “[We] support Klaus and the rest of Arconic management as they remain focused on the investments that will secure sustainable, long-term growth for UTC, for Arconic, and for our entire industry.” – Greg J. Hayes, Chairman, President & CEO of United Technologies Corp., March 2017 “Investments in technology and rate readiness are more important than ever within the supply chains of our growing aviation industry…GE supports Klaus and the Arconic commitment to those priorities and the long-term future of our industry.” – David Joyce, GE Vice Chair and GE Aviation President & CEO, February 2017 What other misinformation is Elliott communicating? Because Elliott has no credible plan for Arconic, Elliott has sought to distract shareholders by mischaracterizing an agreement with Oak Hill. This is a false claim designed to mislead. When Arconic and Oak Hill resolved a working capital adjustment relating to the Firth Rixson transaction in August 2016, one of the many terms of the agreement was a commitment by Oak Hill to vote its Arconic shares in the manner recommended by the Arconic Board, which has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of Arconic’s shareholders. No additional value was given to Oak Hill by Arconic for the voting commitment and Oak Hill only held about two percent of Arconic’s shares and was free to sell them – and thereby terminate the commitment – at any time. In the end, the voting commitment did not have any effect at all. There was no election of directors or contested vote after it was entered into and, after carefully reviewing the commitment in the context of the current proxy contest, management and the Arconic Board decided to release Oak Hill from its commitment in order to facilitate the fullest participation by all shareholders in the current proxy contest. In short, Elliott has made false claims and mischaracterized an ordinary course agreement in a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from what is really at stake in this proxy contest: who are the best qualified director nominees to oversee the execution of the Company’s strategy to enhance shareholder value. Arconic’s Board and management offer you a clear plan for the continued success of the Company and further enhancement of shareholder value. Elliott offers no operational plan, flawed and misleading analysis, and an ineligible CEO candidate on its own payroll. We believe the choice is clear. To protect the future of Arconic and the value of your investment we urge you to vote the WHITE proxy card TODAY. Thank you. The Independent Directors of Arconic Inc.:         Patricia F.

Forward–Looking Statements This communication contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “guidance,” “goal,” “intends,” “may,” “outlook,” “plans,” “projects,” “seeks,” “sees,” “should,” “targets,” “will,” “would,” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that reflect Arconic’s expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, forecasts relating to the growth of end markets and potential share gains; statements and guidance regarding future financial results or operating performance; and statements about Arconic’s strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: (a) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions generally; (b) unfavorable changes in the markets served by Arconic; (c) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in profitability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness and operations anticipated from restructuring programs and productivity improvement, cash sustainability, technology advancements, and other initiatives; (d) changes in discount rates or investment returns on pension assets; (e) Arconic’s inability to realize expected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (f) the impact of cyber attacks and potential information technology or data security breaches; (g) political, economic, and regulatory risks in the countries in which Arconic operates or sells products; (h) the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations, and environmental remediation; and (i) the other risk factors discussed in Arconic’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Arconic disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this communication is derived from Arconic’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in Arconic’s financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume.       1   LME aluminum cash price dropped 62% between July 2008 and February 2009.

The fact is that CEO Klaus Kleinfeld has led Alcoa Inc., now Arconic, to create approximately $8 billion3 in shareholder wealth over the last eight years, reflecting total shareholder returns of 182 percent.4 In addition to Alcoa Inc. creating more value for shareholders than the S&P 500 Metals & Mining and the S&P Metals & Mining Indices,5 if you are a new shareholder and invested in Arconic on its first day of trading on November 1, 2016,6 you have seen a return of 57 percent. Arconic’s performance is significantly better than both the S&P 500 Industrials Index and the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense Index in that same timeframe.7 In fact, in a presentation to Alcoa Inc. on November 9, 2015, Elliott applauded the Board and current Arconic leadership for creating shareholder value: “Elliott would like to commend the Board and management team for the significant steps taken to build a better Alcoa [Inc.] and maximize value for shareholders.”8 Has Elliott offered a plan? It has become increasingly evident that Elliott Management – an activist hedge fund investor – has no serious plan for the future of Arconic and instead has relied largely on misleading attacks on Arconic’s track record. The Board’s extensive review of Elliott’s claims has made it clear to us that they do not understand Arconic’s business or what is needed to maximize value for shareholders. In addition to using a misleading shareholder value creation analysis, Elliott: Misuses and misunderstands industry data Compares Arconic to companies that are different in structure or industry Advocates for a CEO who is legally restricted from serving as Arconic’s CEO Fails to appreciate that close, collaborative partnerships with customers are critical for our future success Even setting aside Elliott’s many misrepresentations and attacks throughout its campaign, Elliott has not produced any operational plan for the future of Arconic. Does Elliott understand Arconic’s business? Elliott has shown a clear lack of understanding of Arconic’s business. Elliott made numerous revisions to its investor presentations to try to correct its flawed and misleading analysis of Arconic’s business, and it has concealed the changes. For example, Elliott revised its “perceived opportunity” in Arconic’s Global Rolled Products (“GRP”) business from $750 million in cost savings down to $245 million in cost savings, and it slashed the share price “percentage upside” that Elliott believed it could deliver from GRP margin improvement by over 65 percent.9 The fact is that this business is already in-line or better than its 10 largest competitors. And, Arconic’s management team has a strategy in place to further improve the cost and margin structure by approximately $100 million by 2019.10 In addition, Elliott compares the profitability of Arconic’s Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS) segment with the profitability of Precision Cast Parts (PCP), without acknowledging the significant differences between the two businesses. In reality, Arconic EPS is different in scale and business mix to PCP. In most segments where the two businesses are comparable, Arconic’s margins are in-line or better than PCP’s. In segments where there are differences, Arconic has been attacking the margin gap through technology investments, increased capacity utilization, strategic acquisitions and organic expansions. A recent report by aerospace analysts at Cowen and Company11 highlighted Elliott’s misleading analysis: “The margin gap between ARNC’s EPS segment and PCP (F15) cannot be eliminated for a host of reasons…. In effect, the benchmark that Elliott cites is an unrealistic bar. ” It has become clear that Elliott in fact has no idea how to actually operate Arconic to create value for shareholders. What is the nature of Elliott’s agreement with Larry Lawson? It appears that Elliott’s only concrete plan is to replace Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconic’s current CEO, with Larry Lawson, a former Spirit AeroSystems CEO, who is legally restricted from serving as Arconic’s CEO due to a non-compete agreement with his former employer. Elliott failed to provide the full details of its relationship with Mr. Lawson when it began calling for him to become Arconic’s CEO. When Elliott’s agreement with Mr. Lawson was finally made public, it revealed the troubling fact that if Mr. Lawson became Arconic’s CEO, he would remain on Elliott’s payroll for years. In fact, Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification payments and, in total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years. Shareholders must therefore ask how Elliott’s proposed compensation arrangements with Mr. Lawson would influence his actions if he were to become CEO, and whether he would truly serve the interests of ALL Arconic shareholders. Does Elliott’s analysis consider the importance of customer relationships? Customers are the lifeblood of our business. Our largest customers, key to our future success, including Airbus Group, The Boeing Company, United Technologies Corp., and GE Aviation have proactively expressed their support for the work Arconic is doing with them, its importance to their businesses and their respect and support for Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconic’s CEO: “What I particularly value is Klaus’ deep understanding of the critical levers to support OEM goals. As CEO of Airbus, I fully support his continued leadership of Arconic.” - Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus Group, March 2017 “Klaus Kleinfeld and his team have…improved our business relationship by focusing in the right areas, increasing our collective competitiveness and delivering innovation and greater value to the customers we serve together.” - Dennis Muilenburg, Chairman, President & CEO, The Boeing Company, March 2017 “[We] support Klaus and the rest of Arconic management as they remain focused on the investments that will secure sustainable, long-term growth for UTC, for Arconic, and for our entire industry.” - Greg J. Hayes, Chairman, President & CEO of United Technologies Corp., March 2017 “Investments in technology and rate readiness are more important than ever within the supply chains of our growing aviation industry…GE supports Klaus and the Arconic commitment to those priorities and the long-term future of our industry.” - David Joyce, GE Vice Chair and GE Aviation President & CEO, February 2017 What other misinformation is Elliott communicating? Because Elliott has no credible plan for Arconic, Elliott has sought to distract shareholders by mischaracterizing an agreement with Oak Hill. This is a false claim designed to mislead. When Arconic and Oak Hill resolved a working capital adjustment relating to the Firth Rixson transaction in August 2016, one of the many terms of the agreement was a commitment by Oak Hill to vote its Arconic shares in the manner recommended by the Arconic Board, which has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of Arconic’s shareholders. No additional value was given to Oak Hill by Arconic for the voting commitment and Oak Hill only held about two percent of Arconic’s shares and was free to sell them - and thereby terminate the commitment - at any time. In the end, the voting commitment did not have any effect at all. There was no election of directors or contested vote after it was entered into and, after carefully reviewing the commitment in the context of the current proxy contest, management and the Arconic Board decided to release Oak Hill from its commitment in order to facilitate the fullest participation by all shareholders in the current proxy contest. In short, Elliott has made false claims and mischaracterized an ordinary course agreement in a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from what is really at stake in this proxy contest: who are the best qualified director nominees to oversee the execution of the Company’s strategy to enhance shareholder value. Arconic’s Board and management offer you a clear plan for the continued success of the Company and further enhancement of shareholder value. Elliott offers no operational plan, flawed and misleading analysis, and an ineligible CEO candidate on its own payroll. We believe the choice is clear.

Forward–Looking Statements This communication contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “guidance,” “goal,” “intends,” “may,” “outlook,” “plans,” “projects,” “seeks,” “sees,” “should,” “targets,” “will,” “would,” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that reflect Arconic’s expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, forecasts relating to the growth of end markets and potential share gains; statements and guidance regarding future financial results or operating performance; and statements about Arconic’s strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: (a) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions generally; (b) unfavorable changes in the markets served by Arconic; (c) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in profitability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness and operations anticipated from restructuring programs and productivity improvement, cash sustainability, technology advancements, and other initiatives; (d) changes in discount rates or investment returns on pension assets; (e) Arconic’s inability to realize expected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (f) the impact of cyber attacks and potential information technology or data security breaches; (g) political, economic, and regulatory risks in the countries in which Arconic operates or sells products; (h) the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations, and environmental remediation; and (i) the other risk factors discussed in Arconic’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Arconic disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this communication is derived from Arconic’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in Arconic’s financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume.       1   LME aluminum cash price dropped 62% between July 2008 and February 2009.

 What you need to know on Wall Street today Business Insider Apr. 5, 2017, 1:51 PM 865 facebook linkedin twitter email print A woman stands in front of the logo of Snap Inc. on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) while waiting for Snap Inc. to post their IPO, in New York City Thomson Reuters Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours.   Imagine the following scenario. A Wall Street investment bank has just led the biggest tech initial public offering in years but makes a mistake in the first research note it publishes on the stock. The error means the bank overstated the forecasted earnings over a five-year stretch by nearly $5 billion. Yet when the bank issues a correction and updates its earnings models, its price target on the shares remains the same. How does that happen? The answer says a lot about the weaknesses in Wall Street analyst research and the closely watched price targets published by big banks. Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, on Tuesday resigned after apparently admitting he was the source of a leak of secret , market-sensitive information about key discussions on interest rate policy.  Business Insider's Pedro da Costa once asked Fed chair Janet Yellen about the investigation in to the leaks. The question echoed much longer than he expected. And the sudden resignation of Lacker came with a huge hint that there's more to come, according to da Costa.  In finance news, machine learning is now used in Wall Street dealmaking, and bankers should probably be worried. Someone made a $100 million trade with JPMorgan on their cell phone. And the world's biggest asset manager has slashed the fees it pays to Wall Street. In markets news, ADP private payrolls crush expectations. The largest part of the US economy slowed in March amid uncertainty about Trump's policies. And the stock market doesn't think Trump will deliver on one of his biggest economic promises. Here's Jeff Gundlach's full presentation on expensive stocks and the end of the Trump trade . In deal news, the owner of Krispy Kreme and Keurig is buying Panera Bread for $7.5 billion, and Warren Buffett's favorite banker is investing in the deal. Boeing and JetBlue just invested in a tiny electric-jet startup that could revolutionize air travel. Money is pouring in to a hot new area of science that could change the way we think about aging. A senator found Medicare blowing hundreds of millions on a drug private insurers wouldn't touch — and nothing happened. And one of the most controversial drug companies in America is out of the industry's lobby. Lastly, here's what it's like to eat a $295-per-person, 3-hour dinner at Eleven Madison Park, the best restaurant in the world.  Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hours. There's one important reason this time is different for the Fed - Not all Federal Reserve interest-rate moves are created equal: Some reverberate around the world, and others, like March's highly telegraphed increase, pass through markets with barely a whimper. A JPMorgan asset manager overseeing $350 billion thinks Europe is an unexploited opportunity for investors - Mainland Europe represents an underexploited and potentially lucrative opportunity for investors, according to the head of equities at JPMorgan Asset Management. Tesla is now bigger than Ford despite selling a fraction of the cars — and a threat is looming over the future - Tesla is having a big week. Walgreens sees a surprise drop in sales - Drugstore chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, reported a surprise drop in quarterly sales, citing challenging market conditions in continental Europe, and as a strong dollar reduced the value of sales outside the United States. How Apple product pricing compares to its closest competitors, in one chart - One of the loudest rumors about the redesigned iPhone expected to launch this fall is that it could cost $1,000 or more. The death of brick-and-mortar retail could hit these 9 companies hard in 2017 - The death spiral of traditional brick-and-mortar stores is having a ripple effect throughout the retail industry.  The 13 best US stocks you can buy right now, according to Credit Suisse - Credit Suisse just published a list of its top US stock picks.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print SPG signs Czech Republic By Theodoric Meyer 04/05/17 01:53 PM EDT With David Beavers and Aubree Eliza Weaver SPG SIGNS SECOND FOREIGN CLIENT: SPG, a small lobbying firm that’s brought on several former Donald Trump staffers since the election, has signed the Czech Republic as its second foreign client, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. The firm “is delighted to engage with the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Washington, D.C. in working to facilitate a successful and productive state visit by President Milos Zeman,” the letter reads. “As per our offer, we will assist you in this regard as a demonstration of our capabilities and as an expression of our sincere desire to establish a constructive and long-serving relationship with your country.” Story Continued Below — SPG one of handful of lobbying firms with Trump connections — including Corey Lewandowski’s Avenue Strategies and Gotham Government Relations & Communications, the New York firm that helped run Trump’s campaign announcement — that have been hunting for foreign clients since Trump’s election. The firm previously signed New Zealand and helped the country throw an inauguration bash that drew Steve Bannon and Rick Dearborn. MONUMENT OPENING SEATTLE OFFICE: Monument Policy Group is expanding to the West Coast, opening a Seattle office and bringing on Tim Punke to help run it. Punke, who was previously a senior vice president at Weyerhaeuser, had been a partner at Monument before leaving in 2013. The office will be focused on corporate and public affairs rather than lobbying, according to John Murray, a Monument partner and Seattle area native who’s moving back in August to run the new office with Punke. The firm is currently hunting for office space. — The new office will work with the Seattle-area companies that Monument already represents — including Amazon, Microsoft, Zillow, Boeing (which decamped for Chicago in 2001 but maintains a big presence in the state) and Weyerhaeuser — as well as hunting for new clients. The firm is particularly interested in signing growing billion-dollar companies looking to hire their first lobbying and public affairs firm. “That’s the kind of company that we’re really going to be focusing on bringing onto the roster,” Murray said. The firm sees Seattle as underserved compared with cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. “It seemed like a place we could go and really carve out a unique offering,” Murray said. NEW COALITION FORMS TO FIGHT ICAHN: “A new group has formed to fight the push by Trump special adviser Carl Icahn to force EPA to change which companies must comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard,” POLITICO’s Eric Wolff reports. “The Main Street Energy Alliance consists largely of fuel marketers like 7-Eleven and Racetrac, their trade associations and oil majors Shell and BP — but no ethanol producers or their industry associations. Their main purpose is to counter the effort by Icahn, Valero Energy and Monroe Energy to shift their compliance obligation under the biofuels program to the fuel marketers.’ A small group of refiners and their investors are trying to push through changes to the RFS to line their pockets at the expense of consumers and small businesses,” Michael Steele, a spokesman for Main Street, said in a statement.” More here.

LOBBYISTS SKEPTICAL OF REVIVED HEALTH CARE PUSH: From POLITICO’s Adam Cancryn and Paul Demko: “Powerful health industry groups shut out of the first failed GOP Obamacare repeal effort say the second version will collapse even faster. … Some hospital groups say they are so frustrated they have largely given up on trying to work with House Republicans, several industry sources told POLITICO. The hope is that Republicans in the Senate will be more receptive to their ideas if a repeal bill ever makes it out of the House. … ‘If the problem before was the belief that it was a bad bill that had no chance of passing the Senate, you’re actually doubling down on that,’ said one health care lobbyist, who called the GOP’s repeal proposal to this point a “complete crap sandwich.” Full story. EMBATTLED COAL COALITION REGROUPS: “The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity is a player on Capitol Hill again,” E&E News’ Dylan Brown reports. “With a new president in the White House and a new attitude at [EPA], a retooled version of the coal-fired trade group is hunting for new members and has returned to lobbying Congress.” Full story. HATCH RAISING LIKE HE’S RUNNING: Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) — who hasn’t said whether he’ll run for an eighth term yet — and Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) will headline a breakfast fundraiser at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday at the NRSC’s headquarters benefiting the Hatch Victory Committee, a joint fundraising committee for Hatch’s campaign, his leadership PAC and the NRSC. Here’s the invitation. MUSICIANS HIT THE HILL: More than 100 members of the Recording Academy are in town for the Grammys on the Hill fly-in on Thursday. They’re planning on meeting with more than 50 members, including Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Al Franken (D-Minn.); House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi; and Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). The academy is also holding an awards dinner tonight honoring Keith Urban and Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) for their support of the National Endowment for the Arts — an agency that’s on the chopping block in Trump’s budget. — Members of the National Association of Dental Plans are also flying in on Thursday, lobbying to maintain the tax exemption for employer-provided health and dental insurance, among other issues. THE MAN BEHIND ‘IMPEACH THE ASSOLE’: “Angelo Pesce is serving a 10-year prison sentence in Illinois for 'theft by deception.' While behind bars, he’s barred from voting,” the Center for Public Integrity’s Rachel Wilson reports. “But that hasn’t stopped Pesce from apparently creating “Impeach the Assole” — a crudely named federal political action committee formed last week to raise political campaign cash — and another dubbed “Angelo Pesce Defends Pedophiles.” No federal law prevents Pesce from forming a PAC or soliciting money for it. And he doesn’t have to tell unsuspecting donors he’s an inmate at Taylorville Correctional Center, having scammed a woman out of nearly $100,000.” MEANWHILE, IN FLORIDA: “Former Vice President Al Gore's son, Albert Gore III, has registered as a legislative lobbyist for Tesla Inc.” in Florida, per POLITICO’s Tallahassee Brief newsletter. JOB MOVES: — The Bockorny Group has added Spencer Pederson to work on tax, trade and energy issues. He was previously a senior tax and trade policy adviser to Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.). — John Weber is heading to Revolvis Consulting as a vice president and the director of its Washington office. He was previously a field finance director for the NRCC during the 2016 cycle. — Eli Dourado will join Boom Technology, a supersonic jet startup, later this month as head of global policy and communications. He was previously a senior research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center and the director of its technology policy program. SPOTTED: At the Internet Education Foundation's #HouseofCode reception in the Rayburn House Office Building, according to a PI tipster: Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), Ed Royce (R-Calif.), Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Greg Walden (R-Ore.), Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Will Hurd (R-Texas), Michael McCaul (R-Texas), Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), John Lewis (D-Ga.), David Price (D-N.C.), Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), Chris Smith (R-N.J.), Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), Steve Womack (R-Ark.), Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.); Tim Lordan, Rhianon Anderson and Melissa Medina of the Congressional App Challenge; Marcelino Ford-Livene, Terri Kokinda and Lindel Barber of Intel; Mitch Ruebush of Capital One; Austin Carson of TechFreedom; Laurent Crenshaw of Yelp; Rachel Wolbers of TwinLogic Strategies; Nicole Clifton of UPS and Rachel Bittner of Spotify.

For the first time on record, the national average APR reached 15.71 percent. Before this year, the highest average APR CreditCards.com recorded was 15.29 percent in December 2016. The average card APR for 2016 was 15.18 percent. Several card issuers boosted rates by a quarter of a percent this week in order to match the Federal Reserve’s March 2017 rate change. Bank of America, Discover, Capital One, Barclaycard and several regional banks, including SunTrust and Regions, increased rates on most card offers by 0.25 percent. The retail store Cabela’s also increased the APR on the Cabela’s Club Visa by 0.20 percent. Unlike most U.S. credit cards, the Cabela’s card is tied to the Libor rate rather than the U.S. prime rate. More cardholders rolling over debt Despite higher credit card interest rates, a growing number of households are carrying credit card balances and rolling over their balances from month-to-month. According to a new poll from the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and Boeing Employees Credit Union, 39 percent of U.S. adults carry over credit card debt from month to month – up from 35 percent in 2016. Meanwhile, 16 percent carry over at least $2,500 or more in debt. The uptick in cardholders carrying balances could make it harder for some families to absorb the Federal Reserve’s rate increases, said the NFCC in a news release. “Interest rate increases related to the recent Federal Reserve announcement will likely add to the cost of carrying credit card debt, which could increase financial pressures on families who are unable to find extra room in their budget to offset the impact of these changes.” The Federal Reserve is expected to modestly increase rates at least two more times before the end of the year. Federal Reserve policymakers have said it’s possible the federal agency will increase rates as many as three times over the next year. Already, cardholders who own cards with APRs close to the national average and carry at least $2,500 in debt could wind up paying up to $130 or more in interest charges if they take a year to clear their balances, according to CreditCards.com’s payoff calculator. Cardholders who can only afford to pay the minimum amount due could have an even harder time absorbing additional rate increases. For example, a cardholder with a 15.71 percent APR and at least $2,500 in debt would owe more than $1,559 in interest if he or she only paid the minimum amount due. According to the NFCC and BECU poll, 7 percent of cardholders confess they’ve already fallen behind on at least one credit card bill. Meanwhile, 8 percent admit that they’ve been rejected for a new card. Some consumers have also tamped down their overall spending, the survey found, which could indicate that they are already having a harder time managing their household expenses and are trying to cut back. For example, 26 percent of adults said they are spending less this year than they did the year before – up from 23 percent in 2016. “As more households carry costly credit card debt from month to month, spending could become a greater challenge as Americans try to pay off balances while working against a rising tide of interest and fees,” said the NFCC in the release.

(Courtesy JetBlue) Share Written by Leslie Josephs Obsession Getting There April 05, 2017 A small aerospace startup is trying to bring electricity-powered airplanes to the world’s skies, a technology it says will save time, money, the environment, and perhaps our hearing. Zunum Aero, based in Kirkland, Washington announced Wednesday that it is developing a hybrid electric airplane with batteries stored in its wings. The company hopes to have its new planes in the skies by the early 2020s. The goal is to drive down the cost of short-haul flights with distances of up to 1,000 miles. JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the airline, said it is backing Zunum, along with Boeing. (JetBlue declined to disclose its stake or how much it paid for it.) It will be like “Tesla for the air,” Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures, tells Quartz. Ashish Kumar, a mechanical and aerospace engineer, founded Zunum in 2013. The company’s name is derived from “tzunuum,” a Mayan word for hummingbird. Kumar claims his company’s electric hybrid propulsion technology can drive down costs for airlines by 40-80%. It would also save passengers money by allowing airplanes to more cost-effectively fly in and out of smaller airports instead of requiring passengers to connect via a large airport in an airline hub city. Frequent business travelers, or at least their corporate travel departments, know that short-haul journeys can quickly become pricey when they include one or more small airports. That’s because airlines carry fewer passengers to these destinations and have to charge more to cover the costs of operating a flight without as many passengers. For example, at current prices, a roundtrip ticket in early May between Mobile in southern Alabama and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was recently on sale for $239 for the 660-mile trip. Meanwhile, a 1,780-mile roundtrip between New York’s Laguardia Airport and Atlanta costs $160. Lowering the cost of flights could create a more affordable transportation option for those living in far-flung communities. This is important because US president Donald Trump last month proposed cutting government subsidies for rural airports, which could force some to close. The Zunum planes could eventually transport up to 50 people, according to Kumar, who expects a first prototype to be ready in about two years. Zunum isn’t the only company exploring battery-powered air travel. In July 2015, aircraft maker Airbus flew its fully electric E-Fan demonstrator aircraft over the English Channel. Still, many hurdles remain, such as proving that the concept is safe to government regulators. That’s a challenge facing other startups in the aviation business, such as those trying to revive commercial supersonic flight. Getting the first electric planes ready for commercial flights won’t be easy as getting electric cars on the road. But perhaps they can eventually share the charging network.

Artwork shows Zunum Aero’s hybrid electric airplanes in flight. (Zunum Aero Illustration) Four years after its founding, Zunum Aero is finally going public with a plan to build hybrid electric airplanes that could revolutionize service to regional airports in the 2020s. “This is our coming out of stealth,” said Ashish Kumar, the founder and CEO of the company, which is headquartered in Kirkland, Wash. Zunum, whose name comes from the Mayan word for hummingbird, aims to develop 10- to 50-seat aircraft that can pave the way for what Kumar calls a “golden age of regional travel.” To follow through on that vision, the company has patented its concept and has won backing from the Boeing Co. as well as from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of JetBlue Airways. “Boeing is investing in Zunum because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space,” Steve Nordlund, vice president of strategy for Boeing Defense, Space and Security, said in a statement. Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures, was similarly bullish. She said Zunum was likely to “light up a vast network of underutilized airports and re-invent regional travel.” The idea is to create aircraft that are well-suited for routes that have fallen into disuse due to trends that have dominated the airline industry over the past few decades – trends that favor larger aircraft serving bigger airports. Kumar cited figures suggesting that only 2 percent of the nation’s more than 5,000 airports account for 96 percent of today’s air traffic. That means the bigger airports are jammed, while scheduled service from the smaller airports is costly, if it exists at all. Zunum Aero says the greater efficiencies of hybrid electric propulsion could reduce fares by 40 to 80 percent for routes ranging up to 1,000 miles. Shifting traffic to underutilized regional airports could cut door-to-door travel times by 40 percent on busy routes such as Silicon Valley to Los Angeles, and by as much as 80 percent for less trafficked routes, Zunum says. Hybrid electric planes also bring environmental benefits in the form of lower emissions and less noise. Kumar said Zunum Aero has been working with the Center for Power Optimization of Electro-Thermal Systems at the University of Illinois on a technology approach that blends battery storage with engine-generated power. An onboard software system would calculate when the engine needs to be on, and for how long, depending on the route. As batteries become more capable, the airplane’s power train could go all-electric, Kumar said. Zunum has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration to drive development of certification standards for electric aircraft. Kumar said he anticipates the standards to be in place by next year, opening the way for certification in 2020. That’s just about the time when the first planes based on Zunum Aero’s technology could be ready to roll off a production line. This artist’s conception shows two potential designs for hybrid-electric planes. (Zunum Aero Illustration) Zunum isn’t alone in pursuing the dream of electric airplanes. Boeing has been putting resources into hybrid-electric development projects for years.  Airbus has its long-running E-Fan program, which is evolving into a hybrid electric initiative that’s similar to Zunum’s. Uber is working on electric-powered flying cars. So is Zee Aero, which is backed by Google co-founder Larry Page. Kumar is confident that Zunum Aero’s technological approach will win out, but he acknowledges that his company won’t be able to take on all the challenges of aircraft production by itself. “We know that’s going to take partners,” he told GeekWire. Zunum’s development plan calls for aircraft with a range of 700 miles to be ready by the early 2020s, with that range extended to 1,000 miles by 2030. “You need to do the range very carefully to get to the disruptive economics, which is what we are focused on,” Kumar said. If the economics are done right, Kumar said that could open the way for cheaper flights from Everett’s Paine Field, Seattle’s Boeing Field and Moses Lake’s Grant County International Airport. You might even see flights to unconventional locales, such as Seaside in Oregon. “We’d love to go to Cannon Beach, but it’s a long drive,” Kumar said. “It could be a $30, $40 one-way flight down to Cannon Beach from Boeing Field.” That’s a prime example of how new technology just might bring back the good old days of aviation. “You can turn the clock back to where you did have air service in these airports with smaller aircraft,” Kumar said, “and bring back high-speed connectivity to communities that don’t have it.” Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

Putting Spotlight on Policy of Plane Sales to Iran (AP) By Mark Swanson   |   Wednesday, 05 Apr 2017 11:35 AM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Boeing's announced agreement to sell another 60 airplanes to Iran has exposed an Obama-era policy that's now under extreme vetting by President Donald Trump's administration, The Washington Free Beacon reported. The $3 billion deal announced Tuesday — part of the umbrella nuclear accord reached with the terrorist state under President Barack Obama — now needs the approval of Trump's administration, the Beacon reported. The Treasury Department confirmed that it "will be reviewing aviation licensing as part of the National Security Council's ongoing interagency review of the Iran deal," past and present, the Beacon reported. Trump campaigned on scuttling the U.S.-Iran nuclear pact and renewed his intent to do so after taking office, recently calling it "the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated." And the White House is getting pressure to put an end to these deals, given the presumption that Iran uses American-made planes to transport weapons to terrorists, the Beacon reported. "On the same day Bashar al-Assad's Air Force dropped chemical weapons onto children, an American company announced its intent to sell airplanes to Assad's patrons in Tehran," Rep. Peter Roskam told the Free Beacon. "We will do everything within our power, and we hope the administration will do everything within its power, to prevent the sale of even more airplanes to state-owned companies in the Islamic Republic." Boeing's deal with Aseman Airlines, still allowed legally so long as it doesn't involve Iranian entities restricted by U.S. sanctions, comes on top of the aircraft maker's near $17 billion pact with Iran Air late last year, which is still being finalized. This test for Trump is a showdown between his Iran pledge vs. hurting business for Boeing; if Boeing's not allowed to consummate the combined $20 billion in sales to Iran, another company will. "Maybe [Boeing is] right — though that's not the mood on the Hill," a source told the Free Beacon.

See also: Chinese theme park will send tourists into space See also: NASA to change air travel with quiet supersonic jet It is are working with Boeing Horizon X and JetBlue Technology Ventures to develop 10-50 of these new aircraft. The plan is to cut overall travel times with more efficient flying and a streamlined boarding process. Passengers will be able to board like they would a train or a bus because you can bring your luggage into the cabin. Studies show that many travelers choose driving over flying regionally because of how time-consuming a flight can be. By using mostly 'general aviation airports', customers should be able to cut down on the wasted ground-time like the long drive to major airports as well as the wait time once you arrive. The electric planes are supposed to be more efficient than jet-fueled planes and will have a backup generator on board for longer flights. Zunum's first plane is expected to take flight in 2020 and to fly up to 700 miles, which is like a flight from San Francisco to Portland.

About us Membership Contact us Thu April 6, 2017 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia Talks with Mitsubishi ongoing despite Boeing deal, Iran says Economy April 5, 2017 TEHRAN - Iran's Aseman Airlines said negotiations with Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp. on the purchase of passenger jets are still ongoing despite its having signed a new agreement with Boeing Co. on the purchase of 30 planes. "Having contracts with Boeing or any other aircraft maker doesn't mean that we have given up negotiations for purchasing MRJ," Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told Kyodo News after the agreement with Boeing was signed on Tuesday in Tehran. As per the agreement, Aseman will buy 30 passenger planes model 737 MAX worth $3 billion. The MOU also provides the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional 737 MAXs and the American plane maker is to start delivering the airplanes from 2022. According to Iranian transport officials, negotiations with Mitsubishi to purchase 25 aircraft with the value of $500 million began last year. Aseman has kept Japan in the list of countries which still can sell new aircraft to Iran, according to Iranian officials. Aviation sanctions on Iran were lifted in January 2016, just months after it signed with France, Germany, China, Russia, Britain and United States an agreement on its nuclear program. Shortly afterward, Iran inked an $18 billion deal with France-based Airbus for 46 Airbus A320 planes, 38 A330 planes and 16 A350 XWB aircraft. It was finalized last December. That same month, state-owned Iran Air signed a $16.6 billion agreement to purchase 80 new Boeing 777 and 737 passenger planes, to be delivered over a period of 10 years.

Manufacturing stocks led the Dow Jones Industrial Average with Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) up 2%, United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) gained 0.9%, and Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) jumped 1.2%. On the broader front, the S&P 500 inched out a gain of 0.1% helped by the energy sector, which rose 0.7%. Crude oil (WTI) for May gained 1.6% to $51.03 per barrel. However, even with gains in oil and natural gas prices, the index traded within a ten-point range for the entire day. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 39 points at 20,689, the S&P 500 closed at 2,360 for a one-point gain, the Nasdaq rose 4 points, closing at 5,899, and the Russell 2000 fell one point to 1,368. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 801 million shares with total volume of 3.2 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 1.8 billion shares. On the Big Board, advancers slightly exceeded decliners, and on the Nasdaq, decliners led by 1.4-to-1. Blocks on the NYSE rose to 6,739 from 6,304 on Monday. Click to Enlarge The favorite index for economists is the Dow Jones Transportation Average. The index is purported to reflect economic conditions six to nine months in advance. Currently the macro trend is up, but the near-term is shaky. Last week’s break of the Dow Jones Transportation Average’s 50-day moving average by its 20-day (green line) signaled a near-term break. And the break was further compounded by five days closing below the support line at 9,045. Click to Enlarge The Dow Jones Industrial Average is having its own problems: After topping in March at 21,169, the index has been stymied by a short-term trend line that is holding back rallies at roughly the 20-day moving average. Prices are being squeezed between the 50- and 20-day MA’s. Volume is contracting on advances and increasing slightly on advances — not a favorable pattern. Conclusion: Stocks have enjoyed a major advance in just the first quarter. Our charts show that the advance has exhausted further buying despite reports of major amounts of money on the sidelines. Waiting for bullish commitments from blocks of institutional buyers can be boring. But, in the long run boring is good. Therefore, let’s wait it out.

Story Continued Below “According to a Syrian opposition group, renewed airstrikes hit the town of Khan Sheikhoun a day after the attack that the Trump administration has blamed on the government of President Bashar Assad, saying that his patrons, Russia and Iran, bore "great moral responsibility" for the deaths. “The Damascus and Moscow governments denied they were behind the attack. A Russian Defense Ministry statement later said the toxic agents were released when a Syrian airstrike hit a rebel arsenal. “The U.N. Security Council was to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday in response to the strike and in Brussels, officials from 70 nations gathered for a major donors' conference on the future of Syria and the region.” Victims foam at the mouth and struggle to breath, adds The Washington Post. — WHITE HOUSE CALLS ATTACK ‘REPREHENSIBLE,’ via our colleague Louis Nelson: “An apparent chemical weapons attack in northern Syria is a “reprehensible” act of violence, the White House said in a statement Tuesday that also accused the previous administration of failing in its efforts to halt the ongoing civil war there … "’Today's chemical attack in Syria against innocent people including women and children is reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world,’ White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at an off-camera gaggle with reporters Tuesday. ‘These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution.’” — ATTACK WILL TEST TRUMP, writes POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi: “Just last week, top aides to President Donald Trump declared that ousting Bashar Assad from power is no longer a priority for the United States, calling the Syrian strongman’s continued rule a “political reality” that needs to be accepted. “Now, reports of a deadly chemical weapons attack in Syria have brought home another reality: priority or not, Assad still poses a political problem for Trump, and it's one that won’t simply vanish by blaming former President Barack Obama.” And Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) calls the White House’s Syria policy “another disgraceful chapter in American history,” Louis adds.

HAPPENING TODAY — SERVICES SOUND-OFF ON A NEW CR: The top officers in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps testify before the House Armed Services Committee on the risks associated with a new continuing spending resolution. According to his prepared testimony, obtained by our colleague Jacqueline Klimas, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson, is set to tell the committee that the impact of a full-year continuing resolution on the Navy would be dire, including $500 million in cuts to pay for raises and housing allowances for troops, the realignment of $5.1 billion in shipbuilding accounts and additional delays and “churn” for the nation’s “already-besieged shipyards.” And without the boost provided by a requested $30 billion supplemental spending bill for this year, Richardson says three ships expected to deploy to Europe and the Middle East will stay home, sailors may leave the Navy because they can’t be paid bonuses and the service will be unable to fix known cyber vulnerabilities. “Our ability to deter potential adversaries will be undercut, and our allies and partners will become less certain of our capabilities, which will further intensify the competition,” Richardson says in his prepared opening statement. The current spending resolution expires April 28, and Congress will have to act to stave of a government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnelll (R-Ky.), though, says he expects the Senate to pass a fiscal 2017 spending bill before government funding runs out, report our colleagues Jennifer Scholtes and Sarah Ferris. The Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee also holds a classified hearing this morning on intelligence programs and threat assessments with CIA director Mike Pompeo and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers. ALSO TODAY — HOUSE VOTES TO EXTEND VA CHOICE: The House is set to vote on legislation to extend the life of the Veterans' Choice Program, which passed the Senate Monday. The bill removes the August expiration date for the emergency program, allowing VA to spend the nearly $1 billion allocated for Choice. AND ON THURSDAY, TRUMP MEETS WITH THE CHINESE PRESIDENT AT MAR-A-LARGO, via The Wall Street Journal: “A month after tough talk on China helped win Donald Trump the presidency, Beijing’s top diplomat visited Trump Tower and delivered a stern lecture on the need to respect Chinese interests. “It didn’t go over well. A day later, Mr. Trump challenged Beijing with a veiled threat to bolster U.S. ties to the democratic island of Taiwan. Since then, both sides have maneuvered, largely behind the scenes, to lower the temperature, setting the stage for Mr. Trump’s first meeting with China’s leader, President Xi Jinping, later this week. “The summit now offers a test of that strategy and a chance for the two leaders, if they choose to take it, to recalibrate relations and reduce the risk of flare-ups over trade, North Korea or the South China Sea.” Will Trump forget Taiwan at the summit? The Washington Post asks. And South Korea escalates its dispute with China in the shadow of plans to host a U.S. missile defense system, the WSJ adds. — NORTH KOREA FIRES A BALLISTIC MISSILE AHEAD OF TRUMP-XI SUMMIT, reports The New York Times: “ North Korea fired a ballistic missile off its east coast on Wednesday, a day before President Trump was to host his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida for their first summit meeting. “The missile test is likely to intensify differences between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi over how to deal with the recalcitrant regime in North Korea. “The timing is also a deep embarrassment for Mr. Xi as the leader of China, which for decades has been the North’s closest ally.” — TILLERSON: U.S. HAS 'SPOKEN ENOUGH,’ writes The Associated Press: “The response of America's chief diplomat to North Korea's latest missile launch was an abrupt departure from the usual - which may be a turning point, analysts in Asia say. “The statement from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson totaled 23 words: ‘North Korea launched yet another intermediate range ballistic missile. The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.’" ** A message from BAE Systems: BAE Systems has a long history of supporting maritime firepower, continually enhancing cornerstone gun systems like the Mk 45 to leverage adaptability, introduce new technologies, increase system capability, and extend ranges through innovative advanced munitions.

Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, urged the president in a letter to expedite the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense system (THAAD) in South Korea. The letter, signed by 25 other senators, including SASC leaders McCain and Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), also noted concerns about retaliatory measures China has taken against South Korea in response to its decision to deploy THAAD. “While China continues to aggressively oppose a missile defense system on the Korean Peninsula, China has done little to slow or halt North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs — the only reason the system is needed,” the senators wrote. MCCAIN ‘SATISFIED’ WITH AIR FORCE NOMINEE’S ETHICS ANSWERS, reports our colleague Connor O’Brien: “Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain says he's satisfied with the answers to the questions senators had over ethics issues surrounding the nominee for Air Force secretary, former New Mexico Rep. Heather Wilson, and that he'd push for a committee vote before the Senate goes on spring break at the end of the week. "’I saw no evidence that she violated ethics,’ the Arizona Republican told reporters. ‘I asked her those questions from the beginning of the hearing and got satisfactory answers, at least they satisfied me.’” FORMER OBAMA NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER RICE DENIES POLITICIZING INTEL, via POLITICO’s Madeline Conway: “Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Tuesday denied accusations from critics that she sought for political purposes the identities of officials on Donald Trump's transition team who were swept up in intelligence reports. “‘The allegation is that somehow Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes,’ Rice told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. ‘That’s absolutely false.’” “Several news outlets reported Monday that while Rice was in the White House, she requested that the names of Trump transition team officials be ‘unmasked’ in some intelligence reports.” — MCCONNELL BACKS PROBE, reports our colleague Cristiano Lima: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday backed calls for a congressional investigation into allegations that Susan Rice, the national security adviser to former President Barack Obama, ‘unmasked’ Trump transition officials in intelligence reports for political purposes. "’I have asked the [Senate] Intelligence Committee, Sen. [Richard] Burr, Sen. [Mark] Warner, to conduct a bipartisan investigation of this whole episode,’ McConnell told Fox News anchor Dana Perino in an interview. ‘They will conduct it. Hopefully at the end we will find out what happened and they will issue a report, I hope, on a bipartisan basis.’" As the House Intelligence Committee seeks Rice’s testimony as part of its Russia investigation, reports the WSJ. And Rice becomes a new target of conservative attacks, writes POLITICO’s Michael Crowley. DEATH TOLL RISES IN RUSSIA BOMBING, reports the NYT: “In addition to killing 14 people, the blast on Monday wounded 64 others, a St. Petersburg official, Aleksandr Rzhanenkov, said at a news briefing. The wounded included citizens of Belarus, Latvia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, he said, as well as Ukrainians from the embattled eastern region of Donetsk. “Members of the Islamic State have periodically threatened to carry out attacks in Russia in retaliation for its intervention in the Syrian conflict, among other reasons.” — AND THE BOMBING WILL TEST RUSSIA’S SYRIA POLICY, adds Reuters: “Islamist militants have targeted Russia many times before but Monday's bombing of a metro train in St Petersburg was, for President Vladimir Putin, personal: it happened in his native city on a day he was making a visit back home. “The attack, which killed 14 people and wounded 50, is also a test for one of Putin's most contentious policies — his decision to launch a military intervention in Syria on the side of President Bashar al-Assad. “Kremlin-watchers say the risk is that Russian voters could decide, after seeing the destruction in St Petersburg, that the Syrian operation is making them more vulnerable to such attacks - not safer as Putin promised.” NEW SOMALI PIRATE ATTACKS RAISE FEARS, reports the NYT: “Are the pirates back? “After years of quiet seas, undisturbed voyages and no major attacks, Somali pirates have waylaid four ships in the past month, raising fears that the pirate menace has returned to the Indian Ocean.” INDUSTRY INTEL — BOEING TESTS TRUMP ON IRAN, writes the NYT: “The Boeing Company announced a tentative agreement on Tuesday to sell up to 60 737s to an Iranian airline, a transaction valued at $6 billion that angered American critics of Iran and appeared likely to test the Trump administration’s avowed hostility toward that country. “Boeing, a leading commercial aerospace company and a top American exporter, said in a statement that the agreement, which requires United States government approval, would create about 18,000 American jobs.” — LOCKHEED LANDS $1.6 BILLION ARMY CONTRACT, reports the AP: “The Pentagon has awarded a $1.6 billion contract to Lockheed Martin for more mobile radar systems that will be assembled at one of the company's New York plants. “Rick Herodes, program director of the Q-53 radar system, told The Post-Standard that the Bethesda, Maryland-based defense contractor will make at least 70 more of the radars over the next five years.” MCSALLY INTRODUCES BILL TO FIGHT NUDE PHOTO SHARING: In the wake of the Marines United nude-photo-sharing scandal, Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) is introducing legislation today aimed at increasing protections for victims of nonconsensual sharing of intimate media in the military. "This bill defines when photo sharing is a crime, which is not clear in current law, and addresses questions related to freedom of speech and intent," McSally, an Air Force veteran, said in a letter seeking support for the bill.

Now Boarding - By Les Shu   Digital Trends Home > Business > Cross the globe while cutting costs with these… Cross the globe while cutting costs with these affordable long-haul airlines By Les Shu — April 2, 2017 9:00 AM Subscribe Share Level is the newest long-haul low-cost carrier to offer flights between the U.S. and Europe. Level/IAG Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends You’re probably familiar with Allegiant, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, and Spirit airlines, but what about WOW Air, Level, AirAsia X, Eurowings, or Norwegian? If you’re looking to save money on international travel to Europe or Asia, then you should get to know these long haul, low-cost carriers (LCC). For domestic U.S. travel, budget airlines are common and popular. These “no frills” carriers typically offer varied price tiers, advertise bargain basement fares, serve secondary airports, operate point-to-point (versus connecting through a hub), have one class of service with little legroom, and charge fees for almost everything, like seat assignment, early boarding, food and beverage, checked baggage, blanket, etc. More: Get comfy in that coach seat with the best gear for long-haul travel Take that concept, but add many more hours to the journey, and what you get is a long-haul LCC. Unlike legacy carriers, these international operators attract customers with low fares, and then upsell on extras. Large carriers have traditionally dominated trans-oceanic flights, and tickets are generally more expensive, but there has been growth in long-haul LCCs thanks to less-stringent government regulations and more-efficient long-range aircraft, such as Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. While the discount model is fine for short flights, it may be a different story for those that could be as long as nine hours (more or less, depending on the route). The schedules and destinations may not appeal to non-leisure travelers, who desire flexibility, convenience, and amenities. And, LCCs aren’t always the cheapest, so it’s a good idea to use Google Flights, Kayak, or Hopper to do some price comparison. However, due to the popularity of LCCs stateside, as well as the many fees implemented by legacy carriers, budget travelers have grown accustomed to having fewer amenities. Paying to check a bag? What was considered heresy a decade ago is now accepted (with reluctance) by many travelers. Thinking back to our most recent long-haul jaunt, it’s hard to imagine flying for half a day without a complimentary meal, inflight entertainment, and Wi-Fi. Which is why we think the legacy carriers still have a place when it comes to international travel, especially the destinations they serve. However, as consumer sentiment evolves and legacy carriers continue to mimic their LCC counterparts – as we’ve seen with the new restrictive “basic economy” fares introduced by American, Delta, and United – we wouldn’t be surprise if the LCC model becomes the new norm. From a tech viewpoint, these budget carriers aren’t entirely no-frills. Some airlines offer inflight entertainment, power outlets, or even Wi-Fi. For the tech savvy, that may be enough to endure a long flight while sitting in a cramped seat. Here are five international discount carriers that have been making news, and a look at onboard tech offered. AirAsia X Onboard tech: Inflight entertainment (via mobile tablet, for a fee in coach; not available on all flights), in-seat power (business class only). The long-haul division of AirAsia, AirAsia X announced in January that it has received clearance from the Federal Aviation Authority to operate flights from Asia to the U.S. – the first Asian LCC to do so, according to the company. AirAsia X plans to launch the four-times-a-week service on June 28, 2017, between Honolulu, Hawaii and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with a connection in Osaka, Japan. Introductory one-way fares were as low as $99. Although regular fares will be higher, a quick search found fares are still less expensive than competitors that fly the Honolulu-Osaka route. The route will likely appeal to Japanese holidaymakers, as Hawaii is a popular leisure destination. However, AirAsia X has had its eyes on the U.S. mainland for some time. The carrier says it is considering other states as part of its expansion plans. The trans-Pacific routes are some of the most expensive to fly, and therefore are lucrative for airlines that operate them. If AirAsia X could bring the low fares stateside, it may force traditional long-haul carriers to match. (Whether AirAsia X could turn a profit is a different story.) For now, trans-Pacific flights will remain the stronghold of legacy carriers. AirAsia X packs them in: its Airbus A330-300 planes seat 365 coach passengers. Every amenity comes with a fee: preferred seating (we recommend the twin seats toward the rear of the aircraft), meals, and checked baggage, Inflight entertainment is provided via a mobile tablet, however, AirAsia X hasn’t announced if it would be offered on the new route. Wi-Fi isn’t an option. Splurge for one of 12 premium flatbed seats and everything is pretty much included, plus a few extras.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Apr 5, 2017, 5:00am EDT share tweet Linkedin Zunum Aero Flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles can be a huge pain in the ass. You can expect to spend over $200 on your plane ticket, plus another five hours of traveling door-to-door thanks to traffic, security, and other headaches. This is the type of hassle-rich trip — short but overly expensive and overly complicated — that a new startup called Zunum Aero is aiming to reinvent. The Kirkland, Washington-based company, which came out of stealth mode today, plans to build a fleet of hybrid electric jets to sell to major carriers for service on densely traveled regional routes like San Francisco to Los Angeles or Boston to Washington, DC. The company has received backing from Boeing and JetBlue Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of JetBlue Airways. Lower operating costs (i.e., no fueling) will allow carriers to reduce fares by 40 to 80 percent, they predict. And by flying a smaller aircraft that would be subject to fewer TSA regulations, Zunum claims it will take less time to go through security before boarding one of its planes. SF to LA in half the time and half the cost Zunum aims to build several models of hybrid-electric propulsion jets. At launch, its first class of aircraft will be tiny, in the 10–15 foot range, with a 10-passenger capacity and a range of up to 700 miles on a single charge. (Think San Francisco to Portland or Atlanta to DC.) Those planes can be expected to roll off the assembly line by the early 2020s, the company’s CEO Ashish Kumar told The Verge. By the 2030s, as electric battery technology improves, Zunum hopes to build larger aircraft that can carry up to 50 passengers and travel up to 1,000 miles on a single charge. (Think Seattle to LA or Boston to Jacksonville, Florida.) “We’re entering the golden era where we’ll have high-speed links to every community on the backs of quiet, sustainable hybrid-electric technology,” Kumar said. “And that’s going to happen really fast.” Zunum has been in the works for three years. Kumar is a veteran of Silicon Valley, having worked at Google, Microsoft, Dell, and McKinsey. His co-founders are Matt Knapp, an engineer who has helped build jets and rockets, and Kiruba Haran, a University of Illinois professor who leads a NASA-funded program to develop electric airliners. The regions in which Zunum Aero sees its short-haul flights operating. Image: Zunum Aero Zunum’s aircraft will feature hybrid electric motors with the capacity to accept recharging power from a variety of sources. Because airplanes are typically kept in service for up to 30 years, Kumar says its important for Zunum’s aircraft to be future proof. That means designing them to be compatible with future battery designs and range-extending generators, with an eye toward ultimately switching from hybrid propulsion to fully electric motors once the technology catches up. While more and more electric cars are introduced onto the road, electric-powered aviation is still in its infancy. Tougher demands such as battery weight, in addition to regulatory requirements, have resulted in far fewer strides in electric aviation, experts say. An all-electric plane in Germany recently broke a record, flying 211 mph over a distance of under two miles. Airbus has been developing its own electric plane prototype called the E-Fan concept, which became the first electric plane to fly across the English Channel in 2015. Having just completed work on its powertrain and preliminary design of its aircraft, Zunum says its now in the “build phase.” Still, the startup has a ways to go if it’s to meet its projections. Zunum is about as small as they come, with under 10 employees right now, but Kumar says the plan is to ramp up aggressively. He wouldn’t reveal the amount of funding he’s received from Boeing and JetBlue, nor the total amount of money raised. What Kumar would disclose, however, is the origin of his company’s name. “Zunum” is a derivation of “tzunuum,” the Mayan word for hummingbird. Think small, fast, and quiet.

[Photos: courtesy of Zunum Aero] By Daniel Terdiman04.05.17 | 5:00 am There was a time, not that many years ago, when the notion of electric or even hybrid cars taking over our roads and highways would have been considered absurd. We know how that turned out. Now it’s time to apply the same thought experiment to passenger airplanes. This morning Zunum Aero, a Seattle-based startup that has been in stealth mode for three years, unveiled its plans for 10- to 50-seat hybrid and electric planes that could transform the industry by the early 2020s—slashing ticket prices and reducing travel time. Zunum, backed by JetBlue Technology Ventures and Boeing’s new HorizonX innovation venture fund, thinks the key to unlocking the potential of the short-haul aviation sector lies in the nation’s 5,000 regional airports. These underutilized airstrips could do a better job than the 136 hub airports that currently serve the vast majority of commercial air traffic to get millions of passengers closer to their destinations. With airplanes that Zunum claims will fly up to 700 miles on hybrid gas-electric systems by next decade—and as far as 1,000 miles by 2030—as well as streamlined security operations that could allow passengers to board in minutes, the company believes it’ll be well-positioned to grab a nice chunk of a market worth several hundred billion dollars. Ironically, that opportunity is due to the phenomenal success of the major airlines, which, via more powerful jet engines and large long-range aircraft, have shifted the world to a small network of major hubs that currently handle more than 90% of the country’s air passenger traffic, explains Zunum CEO Ashish Kumar. It’s become easy and efficient to travel between the world’s large cities, but Kumar says that system has also created a “regional transport gap” that makes it slow and expensive to travel distances between 100 and 1,000 miles. Ashish Kumar In fact, Kumar said, as much as 86% of the total door-to-door travel time for such short-haul trips is taken up with driving to and from larger airports. By allowing more passengers to use the 5,000 regional airports, much of that would no longer be necessary. And that could make it possible to cut the average time for a trip between Silicon Valley and Los Angeles from more than five hours today to two-and-a-half hours, or to cut in half the time and cost of flying from Boston to Washington, D.C. Disrupting conventional air travel is all the rage right now. One company, Boom Supersonic, aims to make it possible to travel at the speed of sound for business-class prices. And Zunum isn’t the only company attempting to bring the power of hybrid and electric technology to aviation. Just last month, Wright Electric, an alumnus of Silicon Valley’s prestigious Y Combinator accelerator, unveiled its own plans for such planes. But to hear Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures tell it, Zunum is the “real deal.” JetBlue Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of JetBlue, focuses on future innovations that could impact the travel experience “soup to nuts,” Simi said. From technologies that could improve passengers’ experiences to aviation maintenance to loyalty programs, the Silicon Valley-based investor is looking at innovations that could revamp the travel industry in 5 or 10 years. Zunum’s plans also illustrate the renewed interest in the regional transportation ecosystem. The long-haul airline industry isn’t likely to be disrupted anytime soon, Simi said, but there’s a lot of interest in upending the market for transporting people between 300 and 600 miles. That’s led to efforts like the Hyperloop, a system of tubes meant to transport passengers in capsules at speeds of up to 700 miles an hour, or experiments with special highway lanes meant to boost transit efficiencies. “We’ve done an enormous amount of due diligence” on potential disruptors, Simi said, eventually concluding that Zunum’s technology and the experience of its team made it the best investment. “We believe that hybrid-electric aircraft are coming,” Simi said, “When I look at what’s out there, I absolutely believe in [Zunum’s] team and [its] patents.” For its part, Boeing’s interest in Zunum is based on the startup’s focus on clean energy, as well as electric propulsion. Steve Nordlund, the vice president in charge of Boeing’s HorizonX, said that the aviation giant has been pursuing similar hybrid-electric technology internally, and thought it made sense to be part of Zunum’s effort by investing, as well as by taking on an advisory role to help the company become a successful player in the aerospace industry. “We were intrigued by their business model, as well as what could happen in the marketplace,” Nordlund said, “and the technology focus that they had.” Zunum’s idea is for its planes to feature a purely electric thrust system in which all the power comes from batteries, but could be switched over to run off a fuel-powered generator. That dynamic could help airlines (and passengers) feel comfortable flying battery-operated planes, since they’d know they could switch to traditional power if necessary. Still, Kumar said, he thinks some airlines may decide to fly their shortest routes using nothing but electric power. The company has been working with the FAA for three years, he explained, on eventual certification. The federal agency has developed rules governing electric planes, and Kumar said he expects Zunum’s first planes to meet the new standards for regional electric aircraft by 2020. Zunum and other companies developing efficient regional transportation also benefit from the Transportation Safety Administration’s more lax security regulations for flights on planes with less than 60 passengers. And because many customers taking such short flights will return to their point of origin the same day, Kumar expects that they’ll be carrying less luggage, creating the opportunity for what he called “walk-on, walk-off” flights that don’t require much traveling time. Ultimately, Zunum is projecting 40% reductions in door-to-door travel times on busy routes, and up to 80% reductions on rarely traveled itineraries. At the same time, the flights could initially generate 80% fewer emissions, and zero emissions over time as airlines adopt all-electric propulsion. Zunum currently has less than 10 employees, but Kumar is planning on doubling and then tripling his staff in the next year. The company did not disclose how much funding it has received from JetBlue Technology Ventures, Boeing, and its other investors.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: April 5th, 2017 >> Story Satnews Daily April 5th, 2017 On the 33rd Space Symposium Show Floor — Curtiss-Wright  Highlights Their Smart Backplane Technology Curtiss-Wright’s Defense Solutions division has introduced their Smart Backplane subsystem (KAM/CSB/12U), a rugged multi-slot chassis designed specifically to address the unique performance and environmental requirements of data acquisition, data processing, and recording in radiation-intensive space environments. Because the Smart Backplane is designed as a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution, it lowers the cost of space flight while speeding development time and significantly reducing program risk. A fundamental threat for electronics systems deployed in radiation-intensive environments is the destructive power of Single Event Latch-Ups (SEL). Until now, this threat has required the use of costly radiation-hardened electronics hardware. The Smart Backplane is the central component to the first data acquisition system designed for space applications that provides radiation protection in a manner that enables the use of 100+ cost-effective standard COTS I/O modules. Curtiss-Wright’s Smart Backplane technology has already been selected by The Boeing Company to supply rugged data handling avionics for use in the Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 spacecraft. More recently, Smart Backplane was selected by Italy’s ELV SpA (Avio Group) to provide a COTS-based telemetry data system for the new VEGA-C launcher. The highly rugged Smart Backplane is designed for use in demanding space-based mission critical data handling applications on launch vehicles, re-entry vehicles, and low earth orbit satellites. Curtiss-Wright’s Smart Backplane technology provides system designers with an intelligent multi-slot backplane that protects its critical data acquisition electronics with a unique radiation tolerant architecture.  If a potential SEL is detected on any of the chassis’ COTS modules, the Smart Backplane resets the operation of that module only. Typically the affected module is back operating again within a few seconds, eliminating the potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation, which can result in electronic circuit malfunction. Smart Backplane also helps to reduce the platform’s overall power requirements because it enables any of the chassis modules to be commanded individually to switch on or off during different phases of a spacecraft mission. For maximum reliability, the backplane also provides continuous health status information to the on-board mission computer as well as a watchdogging capability (e.g. it monitors whether an SEL is detected repeatedly in the same module, or if the unit temperature exceeds a pre-defined value). curtisswrightds.com/space Topical Tags :  Events    New Products    Manufacturing    Business Moves          Regional Tags :  North America                     FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News Ruag Has a Reason to Celebrate...

Hume Oregon Tech president Dr. Nagi Naganathan during a meeting with the Herald and News editorial board in his office on Tuesday. Although Nagi Naganathan officially started in his new role as the seventh president of Oregon Tech on Monday, he’s been logging hours and air miles advocating for the polytechnic university since the board of trustees selected him in November. From meetings with executives from large companies to brainstorming ways to escalate the educational atmosphere at Oregon Tech, Naganathan expressed a commitment on Tuesday to aim higher to meet industry standards with top flight students. He also talked about new efforts to engage students with the university and surrounding community. “We just have to be cognizant we are preparing students for life, not just for a job,” Naganathan said. × Advertisement “You are really preparing the students not just to be a good engineer or a good medical professional, you’re also preparing them to be a good citizen.” Developing goals Naganathan, who was selected as the top pick of two finalists for the post in November, succeeded Jay Kenton, interim president, and former president Chris Maples. Naganathan sat down with Herald and News staffers to talk about developing goals for the upcoming academic year. “You have to be visible, you have to be engaged, you have the responsibility being the face of the university,” Naganathan said. “There is a myth in Toledo that I don’t go to sleep. I intend to keep it that way.” Naganathan comes to the Oregon Tech campuses in Klamath Falls and Wilsonville from the University of Toledo in Ohio, where he served as interim president and previously as a dean of engineering for many years. He also served as the founding chairperson of the Mechanical, Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Department. The new president plans to meet with faculty and staff in the next few months to gauge tangible goals for the new administration. “What I’m hoping to do by July is come up with a set of goals this institution is going to sign up for, at least for the next year,” Naganathan said. “Then some of them will be completed in two to three years.” The goals are a way for more people to answer the question, “What’s Oregon Tech doing today?” Roots in India Naganathan grew up in Southern India, and came to the United States as an international student in 1979 to the Village of Potsdam in upstate New York. He later joined the University of Toledo’s faculty and administration. When asked how to keep Oregon Tech students local, Naganathan shared a personal example, “I would not have left Potsdam (New York) if there was an opportunity for me there. “In our case, we have four to five years to work with those students. That is the time to engage them. “There is a lot to work with here,” he added. “The university has a very good reputation. When I meet with employers, when I meet with elected officials, uniformly you hear a lot of good things.” Naganathan has met with executives from Boeing, a key employer partner of Oregon Tech, and is currently floating the concept of seeking a satellite Boeing operation in Klamath Falls to employ OIT students. Nothing is set in stone, but the thought behind it is to keep students engaged and working within their chosen industry in Klamath Falls. “They just need to have a willing supervisor and a bunch of computers, and all of a sudden you can have a satellite operation,” Naganathan said. “But, we need to prepare the students to be able to serve them well.” Jeld-Wen link Naganathan has also met with Jeld-Wen CEO and President Mark Beck in Charlotte, N.C., the headquarters for the multi-billion dollar window and door company about the possibility of the company hiring more students. “He liked the fact that we are making a commitment to a more structured program wherein they can count on good talent coming that way,” Naganathan said. Naganathan commented on the sometimes hesitancy of companies to utilize university students in their operations for various reasons. “They think they don’t have the time to manage them,” he said. “We kind of want to get ahead, help the students to be more prepared so they require less management when they go into the workplace. “We have to work with our employer base and then determine what kind of talent they need,” he added. “There is a lot of work to do because there is a lot of potential here. Every university cannot do everything. We need to identify a few things on which we can build our brand. I think that opportunity exists here. “Oregon Tech is known for it’s experiential education. But then I think we need to give it a more distinctive presentation of what is this experiential education.” Three ‘Rs’ filter Naganathan plans to use a philosophy to filter every concept and idea in regards to the university and its programs: Reputation, resource and relevance. “What kind of reputation we want and from whom?” he said. “What kind of resource will it take and what kind of resource will it generate? It is not always dollars and cents. It is goodwill, workforce, community engagement. “Is it relevant to who we are?” he added. “We don’t want to do something because MIT did it 40 years ago. Is it relevant to who we serve? Is it relevant to the community we’re a part of? I think when you ask those questions, you kind of put programs through the filter.” When asked if any programs would be considered for removal or creation under his administration, he responded: “When people get passionate, they say, ‘You know what, we need to create this particular program.’” He likes to see that passion. “We need to look at the passion, as well as the expertise, as well as the economic sustainability of programs,” Naganathan added. “I will ask people to explain it in that context, so we will review what we have, the things we need to walk away from, or the things we need to create.” Distinctive difference Getting the messaging for the university is key for Naganathan as well. “We are really preparing distinctive professionals for practice. Sometimes if you don’t explain it correctly, you could be taken for a vocational school,” Naganathan said. He hopes to support more connections between the university and the surrounding community as a whole by potentially moving some services outside the university to a more centrally located location, “So Oregon Tech is more and more engaged in the community.” Naganathan is also scheduling a “Walk with the President,” an event he started in Toledo, to help further engage students on campus. “It is just an opportunity for students to connect with me and for me to connect with the students,” he said, “so they can share what is important to them.” Visit www.oit.edu/faculty-staff/president to learn more about Naganathan. hdillemuth@heraldandnews.com OIT provost selection expected this week Oregon Tech President Nagi Naganathan announced Tuesday that the university is close to selecting a new provost. A decision on a selection could be made this week, according to Naganathan. The Herald and News will provide an update as information becomes available. Check for updates at www.heraldandnews.com.

Chicago, IL, April 05, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Automate 2017, and Odense, Denmark – Mobile Industrial Robots, (MiR), a next-generation developer and manufacturer of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), is launching its newest robot, the MiR200, at Automate 2017 in Chicago today. The MiR200 is a more powerful mobile robot in almost every aspect than the company’s flagship MiR100, which has already been installed in more than 30 countries by companies such as Airbus, Boeing, Flex, Honeywell, Michelin, Procter & Gamble, Toyota and Walmart. MiR’s industry-leading AMRs are a dramatic improvement over legacy automated guided vehicles (AGVs), which require the expensive and inflexible installation of sensors or magnets into factory floors for guidance. MiR products are designed to give owners the flexibility to easily redeploy the robots to different processes or facility layouts to support changing business needs and agile manufacturing processes. With the launch of the MiR200, customers now have even more choices in how to effectively, quickly and cost-effectively automate their material transportation needs. “Our robots are changing the game for any size business, from small, regional companies to large multinationals,” said MiR CEO Thomas Visti. “With the new interface of the MiR200, it’s even easier for companies to program the robot themselves and adapt its deployment as their business evolves. That’s critical for their competitiveness, and supports extremely fast ROI. The robot typically pays for itself in less than a year, even in very dynamic environments.” MiR200 offers game-changing user interface, performance and ROI The MiR200 updates MiR’s already-intuitive web-based user interface, making programming even easier for users who have no previous experience and allowing for even more optimized implementation. Updates include customizable dashboards, improved mapping, easier creation of robot missions and tasks, multi-level permissions, responsive web design and comprehensive browser support. Integrated help and product documentation provides additional guidance. The powerful MiR200 doubles the payload capacity of the MiR100 to 200kg/440lbs, and offers a MiRHook option for autonomous towing of carts up to 500kg/1102lbs. The robot offers exceptional flexibility for top modules—including racks, shelves, conveyors, lifts or even collaborative robot arms—which can be easily customized and mounted to meet specific application requirements. With its ESD-compliant exterior, the MiR200 is ideal for electronic assembly applications where parts being transported must be protected from electrostatic discharge. MiR robots offer more high-performance sensor technologies than any other mobile robot on the market. Six separate sensor systems feed data to the robot’s real-time navigation and safety algorithms. This enables quick decisions for highly efficient and safe operation of the robot, even in changing situations where people, extension cords, pallets or boxes can create unpredictable obstacles. Full 360-degree scanning allows the robot to safely back up, rather than being limited to forward motion. Additional sensors prevent blindspots by identifying obstacles above the robot, such as a table, and can look ahead and down to identify holes or stairwells, as well as clear obstacles such as glass walls. Visit MiR at Automate 2017, Booth #1468 to see the MiR200 in action, along with the rest of the MiR product line. Additional photos can be downloaded here: http://www.mobile-industrial-robots.com/about-us/marketing Additional information is available here: http://www.mobile-industrial-robots.com/products/mir200 About MiR Mobile Industrial Robots is headquartered in Odense, Denmark where the company was founded in 2013 by experienced professionals from the Danish robotics industry.

It’s also got plans to sell 80 planes to Iran Air. The Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran removed some U.S. economic sanctions in exchange for Iran agreeing to curb its development of nuclear technology. New planes were one of the things Iran most wanted out of that deal. Under the sanctions, its airlines had gone decades without much-needed upgrades. Now, aviation companies stand to make billions outfitting new fleets for Iranian carriers. Click the audio player above to hear the full story.

The Russian, Victor Podobnyy, was one of three men charged in connection with a Cold War-style Russian spy ring. According to the court documents, Podobnyy tried to recruit Page, an energy consultant working in New York at the time, as an intelligence source. Page briefly served as a foreign policy adviser to Trump's campaign, though he split from the campaign before the election and the White House says the president has no relationship with him. The Senate began formal debate on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, hurtling toward a blistering partisan conflict this week over the selection itself, the chamber's future rules and the decaying standards of civility among lawmakers. Democrats have the votes they need to block a procedural vote and compel Trump and Republicans either to withdraw Gorsuch's nomination or to change Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote requirement. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would take a procedural step to end debate, allowing Gorsuch to be confirmed on Friday. The Boeing Co. announced a tentative agreement to sell up to 60 737s to an ­Iranian airline, a transaction valued at $6 billion that appears very likely to test the Trump administration's avowed hostility toward Iran. Boeing said that the agreement, which requires U.S. government approval, would create about 18,000 American jobs. Commercial aircraft sales to Iran are permitted under the nuclear agreement reached in 2015 involving Iran and major global powers, including the U.S. Trump has repeatedly denounced the nuclear agreement, but he also has vowed to protect U.S. industries and workers from foreign competition. Aerospace analysts said that together, Boeing's deal with Iran amounts to a test of the Trump administration's priorities. If Boeing is forbidden to sell the aircraft to Iran, plane makers in other countries might fill the gap.

Kaloyev, who lost his wife and two children in a devastating plane crash in 2002, had served three years in prison for butchering the man he blamed for their deaths. EPA 9 ‘Killing him didn’t make me feel any better’: Vitaly Kaloyev didn’t find comfort in the murder of the man he blamed for his family’s death AP:Associated Press 9 Relatives of the plane crash victims can be seen around the wreckage in rural Germany His wife Svetlana, 10-year-old son Konstantin and four-year-old daughter Diana were on a flight that collided with a freight plane over the skies of Uberlingen, Germany. The collision lead to the deaths of 71  people and most of them were Russian schoolchildren. Kaloyev’s story has been recreated in the upcoming film Aftermath that will star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Kaloyev, deputy minister of construction in North Ossetia-Alania in Russia, was one of the first to arrive in the town and found the lifeless body of his toddler daughter tangled in trees that broke her fall. The distraught family man found his wife’s body in a corn field and Konstantin’s body in the road in front of a bus shelter. Kaloyev, from Vladikavkaz near the border with Chechnya, had just finished a two-year contract to work as a builder and architect on a project in Barcelona.

Kaloyev was waiting for them at Barcelona airport when he heard about the tragedy. An insight into his grief came when he published a eulogy online in tribute to his son. He wrote: “(Konstantin) would have become a good, well-educated person, useful to society, were it not for this tragedy, which I cannot get over. “I have no strength.” Kaloyev stopped working and constantly wore black as he entered a period of profound grief. He turned the family home in the Caucasian town of Vladikavkas into a shrine dedicated to his dead wife and children. Getty Images 9 ‘He could have become a good, well-educated person’: Kaloyev created heartbreaking shrines to each of his lost loved ones Getty Images 9 Kaloyev collected up his children’s belongings and arranged them on their beds as he grieved for his family after the crash Heartbreaking photos showed toys on his children’s beds and a box of his wife’s favourite scents. Two years after the tragedy Kaloyev travelled to Switzerland to confront the man he held responsible for the killing. His target Peter Nielsen, 36, was on duty alone in the Zurich control room on the night of the Überlingen crash. He gave only 44 seconds’ warning to a Bashkirian Airlines aircraft and a DHL freight plane that they were too close. The Russian flight from Moscow to Barcelona was carrying 60 passengers and nine crew. Out of the passengers 45 of them were children on a school trip. The  cargo aircraft was piloted by Paul Philips, from Liverpool in the UK, and was on it’s way from Bergamo, Italy, to Brussels, Belgium. It was carrying Mr Philips and his co-pilot. Getty Images 9 Kaloyev lost his wife in the tragic collision that left 45 schoolchildren dead Nielsen was manning two workstations at for a Swiss airspace control company while a colleague rested next door. He failed to spot the planes were going to smash into each other until they less than 60 seconds apart. Neilsen told the passenger plane crew to descend by a 1,000ft. However a second later the crew changed course because their traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) told them to fly upwards instead. The TCAS on the Boeing cargo plane told its pilot to descend. An investigation found that if both pilots had followed their TCAS instructions the collision would never have happened. However Nielsen repeated his instructions to the Russian plane and the crew ignored the automated warning – causing them to descend into the path of the cargo plane. The planes collided at a near-right angle at 34,890 feet. Getty Images 9 Kaloyev is seen drinking vodka upon his arrival to his hometown of Vladikavkaz after his release from prison Alamy 9 Arnold Schwarzenegger will play a character based on Vitaly Kaloyev in the film Aftermath In the days that followed Nielsen’s failings were made public and he admitted responsibility, saying: “As a father I sense that this loss leaves a gap that will hurt. “On the night of the accident, I was part of a network of people, computers, monitoring and transmission devices and regulations. “All these parts must work together seamlessly and without error, and they must be synchronised. “As an air traffic controller, it is my task and duty to prevent such accidents. “So many children lost their lives and so many hopes for the future were erased.” He was never named in the press but his initials and a photo of his flat appeared in the papers. Nielsen had a nervous break down shortly after the crash and required extensive therapy to help him through his guilt. Getty Images 9 Kaloyev is seen here with his daughter Diana during happier times before the crash At a one-year anniversary memorial event distraught Kaloyev asked the head of Skyguide, which manages airspace in Europe, if he could meet the man who had been responsible for the disaster. He decided to hire a private investigator who managed  to locate Nielsen’s address as being outside Zürich. In 2004 Kayolev arrived in Neilsen’s neighbourhood with a piece of paper with his address on it. He asked a local for directions as she pointed to him the way. Kaloyev then sat down in his garden and waited for the right time to strike. Nielsen spotted the intruder and went outside with his three children to ask him what he wanted. His wife Mette tried to call them back when she heard a “kind of scream”. When she rushed outside she found Nielsen lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood. A 14 inch blade was jutting out his stomach. PA:Press Association 9 Paul Phillips, the British pilot of the DHL Boeing 757, is pictured here with is partner Kayolev went on the run and was stopped at Zurich airport as he tried to leave Switzerland. He later told his trial that he wanted Nielsen to apologise for the mistake that lead to the death of his kids. He told the court he committed the murder after he dropped some pics of his family and it felt like his children had “dropped out of their coffins”. Nielson took roughly two minutes to bleed to death as his child and wife watched on helplessly. During his trial Kaloyev admitted he felt pity for Nielsen’s three children. Kaloyev was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2005 but was released three years later after appealing that his mental health at the time had not been considered. He later told a reporter that: “Killing him didn’t make him feel any better.”       The Sun Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Popular WHAT SHE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE!

SIUE will present the award during the university’s spring commencement to the chief external architect who designed the Edwardsville campus. “As our campus was being formed in the 1960s, Gyo Obata shaped that vision in a unique way,” SIUE Chancellor Randy Pembrook said. “The beauty of the 2,660-acre site demanded something special of the architecture that would occupy the core of our campus, and Mr. Obata delivered in sensational fashion. His designs here underscore a sense of strength and stature befitting a higher education institution. We are forever in his debt. “ In 1955, Obata co-founded Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum, the largest United States-based architecture/engineering firm. The firm's values of sustainability, technical advancement, creativity and practical innovation stand out from other firms. In the early 1960s, Obata was commissioned to design the new SIUE. He conceived the idea of a centralized campus, likened to a small college square, with all facilities located within a circle. He designed each of the buildings to have three stories plus a basement, with flat roofs and maroon brick. “There were some objections, but I really wanted to keep the parking away from the main campus,” Obata said. “You have to park and walk to the campus. In the center of the campus is the library, student center, and the main administration building as a focal point. Out of that core, there would be groups of buildings depending on the different types of buildings as the school’s needs might go on. “The site was so terrific, and the challenge was to try to do something that was not only good at that moment, but also would carry on in the future. You seldom get an opportunity to work on such an incredible site and totally new program. It was a great honor.” His many celebrated designs have local, regional and national prominence. HOK’s architectural designs are fixtures in the St. Louis area: the Planetarium at the St. Louis Science Center, the St. Louis Zoo’s Living World and Children’s Zoo, the St. Louis Abby Church’s Priory Chapel, St. Louis Union Station and the Boeing Leadership Center. Obata’s national projects include: Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, National Air and Space Museum, and the Great American Tower at Queen City Square. “It’s always great when people recognize what you’re trying to do as important,” Obata said. “It’s gratifying to know that people truly appreciate what you’re trying to do.” Numerous honors have celebrated Obata’s career: induction as a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1969, recipient of the American Institute of Architects St. Louis Gold Award Honor in 2002, induction into the St. Louis Walk of Fame in 1992, and recipient of an SIUE Honorary Degree in 1999. The Japanese American National Museum gave its lifetime achievement award to Obata in 2004.
