The Council presented the Excellence Award to PotashCorp, the Innovation Award to The Boeing Company and the Advocate Award to Deputy Police Chief Lou Jogmen of the Park Ridge (Ill.) Police Department. National Safety Council leadership and award sponsors recognized each winner during a ceremony on Thursday at Coronado Island in San Diego. "PotashCorp, The Boeing Company and Deputy Chief Jogmen have helped make our world a safer place to work and live," said Deborah A.P. Hersman, president and CEO of the National Safety Council. "We are proud to honor them and to recognize all the outstanding finalists that share the Council's goal of eliminating preventable deaths and injuries in our lifetime." PotashCorp recognized that tools and procedures designed to reduce injuries as a whole do not always affect serious injury and fatality (SIF) rates. To close the gap, PotashCorp developed a system to empower workers to identify potential SIF exposure before an incident and provides training so employees can identify potential problems in routine activities. The approach includes reviewing everyday tasks for risk, integrating injury prevention into all safety processes and following up on all incidents for SIF potential. The Boeing Company developed a fall protection system – the Piranha Lox True Interlock Harness – that disables a work platform if a worker is not properly hooked into his or her Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Falls account for 10 percent of all occupational deaths each year; in more than 75 percent of those fatalities, PPE is available but either not used or used incorrectly. Deputy Chief Lou Jogmen spearheaded the inaugural Illinois Rail Safety Week in 2014 by gathering more than 300 independent police agencies, county sheriff departments, private firms and state agencies to promote public awareness through education, enforcement and rail safety engineering advances. The model has been expanded to other campaigns in Illinois, including distracted driving awareness, and was used to introduce National Rail Safety Week in 2016, co-sponsored by International Association of Chiefs of Police and Operation Lifesaver. The finalists were selected from over 50 applicants reviewed and evaluated by an external panel. Other finalists included Odebrecht Construction, Chatham County, Ga., Tracey Holmberg of Swedish Medical Center in Denver, Colo., and Trenda McPherson of the Florida Motorcycle Safety Coalition in Tallahassee, Fla.

"We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria, and North Korea to protect American lives," Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee. "I can assure you that's a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president," he said, adding that the Trump administration is convinced that sanctions "really work." Mnuchin did not elaborate on the department's review of the aircraft sale licenses, which were issued by the Treasury last year under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. His statements followed President Donald Trump's call on Iran to stop funding "terrorists and militias" during a trip this week to the Middle East. The Boeing aircraft sale was the biggest deal for a U.S. business contemplated in the landmark nuclear accord, while the Airbus sales were also among the largest business deals to come out of the agreement. IranAir has agreed to buy 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing and 100 from Airbus. All the aircraft need U.S. licenses because of their reliance on U.S. parts. Most of Iran's aging fleet of 250 commercial planes were purchased before 1979, and only 162 were operational last year, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Iran has said that halting the aircraft sales would breach the nuclear agreement, though some legal experts say the Treasury has the authority to withdraw the licenses. For Boeing, losing the IranAir deal could force it to cut back production of its 777 passenger jetliners. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran's airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval," a spokeswoman told Reuters by e-mail.

The company said Wednesday that it still plans to deliver the first Boeing 737 Max later this month, and production will continue. A Boeing 737 MAX 9 under construction at the company's production facility in Renton, Washington, on Feb. 13. Jason Redmond / Reuters file The news sent Boeing Co. shares down nearly 4 percent, although they recovered partly to close at $183.18, down $2.31, or 1.3 percent. Chicago-based Boeing was notified last week of a potential issue involving turbine engine discs produced by a supplier to engine maker CFM International. Boeing said it has not experienced any problems with the discs during more than 2,000 hours of testing. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 Max but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. The Max is designed to be a more fuel-efficient version of the workhorse 737, Boeing's most popular commercial plane. Malaysia's Malindo Air plans to take delivery of the first Max in a few days and begin using it for passenger flights before July. Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. expects to begin using the plane this fall. It said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Related: China's 'Homegrown' Competitor to 737 Takes to the Skies American Airlines Group Inc., which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The discs in question are made by a supplier to CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran. GE spokeswoman Jamie Jewell declined to identify the supplier. She said GE and Safran will work with the supplier to find and correct any shortcomings in the manufacturing process while also turning to a backup supplier to keep production of engines on schedule. A Boeing logo on one of the firm's 737 Max 9 jets. Jason Redmond / AFP - Getty Images file In a written statement, Boeing said it will work with CFM "to understand the precise scope and root cause of the quality issue." New planes and parts go through extensive testing to turn up problems before passengers go on board. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., said "this doesn't look like a serious concern" because Boeing still expects to deliver the first plane this month and it appears to be a fixable manufacturing problem rather than a design flaw. Boeing has built about 9,500 single-aisle 737s since the late 1960s. The company said it has taken more than 3,700 orders for the Max, which carries a list price of $112.4 million to $119.2 million, although airlines routinely get big discounts.

Despite not reaching orbit, the company announced it successfully made it to space, marking the first orbital-class rocket launched from a private launch site. The SMC gathered expert reaction about the launch. Feel free to use these comments in your reporting. Kris Walsh, Former project manager at United Launch Alliance and former director of all NASA launch programmes for Boeing, comments: “Congratulations, Rocket Lab. From the data that they are sharing, they made it to space and have the data to assess all aspects of the flight. “Although it is disappointing that the launch didn’t achieve orbit, the next actions of Rocket Lab are very important to watch, especially for Rocket Lab’s current and future customers. “Although Rocket Lab’s control of data is frustrating to the news media, to me it demonstrates that there is a process in place to assess the data carefully before jumping to conclusions internally and in communication outside of the company. “Rocket Lab must evaluate all anomalies in the 25,000 channels of data, develop a plan to the next launch, then execute that plan. Communication should be a part of that plan. “Lastly, I commend Peter Beck for his tweet of confidence in his team on a day that must have been disappointing both to them and him.” Dr George Sowers, Independent consultant, former Chief Scientist and Vice-President of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, comments: “My hearty congratulations to the team. I know first hand how incredibly hard it is to get something to space. A million things have to go right. “As a matter of statistics, the general record of the launch industry for first flights of a new rocket is around 50%. Success was certainly not guaranteed. “There are three sorts of challenges or risks in the space business. 1. Technology risk. Rocket Lab seems well on their way to getting this under control. 2. Performance risk. Can they manufacture and launch repeatedly and reliability, on schedule? This challenge is still in front of them. 3. Market risk. Are there enough customers willing to pay Rocket Lab’s prices for them to achieve business success? This is the toughest part and involves factors out of their control. But I wish them the best.” Contact: gfsowers@comcast.net, +1 303 916 4793, Professor Richard Easther, Professor of Physics (and Head of Department) at the University of Auckland, comments: “Yesterday’s launch was a remarkable milestone for Rocket Lab. Achieving orbit on the first try would be a fairytale result with any completely new launch vehicle and Rocket Lab came tantalizingly close to pulling this off. This will stand as a major accomplishment. “For my part, I am truly excited about the impact of this on our wider STEM community. “Space” has an almost unique ability to inspire interest in science and if Rocket Lab develops a viable launch industry in New Zealand its impact will be extend far beyond the purely commercial benefits.” Professor Martin Barstow, University of Leicester, Director of the Leicester Institute of Space & Earth Observation, comments: “Despite not achieving full success, it is clear that this launch was a major step forward for Rocket Lab. For the launch to have gone as well as it did is a major achievement and it’s a pity that they didn’t make orbit. “However, it seems there were no catastrophic failures and I suspect it was a performance issue with the second stage. I am sure that is something they will fix after doing some further analysis.” ________________________________________ Earlier in the week, the SMC put together this expert Q&A with international experts. Professor Martin Barstow, University of Leicester, Director of the Leicester Institute of Space & Earth Observation, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? “I see this as part of the new spirit of commercial enterprise developing around low cost access to space, of which Space-X is a prime example. In the current context Rocket Lab are not so well advanced, as they have yet to carry out their first launch. Also, their 225kg payload mass is rather smaller than other capabilities. However, I think there will be a growing need for launch capability for lower mass satellites like this to build satellite constellations. So, if successful, they will be well-placed to support and exploit that market.” What is Rocket Lab’s competitive edge and is their business model viable? “It’s not clear to me how their business model functions (since I can’t find their pricing structure), but as mentioned above, they will be hitting an emerging market.” What is new or different about the Electron rocket technology they have developed? “I think the use of 3-D printing techniques to produce key components is very novel and likely to lower production costs, giving them a pricing edge. It could also help with reliability.” Are there any advantages for launching from New Zealand? “There are no particular advantages in launching from NZ, compared to existing sites. In fact the best launch sites are closer to the equator to get the maximum advantage from the Earth’s rotation. “So, this is more about developing independent capability, so that the country does not have to rely on launch services from elsewhere. There is a similar issue in the UK where our government is keen to develop launch site opportunities. It’s actually more difficult here due to the proximity of Europe. From New Zealand, you can launch safely over the Pacific.” How are private ventures like Rocket Lab and SpaceX etc changing access to space? “This is really about lower costs and creating true commercial (and profitable) markets for space services to drive future space activities.” Is only launching small payloads viable? “No, but the current rocket is only capable of launching small/medium payloads at the moment. However, once a successful track record is developed, it is possible to scale-up the systems, as Space-X did.” Other comments: “I wish them luck! It’s a very exciting project, but getting into space is hard and success is not guaranteed.” ________________________________________ Dr George Sowers, Independent consultant, former Chief Scientist and Vice-President of United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? “The Rocket Lab launch is another indication of the vibrancy of the commercial space sector at the present time. It is another entrant into the small payload launch market which has been tough for commercial companies to succeed in. It certainly represents a first for New Zealand.” What is Rocket Lab’s competitive edge and is their business model viable? “Rocket Lab has some interesting technology such as the electric pump driven engine. And they have embraced the state of the art manufacturing technologies. However the small payload launch market is extremely difficult for commercial companies to make a profit. “There are several reasons for this. First, the small payload market is not robust. There are many potential customers, but few are able to afford the price of a dedicated launch. On the bright side, there is some indication that the market might be picking up, for example with companies like Planet. “Second there is fierce competition from nations (India, China, Russia, etc) and larger launchers offering small payload launches as rideshare. Plus, there are a number of other companies vying for the same market. If Rocket Lab succeeds, they will be the first commercial company to do so in the small market. Many have failed, including SpaceX, who discontinued the Falcon 1 small launcher after only a handful of launches.” What is new or different about the Electron rocket technology they have developed? “The electric pump power engine is unique. However, it is not clear it has advantages over traditional turbo-pump designs in terms of either cost, reliability or performance.” Are there any advantages for launching from New Zealand? “Range availability might be an advantage (less congestion). However, the southern latitude limits customers to high inclination orbits, precluding a portion of the market. It is also a long journey for American or European customers, representing most of the market.” How are private ventures like Rocket Lab and SpaceX etc changing the access to space? “Still to be determined for Rocket Labs. SpaceX has disrupted the traditional launch markets, forcing other competitors to transform their business models, at least for the short term. SpaceX has had a number of technological successes, but it remains to be seen if their business model will succeed in the long term.” Is only launching small payloads viable? “If the market improves, perhaps. I believe it unlikely due to factors explained above.” Other comments: I wish them luck. ________________________________________ Kris Walsh, Former project manager at United Launch Alliance and former director of all NASA launch programmes for Boeing, comments: Where does this launch sit in the scheme of what else is currently happening in the industry? “I was the Program Manager of the launch that had the first successful CubeSat launches, and Delta and Atlas continue to launch CubeSats for NASA successfully. The biggest frustration for these small satellites is access to space — they have to wait until the primary payload launches – and delays are common for the larger satellites.” What is Rocket Lab’s competitive edge and is their business model viable? “What Rocket Lab offers is access to space for the smaller payloads. So, if Rocket Lab can quickly get reliable, on time launches, they can capture a market ignored by the current industry. “It will have to also shift customers expectations — payload processing should be mostly complete before the satellites arrive, reducing or eliminating the need for customer access to the launch site, customer viewing would be virtual, etc. “I also think the $7M price tag for 3 CubeSats is a higher price than many of the scientific payloads of this size can support. So, it would be commercial ventures. “Any comparison to SpaceX is not realistic. SpaceX’s long term plan was to continue to increase the size of their rockets, and to capture the larger US government payloads. SpaceX did not significantly change access to space for commercial ventures.” Is only launching small payloads viable? “Rocket Lab could if 1) they stick to their business model and target small (nano) payloads, especially constellations, 2) they are technically successful both in launch reliability and on-time launches, and 3) they focus on a ship and shoot launch process, minimizing Rocket Lab’s expenses as well as its customers.” ends Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

GILLIAN RICH 5/25/2017 Reprints The Pentagon said Thursday it has been in touch with producers of a "Top Gun" sequel, which could be a public relations bonanza for Boeing (BA) or Lockheed Martin (LMT) as one of their jets could be the real star in the follow-up to the 1986 blockbuster movie. "We've been contacted, but the picture is in the early stages of preproduction. We've not even received a script," Philip Strub, director of entertainment media at the Pentagon, wrote in an email to IBD. Tom Cruise, who played Maverick in the first movie, told the Australian morning show "Sunrise" earlier this week that a sequel is "definitely happening." Val Kilmer, who played Iceman in the original, has said in an Instagram post he's excited about the sequel. A generation ago, "Top Gun" wowed audiences as Navy F-14 Tomcats turned and burned, making inverted dives and other acrobatic maneuvers. But those jets are no longer in service. Today, the Navy flies Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, while the service's variant of Lockheed's F-35 is slated to be combat ready sometime between 2018 and 2019. Cruise said filming for the new "Top Gun" movie is scheduled to start early next year. The timing could be tricky for producers of the sequel. The Super Hornet is in the fleet now but isn't the latest-generation fighter jet. The F-35 is a cutting-edge fighter with stealth technology but may not be combat ready in the Navy when filming starts. Other versions of the F-35 are available, however. The Marines' F-35B reached initial operational capability in July 2015, and the Air Force's F-35A was declared combat ready in August 2016. But neither is designed to take off and land from aircraft carriers, which appeared in the original "Top Gun." Meanwhile, the movie could deliver a priceless public-relations boon to Boeing or Lockheed at a critical time for each company. Boeing is trying to sell more Super Hornets to U.S. allies, and President Trump has suggested a "big order" for the fighter could be on the way. Without new Super Hornet or F-15 Eagle orders, the aerospace giant faces the possibility of no longer making combat aircraft after it was shut out of the F-35 contract and lost the B-21 bomber bid to Northrop Grumman (NOC). Lockheed's $400 billion F-35 program has been blasted for being over budget and behind schedule. But as the backbone of America's future fighter fleet, the Pentagon must start asking Congress for more and more procurement money as production ramps up, even as Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill have piled on criticism. Boeing shares closed up 1% to 187.07 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares ended the day up 0.7% to 282.06. Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, jumped 1.2%.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks to Buy With Dividends Yielding More Than 3% Dividend growth and solid yields can help income investors immensely. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) May 25, 2017 at 4:56PM Stocks that pay dividends help investors in two ways: They offer current income, and they give shareholders the prospect for long-term growth. You have to be careful in considering higher-yielding dividend stocks, but below, you'll see why Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), British American Tobacco (NYSEMKT:BTI), and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are worth a closer look, with their 3%-plus dividend yields and potential for gains in the future. Cisco connects with dividend investors Tech stocks aren't generally known for their dividends, but Cisco Systems has committed itself in recent years to making healthy dividend payouts. After initiating a dividend just six years ago, the networking giant has made seven increases to its quarterly payout, and it has boosted what shareholders receive to nearly five times what its initial dividend payment was. The current dividend of $0.29 per share each quarter works out to a yield of 3.7%. Image source: Cisco Systems. Cisco's recent results have raised some concerns about its ability to sustain its long-term growth trajectory, with an outlook for an actual 4% to 6% revenue decline in the coming quarter raising alarm bells. However, like many tech companies, Cisco has been transitioning away from product sales and toward a subscription-based model, and that has temporarily knocked the company's top line for a loop. Questions about the future of Cisco's business in selling to the federal government have also raised uncertainty. However, in the long run, Cisco maintains its leadership position in the connectivity space, and improving conditions in some of its key markets should help the company's long-term prospects looking ahead. British American gears up for global dominance British American Tobacco is a giant in the global tobacco industry, and it's looking to get even bigger. The company said last year that it would acquire the remainder of Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) that it didn't already own, and going forward, BAT sees the prospects for the combined company looking brighter than ever. By uniting worldwide distribution on key brands like Newport and combining forces on reduced-risk products and other innovations, BAT thinks it can stand up to its rivals and come out ahead. BAT follows the European dividend model of two unequal semi-annual distributions, and the dollar amount of its dividends has fallen over the past 12 months because of the weakness of the British pound. Yet even with the decline, BAT's current yield of just under 4% is attractive, and steady growth over the years when you measure payouts in local-currency terms demonstrates the tobacco giant's commitment to dividend investors going forward. Boeing flies high Finally, Boeing has captured a huge portion of the upsurge in demand for commercial aircraft in recent years. The rebound in the airline industry has driven customers to order new, more efficient planes, and Boeing has helped lead the industry forward with new models designed to bolster carrying capacity while being conscious of fuel consumption. The surge in interest has led Boeing to make dramatic increases to its dividend in recent years. Since late 2011, Boeing has made six dividend boosts, and the most recent 30% hike pushed its quarterly payment to $1.42 per share, more than triple what the aircraft manufacturer paid just five years ago. The stock has also performed well, so even those big gains were only enough to send Boeing's dividend yield to 3.1%. Yet shareholders aren't complaining about impressive total return figures, and the aerospace and defense industry giant is taking full advantage of promising trends across its entire market to cash in on favorable conditions as long as they last. Just because a stock has a yield of 3% or more doesn't mean it's a smart investment. In order to know whether a dividend stock really belongs in your portfolio, you have to take a close look and make sure it's consistent with your investing philosophy. For many dividend investors, Boeing, British American Tobacco, and Cisco Systems will be useful parts of a dividend stock portfolio that will produce much-needed income in the months and years to come.

The annual payment was made to the U.S. military at the end of April, the Department of National Defence says, and will keep Canada at the table as one of nine partners in the fighter jet project for the next year. Canada has paid US$373 million into the program since 1997, National Defence spokeswoman Jessica Lamirande said in an email. Staying in the program has advantages, as partners can compete for billions of dollars worth of contracts associated with the building and maintaining F-35. They also get a discount when purchasing the plane. That latter point wasn't considered much of a benefit when Canada paid its annual instalment last year, as the Liberals had promised during the 2015 election not to buy the stealth fighter. The government instead went out of its way last July to highlight the potential benefits to Canada's aerospace industry when explaining why it had decided to stick with the program. Those industrial benefits continue to accrue, Lamirande said, with Canadian companies having secured US$926 million in F-35-related contracts over the last 20 years — including US$114 million in the last year alone. But the trade dispute between Boeing, which builds Super Hornet fighter jets, the F-35's main competitor, and Montreal-based Bombardier casts the decision to stick with the stealth-fighter program in a new light. Citing an urgent need for more fighter jets, the Liberal government announced last November plans to buy 18 "interim" Super Hornets until a competition could be held to replace Canada's entire CF-18 fleet. But then last week, the government threatened to scrap the Super Hornet purchase after Boeing persuaded the U.S. Department of Commerce to launch an investigation against Bombardier. Boeing alleges Bombardier sold its CSeries jets in the U.S. at an unfair discount thanks to subsidies from the Canadian government, while Bombardier says its planes never competed with Boeing. Many defence analysts and former air force officers have questioned whether "interim" fighter jets are needed and instead want an immediate competition to replace all of the CF-18s. But if more jets are truly needed on a short-term basis, the decision to stay at the F-35 table could be used to get a better deal on interim stealth fighters — or even as a bargaining chip against Boeing. "If the government is in fact serious about re-evaluating its dealings with Boeing, then this could be part of showing that," said defence analyst David Perry of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. "Because the F-35, at least in my mind, would be a possible alternative if the government remains committed to buying separate interim aircraft." Three other alternatives exist — the Saab Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale — but all are made by European companies and the government has emphasized the need for a U.S. design. Lockheed Martin, the company behind the F-35, has remained relatively quiet about the government's plan to buy interim Super Hornets, but is now chomping at the bit for a chance to fill any potential gap. The U.S. company "would openly welcome discussions about interim fighter solutions," spokeswoman Cindy Tessier said, adding that Lockheed has partnered with Bombardier on another military project. The government is providing little information as to what next steps it might take as the dispute between Boeing and Bombardier continues to play out. Boeing, for its part, has emphasized its longstanding relationship with Canada, even as representatives from its defence division have scrambled to meet and smooth the edges with Canadian officials. The U.S. International Trade Commission, which heard arguments from both aerospace companies in a hearing last week, isn't expected to issue a ruling until June 12. The U.S. Department of Commerce would then decide whether to penalize Bombardier.

The agency announced Thursday that seven airlines have been added. The newly eligible carriers – a mix of big and small, foreign and domestic – are Copa Airlines, Dominican Wings, InterCaribbean Airways, Silver Airways, Singapore Airlines, Swift Air and Turkish Airlines. The additions grow the total number of carriers eligible for PreCheck to 37. PreCheck, which costs $85 for a five-year membership, gives approved passengers access to expedited security lanes at more than 180 U.S. airports. Travelers using those lanes can keep their shoes and light jackets on at airport checkpoints. Laptops and liquids (provided they meet TSA guidelines) can remain in carry-on bags. Travelers can join the program by providing background information and fingerprints for background check. The goal of the program for TSA and airlines is to get travelers who are better known through checkpoints faster so that security can focus on people who are considered to be bigger risks. “Expanding TSA PreCheck allows us to increase overall security effectiveness and make the screening process more efficient,” Huban Gowadia, TSA’s acting administrator, says in a statement. “We are committed to the expansion of TSA PreCheck to strengthen aviation security and improve the passenger experience.” IN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn February's #avgeek photo gallery (2017)  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Photo credit: Christina Butcher Write to Editor Leave A Comment Read Comments Tweet Most people can remember a time in their life when the sound of an airplane whooshing across the sky would make them lift their face and search for the plane. We may have been young when we first looked upward, but every Memorial Day the gesture returns as air shows honoring our military servicemembers blaze through the sky. This Memorial Day will be no different as The Museum of Flight holds its annual Memorial Day Program Monday, May 29.  "We look forward to working with the local community and recognizing people in the community for their military service," said Cale Wilcox, the public programs coordinator at The Museum of Flight. "We have fun putting this together and we're excited about our lineup this year." This year's Memorial Day Program will include a keynote address by McChord's Col. Leonard J. Kosinski, a ceremony commemorating fallen U.S. servicemembers and musical performances by the Boeing Employees' Concert Band. "The Memorial Day concert is one of my favorite concerts of the year," said Olivia Bloomquist, the treasurer of the Boeing Employees' Concert Band. "It gives me a chance as a veteran to remember and honor, in a real and very personal way, the people who choose to serve our great country." The Boeing Employees' Concert Band, which has been performing since 1979, is conducted by Alexei Girsh and has played at the Key Arena in Seattle, Point Defiance Park in Tacoma, and the Historic Flight Foundation in Mukiteo. "We've supported Memorial Day concerts and Veterans Day concerts for as long as I can remember," Bloomquist shared. "One of the great things we do is to play a piece that has all of the military branch songs in it. When each song is started, veterans of the service branch are asked to stand, including members of the band ... veteran audience members and veteran band members spontaneously salute each other when their particular service song is played." The event's keynote speaker, Col. Kosinski, is the commander of the 62nd Airlift Wing out of Joint Base Lewis-McChord. In addition to its primary combat and humanitarian operations, the 62nd AW is the only Department of Defense wing tasked to fly nuclear and nuclear-related cargo. It's also the only active-duty wing to provide airlift support for Operation Deep Freeze, the National Science Foundation's U.S Antarctic Program. Part of The Museum of Flight's mission is to highlight individuals and organizations like the 62nd AW that have historical significance. The museum works to preserve aircraft and air and space artifacts while fostering educational programs in science, technology and humanities. "A pretty sizeable portion of our volunteer corps is made up of servicemembers," added Wilcox. Established in 1965 by the Pacific Northwest Aviation Historical Foundation in Seattle, the museum is the largest nonprofit air and space museum in the world. It houses over 175 aircraft and spacecraft and tens of thousands of artifacts. It also has a research center, flight simulator, flight library, and an extensive archive collection. "We have a great venue for this memorial," said Wilcox. The museum provides annual Pathfinder Awards to Aerospace industry experts and innovators, as well. This Memorial Day, The Museum of Flight will honor servicemembers and the sacrifices they've made to our country by offering free admission to the Memorial Day Program for veteran and active-duty servicemembers. "We hope to bring the community together in a great space to remember those who died while serving in the military, both for our country and for our community," Wilcox stressed.

By Charlie Osborne for Between the Lines | May 25, 2017 -- 13:10 GMT (06:10 PDT) | Topic: Innovation The United States Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has chosen Boeing to build a spaceplane able to launch 10 payloads in 10 days to fight the prospect of destroyed satellites causing chaos in the future. According to the agency, the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program aims to bring to life a fleet of hypersonic aircraft that can "revolutionize the Nation's ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent." Boeing was awarded the contract to create a craft which will provide short-notice, low-cost access to space, but the project is a serious challenge. As DARPA notes, we don't have the capability to launch substantial payloads to low Earth orbit in days at the moment. Instead, it takes months or years of preparation to launch a satellite or two -- but if in the future there is an incident in which we lose critical satellites en masse, we need to have a backup plan. In order to achieve this goal, Boeing will need to make serious strides in both technology and ground operations. The XS-1, "roughly the size of a business jet," will take off vertically to reach hypersonic speeds. DARPA hopes that the spaceplane will launch with no external boosters -- cutting the expense of the vehicle -- and will be powered only by cryogenic technology. Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity A spotter's guide to the groups that are out to get you Ransomware attack: How a nuisance became a global threat Devastating attacks to public infrastructure 'a matter of when' in the US The Internet of Insecure Things, and why we're still in denial Once the plane reaches orbit, the XS-1 would deploy a 3,000-pound satellite. As the vehicle would be able to use the same launching stage repeatedly, it is hoped that after landing and being prepared for the next flight, the XS-1 will be able to deploy ten satellites in as many days, with a turnaround "potentially within hours." DARPA and Boeing envision the XS-1 utilizing lightweight composite cryogenic propellant tanks able to hold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, as well as hybrid composite-metallic wings for flight which are able to withstand suborbital hypersonic flight and temperatures of over 2,000 Fahrenheit. In addition, the craft will use a range of flight-cancelling and autonomous flight technologies, including some already used by DARPA's Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program.

"The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 -- fabrication and flight." Boeing is in the XS-1 concept first stage, and as designs and technologies sourced from DARPA, NASA, and the US Air Force are integrated and refined, it is hoped that the spaceplane will be ready by 2019, with up to 15 test flights scheduled for 2020.

During a conversation with ATW and Aviation Week editors, Cromer defended the CSeries program’s most significant order, which has come under attack by both Boeing and Embraer. Boeing has formally asked the US government to protest Canadian government assistance to the CSeries program, and in particular alleges that Bombardier offered the CSeries to Atlanta-based Delta at an “absurdly low” $19.6 million per aircraft, well below what Boeing described as the aircraft’s production cost of $33.2 million. Delta placed a firm order for 75 CS100 aircraft, plus 50 options, in April 2016. “The Boeing numbers are not accurate, whether we’re talking about the sales price or the production cost,” Cromer said. He did note that “early airplanes are expensive [to produce] and every manufacturer looks at the entire program” when pricing aircraft. While Bombardier started marketing the CSeries as early as 2005, and originally intended for the aircraft to enter service in 2013, the program had endured a raft of delays and missteps when Cromer came on board in 2015 as part of a new Bombardier management team led by president and CEO Alain Bellemare. Cromer said the CSeries program was effectively “reintroduced and relaunched” at the 2015 Paris Air Show and pricing on 2016 orders, including to Air Canada and Delta, should be viewed in that context. “We were absolutely reintroducing this aircraft,” Cromer said. “We even used the words, ‘We’re relaunching the program’ … The pricing of any aircraft at any given time in a program can be volatile.” He said Bombardier had to account for the “perceived risk” Air Canada and Delta were taking by ordering a new aircraft. Boeing and Embraer, which pushed the Brazilian government to go to the World Trade Organization over the CSeries, allege Bombardier is improperly able to sell the aircraft at market distorting prices because of the Quebec provincial government’s $1 billion investment in the CSeries program and $372.5 million ($276 million) in repayable support from the Canadian federal government over four years for the CSeries and Global 7000 aircraft programs. That assistance violates trade rules, Boeing and Embraer claim. “We were very careful to make sure the investments were done in a way that was fully compliant with trade regulations,” Cromer said, adding that the arrangements with Quebec and the Canadian federal government were “carefully designed to be compliant. We’ve got all the confidence in the world that this is not going to be an issue.” Aaron Karp aaron.karp@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

News NASA, Space and Science NASA's delay of megarocket launch puts competition in spotlight SpaceX launched its Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center on Monday, May 15, 2017, carrying a 13,400-pound satellite into space for London-based Inmarsat. Marco SantanaContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy NASA’s delay in ferrying astronauts to the moon comes as competition has heated up, with SpaceX and Boeing aiming to build passenger capsules and heavy-lift craft — and launch them from Florida — by the end of next year. “You can make a strong argument that NASA is in a space race with SpaceX right now,” said Ray Lugo, director of the University of Central Florida’s Space Institute. “The commercial guys have a much more streamlined process.” NASA recently announced that a maiden voyage of its behemoth Space Launch System would be pushed back from November 2018 into at least 2019, with human flight on SLS waiting until a second mission aimed at 2021. The delay followed a report from the Government Accountability Office that called the optimistic timeline “likely unachievable.” Facing stiff competition from companies like SpaceX and Boing, NASA has delayed the debut of its massive launch system into 2019. Facing stiff competition from companies like SpaceX and Boing, NASA has delayed the debut of its massive launch system into 2019. See more videos Trying to launch next year “is not in the best interest of the program, and we are in the process of establishing a new target in 2019,” NASA Associate Administrator for Human Exploration and Operations William Gerstenmaier agreed in an April 12 response. The delay “is unfortunate, but not surprising,” said Phil Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado who previously worked with SpaceX and who was former space policy adviser to President Barack Obama. “If you talk to folks in the agency, they all knew this was coming.” NASA relies heavily on a federal budget that fluctuates from year to year. The testing phase for its vehicles can take more time while dealing with layers of governmental approval. “People expect them to get it right every time because they have to explain when they don’t to 300 million Americans,” Lugo said. “So it’s hard to compare the two.” Private companies, like early-stage startup firms, can work directly with private financial backers or billionaire CEOs when making adjustments. That can include NASA as a client. Boeing and SpaceX have signed NASA contracts for the use of their crew capsules to send astronauts to the International Space Station. SpaceX’s Dragon 2 capsule is planned to run a test flight later this year and a crewed flight in May 2018. The company is preparing to send two private citizens around the moon next year, as well. SpaceX said last week that the mission remains on track — but Musk said at a news conference in February that they would prioritize the launch of astronauts for NASA if conflicts arose. Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner capsule has three major milestones scheduled for 2018: a test flight in June, a human test flight in August and a trip to the International Space Station in December. In April, the Denver Post reported that United Launch Alliance President and CEO Tory Bruno announced at a space symposium that the company wants to “develop a fleet of ‘space trucks’ to ferry people between Earth and moon.” The timing of that effort is unclear. A ULA spokeswoman declined comment. The term “space race” might be too strong, said Mary Lynne Ditmar, executive director of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration. The nonprofit advocates for deep-space exploration. “The objectives of these players are really different,” Ditmar said. While NASA hopes to build infrastructure in space that will support deep-space exploration, she says, “SpaceX and ULA are both in the business of making money and bringing value to their investors and shareholders.” The SLS delays likely come from NASA’s tendency to play it safe, Space Florida President and CEO Frank Dibello said. “What you are hearing is NASA’s conservative risk-management approach,” Dibello said. “They want to make sure they are comfortable with the vehicle and make it safe for when they put humans in it. It’s a perfectly reasonable decision.” “Schedules rarely slip to the left. They almost always slip to the right.” President Donald Trump had asked NASA to consider sending an astronaut on the November 2018 test flight, known as Exploration Mission 1. Lugo trusts that NASA officials believe their new 2019 timeline for Exploration Mission 1 but would likely not be too hesitant to push that back if needed. “They try not to be too schedule-driven,” he said. “But they are also not ignorant of the fact that people expect them to hold a schedule. When you look at the pace SpaceX has been on, though, the people at NASA have to say that they look to be on schedule.” Got a news tip? msantana@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5256; Twitter, @marcosantana Caption The Chandra X-ray Observatory has looked at the Crab Nebula many times since the telescope was launched in 1999.

But he also danced around whether the Liberal government has another option if it follows through on its not-so-subtle threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing. The Liberals appeared to link the trade dispute and fighter-jet purchase on Thursday, after the U.S. officials launched an investigation into dumping allegations that Boeing has brought against Bombardier. Boeing officials alleged in a special hearing that Bombardier sold its CSeries jets to Delta Air Lines at an unfair discount thanks to subsidies from the Canadian government. Bombardier representatives countered that their planes never competed with Boeing in a sale to Delta and that the U.S. company is a global powerhouse that hasn’t lost any sales to the Canadian firm. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland released a statement after the hearing blasting the investigation, adding the Liberals were “reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing.” Government officials and industry representatives said the planned Super Hornet purchase was the only ongoing military procurement project with Boeing. Trudeau didn’t mention Boeing or the Super Hornets by name while responding to reporters’ questions at an event in Surrey, B.C., on Friday, but he did have some tough words for the U.S. government. “We strongly disagree with the actions taken by the U.S. Department of Commerce and we are making that very clearly known,” he said. “We will be respectful and work constructively with the United States, but we will always be resolute and firm in how we stand up for Canadian interests.” Yet the threat also cast a fresh light on the government’s plan, announced last November, to sole-source the Super Hornets as a stopgap to supplement Canada’s aging fleet of CF-18s. The government has said more fighter jets are urgently needed to defend North America and meet Canada’s obligation to NORAD until a competition to replace all of the CF-18s can be held in five years. And it says the Super Hornet is the only plane that can fill that “capability gap,” as its three European competitors aren’t easily compatible with U.S. warplanes, while the F-35 is still in development. That raises a key question: If not the Super Hornet, then what? Trudeau sidestepped the issue when asked what other avenues the government has available if it decides to cancel the Super Hornet purchase in retaliation for Boeing’s case against Bombardier. “We know that we have a responsibility to the men and women of the Canadian Forces (and) to our allies,” the prime minister said. “But we’re always going to be very thoughtful about standing up for Canadian rights and what is right at the same time.” Defence experts and industry representatives say based on the government’s past statements, it would appear the Super Hornet is the only option for addressing Canada’s fighter-jet shortage. But many have questioned whether the Liberals simply invented the “capability gap” to purchase Super Hornets without a competition and keep their election promise not to buy the F-35 stealth fighter. As a result, there were fresh calls from all sides Friday for an immediate competition to replace the CF-18 fighter fleet, which some have said could be finished in about 12 months. “There is no capability gap,” said Conservative defence critic James Bezan. “They should immediately launch an open and fair competition to replace the entire fleet and not take half measures and half steps that will ultimately cost our taxpayers more and put our troops at risk.” Former chief of defence staff Paul Manson, who previously worked for F-35 maker Lockheed Martin, said the Liberals could address any urgent needs with used variants of the CF-18 from Australia or the U.S. “But my personal belief is they should swallow their pride and immediately start a competition,” he said. “And then we can get into this next generation of fighters for the Canadian Air Force.” Carleton University political scientist Stephen Saideman also called for a competition, saying that few in Ottawa believe the military is facing a true shortage of jet fighters. But he also said, based on the amount of money Boeing stands to lose from the Super Hornet purchase, the U.S. company would back down. Boeing can expect to make at least $2 billion from the 18 Super Hornets, based on rough estimates, plus whatever else it receives in future sales of fighter jets and other aircraft.

Corporate News Money & Markets Economy & Politics Opinion & Analysis Life & Style Magazines Menu advertisement By MUGAMBI MUTEGI More by this Author Summary Kenya Airways has reported a 60.9 per cent drop in its net loss for the 12 months ended March from last year’s Sh26.2 billion. The apparent upturn was, however, dampened by a Sh10 billion shrinkage in its turnover to Sh106 billion. The airline’s book value sank Sh9.2 billion more into the negative to Sh44.9 billion, reflecting erosion by years of losses and negative fluctuations on the carrier’s foreign currency-denominated loans. advertisement advertisement Economy & Politics KQ’s Sh10bn loss deepens shareholders capital erosion Thursday, May 25, 2017 20:57 By MUGAMBI MUTEGI KQ’s outgoing chief executive, Mbuvi Ngunze (left) with chairman Michael Joseph at Crowne Plaza, Nairobi on May 25, 2017. PHOTO | SALATON NJAU | NMG  Deep cost-cutting helped Kenya Airways #ticker:KQ reduce its full-year net loss by more than half to Sh10.2 billion, showing some green shoots for the national carrier that is, however, beset by a flagging topline and wider erosion of shareholders’ capital. KQ, as the carrier is known by its international code, Thursday reported a 60.9 per cent drop in its net loss for the 12 months ended March from last year’s Sh26.2 billion. The apparent upturn was, however, dampened by a Sh10 billion shrinkage in its turnover to Sh106 billion, while the airline’s book value sank Sh9.2 billion more into the negative to Sh44.9 billion, reflecting erosion by years of losses and negative fluctuations on the carrier’s mountain of foreign currency-denominated loans. “Our operating costs reduced significantly due to the turnaround efforts. We posted an operating profit of nearly Sh900 million compared to a Sh4.1 billion loss last year,” KQ’s outgoing chief executive, Mbuvi Ngunze, said when releasing the results. Operating costs dropped by Sh14.9 billion to Sh105.4 billion, with the biggest savings coming from lower fleet ownership costs following the offloading of several aircraft in the year. KQ subleased three Boeing 777s and two Boeing 787s and sold two Boeing 777s, bringing fleet costs down by Sh14 billion to Sh15.5 billion. The offloading was part of Operation Pride, the turnaround strategy for the loss-making airline, which includes interventions like balance sheet restructuring, disposal of aircraft and land and laying off of over 100 staff.

We are seeing the first results of our investment in the turnaround,” Mr Ngunze said. READ: Kenya Airways improves performance to post Sh10bn net loss KQ’s bottom line benefited positively from a favourable exchange rate and hedging environment which, despite financing costs remaining high, helped the airline lower its “other costs” 49.6 per cent to Sh11.1 billion. The national airline, which is 29.8 per cent owned by the Treasury and 26.7 per cent by Air France-KLM, also booked Sh1.6 billion from the sale of land and aircraft parts such as spare engines. The carrier closed the period with lower staff expenses as 288 workers exited the company — through retrenchment and natural attrition — leaving the employee count at 3,582. Operation Pride, which is being implemented with the help of US consultancy McKinsey, is 72 per cent complete as per the carrier’s estimates, the major outstanding issue being completion of the balance sheet restructuring. The turnaround plan, which has been going on for 15 months, has so far cost KQ Sh2.4 billion — an amount made up of retrenchment costs and consultant and lawyers’ fees. Mr Ngunze, however, said that KQ’s investors “need not worry too much” about the company’s negative equity position, noting that airlines can find themselves in such a situation but still operate “provided you have cash.” KQ’s total liabilities of Sh191 billion outstrip its total assets of Sh146.1 billion. The widening negative book value, the CEO said, resulted from the latest loss and was made worse by currency fluctuations booked from its long-term (12-year) loans borrowed to acquire aircraft. KQ expects the capital restructuring — which could see it take up about Sh60 billion in a mixture of debt and equity — to be completed in coming months, improving its book value and liquidity. “We do not worry so much about the negative equity position but more about whether the airline is generating cash,” Mr Ngunze, who will stay on for two months to finalise the capitalisation, added. READ: Man whose dream of reviving KQ turned into a nightmare “We are focused on the financial restructuring to reduce overall debt so that it matches the valuation of the company and so that we have the right liquidity to ensure that we meet our obligations.” Despite the earnings having been boosted highly by cost cutting, KQ’s management is upbeat about the firm’s ability to make money from its core business and its financial future. Despite a reduction in the airline’s fleet, passenger numbers grew by 5.4 per cent to 4.5 million, with the company expectant that new routes, additional frequencies, optimal ticket pricing will continue growing this and grow revenues. Cash generated from operations remained relatively flat at Sh13.4 billion while the money directed towards financing activities shrunk by Sh8.3 billion to end the year at Sh2.2 billion. This saw the company’s cash and cash equivalents grow by Sh4.4 billion to Sh9.2 billion. “The results are really positive. We have gone through some really tough times but we are coming out. The efforts put in by the KQ management are starting to bear fruit in terms of our operations,” said Michael Joseph, KQ’s chairman. advertisement In the Headlines Ex-KCB boss gets Sh1.5m per month pay for part-time job By VICTOR JUMA  Court orders probe in Safaricom hack claim By ABIUD OCHIENG  26 minutes ago 20 cleared to import 0.7m tonnes of maize By GERALD ANDAE  42 minutes ago DR NG'ANG'A: Too embarrassed to open up to your doctor?

The XS-1 is intended as a satellite delivery system, launching small orbiters into space at high speed and returning to Earth in the same day. DARPA's intention for the XS-1 is for it to be fast and durable enough to complete 10 deliveries to space and back in as many days. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of 10 and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," DARPA program manager Jess Sponable said in a press release.  "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 — fabrication and flight." The XS-1 was announced in November 2013 as DARPA's newest endeavor in hypersonic spaceplane technology, something they've been exploring since the 1980s with little success. DARPA brought on several contractors, including Boeing, to build demonstration vehicles.  Boeing's model, the Phantom Express, beat their competitors. This led to the 2016 launch of Phase 2: a functional vessel that can be taken on a test flight as early as 2020. Boeing's space plane division Phantom Works will handle the construction of the vehicle and engine, with DARPA support. © Photo: Rex Features DARPA Sets Sights on Robotic Space Plane for Next Generation Warfare The XS-1 is to be an unmanned spaceplane capable of carrying 900-3,000 pounds into space and back in a single day for a price tag of $5 million. That's a hefty chunk of change, but right now moving that amount of material into space costs approximately $55 million – and the booster used for the launch is expendable and needs to be replaced afterwards. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," president of Boeing Phantom Works Darryl Davis said in a separate statement. The Phantom Express' engine model is the Aerojet Rocketdyne 22, which is fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen. It is based on a NASA design, Phantom Works said.  © Flickr/ US Air Force Mystery Surrounds Return of Pentagon’s Secretive X-37B Spaceplane To complete the flight in a single day, the XS-1 will have to fly at Mach 10, or 7,673 miles per hour. It will fly into the upper atmosphere before deploying a disposable secondary rocket carrying the payload into orbit around the Earth. Phantom Works and the Pentagon have another spaceplane: the mysterious X-37B, which is launched into space for classified missions that span months or even years. Unlike its cousin, the XS-1 is meant for quick launches and returns. ...

Boeing is tasked with developing an autonomous, reusable spaceplane that can carry a small single-stage launcher and place satellites weighing up to 3000 pounds into low orbit. Both Boeing and DARPA will invest in the program. The spaceplane, colloquially referred to as the "Phantom Express," is designed to use a second stage thruster in order to reenter the Earth's atmosphere and allow a runway landing. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a press release. The Phantom Express's Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine system is a derivative off the original Space Shuttle. It is powered by a mix of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. When the test phase is reached, Boeing and DARPA say they hope to demonstrate 10 flights in 10 days.

(TSX:HRX), („Héroux-Devtek” or the „Corporation”), a leading international manufacturer of aerospace products, today reported its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are in Canadian dollars. „In fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek focussed on executing its business strategy aimed at building a sustainable future for the Corporation. We made initial deliveries on the largest landing gear contract in our history to supply The Boeing Company („Boeing”) with complete landing gear systems for the Boeing 777 and 777X aircraft. We also widened our reach in the worldwide landing gear market by signing multi-year agreements with global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Finally, Héroux-Devtek concluded the fiscal year with a strong financial position, from which it can confidently invest in value-creating initiatives to the benefit of its shareholders,” said Gilles Labbé, President and CEO of Héroux-Devtek. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Quarters ended March 31, Fiscal years ended March 31, (in thousands of dollars, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sales 120,886 117,496 406,536 406,812 EBITDA1 15,547 20,713 61,120 62,590 Adjusted EBITDA1 19,181 20,713 61,448 64,070 Net income 8,895 9,091 31,768 26,641 Per share – diluted ($) 0.25 0.25 0.88 0.74 Adjusted net income1 9,077 9,091 26,353 27,650 Per share ($) 0.25 0.25 0.73 0.77 Weighted-average shares outstanding (diluted, in ‚000s) 36,300 36,188 36,284 36,119 1 This is a non-IFRS measure. Please refer to the „Non-IFRS Measures” section at the end of this press release. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Consolidated sales reached $120.9 million, compared with $117.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This 2.9% increase reflects higher sales to the commercial aerospace market, as detailed below, while year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies had a negative impact of $3.5 million on fourth-quarter sales. Commercial sales rose 11.9% to $60.8 million, versus $54.3 million last year. The increase is mainly attributable to the beginning of deliveries for the Boeing 777 program, partially offset by lower customer requirements for certain business jet and large commercial aircraft programs, as well as unfavourable currency fluctuations. Defence sales declined 4.9%, from $63.2 million to $60.1 million. This variation is essentially due to lower repair and overhaul sales to the U.S. Air Force, as well as unfavourable currency fluctuations, partially offset by a catch-up in sales of spare parts to the U.S. government. Gross profit was $20.8 million, or 17.2% of sales, versus $22.2 million, or 18.9% of sales, last year. The decline mainly reflects a higher under-absorption of costs, including excess processing and finishing costs related to the Boeing 777 program. These excess costs are expected to normalize upon completion of the customer qualification and approval of Héroux-Devtek’s surface treatment processes. This factor was partially offset by favourable year-over-year currency fluctuations equivalent to 1.8% of sales. As a result of the reduction in gross profit, adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million, or 15.9% of sales, compared with $20.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, a year ago. This year’s adjusted EBITDA excluded restructuring charges of $3.6 million, mainly comprised of employee-related costs as part of workforce adjustments announced in February 2017. Net income reached $8.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding non-recurring items net of taxes, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 stood at $9.1 million, or $0.25 per share, stable compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income excluded an after-tax amount of $2.5 million related to a non-cash gain resulting from the update of the estimated repayment schedule for one government authority loan. YEAR-END RESULTS For fiscal 2017, consolidated sales reached $406.5 million, essentially stable compared with $406.8 million in fiscal 2016. Year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies increased sales by $3.4 million. Commercial sales increased 2.1% to $210.8 million, while defence sales decreased 2.3% to $195.7 million. Gross profit for fiscal 2017 amounted to $68.0 million, equivalent to 16.7% of sales, compared with $74.3 million, or 18.3% of sales, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA reached $61.4 million, or 15.1% of sales, versus $64.1 million, or 15.7% of sales, a year earlier. Net income was $31.8 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017, compared with $26.6 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income stood at $26.4 million, or $0.73 per share, versus $27.7 million, or $0.77 per share, last year. STRONG FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION AND SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION In fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek generated a solid free cash flow of $33.0 million, as opposed to negative $66.3 million in fiscal 2016. This significant increase stems from higher cash flows related to operating activities attributable to improved working capital, as well as from a reduction in capital investments following the completion, in fiscal 2016, of the Corporation’s comprehensive investment plan related to the Boeing 777 and 777X contract. The working capital improvement was mainly realized in the fourth quarter, resulting in a strong free cash flow of $22.8 million during the period. Reflecting this free cash flow generation, Héroux-Devtek’s financial position further improved as at March 31, 2017, with cash and cash equivalents of $42.5 million, while total long-term debt was $134.8 million, including the current portion, but excluding net deferred financing costs. Long-term debt includes $55.9 million drawn against the Corporation’s authorized Credit Facility of $200.0 million. As a result, the net debt position was $92.3 million at the end of fiscal 2017, down sharply from $128.0 million at the end of fiscal 2016. The net-debt-to equity ratio stood at 0.26:1 as at March 31, 2017, versus 0.39:1 twelve months earlier. THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE AUTHORIZED CREDIT FACILITY Héroux-Devtek has reached an agreement with a syndicate of banks to amend and restate its existing Credit Facility. Under the terms of the agreement, the Credit Facility has been extended for a three-year period with a new maturity date set for May 2022. The authorized amount remains $200 million, while the additional amount that could be borrowed, subject to lenders’ consent, has been increased from $75 million to $100 million. The Credit Facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes of Héroux-Devtek and its subsidiaries, including acquisitions. It is secured by all assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, and is subject to certain restrictive covenants and corporate guarantees granted by the Corporation and its subsidiaries. UPDATE ON B-777 AND B-777X CONTRACT During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek continued to ramp-up production of complete landing gear systems for this program. The Corporation delivered 21 complete systems in fiscal 2017 and continues to meet production requirements. Also during the fourth quarter, Héroux-Devtek received customer approval for a second main surface treatment process required under this contract in order to produce the most critical components internally. Customer qualification and approval is progressing for the remaining surface treatment processes. Management expects this phase to be completed in fiscal 2018. OUTLOOK In the large commercial aircraft sector, Boeing and Airbus are adjusting production rates ahead of introducing certain more fuel efficient aircraft variants on several leading programs through calendar 2020. Their backlogs remain healthy despite a reduction in new firm orders since calendar 2016. The reduction has been more important for twin-aisle aircraft, including the Boeing 777 program. In the business jet sector, aircraft shipments declined 7.9% in calendar 2016 reflecting an economic contraction in certain emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia. The Corporation remains well positioned in this market given the current and future ramp-up of certain models for which it has designed the landing gear. In the defence aerospace market, the new U.S. administration indicated its intention to increase funding, which could be positive for certain programs. In this regard, greater defence funding was proposed for the 2018 U.S. government’s fiscal year. The Corporation’s U.K. operations provide a more geographically diversified defence portfolio, which reduces its relative exposure to the U.S. market and creates more international opportunities. The balance between new component manufacturing and aftermarket products and services in the Corporation’s defence portfolio and its leading program content also promote more stability. As at March 31, 2017, Héroux-Devtek’s funded (firm orders) backlog stood at $405 million, versus $424 million three months earlier. „Héroux-Devtek is dedicated to building a sustainable future. Our state-of-the-art facilities, talented employees, important content on leading programs, as well as solid relationships with leading aerospace OEMs are essential attributes in achieving success. In the short-term, results will reflect reduced production rates announced by some OEMs for certain aircraft programs, including the Boeing 777. As a result, we expect a low single-digit decrease in sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 when compared to the fiscal year just ended. Following this transition year, we expect sales growth to gradually resume, driven by the ramp-up of new programs, to reach between $480 and $520 million in fiscal 2021. Meanwhile, our solid financial position enables us to continue looking for new business opportunities and for strategic acquisitions that would complement current activities and create further value for shareholders,” concluded Mr. Labbé.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Triumph Group Stock Upgraded: What You Need to Know Details are still sparse, but here's what we know today. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 25, 2017 at 11:46AM Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and "initiate coverage" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... Shares of airplane parts supplier Triumph Group (NYSE:TGI) skyrocketed yesterday, ultimately closing the day up more than 30%, or $7.40 per share. The question is: Why? Triumph Group didn't provide a lot of detail on this in its actual earnings report, which contained mostly bad news -- sales half a percentage point short of Wall Street estimates, losses coming in at $2.57 per share, and guidance well short of expectations. But in its subsequent earnings call with analysts, management gave a bit more color on why things may be looking up for Triumph Group stock, and why recent deals with Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Bombardier (NASDAQOTH:BDRBF) make it possible for Triumph to start winning again -- details that helped to inspire analysts at Vertical Research Partners to remove their sell rating on Triumph Group stock this morning, and upgrade the stock to hold. Here are three things you should know about why they did that. Image source: Getty Images. 1. What worries investors This story starts with Triumph Group's aerospace structures division, which provides more than 62% of the company's total revenue (and according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, is responsible for all of the company's operating losses). Aerostructures, you see, is standing on the knife's edge of bankruptcy. One false move, and it will fall off. In acknowledgement of that, Triumph CEO Daniel Crowley informed analysts yesterday that Triumph has negotiated a "bank amendment" with its lenders that "provides covenant relief during our transformation." In particular, this amendment gives Triumph the option, if necessary, of commencing "voluntary insolvency proceedings within 90 days of the bank amendment" for its Vought Aircraft Division (aka aerospace structures). That said, while bankruptcy is an option open to Triumph, Crowley explained that "the company does not anticipate and believes it is highly unlikely that it will voluntarily file insolvency proceedings with respect to the Vought entity." This is because Triumph has also negotiated "successful agreements" with its customers Boeing and Bombardier to "address the underlying causes of liquidity shortfalls" at Vought.  2. Boeing flies to the rescue A few details on these deals were contained in a pair of press releases issued on Monday, and Triumph provided more in its earnings call. With Boeing, Triumph executed a memorandum of agreement "to increase productivity, reduce cost and enhance the value of Boeing products." Among the more concrete benefits, Triumph says it has "settled past claims and negotiated new prices, cash payments, and standardized terms and conditions that resulted in a win-win for both companies." Actually, maybe "win-not lose as badly" would be a better way of describing the deal. Triumph says it has negotiated "more economical build rates on the 747." According to Crowley, while this won't result in a profit for Triumph, it at least ensures the company "loses ... significantly less money than it was before." 3. Bombardier defused The deal with Canada's Bombardier seems similar, resolving "all outstanding commercial disputes between them, including all pending litigation." In particular, the agreement Triumph Group reached with Bombardier addressed "mutual concerns about wing deliveries, development costs, and recurring production costs" and "resetting" Triumph's relationship with Bombardier. And one more thing... So now we know a few more concrete details about what happened at Triumph Group last quarter. Of course, you can't get much more "concrete" than cold, hard cash -- and this may be the best news of all. According to Triumph, the company generated cash flow from operations of $454 million last quarter. Much of that was of the ordinary variety -- selling stuff, and getting paid for it. But Triumph also collected "approximately $324.0 million of increases in customer advances" on work to be done in the future. Crucially, it appears that this cash came from customers other than Boeing and Bombardier -- but those two companies may be next in line to contribute cash to help keep Triumph's aerostructures solvent, and avoid the need for a bankruptcy filing. We infer this because, during the earnings call, Crowley confirmed that although Triumph received hundreds of millions of dollars worth of advance payments in fiscal Q4 2017, "there was no cash related to any settlements in the quarter we just reported." Crowley went on to (not) confirm that such payments are forthcoming, saying, "We're not going to speculate on specific customer advances in the quarter. But ... we were able to obtain advances from [customers other than Boeing and Bombardier], and we hope to continue that process with other customers." Translation: Boeing and Bombardier have not yet anted up, but they might. That simple hint seems to have been enough to convince Vertical Research to upgrade Triumph Group stock this morning, and to inspire the stock rally yesterday. Whether this optimism will prove warranted may depend on whether the hoped-for cash really does arrive. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The unmanned Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) can lift a payload into orbit and return to Earth to land on a runway. DARPA hopes the XS-1 can launch Department of Defense (DOD) satellites into low Earth orbits with only a few days’ or hours of notice. Current rockets take months to launch satellites. “There is a unique opportunity to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” Boeing spokeswoman Cheryl Sampson told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “The availability of advanced composite manufacturing capability and streamlined launch systems has created an opportunity to bring aircraft-like operations to the launch business and pursue a new approach,” Sampson said. “The capability would offer government and commercial customers more flexibility to launch more quickly and test new technologies in space.” The XS-1 will have vertical launch capabilities, unlike the Air Force’s current X-37B unmanned plane that relies on Atlas V rockets to launch. The XS-1 will be roughly the size of a business jet, but capable of reaching hypersonic speeds over Mach 5 to allow the plane to reach suborbital altitudes. “Boeing selected the Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine for this next phase as it offers a flight proven, reusable engine to meet the DARPA mission requirements,” Sampson said. “For the XS-1 program, Aerojet Rocketdyne is providing two engines with legacy shuttle flight experience to demonstrate reusability, a wide operating range and rapid turnarounds.” WATCH: DARPA predicts that the XS-1 could operate with costs under $5 million per launch. In comparison, some of NASA’s Space Shuttle launches cost $1.5 billion while the more modern Falcon 9 rocket created by the private corporation SpaceX costs $54 million per launch. If the program is successful, DARPA plans to develop commercial spin-offs. DARPA did not return requests for comment on potential civilian uses for the XS-1 technology to TheDCNF. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today’s frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager, said in a press statement. “We’re very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight.” Reusable space technology is considered a major advance because it has the potential to lower the costs of getting into orbit, which are high due to expensive rocket components. America’s now decommissioned Space Shuttle was only technically reusable because scientists discarded its giant fuel tank after each launch, and its side boosters were parachuted into corrosive salt water. This required them to be extensively refurbished after use, making the Space Shuttle extremely expensive. The Air Force has already vowed to invest $6.6 billion into protecting satellites over the next six years, and could spend upwards of $10 billion on space operations from combined public and classified budgets last year, according to The Air Force Times. Theoretically, XS-1 could allow the military to replace satellites taken out of operation by an enemy faster than they could be shot down.

His statements followed President Donald Trump’s Middle East trip, in which he called on Iran to stop funding “terrorists and militias.” The review suggests that Trump’s support for Boeing’s defence and jetliner businesses could have political limits. Iran says halting the aeroplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. Mnuchin told the Ways and Means hearing that sanctions “really work” and were responsible for bringing Iran to the negotiating table ahead of the nuclear deal. For Boeing, losing the IranAir deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the wide-body jetliners are included in the first approved batch of Boeing aircraft due for delivery to IranAir by 2020. Deliveries start in May next year. Boeing said in December it would cut 777 output by 40 per cent this year under plans that include IranAir’s still-tentative order. IranAir has agreed to buy 200 US and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing, 100 from Airbus and 20 turboprops from Franco-Italian ATR. All the aircraft need US licences because of their reliance on US parts. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval,” a spokeswoman said by email. An Airbus spokesman had no immediate comment. In its first business with the Islamic republic since US President Donald Trump took office vowing a tougher stance on Iran in January, Boeing last month announced a tentative deal to sell 30 jets to Iran Aseman Airlines, its third-largest carrier. Boeing said it would apply for licences for the deal. People involved in the deals say the Treasury has so far issued licences for the main contracts between Western suppliers and IranAir, but that many need to be renewed beyond 2020. IranAir does not need further approvals to take delivery of the first 70 or so aircraft, they say, though legal experts have said the US Treasury can withdraw licences at any time. About a third of the Airbus jets, or some 37, also are due to arrive by 2020, including three already delivered. IranAir last week took delivery of four ATR turboprops and plans to take the remaining 16 next year. Even with licences in place, bankers say talks between Iran and Western banks to fund deliveries of the aircraft have been disrupted by concerns that sanctions could be reintroduced or that banks could be penalised for dealing with Iran.

Among those emerging from the third-party pack is Cobham. The company’s Mission Systems division—once part of Bendix—developed the first inerting application, for military helicopters, more than 30 years ago. It supplies components for the Boeing 787 and Mitsubishi MRJ systems. But its largest opportunity is evolving, thanks to missteps by competitors chosen by Airbus and Boeing to meet the FAA’s Fuel Tank Flammability Reduction mandate. Southwest Airlines is one of several operators using aftermarket inerting-kit components. The 2008 rule called for new-production versions of affected models with center-wing tanks to have systems installed starting in late December 2010. It also requires airlines to retrofit affected in-service models by Dec. 27. The rule, one of many changes triggered by probes into about 20 center fuel-tank explosions, including TWA Flight 800 in 1996, covers nine aircraft families, including the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. While the rule does not prescribe a fix, Airbus and Boeing opted for inerting systems, which lower the oxygen levels in tanks, removing the risk of explosion. About two years after new aircraft began rolling out with the systems installed, 737 operators began reporting reliability issues with air separation module (ASM) membranes that are key to the inerting process. Supplied by Parker Hannifin and designed to last at least 20,000 hr.—about four years—many operators were experiencing failures in half that time.  “The system has not been as reliable as we’d like it to be,” says Kent Horton, director of aircraft engineering for Southwest Airlines. Replacement ASMs, the only way to get new membranes, are about $70,000. Enter the third-party suppliers. Cobham in late 2015 announced its 737NG ASM offering was flying with an unnamed U.S.-based customer. It added two major North American 737 operators—and was close to signing with a third—as well as a large European carrier. It has 250 of its ASMs in service. “They are shipping pretty quickly,” says Mike Donahue, Cobham Mission Systems business development director. In addition to Cobham, AeroParts has developed an ASM repair featuring a new membrane and fixed 100 out-of-warranty systems in the last two years.  JetAire Group has taken a different tack, developing a system that lines tanks with a proprietary foam to suppress fuel ignition. Based on an approach used in the military for years, JetAire has kits for 737 Classics, 757s and 767s and A320s. It expects to have an approved 737NG system by mid-year. Boeing is working on a more reliable ASM, but its time line keeps slipping. “We are working with our supplier to ensure that the improved [ASM] kits will be available in [the fourth quarter of] 2017,” Boeing says. Meanwhile, major operators of U.S.-registered aircraft report no problems lining up kits to meet the Dec. 27 retrofit deadline. The OEM-offered kit is most popular, but carriers are using alternate suppliers to boost reliability.  “We have worked with a third party to provide an alternate component in the system, and we’re seeing the performance on that component [is] more in line with what our expectations were originally,” Southwest’s Horton says. The new Boeing kit’s delay plus reports of similar problems with A320-family systems suggests that the market for alternatives will be large.  While the FAA ended up alone in mandating a retrofit (European regulators reversed course, concluding the costs were not justifiable), the forward-fit requirement was adopted globally. This means that more than 6,000 737NGs and A320s delivered since about mid-2009 have the systems. “Many of the operators are just now coming out of warranty,” says Larry Britt, AeroParts business development manager. “There’s a huge market for us.” This has the suppliers jockeying for position. In addition to the membrane repair, AeroParts offers a customized insulation sleeve for the 737 ASM. The part was requested by operators to ease reassembly of a repaired system, such as an ASM under warranty it sent back to Parker, Britt says. Cobham is using input from operators to guide its product development. “We’ve flipped our focus to the end customers from the OEM,” Cobham’s Donahue explains. “We interview the customer and grade their interest [in different products]. We have a documented path of what their goal is, which helps guide our product development.” The dialog helped Cobham develop  a seven-year warranty option for its ASMs. Now some customers are asking for a “life-of-aircraft” option, which would run about 14 years, or two average leases, Donahue notes. “It’s taking the subsystem off the radar screen for the airline,” he says, adding that customer data show inerting systems are among the three costliest subsystems on some aircraft models.

REUTERS By DiversityInc Staff / May 25, 2017 The Boeing (a DiversityInc Noteworthy Company) SES-15 satellite, launched today, will bolster connectivity for Wi-Fi and entertainment services on flights over North America, Mexico and Central America. It will also serve the government, enterprise and maritime sectors. This 702-model satellite also demonstrates that using 3-D printed parts can improve affordability and production. More than 50 such metallic parts are on the vehicle in the primary structure. “With its all-electric propulsion, and inclusion of 3-D printed hardware, SES-15 is a great example of how we can create efficient and cost-effective products rapidly for customers,” said Mark Spiwak, president, Boeing Satellite Systems International. “In fact, SES-15 was designed, built, tested and delivered to the launch site ahead of schedule.” This is the fifth Boeing satellite to be deployed with a highly efficient all-electric propulsion system. SES-15 has a hybrid payload, including additional Ku-band wide beams and Ku-band High Throughput Satellite (HTS) capability, with connectivity to gateways in Ka-band. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) safety efforts will also benefit from the satellite as SES-15 carries a Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS) hosted payload for the FAA. SES has ordered 12 Boeing satellites since 1990, including SES-15. SES-15 is the operator’s first 702 all-electric satellite in its fleet.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Value Stocks You Might Not Have Thought Of These three stocks may not be run-of-the-mill value stocks, but they are attractive buys right now. George Budwell, Rich Smith, and Dan Caplinger (TMFGBudwell) May 25, 2017 at 8:32AM With the market bumping up against its all-time highs, it's becoming increasingly difficult to unearth stocks with compelling valuations. That said, good bargain-hunters can always seem to find hidden gems -- even in a pricey market such as this one. Keeping this theme in mind, we asked three of our contributors which stocks they think offer attractive valuations right now. They suggested Opko Health (NASDAQ:OPK), Wesco Aircraft Holdings (NYSE:WAIR), and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Read on to find out why.  Image source: Getty Images. This healthcare stock is poised to bounce back after an awful start to 2017 George Budwell (Opko Health): Opko's shares have been on a downward spiral this year because of the late-stage failure of its long-acting human growth hormone product hGH-CTP, which was indicated as a possible treatment for growth hormone deficiency. The key issue to understand is that this experimental drug was already licensed out to pharma titan Pfizer, meaning that Opko was in line to gain millions in milestone payments following a successful late-stage readout. However, the market appears to have seriously overreacted to this clinical setback -- potentially transforming Opko into an attractive value play for investors with a long-term outlook. Although this late-stage failure was certainly unwelcome news, Opko still has two major value drivers in play that could send its shares higher in the years ahead. Opko is working diligently at improving the reimbursement landscape for its 4Kscore prostate cancer test, and the company has arguably set up its relatively new chronic kidney disease drug Rayaldee for a strong commercial launch by forming key partnerships with leaders in the field.  The bottom line is that Opko is on track to grow its top line by an impressive 16.6% next year because of these two growth drivers, and its shares are also trading at an absolutely dirt cheap price to sales ratio of 3 at the moment. So, Opko definitely qualifies as an underappreciated value stock that's worthy of a deeper dive.  Looking for value in the friendly skies Dan Caplinger (Wesco Aircraft Holdings): The aerospace industry has done extremely well in recent years, and many stocks that have links to aviation have seen their shares rise. Yet for Wesco Aircraft Holdings, the recent boom hasn't shown up in its stock price, and shares now look attractive to some value investors. Wesco provides supply chain management services and distributes products related to the aerospace industry both in the U.S. and internationally. The company ensures that its customers have a wide range of supplies, ranging from hardware items to chemicals, electronic components, tools, and specially crafted parts. With new aircraft in strong demand and with companies across the commercial and military airplane manufacturing industry using Wesco's services, the aerospace supply specialist has plenty of opportunities. What has some investors concerned is the fact that Wesco's earnings have been on the decline in recent years. From a high of $1.12 per share in fiscal 2013, Wesco saw its bottom-line figures fall to $0.94 per share in fiscal 2016, and the past three quarters have shown more signs of a slowdown. Yet the stock trades at just nine times its trailing earnings, giving Wesco a margin of safety against any further declines. Whether the company succeeds in boosting its sales performance or starts pursuing strategic alternatives, Wesco has a good chance of bouncing back from its recent challenges and delivering value for shareholders. Want to find value? Look up -- in the sky Rich Smith (Boeing): At $109.4 billion in market capitalization and a share price of nearly $180, I'm willing to bet that airplane maker Boeing is a company few investors think of as being a "value stock." But it is. The way I look at value breaks down into two main parts: How much does a stock cost relative to its profits, and how fast is the company growing those profits? In the case of Boeing, it works like this: Valued on GAAP earnings, Boeing stock costs about 21.6 times its $5.1 billion in trailing net income. But that's just the start of the story. Boeing, you see, generates cash from its business at levels far higher than what it's permitted (by GAAP rules) to call "net income." In fact, over the past 12 months, Boeing generated positive free cash flow (that's operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) of nearly $9 billion. That's roughly $1.76 in cash profits for every $1 than Boeing was able to report as "accounting profit." As a result, while some may look at Boeing stock and say that it sells for 21.6 times "earnings," it's just as accurate to say that Boeing costs less than 12.3 times free cash flow, which seems to me a very reasonable price to pay for the world's leading aircraft manufacturer. All the more so given how fast Boeing is growing. According to estimates tallied by S&P Global Market Intelligence, analysts on average expect Boeing to grow its profits at 16% annually over the next five years as it works its way through its backlog of more than 5,700 aircraft ordered but not yet built. Marrying these two metrics, I calculate Boeing stock as selling for a price-to-free cash flow-to-growth ratio of just 0.8 -- at least 20% below fair value. In my book, this makes Boeing a value stock, hiding in plain sight.  Dan Caplinger owns shares of Boeing. George Budwell owns shares of Pfizer. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Allegiant will waive its customary fees on bags, seat assignments and boarding passes for members of the military with valid identification. The “Allegiant Honors” program, to be formally announced Thursday, will cover active duty military, retired military veterans, members of the National Guard, military reserve and their spouses and dependents. “All of us at Allegiant take great pride in supporting the brave men and women who serve our country every day,” Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher says in a statement. “The Allegiant Honors program extends our thanks by making it a little easier for active members of the military, veterans and their families to travel.” With Allegiant’s move, all three of the USA’s big “ultra low-cost carriers” have now waived bag fees for active duty military members. Those airlines – Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant are the biggest such types in the U.S. – operate business models that promote bargain fares. But the discount fares come with fees for everything from printing a boarding pass to using the overhead bins for carry-on bags. Allegiant’s military program, however, goes beyond bag fees to cover a number of fee-based services that have become a staple at the budget airlines. TODAY IN THE SKY: What's it like to refuel fighter jets mid-air? A rare up-close look Those eligible for the Allegiant Honors program will have fees waived or refunded for the following items: Up to three pieces of checked luggage (each must weigh less than 100 pounds) No charge for oversized checked baggage One carry-on bag (within Allegiant size limits) for free Free boarding pass printing at the airport Free seat assignments, pending availability Priority boarding Waiver of change fee for active duty military when flight changes made due to a change in orders Waiver of fees for flying with a pet in the cabin  To get the fees waived for the covered Allegiant Honors services, eligible military personnel and their family members should request the items when checking in at the airport. Travelers must show valid military I.D. to verify their eligibility. Eligible members who have paid in advance for services covered by the Allegiant Honors program can request a refund after showing a valid military I.D. at an Allegiant airport counter. After confirmation of the I.D. is documented in the traveler’s itinerary, the traveler must call Allegiant’s customer call center to process the refund.

(TSX:HRX), ("Héroux-Devtek" or the "Corporation"), a leading international manufacturer of aerospace products, today reported its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are in Canadian dollars. "In fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek focussed on executing its business strategy aimed at building a sustainable future for the Corporation. We made initial deliveries on the largest landing gear contract in our history to supply The Boeing Company ("Boeing") with complete landing gear systems for the Boeing 777 and 777X aircraft. We also widened our reach in the worldwide landing gear market by signing multi-year agreements with global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Finally, Héroux-Devtek concluded the fiscal year with a strong financial position, from which it can confidently invest in value-creating initiatives to the benefit of its shareholders," said Gilles Labbé, President and CEO of Héroux-Devtek. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Quarters ended March 31, Fiscal years ended March 31, (in thousands of dollars, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sales 120,886 117,496 406,536 406,812 EBITDA1 15,547 20,713 61,120 62,590 Adjusted EBITDA1 19,181 20,713 61,448 64,070 Net income 8,895 9,091 31,768 26,641 Per share - diluted ($) 0.25 0.25 0.88 0.74 Adjusted net income1 9,077 9,091 26,353 27,650 Per share ($) 0.25 0.25 0.73 0.77 Weighted-average shares outstanding (diluted, in '000s) 36,300 36,188 36,284 36,119 1 This is a non-IFRS measure. Please refer to the "Non-IFRS Measures" section at the end of this press release. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Consolidated sales reached $120.9 million, compared with $117.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This 2.9% increase reflects higher sales to the commercial aerospace market, as detailed below, while year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies had a negative impact of $3.5 million on fourth-quarter sales. Commercial sales rose 11.9% to $60.8 million, versus $54.3 million last year. The increase is mainly attributable to the beginning of deliveries for the Boeing 777 program, partially offset by lower customer requirements for certain business jet and large commercial aircraft programs, as well as unfavourable currency fluctuations. Defence sales declined 4.9%, from $63.2 million to $60.1 million. This variation is essentially due to lower repair and overhaul sales to the U.S. Air Force, as well as unfavourable currency fluctuations, partially offset by a catch-up in sales of spare parts to the U.S. government. Gross profit was $20.8 million, or 17.2% of sales, versus $22.2 million, or 18.9% of sales, last year. The decline mainly reflects a higher under-absorption of costs, including excess processing and finishing costs related to the Boeing 777 program. These excess costs are expected to normalize upon completion of the customer qualification and approval of Héroux-Devtek's surface treatment processes. This factor was partially offset by favourable year-over-year currency fluctuations equivalent to 1.8% of sales. As a result of the reduction in gross profit, adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million, or 15.9% of sales, compared with $20.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, a year ago. This year's adjusted EBITDA excluded restructuring charges of $3.6 million, mainly comprised of employee-related costs as part of workforce adjustments announced in February 2017. Net income reached $8.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding non-recurring items net of taxes, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 stood at $9.1 million, or $0.25 per share, stable compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income excluded an after-tax amount of $2.5 million related to a non-cash gain resulting from the update of the estimated repayment schedule for one government authority loan. YEAR-END RESULTS For fiscal 2017, consolidated sales reached $406.5 million, essentially stable compared with $406.8 million in fiscal 2016. Year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies increased sales by $3.4 million. Commercial sales increased 2.1% to $210.8 million, while defence sales decreased 2.3% to $195.7 million. Gross profit for fiscal 2017 amounted to $68.0 million, equivalent to 16.7% of sales, compared with $74.3 million, or 18.3% of sales, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA reached $61.4 million, or 15.1% of sales, versus $64.1 million, or 15.7% of sales, a year earlier. Net income was $31.8 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017, compared with $26.6 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income stood at $26.4 million, or $0.73 per share, versus $27.7 million, or $0.77 per share, last year. STRONG FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION AND SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION In fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek generated a solid free cash flow of $33.0 million, as opposed to negative $66.3 million in fiscal 2016. This significant increase stems from higher cash flows related to operating activities attributable to improved working capital, as well as from a reduction in capital investments following the completion, in fiscal 2016, of the Corporation's comprehensive investment plan related to the Boeing 777 and 777X contract. The working capital improvement was mainly realized in the fourth quarter, resulting in a strong free cash flow of $22.8 million during the period. Reflecting this free cash flow generation, Héroux-Devtek's financial position further improved as at March 31, 2017, with cash and cash equivalents of $42.5 million, while total long-term debt was $134.8 million, including the current portion, but excluding net deferred financing costs. Long-term debt includes $55.9 million drawn against the Corporation's authorized Credit Facility of $200.0 million. As a result, the net debt position was $92.3 million at the end of fiscal 2017, down sharply from $128.0 million at the end of fiscal 2016. The net-debt-to equity ratio stood at 0.26:1 as at March 31, 2017, versus 0.39:1 twelve months earlier. THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE AUTHORIZED CREDIT FACILITY Héroux-Devtek has reached an agreement with a syndicate of banks to amend and restate its existing Credit Facility. Under the terms of the agreement, the Credit Facility has been extended for a three-year period with a new maturity date set for May 2022. The authorized amount remains $200 million, while the additional amount that could be borrowed, subject to lenders' consent, has been increased from $75 million to $100 million. The Credit Facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes of Héroux-Devtek and its subsidiaries, including acquisitions. It is secured by all assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, and is subject to certain restrictive covenants and corporate guarantees granted by the Corporation and its subsidiaries. UPDATE ON B-777 AND B-777X CONTRACT During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek continued to ramp-up production of complete landing gear systems for this program. The Corporation delivered 21 complete systems in fiscal 2017 and continues to meet production requirements. Also during the fourth quarter, Héroux-Devtek received customer approval for a second main surface treatment process required under this contract in order to produce the most critical components internally. Customer qualification and approval is progressing for the remaining surface treatment processes. Management expects this phase to be completed in fiscal 2018. OUTLOOK In the large commercial aircraft sector, Boeing and Airbus are adjusting production rates ahead of introducing certain more fuel efficient aircraft variants on several leading programs through calendar 2020. Their backlogs remain healthy despite a reduction in new firm orders since calendar 2016. The reduction has been more important for twin-aisle aircraft, including the Boeing 777 program. In the business jet sector, aircraft shipments declined 7.9% in calendar 2016 reflecting an economic contraction in certain emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia. The Corporation remains well positioned in this market given the current and future ramp-up of certain models for which it has designed the landing gear. In the defence aerospace market, the new U.S. administration indicated its intention to increase funding, which could be positive for certain programs. In this regard, greater defence funding was proposed for the 2018 U.S. government's fiscal year. The Corporation's U.K. operations provide a more geographically diversified defence portfolio, which reduces its relative exposure to the U.S. market and creates more international opportunities. The balance between new component manufacturing and aftermarket products and services in the Corporation's defence portfolio and its leading program content also promote more stability. As at March 31, 2017, Héroux-Devtek's funded (firm orders) backlog stood at $405 million, versus $424 million three months earlier. "Héroux-Devtek is dedicated to building a sustainable future. Our state-of-the-art facilities, talented employees, important content on leading programs, as well as solid relationships with leading aerospace OEMs are essential attributes in achieving success. In the short-term, results will reflect reduced production rates announced by some OEMs for certain aircraft programs, including the Boeing 777. As a result, we expect a low single-digit decrease in sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 when compared to the fiscal year just ended. Following this transition year, we expect sales growth to gradually resume, driven by the ramp-up of new programs, to reach between $480 and $520 million in fiscal 2021. Meanwhile, our solid financial position enables us to continue looking for new business opportunities and for strategic acquisitions that would complement current activities and create further value for shareholders," concluded Mr. Labbé.

The improvements were carried out by Boeing to develop radar capabilities and reduce repair time. The work included the addition of a new radar computer, a radar control maintenance panel, as well as electrical and mechanical software and hardware. Boeing Saudi AWACS programme manager Keith Burns said: "The AWACS’s main mission is to provide real-time situation awareness and our teams have stayed true to that mission. “The modernised software, multiple radar nodes and overall enhanced operation make this the most significant upgrade to the AWACS radar since it was developed in the 1970s.” The upgrade programme is intended to increase the original equipment’s radar sensitivity and expand the range of tracking targets. A team of engineers and technicians at Boeing carried out the installation and checkout of the first upgraded aircraft at Boeing Field in Seattle, US.  "The modernised software, multiple radar nodes and overall enhanced operation make this the most significant upgrade to the AWACS radar since it was developed in the 1970s." The remaining aircraft were modified at Alsalam Aerospace Industries in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with the support of Boeing engineers, technicians, and a test and evaluation team. Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems-built RSIP kit has also been installed on AWACS fleets of the US, UK, Nato and France. Powered by four Pratt and Whitney (P&W) TF-33 engines, the AWACS can travel at a top speed of 530mph and has an endurance of six hours. With a length of 152ft and 11in, the aircraft has enough space to accommodate a four-member crew and 13 to 18 AWACS specialists. Image: The Royal Saudi Air Force’s AWACS aircraft.

(TSX:HRX), ("Héroux-Devtek" or the "Corporation"), a leading international manufacturer of aerospace products, today reported its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are in Canadian dollars. "In fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek focussed on executing its business strategy aimed at building a sustainable future for the Corporation. We made initial deliveries on the largest landing gear contract in our history to supply The Boeing Company ("Boeing") with complete landing gear systems for the Boeing 777 and 777X aircraft. We also widened our reach in the worldwide landing gear market by signing multi-year agreements with global Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Finally, Héroux-Devtek concluded the fiscal year with a strong financial position, from which it can confidently invest in value-creating initiatives to the benefit of its shareholders," said Gilles Labbé, President and CEO of Héroux-Devtek. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Quarters ended March 31, Fiscal years ended March 31, (in thousands of dollars, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sales 120,886 117,496 406,536 406,812 EBITDA1 15,547 20,713 61,120 62,590 Adjusted EBITDA1 19,181 20,713 61,448 64,070 Net income 8,895 9,091 31,768 26,641 Per share - diluted ($) 0.25 0.25 0.88 0.74 Adjusted net income1 9,077 9,091 26,353 27,650 Per share ($) 0.25 0.25 0.73 0.77 Weighted-average shares outstanding (diluted, in '000s) 36,300 36,188 36,284 36,119 1 This is a non-IFRS measure. Please refer to the "Non-IFRS Measures" section at the end of this press release. FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Consolidated sales reached $120.9 million, compared with $117.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This 2.9% increase reflects higher sales to the commercial aerospace market, as detailed below, while year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies had a negative impact of $3.5 million on fourth-quarter sales. Commercial sales rose 11.9% to $60.8 million, versus $54.3 million last year. The increase is mainly attributable to the beginning of deliveries for the Boeing 777 program, partially offset by lower customer requirements for certain business jet and large commercial aircraft programs, as well as unfavourable currency fluctuations. Defence sales declined 4.9%, from $63.2 million to $60.1 million. This variation is essentially due to lower repair and overhaul sales to the U.S. Air Force, as well as unfavourable currency fluctuations, partially offset by a catch-up in sales of spare parts to the U.S. government. Gross profit was $20.8 million, or 17.2% of sales, versus $22.2 million, or 18.9% of sales, last year. The decline mainly reflects a higher under-absorption of costs, including excess processing and finishing costs related to the Boeing 777 program. These excess costs are expected to normalize upon completion of the customer qualification and approval of Héroux-Devtek's surface treatment processes. This factor was partially offset by favourable year-over-year currency fluctuations equivalent to 1.8% of sales. As a result of the reduction in gross profit, adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million, or 15.9% of sales, compared with $20.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, a year ago. This year's adjusted EBITDA excluded restructuring charges of $3.6 million, mainly comprised of employee-related costs as part of workforce adjustments announced in February 2017. Net income reached $8.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding non-recurring items net of taxes, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 stood at $9.1 million, or $0.25 per share, stable compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income excluded an after-tax amount of $2.5 million related to a non-cash gain resulting from the update of the estimated repayment schedule for one government authority loan. YEAR-END RESULTS For fiscal 2017, consolidated sales reached $406.5 million, essentially stable compared with $406.8 million in fiscal 2016. Year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies increased sales by $3.4 million. Commercial sales increased 2.1% to $210.8 million, while defence sales decreased 2.3% to $195.7 million. Gross profit for fiscal 2017 amounted to $68.0 million, equivalent to 16.7% of sales, compared with $74.3 million, or 18.3% of sales, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA reached $61.4 million, or 15.1% of sales, versus $64.1 million, or 15.7% of sales, a year earlier. Net income was $31.8 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017, compared with $26.6 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income stood at $26.4 million, or $0.73 per share, versus $27.7 million, or $0.77 per share, last year.

 FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS Consolidated sales reached $120.9 million, compared with $117.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. This 2.9% increase reflects higher sales to the commercial aerospace market, as detailed below, while year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies had a negative impact of $3.5 million on fourth-quarter sales.  Commercial sales rose 11.9% to $60.8 million, versus $54.3 million last year. The increase is mainly attributable to the beginning of deliveries for the Boeing 777 program, partially offset by lower customer requirements for certain business jet and large commercial aircraft programs, as well as unfavourable currency fluctuations. Defence sales declined 4.9%, from $63.2 million to $60.1 million. This variation is essentially due to lower repair and overhaul sales to the U.S. Air Force, as well as unfavourable currency fluctuations, partially offset by a catch-up in sales of spare parts to the U.S. government. Gross profit was $20.8 million, or 17.2% of sales, versus $22.2 million, or 18.9% of sales, last year. The decline mainly reflects a higher under-absorption of costs, including excess processing and finishing costs related to the Boeing 777 program. These excess costs are expected to normalize upon completion of the customer qualification and approval of Héroux-Devtek's surface treatment processes. This factor was partially offset by favourable year-over-year currency fluctuations equivalent to 1.8% of sales. As a result of the reduction in gross profit, adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million, or 15.9% of sales, compared with $20.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, a year ago. This year's adjusted EBITDA excluded restructuring charges of $3.6 million, mainly comprised of employee-related costs as part of workforce adjustments announced in February 2017. Net income reached $8.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding non-recurring items net of taxes, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 stood at $9.1 million, or $0.25 per share, stable compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income excluded an after-tax amount of $2.5 million related to a non-cash gain resulting from the update of the estimated repayment schedule for one government authority loan. YEAR-END RESULTS For fiscal 2017, consolidated sales reached $406.5 million, essentially stable compared with $406.8 million in fiscal 2016. Year-over-year fluctuations in the value of the Canadian currency versus foreign currencies increased sales by $3.4 million. Commercial sales increased 2.1% to $210.8 million, while defence sales decreased 2.3% to $195.7 million. Gross profit for fiscal 2017 amounted to $68.0 million, equivalent to 16.7% of sales, compared with $74.3 million, or 18.3% of sales, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted EBITDA reached $61.4 million, or 15.1% of sales, versus $64.1 million, or 15.7% of sales, a year earlier. Net income was $31.8 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017, compared with $26.6 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, in fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income stood at $26.4 million, or $0.73 per share, versus $27.7 million, or $0.77 per share, last year. STRONG FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION AND SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION In fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek generated a solid free cash flow of $33.0 million, as opposed to negative $66.3 million in fiscal 2016. This significant increase stems from higher cash flows related to operating activities attributable to improved working capital, as well as from a reduction in capital investments following the completion, in fiscal 2016, of the Corporation's comprehensive investment plan related to the Boeing 777 and 777X contract. The working capital improvement was mainly realized in the fourth quarter, resulting in a strong free cash flow of $22.8 million during the period. Reflecting this free cash flow generation, Héroux-Devtek's financial position further improved as at March 31, 2017, with cash and cash equivalents of $42.5 million, while total long-term debt was $134.8 million, including the current portion, but excluding net deferred financing costs. Long-term debt includes $55.9 million drawn against the Corporation's authorized Credit Facility of $200.0 million. As a result, the net debt position was $92.3 million at the end of fiscal 2017, down sharply from $128.0 million at the end of fiscal 2016. The net-debt-to equity ratio stood at 0.26:1 as at March 31, 2017, versus 0.39:1 twelve months earlier. THREE-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE AUTHORIZED CREDIT FACILITY Héroux-Devtek has reached an agreement with a syndicate of banks to amend and restate its existing Credit Facility. Under the terms of the agreement, the Credit Facility has been extended for a three-year period with a new maturity date set for May 2022. The authorized amount remains $200 million, while the additional amount that could be borrowed, subject to lenders' consent, has been increased from $75 million to $100 million. The Credit Facility will be used for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes of Héroux-Devtek and its subsidiaries, including acquisitions. It is secured by all assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, and is subject to certain restrictive covenants and corporate guarantees granted by the Corporation and its subsidiaries. UPDATE ON B-777 AND B-777X CONTRACT During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Héroux-Devtek continued to ramp-up production of complete landing gear systems for this program. The Corporation delivered 21 complete systems in fiscal 2017 and continues to meet production requirements. Also during the fourth quarter, Héroux-Devtek received customer approval for a second main surface treatment process required under this contract in order to produce the most critical components internally. Customer qualification and approval is progressing for the remaining surface treatment processes. Management expects this phase to be completed in fiscal 2018. OUTLOOK In the large commercial aircraft sector, Boeing and Airbus are adjusting production rates ahead of introducing certain more fuel efficient aircraft variants on several leading programs through calendar 2020. Their backlogs remain healthy despite a reduction in new firm orders since calendar 2016. The reduction has been more important for twin-aisle aircraft, including the Boeing 777 program. In the business jet sector, aircraft shipments declined 7.9% in calendar 2016 reflecting an economic contraction in certain emerging markets, notably Brazil and Russia. The Corporation remains well positioned in this market given the current and future ramp-up of certain models for which it has designed the landing gear. In the defence aerospace market, the new U.S. administration indicated its intention to increase funding, which could be positive for certain programs. In this regard, greater defence funding was proposed for the 2018 U.S. government's fiscal year. The Corporation's U.K. operations provide a more geographically diversified defence portfolio, which reduces its relative exposure to the U.S. market and creates more international opportunities. The balance between new component manufacturing and aftermarket products and services in the Corporation's defence portfolio and its leading program content also promote more stability. As at March 31, 2017, Héroux-Devtek's funded (firm orders) backlog stood at $405 million, versus $424 million three months earlier. "Héroux-Devtek is dedicated to building a sustainable future. Our state-of-the-art facilities, talented employees, important content on leading programs, as well as solid relationships with leading aerospace OEMs are essential attributes in achieving success. In the short-term, results will reflect reduced production rates announced by some OEMs for certain aircraft programs, including the Boeing 777. As a result, we expect a low single-digit decrease in sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 when compared to the fiscal year just ended. Following this transition year, we expect sales growth to gradually resume, driven by the ramp-up of new programs, to reach between $480 and $520 million in fiscal 2021. Meanwhile, our solid financial position enables us to continue looking for new business opportunities and for strategic acquisitions that would complement current activities and create further value for shareholders," concluded Mr. Labbé.

Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz IT & Technology Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Boeing building DARPA's new hypersonic space plane May 25, 2017 - 12:14 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - A few years ago, DARPA started work on a new experimental aircraft project called the XS-1, a vehicle designed to make launching satellites a faster, less expensive endeavor. Now, that project just took a huge leap forward: DARPA has announced that it's partnering with Boeing to build its next generation hypersonic space plane. Specifically, the aircraft manufacturer has been tapped to complete advanced design work on the XS-1 project, following up on the concept Boeing pitched to the agency during the project's early stages -- which it will now help build and test over the next several years, Engadget said. In practice, this means Boeing is now building a unmanned, reusable hypersonic jet with the goal of running ten test flights over ten consecutive days by the year 2020 -- a program that's designed to prove that the XS-1 will be able to launch satellites into low-earth orbit on short notice. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two," DARPA's Jess Sponable explained in a press release. "With the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand." The XS-1 will manage this feat by flying to suborbital heights without boosters before deploying a disposable, secondary rocket to push its payload into orbit. Better still, the spaceplane be able to take a second satellite up within hours of delivering the first. Well, that's the plan anyway -- the project is still years away from being finished, and the earliest on-ground engine tests won't start until 2019 at the earliest. Until then, we'll have to settle for DARPA's concept video, which admittedly, is still pretty cool. Photo: DARPA Related links: Engadget.

ADVERTISEMENT The go-ahead was given by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), the US Department of Defense’s technological research wing. While strategic launches, such as satellite deployments, currently take months, or even years, of preparation, the jet – now known as ‘Phantom Express’ would be ready for launch in just days. This would provide a boost to national security, says DARPA.

"We’re very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight." Phase 2 includes design, construction and testing of the technology throughout 2019. This will include firing the vehicle’s engine on the ground 10 times over 10 days.

Initial flights will begin at speeds of Mach 5, while later flights will be pushed to Mach 10. The spaceplane would take off vertically like a rocket, using VTOL-style technology, powered by self-contained cryogenic propellants, with no external boosters. On reaching a high suborbital altitude, an expendable upper stage would be released, capable of deploying a satellite. The reusable first stage would then return to Earth, landing horizontally like a plane. It could be ready for another flight within hours. Autonomous flights will be powered using systems developed by DARPA. The X-37B spaceplane recently returned to Earth after nearly two years in orbit U.S. Air Force Once the spaceplane is eventually ready, it will cost an estimated $5 million or less per launch, based on at least 10 launches per year. This is a fraction of what the US military currently uses for similar strategic launches. "We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality," said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. ADVERTISEMENT "Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.”" After testing is complete, non-government firms will be able to use XS-1 technologies. DARPA will release selected data from the final testing phases of the XS-1 programme to commercial companies. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," said Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works. In May, Nasa successfully landed the autonomous X-37B spaceplane, which was also built by Boeing, after a massive 718 days in orbit.

Source: Boeing Key Points Boeing wins widely anticipated DARPA space contract Goal is to develop a reusable spaceplane that can eventually launch 10 times in 10 days Boeing on 24 May beat Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems to complete advanced design work for the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) programme. Boeing said it will develop an autonomous, reusable spaceplane capable of carrying and deploying a small expendable upper stage to launch small (3,000 lb/1,361 kg) satellites into low earth orbit (LEO). Boeing and DARPA will jointly invest in the development. DARPA spokesman Jared Adams told Jane's that the agency is contributing USD146 million to the programme. Boeing spokeswoman Cheryl Sampson declined to say the amount of Boeing's investment. Once the spaceplane, called Phantom Express, reaches the edge of space, it would deploy the second stage and return to earth. It would then land on a runway to be prepared for its next flight by applying operational and maintenance principles similar to modern aircraft. DARPA said it formally selected Boeing to progress to phases 2 and 3 of the programme: fabrication and flight. Phase 2 includes design, construction, and testing of the technology demonstration vehicle through 2019. It calls for initially firing the vehicle's engine on the ground 10 times in 10 days to demonstrate propulsion readiness for flight tests. Phase 3 objectives include 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020. After multiple shakedown flights to reduce risk, the XS-1 would aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first, without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5. Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10 and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 lb (408.2 kg) and 3,000 lb (1,360.8 kg) into LEO. Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems did not respond to requests for comment. Want to read more?

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced today (May 24) it had selected Boeing for the next phase of its XS-1 project, known as the Experimental Spaceplane, after an intense competition among aerospace companies. The XS-1 is aimed to be a completely reusable military space plane capable of launching 3,000-lb. (1,360 kilograms) satellites into orbit 10 times in 10 days. The spacecraft could dramatically reduce the cost of launches to $5 million per flight, DARPA officials said. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," DARPA program manager Jess Sponable said in a statement. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 — fabrication and flight." [DARPA's Experimental XS-1 Space Plane in Pictures] The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has picked Boeing to design and build the XS-1 military space plane, a robotic spacecraft for launching small satellites. Boeing's design, called Phantom Express, is shown here in an artist's concept. Credit: Boeing Phase 2 of the XS-1 program will have Boeing design, build and test a technology demonstration vehicle by 2019, according to the DARPA statement. A ground-based engine test will be included, to show the feasibility of firing the engine 10 times in 10 days, DARPA officials said. The first test launches will begin with Phase 3, which aims to launch the XS-1 between 12 and 15 times in 2020. "After multiple shakedown flights to reduce risk, the XS-1 would aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5," DARPA officials wrote in a statement. "Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds [400 to 1,360 kg] into low Earth orbit." (Mach 5 means five times the speed of sound, which equates to 3,806 mph, and Mach 10, or 10 times the speed of sound, is 7,612 mph.) Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 design beat out concepts by two other teams: a partnership of Masten Space Systems and XCOR Aerospace, and the team of Northrop Grumman and Virgin Galactic. Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 space plane design is shown in launch position in this artist's concept. The autonomous spacecraft is designed to launch vertically, deploy a second stage payload in orbit and return to Earth for a runway landing. Credit: Boeing The Phantom Express XS-1 is designed to launch to the edge of space, and deploy a piggyback-mounted second stage that would carry a satellite the rest of the way into orbit. The space plane would then return to Earth to make a runway landing. The XS-1 will launch vertically using an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine fueled with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The AR-22 engine is a version of main engines that were used to power NASA's space shuttles, Boeing representatives said in a statement. The Phantom Express will be built by Boeing's Phantom Works division, which also built the two robotic X-37B space planes that are currently in use by the U.S. Air Force for classified missions. The reusable X-37B space planes have flown four missions to date, each longer than the last, with the latest mission (called OTV-4) landing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on May 7 after 718 days in orbit. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a separate statement. DARPA officials said the rapid-turnaround goal of the XS-1 space plane and the technologies that make it possible won't benefit just the U.S. military. DARPA will publicly release some of its results from the Phase 2 and 3 trials, and share payload specifications for interested commercial companies, agency officials said. "We're delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality," Brad Tousley, director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office, which oversees the XS-1 project, said in the DARPA statement, "Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities."

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT MACHINES DARPA and Boeing developing experimental, hypersonic space drone by Colm Gorey 2 hours ago1 Share The XS-1 space drone. Image: Still from ‘Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) Phase 2/3 Concept Video’. Image: DARPA/YouTube DARPA is teaming up with Boeing to produce an experimental space drone to speed up satellite deployment. The cost of sending payloads into orbit is rapidly decreasing, with companies such as SpaceX unveiling new rockets capable of landing after launch, to be used again. However, the cost of sending satellites and astronauts is still considered quite high and, more importantly, time-consuming. That is why DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and Boeing have revealed plans to develop a new craft that would, for all intents and purposes, be a ‘space plane’. The Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) programme will look to build the first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that could – on short notice – take off, deploy satellites or other cargo, and return to a runway on Earth. This, DARPA said, would drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to complete a mission from years or months, to just a matter of days. The XS-1 would be a fully reusable uncrewed vehicle – similar in size to a modern business jet – and would take off vertically like a rocket, flying to hypersonic speeds using its engine powered by self-contained cryogenic propellant. When it deploys its payload of up to 1,400kg, the craft could return to Earth and be ready for use again within a matter of hours. Neither an aircraft nor a rocket After the first XS-1 prototype is built, DARPA and Boeing plan to fly the craft 10 times in 10 days to see if it can manage the rigours of regular spaceflight, with its hybrid, composite-metallic wings and control surfaces capable of withstanding 1,000 degrees Celsius. Envisioning a future using the XS-1, the pair of developers believe each of the payload deliveries would cost $5m at most, considerably less than what the US military spends on space missions today. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional aeroplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but, rather, a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of 10 and replacing today’s frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” said Jess Sponable, DARPA programme manager. The first technology demonstration is scheduled to take place in 2019, before a series of test flights some time in 2020.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Space Environment Health Nature Archaeology Science Space How Boeing plans to build Darpa's first hypersonic spacecraft The spaceplane will fly unmanned to high altitudes above Earth. By Agamoni Ghosh May 25, 2017 10:39 BST Darpa has finally picked Boeing to turn its first hypersonic spaceplane into a reality. Dubbed the Phantom Express, it will be a combination of a traditional aeroplane and space launch vehicle aimed at sending satellites into orbit at low costs. The upcoming supersonic plane is part of the agency's Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) programme. It will be designed to take off vertically and fly unmanned to high altitudes above the Earth. Once it reaches high suborbital altitude, the vehicle will release a mini-rocket or a booster fitted with an engine that can propel a satellite weighing up to 3,000 pounds into polar orbit. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the programme and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 — fabrication and flight," said Jess Sponable, Darpa programme manager, in a statement. The Plan While Phase 1 included conceptualising and propagating the idea of the space vehicle, Phase 2 will include design, construction, and testing of the technology demonstration vehicle all through 2019. Phase 3 will include 12 to 15 flight tests scheduled for 2020. After multiple tests are conducted, the XS-1 will aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and later with a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. No Blue Origin Although Boeing had paired up with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin for the first phase, it has decided to go with a different company to make the propulsion system for its spaceplane. The vehicle will now use an AR-22 engine, manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne. The AR-22 is similar to the type of engine used to power a Space Shuttle. The US military has been expanding its space research significantly in the past few years. Last month, the secret US Air Force plane named X-37B, that spent over 700 days in space, came back to Earth raising speculation about its real objective. Many believe the US military may be deploying spy satellites or even weaponised ones to take down satellites of other countries.

Boeing and US military to build new hypersonic XS-1 ‘Phantom Express’ plane that will help government perform top secret operations in SPACE New unmanned craft the size of a passenger jet will 'bolster national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space' By Jasper Hamill 25th May 2017, 10:10 am Updated: 25th May 2017, 10:28 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments THE US Military has agreed to pay Boeing more than £100 million to build an experimental hypersonic place which will allow secret space missions to be launched on a daily basis. Boeing has dubbed the pioneering new spaceship the “Phantom Express”, but the military’s top research wing refers to it as the XS-1. Boeing 6 This artist’s impression shows the Phantom Express on its launch pad on Earth’s surface Boeing will be given $146 million (£112 million) to build the space plane to a tight specification so it can carry small satellites into orbit at the drop of a hat. The Phantom Express is due to launch in 2020 and was dreamed up by the boffins of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Boeing declined to say how much of its own money it will put into the development of the vehicle. Boeing 6 The space plane will allow missions to be performed on a daily basis Phantom Express is about the size of a business jet. It will take off like a rocket, boost itself beyond the atmosphere and release an expendable second-stage rocket and satellite before turning around and landing like an aeroplane on a runway. DARPA spokesman Jared Adams said the goal of the XS-1 program is to fly 10 flights within ten days. Boeing said it is still evaluating launch sites, but Adams said Phantom Express would fly from Cape Canaveral, where two other Boeing space programs are based. 6 The Phantom Express is designed to carry small satellites into orbit Rex Features 6 The Boeing X-37B, an American robotic spacecraft which has spent years on a secret mission up in space Boeing also built the military’s X-37B robotic space planes. The vehicles, which resemble miniature space shuttles, recently set the record for the longest time spent in space after spending almost two years completing a classified mission in orbit. The spaceship, one of two in the Air Force fleet, conducted mysterious classified experiments for more than 700 days while in orbit.

The vehicle will be powered by a liquid-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, which is based on the now-retired space shuttle main engine. The space plane is designed to loft satellites weighing up to 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) into low-altitude orbits around Earth. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

Rietkerk has been with the company since the Everett plant was built in 1967. (Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog 50 history-making years of building Boeing jets in Everett Dan Catchpole Mon May 22nd, 2017 12:04pm BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Photo gallery: 50 years of Boeing at Paine Field in Everett EVERETT — Bill Rietkerk picked up his college diploma from the University of Washington’s aeronautical engineering program on a Saturday in 1966. The next Monday, he started work at Boeing’s Renton plant. The 23-year-old was one of 50,000 workers hired by the company in the mid-1960s. Boeing was booming. It had roared into the Jet Age with the 707 and then the 727. A few months after Rietkerk started, Boeing’s Lunar Orbiter sent back the first photographs of the Moon. The entire industry was busy turning the day’s science fiction into tomorrow’s reality. “It was a thrilling time” for a young engineer, Rietkerk said. The year he graduated, Boeing committed to make a jetliner to dwarf every other passenger plane in the sky. The 747 was expected to carry more than 350 passengers between continents, making it about two-and-a-half times bigger than the largest airliners of the day, the 707 and the Douglas DC-8. The company would need a massive factory to make the mammoth plane. That need brought Boeing — and Rietkerk — to Everett, where the company developed jets that revolutionized air travel. This May 1 marked 50 years since jetliner production began at the plant, which was far from finished at the time. The factory floor was still dirt. Mechanics, engineers, analysts and other workers wore hardhats while construction continued all around. The iconic jumbo was just the beginning for Boeing Everett. All of the company’s big, twin-aisle airplanes — the 747, 767, 777 and 787 — were developed at the sprawling plant. Each has dramatically influenced how airplanes are made, how airlines operate and how people fly. “It’s hard to think of a more influential factory anywhere,” said Kevin Michaels, head of AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Michigan. More than 60 percent of the twin-aisle jets flying now were made in Everett. When Boeing decided to make its new jetliner, the 777X, and the plane’s advanced composite-material wings, in Everett, the company ensured the plant would continue to shape the world and push technological boundaries. Long runway Boeing could easily have ended up elsewhere to make the 747. The company needed a site with rail, roads and a long runway. By early 1966, Boeing property managers’ short list included Everett, McChord Air Force Base and Walnut Creek, California. The engineer tapped to design the jumbo, Joe Sutter, balked at the idea of moving production to California. “I told them it would be a big disaster,” he said in an interview with The Daily Herald in 2015. He died last year. “We had 29 months to roll an airplane out, and if I was going to spend 25 percent of my time running between here and California, when the hell would I help design the airplane?” Boeing leaders expected the 747 would soon be surpassed by faster passenger jets. So, designers emphasized its use as a cargo plane and put the flight deck on top of the fuselage, giving the 747 its defining hump. As company leaders considered where to build the jumbo, The Daily Herald’s owner and publisher at the time, Robert Best, set out to woo the company to Paine Field. He then headed the commission which oversaw the Snohomish County-owned airport. Best and airport director George Petrie pitched Everett to Boeing president Bill Allen, who interrupted them. “He said they had already optioned about 700 acres. Bob and I looked at each other in amazement,” Petrie said. “We had no idea Boeing was thinking that big.” Local officials pledged to do whatever was needed to land the factory, which Boeing expected would employ about 15,000 people. Today, roughly 40,000 people work at the sprawling plant and office buildings. The area was covered by dense forest. As workers cleared trees and levelled the rolling terrain in the spring of 1966, they occasionally had to chase off bears, Sutter said. On Jan. 3, 1967, the first 113 Boeing workers arrived onsite. A Boeing executive welcomed the group, calling them the “Incredibles.” The nickname stuck and became a source of pride for the thousands of workers involved in creating the 747. They did it with slide rules and hand-drawn schematics, with rivet guns and soldering irons, and with a relentless focus through long hours, day after day. The program manager, Mal Stamper, took off one day — a single Christmas — during the years the 747 was in development. Later that year, Rietkerk joined the 747 program. His job was to ensure the parts designed by the myriad engineering teams could all fit together inside the plane. Without digital design programs, he and other engineers installed prototypes in a full-size 747 mockup, housed in the first building completed on site. When he first stepped inside the building, the size and towering height of the polished-aluminum body stopped him. At Renton, the 707 was the biggest jet he had seen. “I hadn’t realized the scope of the project” until that moment, he said. “My reaction was ‘Wow, this is going to be something to pull off.’” The first 747, dubbed the “City of Everett,” taxied onto the main runway at Paine Field for its maiden flight on Feb. 9, 1969. Rietkerk and a couple other engineers snuck onto the factory roof and watched from a catwalk near the air traffic control tower perched above the plant. Powered by revolutionary engines from Pratt & Whitney, the jumbo started rolling — slowly at first. The 747 picked up speed and gracefully lifted into the air. The plane’s size made it look like it was floating more than flying, he said. “The airplane’s flying beautifully!” Boeing test pilot Brien Wygle said over the radio. Less than a year later, a Pan Am 747 carried passengers across the Atlantic Ocean for the first time. Air travel would never be the same. Boom, bust and beyond Boeing’s booming 1960s went bust by the decade’s end. An economic downturn, high fuel prices and other changes forced the company to lay off tens of thousands of workers. “It was devastating,” Rietkerk recalled. His group of 240 engineers dwindled to 35. As Boeing stumbled, a rival arrived. Several faltering European aerospace companies collaborated to create Airbus, which saw its first airplane, the A300, take flight in late 1972. It passed without much notice in Everett. “We didn’t perceive what a strong competitor they would become,” he said. Boeing had recovered by the late 1970s, and its workforce swelled as airplane production picked up again. While the days of The Incredibles were over, there was still a sense of purpose in the Everett plant, recalled Bonnie Grisim, who had joined Boeing in 1969. “We had huge Christmas parties,” she told the Herald in 2016. The plant shut down and tables were set up in the aisles. “Everyone brought food, and managers were in charge of turkeys and hams,” Grisim said. “We warmed the food in the paint-booth ovens.” The plant grew as Boeing added new airplane assembly lines, starting with a 20-acre expansion for the twin-aisle 767 in the late 1970s. The 767 started an evolution still underway in aviation today. The smaller twin-jet initially was designed for mid-range routes too small for a jumbo and too big for a 707. However, later upgrades extended its range, and airlines used it to pioneer new point-to-point Transatlantic routes. That began a decades-long shift away from hub airports for more direct flights, aerospace analyst Scott Hamilton said. In the early 1990s, Boeing butted heads with local officials over its plan to add another 36 acres of factory space for its new 777. “Were there issues? Sure, there were,” former Boeing Everett manager Jim Johnson said in 2006. He managed the plant from 1988 to 1993. Company leaders had not looped in local leaders, who were caught off guard, he said. In response, they told the company it would have to cover $50 million for the additional sewers, roadwork and other work needed by the larger workforce. Eventually, the two sides reached an agreement. Since then, Boeing has developed a closer relationship with key state and local leaders, who have been keen to keep happy the engine driving the local economy. Launched in 1990, the 777 revolutionized how airplanes are developed. It was the first jet designed entirely with computers. Its tail was made mostly from composite materials, which made up about 12 percent of the material on the airplane. That was up from the 2 or 3 percent on earlier Boeing jetliners. “Boeing didn’t just hang composite panels on metal frames,” as other airplane makers did at the time, said Kevin Michaels with AeroDynamic Advisory. The plane’s designers used the new digital design tools to create all-composite structures, which maximized their benefit, he said. The 777 first flew in 1994. Less than a year later, it carried passengers across the Atlantic. From day one, the 777 was a workhorse of long-haul travel, a niche it still dominates. “Boeing did all that in four years,” he said. “Think about where we are today. My gosh, even the 737 MAX (an upgrade of an existing plane) is taking years.” In 2003, Boeing set out to again revolutionize air travel with the 787. It pushed technological boundaries in its design, materials, avionics and even its supply chain. Anxious to see 787 production land in Washington, state and local leaders jumped into action. Lucrative tax breaks, streamlined permitting processes, transportation investments and other incentives followed. At the end of the year, Boeing announced the plane would be assembled in Everett. Some of the changes proved more than Boeing and its suppliers could handle. The 787 was bogged down by supply and design problems that have cost Boeing billions of dollars. However, the plane has continued the evolution that the 767 began, allowing airlines to bypass hub airports for more direct flights. Boeing makes more airplanes now at Everett than it did 20 years ago. However, the company’s decision to move its corporate headquarters and to put a second 787 assembly line in South Carolina, unnerved the region, convincing many that the company was rushing to leave the state. In 2013, the company publicly considered putting production of its new 777X outside Washington. Lawmakers responded with the biggest state tax break in U.S. history, a deal worth an estimated $8.7 billion over 16 years, and members of the Machinists union approved a concession-laden contract. Critics called Boeing’s behavior a shakedown, while supporters said it was merely the reality of global competition. Still amazed Rietkerk still works at Everett, now on the 767 program. Commercial demand for the jet is waning, but it continues to change aviation as the KC-46 Pegasus, the most advanced aerial refueling military tanker. Boeing expects to hand over the first tanker to the U.S. Air Force by the end of 2017. During a recent walk in the factory, Rietkerk paused below a 747 and looked up to the flight deck perched high overhead. “It still amazes me,” the 73-year-old said. Boeing is working on the future today with its 777X, its composite wing production and new automated production systems. Making the airplane’s advanced, composite-material wings at the plant ensures Everett will be on the forefront of the industry for years to come. “Wings are changing very significantly. They are much thinner and more complex than ever,” Michaels said. “You almost can’t make them out of anything but composites anymore.” That could make Everett a front-runner when Boeing considers where to make its next new jetliner. Increasing automation means fewer workers will be needed to make those planes. Nonetheless, the plant’s success will depend on having talented workers, Boeing Commercial Airplanes vice president Kathy Moodie said. She runs operations at the Everett plant. There is plenty of work to be had. Aviation consulting firm Flight Ascend expects that 7,960 twin-aisle aircraft will be needed in the next 20 years. Boeing estimates the market is worth $2.8 trillion. Winning that work for Everett will depend on the same fundamental factors that drove its success half a century ago, she said. “My top concerns right now are affordability, efficiency, safety and getting that next group of talent in here,” Moodie said. “In 50 years, the person sitting here is going to say, ‘My number-one concerns are remaining competitive, affordable, building the best airplanes in the safest way and keeping the talent coming into the Boeing Co.” Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com; Twitter: @dcatchpole.   The Boeing assembly plant in Everett is adorned with a set of murals that set a Guinness world record.

The project, known as XS-1, is expected to debut in 2020. Boeing declined to say how much it will put into development of the vehicle, which it calls Phantom Express, with Darpa, which is an agency under the US Department of Defence. About the size of a business jet, Phantom Express will take off like a rocket, boost itself beyond the atmosphere and release an expendable second-stage rocket and satellite, then turn around and land like an airplane on a runway. The Darpa-Boeing venture joins a race to design a generation of reusable launch vehicles designed to cut the cost of putting payloads into space. Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Blue Origin, a venture backed by Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, are working on reusable launch vehicles. “The reusable first stage … would be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours,” Darpa spokesman Jared Adams wrote in an email. The goal of the XS-1 program is to fly 10 flights within 10 days. Boeing said it is still evaluating launch sites, but Darpa’s Adams said Phantom Express would fly from Cape Canaveral, where two other Boeing space programs are based. The company took over one of the hangars used by Nasa’s now-retired space shuttles for a commercial space taxi that will ferry astronauts and potentially paying passengers to and from the International Space Station. The first flight of Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner is scheduled for next year. Two other former shuttle hangers house a pair of Boeing-built robotic spaceplanes developed and operated under the Air Force’s X-37B program. The vehicles, which resemble miniature space shuttles, have made four flights so far, the last of which ended on May 8 after a secretive two-year mission. Unlike the X-37B which is launched aboard an expendable rocket, Phantom Express will get itself into space. The vehicle will be powered by a liquid-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, which is based on the now-retired space shuttle main engine. An upper-stage motor for Phantom Express has not yet been announced. The spaceplane is designed to loft satellites weighing up to 1.4 tonnes into low-altitude orbits around Earth.

The Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program is designed to give the US the ability to launch stuff fast, in order to “revolutionize the Nation’s ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent.” The XS-1 design selected by DARPA will see Boeing construct a spaceplane “roughly the size of a business jet”. The vehicle will take off like a rocket using the Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, thruster derived from the Space Shuttle's main engine. The AR-22 is designed to offer 500,000 lbf of thrust. Once the AR-22 gets the XS-1 to “high suborbital altitude” a rocket that piggybacks the spaceplane will take over and carry a “deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit.” The rocket won't be used again, but the XS-1 will land like a conventional aircraft and be ready for another launch “potentially within hours.” The XS-1 will be hypersonic, thanks to what Boeing calls “third-generation thermal protection” that can take the heat of faster-than-sound flight. Boeing won the gig after convincing DARPA it has the tech and know-how to build planes that can take a beating and still turn around fast. The plan is for “easily accessible subsystem components” to be used, so that new bits can be swapped in quickly and easily, while the XS-1 is expected to use “Hybrid composite-metallic wings and control surfaces” which sounds rather like the kind of stuff Boeing packs into both military and civilian aircraft. And of course its mysterious X-37B spaceplane. DARPA's given the XS-1 a tight schedule. By 2019 it's hoped the vehicle's engines can be tested ten times in ten days. First flights have been scheduled for 2020, with 12-15 tests expected including ten on ten consecutive days. The first few flights would be shakedowns, but then tests would require payload-free operation at up to Mach 5. The last flights in the series would fly at up to Mach 10 “and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit.” At the end of the tests it's hoped the US possesses a platform capable of launching satellites at US$5m a pop. That's nicely priced given that at the small end of the space business Vector Space Systems thinks it can launch 60kg (130 pounds) for $1.5m and SpaceX's $62m base price can buy you 50,265 pounds of freight in low earth orbit or 18,300 pounds in geosynchronous transfer orbit. ® Tips and corrections 35 Comments MORE DARPA Boeing Space Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Self-driving car devs face 6-month backlog on vital $85,000 LIDAR kit Analysis So you wanna build a robo-ride?

Most Popular DARPA By Jay Bennett May 24, 2017 DARPA announced today that it has selected Boeing to design and build a new reusable, hypersonic spaceplane called the Phantom Express that would fly into high suborbital altitudes to launch satellites into orbit before coming back down to land horizontally like an airplane. The unmanned craft, part of the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program, would release a small expendable upper stage rocket after it reaches suborbital altitudes. The upper stage would continue to carry the payload to orbit while the first stage—the spaceplane itself—would bank and return to Earth to land on a runway. DARPA hopes the XS-1 will allow the Department of Defense to launch satellites into low Earth orbit with only a few days' notice, compared to the months it currently takes to plan satellite launches, and that the spaceplane will be capable of landing and relaunching within hours. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager, in a press release. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3—fabrication and flight." Unlike the Air Force's X-37B unmanned spaceplane that launches on top of an Atlas V rocket, the XS-1 will launch vertically on its own internal engines using cryogenic propellants—liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The Phantom Express, roughly the size of a business jet, would fly to hypersonic speeds over Mach 5 to reach high suborbital altitudes before releasing the satellite-launching second stage to carry a payload up to 3,000 pounds the rest of the way to low Earth orbit. Phase 2 of the Experimental Spaceplane program covers design, construction, and testing of the craft, including 10 test fires of the propulsion system over 10 days to demonstrate the system is robust enough for quick turnaround launches. Phase 2 is expected to last through 2019. Then the defense agency along with Boeing hope to begin flight tests in 2020 during Phase 3. A total of between 12 and 15 test flights are tentatively planned, with the first few conducted as shakedown flights to extensively test the spaceplane. After those initial flights are completed, DARPA wants to launch the XS-1 10 times in 10 days, culminating with a flight carrying the upper-stage satellite delivery system. Concept image of DARPA's XS-1 experimental spaceplane, to be built by Boeing and slated to achieve first flight by 2020. YouTube DARPA If the program is successful, DARPA predicts the XS-1 could operate with costs under $5 million per launch. The XS-1 will make use of Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engines—modified Space Shuttle main engines—composite materials for propellant tanks, autonomous flight control technologies, and hybrid composite-metallic wings and surfaces to withstand the high stress of hypersonic flight and temperatures as high as 2,000º F. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," said Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, in a press release. In addition to providing launch services to the military, DARPA plans to share key design specifications for the XS-1 with commercial spaceflight companies. The defense agency stated that it is a goal to facilitate the commercial sector to take advantage of XS-1 technologies to reduce launch costs across the board. In the next couple years we could see some engine test fires, and then come 2020, if all goes according to plan, the first ship in the Experimental Spaceplane program will take to the skies.

On Wednesday, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced that Boeing will continue to work with them on the next phase of their Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. The goal of the program is to build an autonomous aircraft that’s capable of launching into orbit 10 times over the course of 10 days by 2020. DARPA has picked a design for its Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) and awarded Phases 2 & 3 of the program to @Boeinghttps://t.co/lJmGc2TNHwpic.twitter.com/Dcr7LZQbMb— DARPA (@DARPA) May 24, 2017 “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two,” Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager, said in a news release. Roughly the size and weight of a modern business jet, the spaceplane, known as the Phantom Express, will be able to take off vertically like a rocket and fly at hypersonic speeds. The current design of the Phantom Express does not include external boosters like a modern spaceship. It will be powered by an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants. “This engine has a demonstrated track record of solid performance and proven reusability,” Eileen Drake, president and CEO of Aerojet Rocketdyne, said in a statement. Once in space, the Phantom Express will be capable of deploying a small satellite weighing up to 3,000 pounds into low-Earth orbit, according to a news release from Boeing.  On the journey back to Earth, the space plane will land horizontally on a runway, where it can be prepared for the next flight “potentially within hours,” according to DARPA. DARPA says the design of the Phantom Express will bring the cost of a launch down to $5 million, ten times lower than current costs. Boeing has been working with DARPA and two other companies on phase one of the XS-1 project, which involved the development and concept of the design. Now, only the aerospace company will continue to work with the agency on phases two and three, beginning with the construction phase. After the construction, DARPA and Boeing plan to conduct 10 launches over a period of 10 days to demonstrate the cost efficiency and reliability of the Phantom Express. The project is scheduled to begin conducting flight tests in 2020.

While DARPA’s goal for the project is focused on bolstering “national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space,” they are also encouraging companies to invest in the spaceflight technology. The agency says they intend to “release selected data from its Phase 2/3 tests and will provide to all interested commercial entities the relevant specs for potential payloads.” “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Boeing, DARPA building unmanned hypersonic spaceplane “Phantom Express” Boeing, DARPA building unmanned hypersonic spaceplane “Phantom Express” May 25, 2017, 2:17 AM BST | Written by Joseph Nordqvist | Boeing has been selected by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to build an experimental unmanned hypersonic spaceplane called the Phantom Express. The project is part of the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. The Phantom Express will be an autonomous, reusable aircraft designed to launch small satellites into low Earth orbit. The goal is for it to provide a faster and more affordable way of small satellite launches compared to conventional methods. Source: Boeing “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” said Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works. The Phantom Express is being designed to reach the edge of space and deploy small expendable upper stage to launch small (3,000 pound/1,361 kg) satellites. It would return to Earth after deploying the satellites and land on a runway “to be prepared for its next flight by applying operation and maintenance principles “similar to modern aircraft.” The spaceplane will be powered by an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine, which uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fuel. Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO Eileen Drake said in a news release that the AR-22 “has a demonstrated track record of solid performance and proven reusability.” “As threats to our nation’s space systems increase, it is imperative that we have the ability to rapidly deploy replacement assets,” Drake said. “This demonstration program is vitally important to maintaining assured access to space, which remains a top priority for our nation.” Boeing and DARPA are planning to carry out a demonstration of 10 flights over 10 days during the test phase of the program.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Back in November, when the Liberal government announced it would be making an “interim” purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing, it was all about the need for speed. There wasn’t time to hold an “open competition” to select a permanent replacement for the air force’s aging fleet of CF-18s, as the Liberals had promised during the election. The reason: the government had discovered a critical “capability gap” in our air defences that had to be filled at once. Well, here we are in May, and the Super Hornets that were supposedly so urgently necessary to the defence of our national borders turn out to be just another in the apparently endless list of pawns to be sacrificed in pursuit of the Trudeau government’s real and only strategic objective, propping up Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. Billions of dollars in direct and indirect aid to Bombardier, from both the federal and Quebec governments, having met with the entirely predictable response from its competitors — not only a suit before the World Trade Organization on behalf of Brazil’s Embraer, but latterly a complaint to the U.S. Commerce department by Boeing, demanding retaliatory duties of nearly 160 per cent — the government has now taken the unprecedented step of tying an important procurement decision to the outcome of a private trade dispute. “Canada is reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing,” Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland declared last week, adding: “Our government will defend the interests of Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace industry and our aerospace workers.” As if the implied threats were not quite heavy-handed enough, Canada’s ambassador to Washington, David MacNaughton, volunteered his opinion that Boeing, by availing itself of the remedies for alleged unfair trade practices prescribed under the laws of the United States, was guilty of “lousy customer relations.” Nice little fighter-jet deal you got there. Pity if anything should happen to it. The particulars of the dispute, we should be clear, are not the issue. Whatever the technical definition of an illegal export subsidy, there is no doubt that Bombardier is the beneficiary of government subsidy — many of them, in fact. Neither is there much disagreement that last year’s sale of 75 CSeries passenger jets to Delta — at a substantial loss — would not have been possible, for a company that was deep in debt and rapidly running out of cash, without the timely arrival of $1.3 billion in aid from the government of Quebec. Bombardier does not even bother to deny much of this. It says only that the scale of the support, and the discount on the planes, was not unusual or out of bounds, in an industry in which all of the players, including Boeing, are heavily subsidized. Which is true. It doesn’t make any side’s subsidy any smarter — indeed, that all sides are subsidizing each other’s jets to a draw only makes the stupidity of the whole exercise more obvious. Neither is the folly of one government’s subsidy made less by another’s tariff. Rather than punish Delta for exploiting Bombardier’s weakness, the U.S. government would be better advised to take the Quebec taxpayers’ money and run. So everyone’s in the wrong. That’s not the point. The point, rather, is that the government of Canada seems willing to escalate a dispute between two private companies into an all-out trade war — one that, as by far the smaller partner, we are in no position to win. If there is any country that has an interest in a rules-based approach to resolving trade disputes, it is us. If the U.S. is abusing its own trade laws, there are other and better remedies available to us than cancelling procurement deals, whether through NAFTA or the WTO. If it is not — if it is we who are in the wrong, legally speaking — all the more reason not to do so. It’s not clear what the government’s end game is. Suppose our bluff is called — Boeing refuses to withdraw its complaint, the relevant U.S. authorities find in its favour, the tariffs are applied. Is it really ready to nix the Super Hornets deal in response? Perhaps it is. The “interim” purchase has been almost universally criticized by military experts as an expensive distraction: what is needed, nearly everyone agrees, is to get started on acquiring a permanent replacement fleet. The “capability gap” was a transparent invention: the underlying rationale, that we had to be ready to meet all of our NATO and NORAD obligations simultaneously, had never previously been part of defence doctrine. Related F-35 jets waiting in wings as Liberals’ ‘interim’ Super Hornet purchase in limbo Ottawa hints Boeing shouldn’t take military contracts for granted in trade spat with Bombardier ‘Stand up for American companies’: Bombardier and Boeing clash at trade hearing in Washington Absolutely nothing stands in the way, in other words, of the government going ahead with the promised competition — nothing, except the Liberals’ other, and contradictory, promise that the Lockheed F-35 favoured by the previous Conservative government would not be part of it. But a truly open competition would expose the government to the embarrassing risk that the F-35, against which the Liberals had inveighed to much political effect, might win. So: put off the competition until after the next election, using the interim purchase as a pretext. If it costs $12 billion, all in, for planes that would likely be junked in 10 years, well, what price power? But now the Liberals have dragged one costly policy misstep into the midst of another, trapping themselves in yet another fork of their own making. Either the Super Hornets are an urgently needed stopgap for a glaring deficiency in our military capacity, in which case the Liberals’ clumsy attempt at blackmail, if it does not collapse in humiliation, would trade away national security for the benefit of a failing, but well-connected, private company. Or the planes, contrary to the government’s repeated assurances, were every bit as expendable as they now appear — in which case the Liberals merely broke a key election promise and lied about it. Either way, it seems so unlike them. Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

It says only that the scale of the support, and the discount on the planes, was not unusual or out of bounds, in an industry in which all of the players, including Boeing, are heavily subsidized. Which is true. It doesn’t make any side’s subsidy any smarter — indeed, that all sides are subsidizing each other’s jets to a draw only makes the stupidity of the whole exercise more obvious. Neither is the folly of one government’s subsidy made less by another’s tariff. Rather than punish Delta for exploiting Bombardier’s weakness, the U.S. government would be better advised to take the Quebec taxpayers’ money and run. So everyone’s in the wrong. That’s not the point. The point, rather, is that the government of Canada seems willing to escalate a dispute between two private companies into an all-out trade war — one that, as by far the smaller partner, we are in no position to win. If there is any country that has an interest in a rules-based approach to resolving trade disputes, it is us. If the U.S. is abusing its own trade laws, there are other and better remedies available to us than cancelling procurement deals, whether through NAFTA or the WTO. If it is not — if it is we who are in the wrong, legally speaking — all the more reason not to do so. It’s not clear what the government’s end game is. Suppose our bluff is called — Boeing refuses to withdraw its complaint, the relevant U.S. authorities find in its favour, the tariffs are applied. Is it really ready to nix the Super Hornets deal in response? Perhaps it is. The “interim” purchase has been almost universally criticized by military experts as an expensive distraction: what is needed, nearly everyone agrees, is to get started on acquiring a permanent replacement fleet. The “capability gap” was a transparent invention: the underlying rationale, that we had to be ready to meet all of our NATO and NORAD obligations simultaneously, had never previously been part of defence doctrine. Absolutely nothing stands in the way, in other words, of the government going ahead with the promised competition — nothing, except the Liberals’ other, and contradictory, promise that the Lockheed F-35 favoured by the previous Conservative government would not be part of it. But a truly open competition would expose the government to the embarrassing risk that the F-35, against which the Liberals had inveighed to much political effect, might win. So: put off the competition until after the next election, using the interim purchase as a pretext. If it costs $12 billion, all in, for planes that would likely be junked in 10 years, well, what price power? But now the Liberals have dragged one costly policy misstep into the midst of another, trapping themselves in yet another fork of their own making. Either the Super Hornets are an urgently needed stopgap for a glaring deficiency in our military capacity, in which case the Liberals’ clumsy attempt at blackmail, if it does not collapse in humiliation, would trade away national security for the benefit of a failing, but well-connected, private company. Or the planes, contrary to the government’s repeated assurances, were every bit as expendable as they now appear — in which case the Liberals merely broke a key election promise and lied about it. Either way, it seems so unlike them. Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Almost 25 years since the -3 model started flying on the Boeing 737 Classic, more than 24,000 iterations of the engine are still in service, and it will take nearly another decade for the CFM56’s successor—the CFM Leap—to overtake it in the global fleet. Numbers of the two most popular variants, the CFM56-5B powering the Airbus A320 family and the -7B for the Boeing 737NG series, will continue to grow until 2020, according to Aviation Week’s 2017 Commercial Aviation Fleet & MRO Forecast. CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines, predicts that it will produce roughly 1,400 CFM56 engines this year, 1,000 in 2018, 250 in 2019 and 100 in 2020. Against the Leap, this means that the CFM56’s share of production will decrease from 78% this year, to 51% in 2018, to 11% in 2019 and to 5% in 2020. “Keep in mind that 2017 to 2020 are projections only; the CFM56 product line is still selling,” notesJamie Jewell, CFM’s director of strategic communications. Naturally, CFM takes its cue from narrowbody production at Airbus and Boeing, and particularly the latter, since CFM is the sole engine supplier for the 737NG and 737 MAX. Boeing’s rate of 42 single-aisles per month is dominated by the CFM56-7B-powered 737NG, but by 2020, when 57 will roll out monthly, the majority should be Leap-equipped 737 MAXs. CFM says that CFM56 production peaked in 2016 at 1,665 units, while Aviation Week forecasts that the in-service fleet will top out in 2018 at just under 25,000 engines. Nonetheless, accurate forecasts about engine numbers are tricky, not least because Boeing hasn’t specified its ratio of 737NGs to MAXs going forward. Also, some analysts think that production plans, including Airbus’s rise to 60 narrowbodies per month in 2019, are too aggressive. Slower growth in emerging markets, combined with ongoing cheap fuel could lead to a spate of deferrals for new aircraft, meaning the CFM56 count could stay higher for longer. History suggests how market-leading engines are superseded. In 1997, there were almost 4,000 CFM56-3s flying on 737 Classic aircraft worldwide. The engine was approaching the peak of its popularity, but in the same year the 737NG entered service, sporting a new, more efficient powerplant, the CFM56-7, which became the fastest-selling engine to that date. Production of the older CFM56-3 ceased four years later. Even so, the in-service fleet of -7s only overtook that of -3s in 2005, eight years after the former engine’s introduction. CFM56-3 values fell rapidly after in-service numbers were overtaken by its successor, the CFM56-7. There appear to be parallels between the introductions of the CFM56-7 and the Leap, which were both designed to offer better fuel burn on re-engined variants of popular narrowbodies. CFM expects to complete transition to Leap production in 2020, so -7 production will wind down in roughly the same time as the -3—about four years after the introduction of their successors. However, there also are several reasons why the CFM56-7’s story will not just repeat that of the CFM56-3. First, the newer engine outsold its predecessor almost three to one across a longer production run. Engine values usually start to drop once the population of a new iteration succeeds that of the older, so pricing for the CFM56-7 (and, to a lesser extent, the CFM56-5B) could remain stable for another decade. On the other hand, Leap’s fuel-burn gain of 16% is twice what the -7 offered over the -3. From 2002 to 2008, oil rose from $30 to $145 per barrel, and CFM56-3 values were cut in half. Future oil price inflation could mean a quicker-than-expected demise for the -7.

When the -7 was introduced, its predicted mean time between overhaul was 20,000 hr., but engines operating in clement conditions have lasted up to one-third longer—to the consternation of some MRO providers. Given this reliability and a production rate that peaked only last year, the bow wave of CFM56 overhauls is yet to arrive. CFM56-7 maintenance spending will jump from $3.3 billion to $4.2 billion next year, stabilize until 2022, and then steadily rise to $6.5 billion by 2026, predicts Aviation Week’s 2017 Commercial Aviation Fleet & MRO Forecast. “We are seeing an upward trend for CFM56-5B and -7B shop visits, as more are due for scheduled maintenance, and we expect the trend to continue in the next year or so,” says Choo Han Khoon, executive vice president of engine total support at ST Aerospace. Better-than-predicted reliability and a long production run mean that CFM56-7 maintenance won’t peak until the mid-2020s. Maintenance spending on the A320’s CFM56-5B powerplant will grow less dramatically than on the -7B but is still expected to rise by about one-third in the next 10 years. In contrast, the mature CFM56-3 represents a shrinking market for MRO providers. Rather than overhaul such old engines, many operators decide instead to tear them down for parts or lease-in a replacement that still retains some service life. Aviation Week forecasts that the CFM56-3 fleet will drop to 525 from 1,970 engines by 2026, and that MRO demand will fall to $74 million from $479 million. The Maintenance Market The CFM56 has more MRO options than any other engine. Globally, 42 facilities offer CFM56 overhauls and even Pratt & Whitney maintains its competitor’s powerplant. Unlike widebody engine OEMs, CFM has not tried to dominate the aftermarket, so a healthy mix of independent MROs, airline affiliates and OEMs all offer services. This deep market helps keep maintenance prices down and is, according to lessors, a major factor behind the enduring residual values of CFM56-5 and -7 engines. CFM has promised to keep maintenance costs for the Leap at a similar level to the -7 and -5. This should ease the transition from CFM56 to Leap, although wavering buyers will pay close attention to the reliability of the new powerplant, which incorporates several new technologies. That said, more than half of Leap engines have been sold with an OEM maintenance contract, a much higher proportion than for the CFM56. CFM Services, which provides the maintenance, is now a joint effort between Safran and GE; the two manufacturing partners once competed in the CFM56 aftermarket. The OEMs service about one-third of the global CFM56 fleet. Such changes might not bode well for MRO pricing. Discussing Rolls-Royce’s ubiquitous TotalCare contracts, one customer tells Inside MRO: “We can’t tell if it is a good offer or not because there’s nothing to compare it with.” Nonetheless, the sheer volume of Leap orders, now over 12,000, should ensure that independent MRO providers will eventually develop the needed overhaul capabilities.  Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

  U.S. to build hypersonic spaceplane that can fly 10 times in 10 days                Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo   Source: Xinhua | 2017-05-25 03:41:10 | Editor: huaxia Phantom Express is envisioned as a highly autonomous experimental spaceplane, shown preparing to launch its expendable second stage on the top of the vehicle in this artist's concept. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is collaborating with Boeing to fund development of the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. (Xinhua/Boeing Rendering) WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced Wednesday it has selected Boeing company to design, build and test the first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would be able to fly 10 times in 10 days. The unmanned vehicle, known as Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1), roughly the size of a business jet, would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speed. But unlike the U.S. military's X-37B spaceplane that launches with an external booster, it would be powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants, the DARPA said in a statement. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the spaceplane would release an expendable upper stage that is able to deploy a 3,000-pound (1,360-kilogram) satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. Currently, months or years of preparation is needed to send a single satellite into orbit. According to the DARPA, building XS-1 will need significant advances in both technical capabilities and ground operations, but "would revolutionize the Nation's ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent." "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager. Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 design beat out concepts proposed by Masten Space Systems and Northrop Grumman. "Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk," said Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works. Next, Boeing will build and test the technology demonstration vehicle, culminating with 10 test fires of the vehicle's engine on the ground in 10 days to demonstrate propulsion readiness for flight tests in 2019. Then, there would be 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020. After these flights are completed, the DARPA would launch the XS-1 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound. Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds (400 to 1,360 kilograms) into low Earth orbit. If the program is successful, the agency predicted that the XS-1 could operate with costs under five million U.S. dollars per launch, including the cost of an expendable upper stage, which accounts for "a small fraction of the cost of launch systems the U.S. military currently uses for similarly sized payloads."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 26 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman National Safety Council Announces Winners of its Prestigious Green Cross for Safety Awards ITASCA, Ill., May 26, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — The National Safety Council presented its prestigious Green Cross for Safety Awards to individuals and organizations that have helped save lives and prevent injuries. The Council presented the Excellence Award to PotashCorp, the Innovation Award to The Boeing Company and the Advocate Award to Deputy Police Chief Lou Jogmen of the Park Ridge (Ill.) Police Department. National Safety Council leadership and award sponsors recognized each winner during a ceremony on Thursday at Coronado Island in San Diego. „PotashCorp, The Boeing Company and Deputy Chief Jogmen have helped make our world a safer place to work and live,” said Deborah A.P. Hersman, president and CEO of the National Safety Council. „We are proud to honor them and to recognize all the outstanding finalists that share the Council’s goal of eliminating preventable deaths and injuries in our lifetime.” PotashCorp recognized that tools and procedures designed to reduce injuries as a whole do not always affect serious injury and fatality (SIF) rates. To close the gap, PotashCorp developed a system to empower workers to identify potential SIF exposure before an incident and provides training so employees can identify potential problems in routine activities. The approach includes reviewing everyday tasks for risk, integrating injury prevention into all safety processes and following up on all incidents for SIF potential. The Boeing Company developed a fall protection system – the Piranha Lox True Interlock Harness – that disables a work platform if a worker is not properly hooked into his or her Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Falls account for 10 percent of all occupational deaths each year; in more than 75 percent of those fatalities, PPE is available but either not used or used incorrectly. Deputy Chief Lou Jogmen spearheaded the inaugural Illinois Rail Safety Week in 2014 by gathering more than 300 independent police agencies, county sheriff departments, private firms and state agencies to promote public awareness through education, enforcement and rail safety engineering advances. The model has been expanded to other campaigns in Illinois, including distracted driving awareness, and was used to introduce National Rail Safety Week in 2016, co-sponsored by International Association of Chiefs of Police and Operation Lifesaver. The finalists were selected from over 50 applicants reviewed and evaluated by an external panel. Other finalists included Odebrecht Construction, Chatham County, Ga., Tracey Holmberg of Swedish Medical Center in Denver, Colo., and Trenda McPherson of the Florida Motorcycle Safety Coalition in Tallahassee, Fla. Visit greencross.nsc.org for additional information about each winner and finalist. About the National Safety Council Founded in 1913 and chartered by Congress, the National Safety Council, nsc.org, is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to save lives by eliminating preventable deaths at work, in homes and communities, and on the road through leadership, research, education and advocacy.

By Mugambi Mutegi Deep cost-cutting helped Kenya Airways reduce its full-year net loss by more than half to Sh10.2 billion, showing some green shoots of hope for the national carrier, which is however beset by a flagging topline and wider erosion of shareholders' capital. KQ, as the carrier is known by its international code, on Thursday reported a 60.9 per cent drop in its net loss for the 12 months ended March from last year's Sh26.2 billion. The apparent upturn was, however, dampened by a Sh10 billion shrinkage in its turnover to Sh106 billion, while the airline's book value sank Sh9.2 billion more into the negative to Sh44.9 billion, reflecting erosion by years of losses and negative fluctuations on the carrier's mountain of foreign currency denominated loans. "Our operating costs reduced significantly due to the turnaround efforts. We posted an operating profit of nearly Sh900 million compared to a Sh4.1 billion loss last year," KQ chief executive, Mbuvi Ngunze, said when releasing the results. Operating costs dropped by Sh14.9 billion to Sh105.4 billion, with the biggest savings coming from lower fleet ownership costs following the offloading of several aircraft in the year. KQ subleased three Boeing 777s, two Boeing 787s and sold two Boeing 777s, bringing fleet costs down by Sh14 billion to Sh15.5 billion. The offloading was part of Operation Pride, an turnaround strategy for the airline, which includes interventions like balance sheet restructuring, disposal of aircraft and land and laying off of over 100 staff. "We are seeing the first results of our investment in the turnaround," Mr Ngunze added. KQ's bottom line benefited positively from a favourable exchange rate and hedging environment, which despite financing costs remaining high, helped KQ lower its "other costs" 49.6 per cent to Sh11.1 billion. The airline, which is 29.8 owned by the Treasury and 26.7 per cent by Air France-KLM, also booked Sh1.6 billion from the sale of land and aircraft parts such as spare engines. KQ closed the period with lower staff expenses as 288 workers exited the company - through retrenchment and natural attrition-, leaving the employee count at 3,582. Operation Pride, which is being implemented with the help of US consultancy McKinsey, is 72 per cent complete as per the carrier's estimate with the major outstanding issue being completion of the balance sheet restructuring. The turnaround plan has so far cost KQ Sh2.4 billion. "The results are really positive. We have gone through some really tough times but we are coming out. The efforts put in by the KQ management are starting to bear fruit in terms of our operations," said Michael Joseph, KQ's chairman.

05262017Fri                                            English-French IranFocus Home Iran Iran (General) Nuclear Human Rights Women Intelligence Reports Terrorism Exclusive Reports Life in Iran Nuclear Iran & Neighbours Iraq Afghanistan Syria Economy Tehran Grapevine Opinion Iran in the World Press Editorial Op-Ed Multimedia Blog US Treasury Reviewing Iran's Aircraft Licence Details Economy 25 May 2017 Print Email Twitter Iran Focus London, 25 May - The head of the US Treasury Department has revealed that he is reviewing the licenses for Boeing Co and Airbus to sell aircraft to airlines affiliated with the Iranian Regime. On Wednesday, Steven Mnuchin testified before the House of Representatives’ Ways and Means Committee that he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran, Syria and North Korea. He said: “We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria and North Korea to protect American lives. I can assure you that's a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president." Although Mnuchin did not go into detail about the review of the licenses, which were granted as part of the sanctions lifting following the 2015 nuclear deal, he did reveal to the committee that he believes in economic sanctions and that they were the reason Iran came to the negotiating table regarding the nuclear deal. Donald Trump, who recently visited Saudi Arabia and Israel on his inaugural foreign visit, has also been very critical of the Iranian Regime for its links to terrorism and its destructive influence on the Middle East. The Iranian Regime has responded by saying that any attempt to stop the aircraft deals would be in violation of the nuclear deal, but it is unclear whether or not this is true. The Regime claims that most criticisms of them violate the deal, when in fact, it does not. The airline affiliated with the Regime have made deals to buy over 200 aircraft from manufacturers in the US and Europe, which would almost triple their current commercial fleet, and the worry is that these planes would be used to illegally traffic weapons, money, and troops to support terrorist cells like Hezbollah and the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad. If the deal between Boeing and the Iranian airlines is scrapped, this could mean a production halt and a loss of US jobs but national security should be more important. Although the other aircraft manufacturers (Airbus and ATR) that the Iranian airlines have deals with are outside of the US, they are still subject to US licences because they contain American-made parts. Many licenses have already been issued but need to be renewed in 2020, by which time only about a third of Airbus jets will have been delivered. However, US legal experts have reported that the licences can be revoked at any time and that even with deals in place, sanctions could be reintroduced at any time.   Search search Over 150 Members of European Parliament Condemn Fake Elections in Iran Iran - Esfahan.

PHOTO | SALATON NJAU | NMG  In Summary Kenya Airways has reported a 60.9 per cent drop in its net loss for the 12 months ended March from last year’s Sh26.2 billion. Advertisement By MUGAMBI MUTEGI More by this Author Deep cost-cutting helped Kenya Airways reduce its full-year net loss by more than half to Sh10.2 billion, showing some green shoots of hope for the national carrier, which is however beset by a flagging topline and wider erosion of shareholders’ capital. KQ, as the carrier is known by its international code, on Thursday reported a 60.9 per cent drop in its net loss for the 12 months ended March from last year’s Sh26.2 billion. The apparent upturn was, however, dampened by a Sh10 billion shrinkage in its turnover to Sh106 billion, while the airline’s book value sank Sh9.2 billion more into the negative to Sh44.9 billion, reflecting erosion by years of losses and negative fluctuations on the carrier’s mountain of foreign currency denominated loans. “Our operating costs reduced significantly due to the turnaround efforts. We posted an operating profit of nearly Sh900 million compared to a Sh4.1 billion loss last year,” KQ chief executive, Mbuvi Ngunze, said when releasing the results. Operating costs dropped by Sh14.9 billion to Sh105.4 billion, with the biggest savings coming from lower fleet ownership costs following the offloading of several aircraft in the year. KQ subleased three Boeing 777s, two Boeing 787s and sold two Boeing 777s, bringing fleet costs down by Sh14 billion to Sh15.5 billion. The offloading was part of Operation Pride, an turnaround strategy for the airline, which includes interventions like balance sheet restructuring, disposal of aircraft and land and laying off of over 100 staff. “We are seeing the first results of our investment in the turnaround,” Mr Ngunze added. KQ’s bottom line benefited positively from a favourable exchange rate and hedging environment, which despite financing costs remaining high, helped KQ lower its “other costs” 49.6 per cent to Sh11.1 billion. The airline, which is 29.8 owned by the Treasury and 26.7 per cent by Air France-KLM, also booked Sh1.6 billion from the sale of land and aircraft parts such as spare engines. KQ closed the period with lower staff expenses as 288 workers exited the company – through retrenchment and natural attrition-, leaving the employee count at 3,582. Operation Pride, which is being implemented with the help of US consultancy McKinsey, is 72 per cent complete as per the carrier’s estimate with the major outstanding issue being completion of the balance sheet restructuring. The turnaround plan has so far cost KQ Sh2.4 billion. “The results are really positive. We have gone through some really tough times but we are coming out. The efforts put in by the KQ management are starting to bear fruit in terms of our operations,” said Michael Joseph, KQ’s chairman. email print In the headlines IEBC shocker for tainted aspirants Waiguru and Oparanya among nominees in the spotlight.

Lowering the cost of traveling into space is a goal of companies including Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, and the US Air Force. But DARPA is also interested in solving the problem by developing a reusable spaceplane design. That spaceplane is called the Experimental Spaceplane XS-1, and Boeing just won the contract to build it. DARPA's reasons for exploring a reusable spaceplane have been made very clear. The combination of smaller budgets and "proliferating foreign threats to U.S. air and space assets" mean cheap and easy access to space is "essential to enabling new military space capabilities and rapid reconstitution of space systems during crisis." The XS-1 is meant to be a solution to that problem. It's a spaceplane that's easy and cheap to fabricate, capable of carrying a payload weighing up to 3,000 pounds, and costing no more than $5 million per launch. It takes off vertically like a rocket without any external boosters and lands horizontally like an aircraft. DARPA selected Boeing's Phantom Express design with which to move forward and develop a final XS-1 spaceplane. It will be about the same size as a business jet, is fully autonomous, and powered by an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine using liquid oxygen and hydrogen as fuel. During a mission the XS-1 will fly to the edge of space, deploy a second stage, and then return to Earth. Related Boeing Dreamliner Gets $3M Cheaper Thanks to 3D Printing Boeing Dreamliner Gets $3M Cheaper Thanks to 3D Printing Boeing won after Phase 1 of the XS-1 project. Now it must undertake Phase 2 and 3, which cover fabrication of a usable spaceplane and successful flight of that craft. Phase 2 will end in 2019 and requires the completed XS-1 engine firing on the ground 10 times in 10 days. Phase 3 is scheduled to end in 2020, at which time up to 15 test flights will have been carried out including 10 flights in 10 consecutive days. The final flight will see a 3,000 pound payload delivered into a low Earth orbit. During these flights the XS-1 will travel at speeds of up to Mach 5. One side effect of the XS-1 project is its potential impact on the rest of the industry. DARPA intends to share "selected data" from Phase 2 and 3 of the tests with any commercial entities that are interested. It could lead to a revolution in how flight is approached from a design and cost perspective.

The vehicle will be known as the Phantom Express, and the primary purpose will be for deploying nanosatellites into space. The spaceplane uses a unique approach of using a reusable vehicle to leave the atmosphere of the Earth, and then use an expendable upper stage to actually deploy the satellites into orbit. A single stage to orbit spaceplane can take off from a conventional runway, and fly all the way to Earth orbit, which takes about fifty times more energy than just leaving the atmosphere of the Earth. The Phantom Express design smartly uses an upper stage to save on the energy costs. After deploying the upper stage, the spaceplane can return to the Earth and land on a conventional runway. Darryl Davis, president, Boeing Phantom Works says “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk.” Another unique feature of the spaceplane is that it is designed to be highly autonomous. The engine used will be the Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a derivative of the legacy engines used on the Space Shuttles. Boeing and DARPA plan to demonstrate the capabilities of the spaceplane with ten flights in ten days.

Now, the agency has announced it’s partnered with Boeing to manufacture the aircraft by 2020. An artist's impression of the XS-1 spaceplane - DARPA The XS-1 is about the size of a business jet, and uses a takeoff mechanism based on the main engine of the Space Shuttle’s main engine, the Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22. This engine is built to lift the rocket to suborbital altitude, where a secondary engine takes over to lift up to a 1360 kilogram satellite into orbit. The rocket itself will not be reusable, but the XS-1 is designed to land just like a conventional aircraft, and be ready for another launch within hours. The idea is to have an aircraft capable of launching a rocket everyday when necessary. In addition, the XS-1 will also travel at hypersonic speeds, thanks to Boeing’s “third-generation thermal protection”. DARPA and Boeing plan to build the prototype jet in time to carry out ten test flights in ten days, by 2020. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two,” DARPA official Jess Sponable said in a press release, “With the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand.” Don't Miss A Robot Just Landed A Boeing 737 All By Itself And We Should Be Looking For John Connor Already 3.9K SHARES Smartphones Will Be Sold At Big Discounts In June Before GST Starts From July, Analysts Predict 7.1K SHARES BSNL To Launch Satellite Phone Service In India With Call Rates Expected At Rs 35 Per Minute 4K SHARES Mark Zuckerberg Gives A Personal Tour Of His Old Harvard Dorm Room Where He Coded Facebook 2K SHARES Beware!

Sci-Tech by Eric Mack May 24, 2017 10:29 AM PDT @ericcmack Boeing's Phantom Express heads for spaaace. Boeing Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force's super-secretive Boeing-built X-37B space drone came back to Earth after nearly two years in orbit. For its next trick, Boeing plans to collaborate with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to create a new spaceplane that will be less mysterious but just as experimental. The new craft will be called "Phantom Express" and be designed to carry and launch small satellites aboard a plane rather than a rocket. It's kind of like skydiving, but when this plane's passenger gets pushed out the door at the edge of space, it doesn't fall to the ground. After dropping its cargo off in orbit, the plane fires an engine to turn around and return to Earth, landing on a runway to prepare for its next flight, just like a plane or the old space shuttle. In fact, Phantom Express will be equipped with a version of the Space Shuttle main engine, the AR-22 from Aerojet Rocketdyne. DARPA and Boeing will both invest in the development of the new craft and plan to conduct a demonstration of 10 flights over 10 days at some point in the future.

"We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria, and North Korea to protect American lives," Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee. "I can assure you that's a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president," he said, adding that the Trump administration is convinced that sanctions "really work." Mnuchin did not elaborate on the department's review of the aircraft sale licenses, which were issued by the Treasury last year under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities. His statements followed President Donald Trump’s call on Iran to stop funding "terrorists and militias" during a trip this week to the Middle East. The Boeing aircraft sale was the biggest deal for a U.S. business contemplated in the landmark nuclear accord, while the Airbus sales were also among the largest business deals to come out of the agreement. IranAir has agreed to buy 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing and 100 from Airbus. All the aircraft need U.S. licenses because of their reliance on U.S. parts. Most of Iran's aging fleet of 250 commercial planes were purchased before 1979, and only 162 were operational last year, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Iran has said that halting the aircraft sales would breach the nuclear agreement, though some legal experts say the Treasury has the authority to withdraw the licenses. For Boeing, losing the IranAir deal could force it to cut back production of its 777 passenger jetliners. "Boeing continues to follow the lead of the U.S. government with regards to working with Iran's airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon U.S. government approval," a spokeswoman told Reuters by e-mail.

These 7 planes are trying to end Airbus and Boeing's dominance in the skies Benjamin Zhang May 24, 2017, 3:19 PM 255,955 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP The single-aisle airliner market is one of the most lucrative and hotly contested segments in the aviation business. But for the past 15 years, that white-hot competition has almost exclusively been between two companies — Airbus and Boeing.  In recent years, companies from around the world have launched aircraft aimed at breaking the Airbus-Boeing duopoly.  On Monday, China's COMAC and the Russia's United Aircraft Corporation announced a joint venture called the China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation or CRAIC. According to the two companies, the new joint venture will be tasked with developing a new long-range wide-body airliner.  CRAIC is the product of a joint venture agreement signed by COMAC and UAC in June of 2016 with the blessing of Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian president Vladimir Putin.  "We will cooperate sincerely with UAC, unite as one, and strive to make the program a model of Sino-Russian cooperation," COMAC chairman Jin Zhuanglong said in a statement. "We will follow the latest international mainstream airworthiness standards, build more competitive long-range widebody aircraft, and strive to provide customers with better service and make new contributions to the global aviation market." The new JV will be will be based in Shanghai near COMAC's existing facilities and will also produce its future aircraft in the Chinese city.  In addition to the new Sin0-Russia wide-body, there is a slew of state-of-the-art airplanes from around the world designed to challenge Airbus' and Boeing's market dominance.  But before we get to their challengers, let's take a look at the next generation offerings from Airbus and Boeing. View As: One Page Slides Airbus A320neo family Airbus The Airbus A320neo family of airplanes are updated versions of the company's original A320-family with new-generation engines and optimized aerodynamics. The line up of medium-range airliners includes a trio of models — the 160-seat A319neo, the 189-seat A320neo, and the 240-seat A321neo. All three variants can be equipped with modern CFM LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofan engines.  Thus far, Airbus has more than 5,000 orders for the various versions of the A320neo. The first A320neos entered service in early 2016.   Airbus A350XWB Airbus The Airbus A350 XWB or Extra Wide Body is a family of next-generation long-haul widebody airliners. More than 70% of the aircraft is built using carbon composites, titanium, and advanced aluminum alloys. As a result, Airbus claims the A350 delivers 25% lower operating costs, fuel burn, and C02 emissions.   For increased passengers comfort, the cabin of the aircraft is pressurized to 6,000 ft. of altitude.  The A350 can be had in three different versions — the 280-seat Dash 800, the 325-seat Dash 900, and the 366-seat Dash 1000. All versions of the A350 are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB turbofan engines.  The A350 has a maximum range of more than 11,000 miles.  Through April 2017, Airbus has 831 orders for the A350. Eighty-one of the planes are already in service with 12 operators.    Airbus A330neo Airbus The A330neo or New Engine Option is an upgraded version of the existing Airbus A330 with next fuel-efficient engines, a new wing design, and avionics. The A330neo can be had with 257 seats or 287 seats.  All versions of the A330neo will be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 turbofan engines. Through the end of April, Airbus has 210 orders for the A330neo.    Boeing 737 MAX-Series Boeing Like the A320neo, the 737 MAX is the latest version of Boeing's long-serving short-to-medium range airliner that it has been selling for 50 years. For MAX duty, Boeing gave its 737 new engines, wings, avionics, and a slew of other updates. The 737 MAX series is made up of four different variants — the 149-seat 737 MAX7, the 189-seat MAX8, the 200-seat MAX200, and the 220-seat MAX9. The updated 737 is available with new CFM LEAP-1B turbofan engines. Boeing has more than 3,700 orders for the 737MAX and entered service in May.  Boeing 787 Dreamliner Boeing The 787 Dreamliner is a family of next-generation long-range widebody airliners. The carbon-composite Dreamliner is available in three guises  — the 242-seat Dash 8, the 290-seat Dash 9, and the 330-seat Dash 10.  The Boeing 787 is capable of delivering more than 8,700 miles of range while coddling passengers in a cabin optimized for more comfort and reduced jetlag.  Boeing Dreamliners are powered by either General Electric GENx-1B or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.  Through April 2017, Boeing has more than 1,200 orders for the Dreamliner.  Boeing 777X Boeing The Boeing 777X is the latest development of the company's wildly successful 777 family of airliners. Under development, the 777X is expected to replace not only existing versions of the 777 but also Boeing's iconic 747 jumbo jet. The 777X is available in two versions ranging from 350 to 425 seats and will be powered by General Electric GE9X engines. According to industry analysts, the 777X is expected to deliver unit costs lower than that of the Airbus A380 superjumbo.  Through April, Boeing has 306 orders for the 777X, which are expected to enter service in late 2019. Bombardier C-Series Bombardier The Bombardier C-Series is Airbus' and Boeing's most prominent rival. Although the Canadian airplane maker has long been a major player in regional airliners, the C-Series is the first time the company has had to compete against the US and European titans.  The Bombardier airliner has, thus far, struggled to net the level of sales as the 737 and the A320. But the C-Series has garnered critical acclaim for its performance, fuel efficiency, and design.  The C-Series lineup consists of two variants of the plane — the 133-seat CS100 and the 160-seat CS300. In the marketplace, the C-Series competes against the Boeing 737MAX7 and the Airbus A319neo.  Like the A320neo, the C-Series is powered by a version of Pratt & Whitney's revolutionary geared turbofan engines — the PW1500G. The Bombardier C-Series entered commercial service in 2016 and has more than 300 firm orders for the plane.  Embraer E-Jet E2 REUTERS/Nacho Doce Like Bombardier, Embraer is also a major regional airliner powerhouse that's moving up to the big leagues to compete against Airbus and Boeing. Embraer's contender is the second generation of the company's E-Jet called the E2. Even though the first generation airplane made a living mostly with regional airlines, Embraer is marketing the second generation as a smaller alternative to the A319 and the MAX7.  The E2 lineup comprises three variants — the 88-seat E175-E2, the 106-seat E190-E2, and the 132-seat E195-E2.  The E2 is powered by two versions of Pratt & Whitney's geared turbofan engine. The Embraer E-Jet E2 is expected to enter service in 2018. The Brazilian airplane maker currently has roughly 270 orders for its latest jet.  Mitsubishi MRJ REUTERS/Kyodo The Mitsubishi MRJ is Japan's first native commercial airliner in 50 years. The MRJ or Mitsubishi Regional Jet lineup is made up of the 80-seat MRJ70 and the 92-seat MRJ90. Although the MRJ variants are much smaller any of the offerings from Airbus or Boeing, the plane represents a domestic alternative for a country whose airlines have long been one of Boeing's most loyal customers. The MRJ will also be powered by Pratt & Whitney's geared turbofan engine. The Mitsubishi airliner is expected to enter service in 2018. The company currently has more than 220 orders for the MRJ. COMAC ARJ21 AP The COMAC ARJ21 is China's first modern airliner. COMAC or Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, was founded in 2008 to design and produce indigenous airplanes for the country's burgeoning airline industry. According to Boeing, Chinese airlines are expected to order more than 6,300 airplanes over the next 20 years with a total value topping $1 trillion. The ARJ21 is a 90-seat regional airliner designed for short-to-medium range duty. It's powered by a pair of General Electric CF34-10A engines. The Chinese government-owned company currently has almost 350 orders for the plane — mostly from domestic airlines and leasing companies. The ARJ21 entered service in late 2015 . COMAC C919 AP The C919 is COMAC's first mainline jet designed to go head-to-head with the A320neo and the 737 MAX. The 168-seat jet is expected to be powered by a pair of CFM LEAP-1C engines. Thus far, COMAC has 517 orders for the C919 with almost all of them from Chinese operators. The Shanghai-built airliner is expected to make its first flight next year and enter service sometime after 2020. The C919 made its maiden flight in May of 2017.  Irkut MC-21 Irkut The Irkut MC-21 is the latest airliner to emerge from the Russian aviation industry. The MC-21 will be available in two versions — the 165-seat MC-21-200 and the 211-seat MC-21-300. The MC-21 is available with two engine options — the Russian Aviadvigatel PD14 and the American Pratt & Whitney PW1440G geared turbofan. Irkut currently has 175 orders the MC-21— made almost exclusively by Russian airlines and leasing companies. Although Irkut does not have a track record in the commercial aviation space, the company and its Yakovlev subsidiary have a long history building some of the world's elite military aircraft.  In addition, Irkut also manufactures components for the rival Airbus A320.  CRAIC 929 China Daily/via REUTERS China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation has been set up to develop an aircraft capable of breaking up Airbus' and Boeing's duopoly in the widebody airliner market.  The Sino-Russian jetliner remains unnamed, however, it has commonly been referred to as the 929. Little is know about the aircraft, however, CRAIC is aiming for a 280-seat widebody with a range of more than 7,500 miles. The 929 is expected to take roughly a decade to develop.  Get the latest Boeing stock price here.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Space Boeing tapped to build Phantom Express spaceplane for DARPA David Szondy May 24, 2017 Phantom Express shown preparing to launch its expendable second stage on the top of the vehicle in this artist’s concept (Credit: boeing-spaceplane) View gallery - 2 images DARPA's ambitious launch-a-day spaceplane is a step closer to lift off after Boeing announced that it's been assigned the contract to work with the agency to design, build and test a technology demonstration vehicle for the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. Called the Phantom Express, the goal is to create an unmanned, autonomous, hypersonic, reusable spaceplane that can deliver small payloads of 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) to low Earth orbit. Currently, space launches are special events that take months or years in preparation, but as the world becomes more dependent on orbital assets, stepping up the pace is becoming a major priority. This is especially the case for the military, which often requires new satellites put in place on very short notice to fulfill missions in a fast-changing world. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW The Phantom Express is DARPA's idea for a craft that can deliver small payloads into orbit for about US$5 million each. Unlike the US Air Force's X-37B, the Phantom is a self-contained vertical launch vehicle about the size of a business jet and uses cryogenic liquid oxygen and hydrogen propellants to power an updated version of the Space Shuttle's Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine. The idea is that the Phantom Express would lift off from a launch pad and go into a suborbital trajectory at hypersonic speeds while shielded by third-generation thermal protection. After it reaches the edge of space, it would launch a small, expendable second stage, which would deliver the payload to orbit. Meanwhile, the Phantom would bank and return to the spaceport, where it would land like a conventional aircraft. Because the Phantom would be built and operated more like a military aircraft than a space vehicle, and even uses off-shelf military components, DARPA says that it has a potential turnaround time for the next launch of hours instead of weeks. According to the agency, this first of a new class of spaceplanes would allow the US to quickly recover even if faced with the catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites. Boeing's task is to develop a technology demonstrator capable of carrying out 10 flights in 10 days by using easily accessible subsystem components that can be quickly ordered and replaced. As the XS-1 project enters Phase 2 and 3, the vehicle will incorporate advanced, lightweight composite cryogenic propellant tanks, hybrid composite-metallic wings and control surfaces capable of withstanding hypersonic temperatures and stresses, and automated flight-termination and other technologies, including those from DARPA's Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program. If all goes to schedule, Phase 2 will see static engine tests by 2019, followed by Phase 3 that will include 12 to 15 flight tests by 2020, the 10 in 10 days flight demonstration, and hypersonic test flights at Mach 5 (3,800 mph, 6,125 km/h). This will be followed by flights at Mach 10 (7,600 mph, 12,250 km/h) and delivering payloads of up to 3,000 lb (1,361 kg) to low Earth orbit. DARPA says that in addition to the Phantom Express helping meet military needs, it hopes it will attract interest in the XS-1 technology from private firms. "The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today's frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand," says Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager. "We're very pleased with Boeing's progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 — fabrication and flight."

An artist’s conception shows Boeing’s Phantom Express XS-1 space plane in flight. (Boeing Illustration) The Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency says it has selected the Boeing Co. to develop and test its XS-1 hypersonic space plane, using a design now known as the Phantom Express. Boeing won out over Northrop Grumman and Masten Space Systems to take the long-running XS-1 project beyond Phase 1 into Phase 2/3, culminating with test flights in 2020. The reusable space plane would be designed to carry and deploy a small, expendable upper stage, then return to Earth for a runway landing. The upper stage would be capable of putting satellites weighing up to 3,000 pounds in low Earth orbit. “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said today in a statement. DARPA will provide up to $146 million for the project. Boeing said it would invest jointly with DARPA in the plane’s development, but declined to give a specific figure for its contribution. Boeing and the Air Force already have tested a reusable space plane known as the X-37B four times. The most recently flown X-37B landed earlier this month after spending nearly two years in orbit. Boeing had partnered with Blue Origin on rocket engine studies during Phase 1 of the XS-1 project, but for Phase 2/3, the company will go with Aerojet Rocketdyne’s AR-22 engine, which is based on the design for the space shuttle main engines. “As one of the world’s most reliable rocket engines, the SSME is a smart choice to power the XS-1 launch vehicle,” Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO and President Eileen Drake said in a statement. “This engine has a demonstrated track record of solid performance and proven reusability.” Phase 2 of the XS-1 project calls on Boeing to complete its design for the Phantom Express and conduct ground tests by 2019. One of the key ground tests calls for firing the rocket engine 10 times over consecutive 10 days. Phase 3 would involve 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020. One objective is to have the XS-1 fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days to demonstrate reusability with a rapid turn-around. Subsequent test flights would fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload weighing between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. DARPA said one of its aims was to encourage the rise of commercial launch services that could operate with recurring costs of $5 million or less per launch. Toward that end, DARPA plans to release selected data from its Phase 2/3 tests and share relevant payload specifications with commercial ventures. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, said in the agency’s news release. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

The announcement as US President Donald Trump makes a maiden foreign tour in which Saudi and Israeli concerns about Iran have loomed large is likely to stoke new tensions with Washington. “Step by step, we are developing our defensive capability and I announce today that in recent years we have built a third underground factory for the manufacture of missiles,” Iran’s Fars news agency quoted Hadjizadeh as saying. “We are going to develop our ballistic power. It’s normal that our enemies, that is to say the United States and Israel, are angry when we show off our underground missile bases because they want the Iranian people to be in a position of weakness,” he added. In October 2015, state television aired footage for the first time of a base that Hadjizadeh said was 500 metres (1,600 feet) underground and stocked with a range of different missiles. Armed forces spokesman General Masoud Jazayeri said earlier this month that Iran had a number of such underground silos which were an “important deterrent factor against the sworn enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.” The United States says Iran’s missile programme is a breach of international law because the missiles could carry nuclear warheads in the future. Iran denies ever seeking nuclear weapons and says the missiles are designed to carry conventional warheads only and are a legitimate part of it defensive capabilities. The Trump administration imposed fresh sanctions on Iran following a missile test in late January. It added more last week at the same time as it renewed a waiver of sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear programme. In Saudi Arabia on Saturday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged newly re-elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to end ballistic missile testing. On Monday, Rouhani retorted that Iran did not need US permission to conduct missile tests and that they would continue “if technically necessary”. Iran has developed various designs of ballistic missiles, some with a range of 2,000 kms (1,250 miles) — sufficient to reach both Israel and US bases in the region. The US Treasury is reviewing licenses for Boeing Co and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, department head Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran, Syria and North Korea. “We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria and North Korea to protect American lives,” Mnuchin said in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee. “I can assure you that’s a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president.” Mnuchin did not elaborate on the review of the licenses, which were issued under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. His statements followed President Donald Trump’s Middle East trip, in which he called on Iran to stop funding “terrorists and militias.” The review suggests that Trump’s support for Boeing’s defense and jetliner businesses could have political limits. Iran has accused Washington of supporting terrorism by backing rebels in Syria and says halting the airplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. Mnuchin told the Ways and Means hearing that sanctions “really work” and were responsible for bringing Iran to the negotiating table ahead of the nuclear deal. For Boeing, losing the IranAir deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the widebody jetliners are incluced in the first approved batch of Boeing aircraft due for delivery to IranAir by 2020. Deliveries start in May next year. Boeing said in December it would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year under plans that include IranAir’s still-tenative order. IranAir has agreed to buy 200 US and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing, 100 from Airbus and 20 turboprops from Franco-Italian ATR. All the aircraft need US licenses because of their reliance on US parts. “Boeing continues to follow the lead of the US government with regards to working with Iran’s airlines, and any and all contracts with Iran’s airlines are contingent upon US government approval,” a spokeswoman said by email. An Airbus spokesman had no immediate comment.

Image: darpa By Adario Strange2017-05-26 02:17:44 UTC Launching satellites into orbit could get a lot cheaper thanks to an experimental space plane.  SEE ALSO: NASA's new space fabric looks like chain mail and can protect astronauts This week, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) revealed the design for the XS-1, which is set to be built by Boeing. The hypersonic aircraft would launch vertically, deploy a second stage to carry a satellite into orbit, and then land like a normal airplane.  Although the aircraft is still in the concept phase, DARPA believes the final result will be a vehicle that will provide "short-notice, low-cost access to space" for both military and commercial use. Initial tests of the XS-1 technology will attempt 10 flights over the course of 10 days with the ultimate goal being routine low-Earth orbit flights for around $5 million or less per launch. (Currently, it costs SpaceX about $62 million to launch its Falcon 9 rocket into orbit.) "We're delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality," DARPA's Brad Tousley said in a statement on the agency's website. "Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities." And while this futuristic space plane and the opportunities it may afford sound exciting, actual flight tests aren't scheduled to happen until 2020. For now, you'll have to use the concept video (above) to imagine this very near future of space travel.  WATCH: Topics: Boeing, DARPA, military, Satellites, Science, Space About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

It is home to the Davenport Works plant owned by Arconic (formerly Alcoa), which produces part of the overall order of aluminum Ford requires for its vehicles, like the F-150. A recent tour allowed us to see how the aluminum sheeting is manufactured and look back on how the automotive world has changed since the aluminum Ford F-150 was unveiled. Alcoa Inc. split into two publically traded companies near the end of 2016—Alcoa Corp., the commodity side, and Arconic Inc., the manufactured-products side. We will refer to the new name, Arconic, over Alcoa. The Davenport Works Plant While the Mississippi River may be a stone’s throw away from the plant, inside the nondescript building—which is large enough to completely cover an 18-hole golf course—the smells and visuals of aluminum production dominate the senses. It is like walking into a different world. View Photo Gallery | 19 Photos Photo 2/19   |   Arconic Davenport Works Underneath the roof of the 400-acre facility sits a variety of aluminum production equipment, including an oven to melt down the aluminum ingots and add in a secret makeup of other metals. Several large hot and cold presses send large sheets of aluminum of varying lengths (including 10 to 20 feet long or longer and weighing hundreds to thousands of pounds) down conveyer belts to flatten them like pancakes. These presses, standing stories tall and driven by operators in computer-laden control booths, use the conveyer belts to send the aluminum in and out until the right thickness is obtained. Finally, another machine rolls up the flattened aluminum for transport. The rolled aluminum can sit for days until it is cool enough for transport. Held in place by large metal straps, the spools are then shipped by truck to the stamping plant in Michigan. Upon arrival, the metal strips are cut and the aluminum lays flat again by itself. The process of sheeting the aluminum is done in a matter of minutes and is an incredibly simple system in theory, yet getting the right thickness and chemical compound in each sheet is complex and challenging. View Photo Gallery | 19 Photos Photo 3/19   |   Arconic Davenport Works Monitor Aluminum Changes Ford and Arconic It is hard to truly understand the importance of the relationship between Ford and Arconic without going back in time to 2009. Back then, Ford was just starting the aluminum build plan of its new F-150. Mark Fields spearheaded the plan, knowing the future of trucks revolved around meeting fuel economy standards. While Fields may not have known much about aluminum at the time, then-CEO Alan Mulally sure did, thanks to his days at Boeing. Arconic and Alcoa have been leaders in aluminum production for aerospace, and the Davenport plant plays a big role in producing material for airplanes. The fact that Mulally knew about aluminum usage, combined with Field’s need to drop weight, couldn’t have been better news for Arconic. In 2009, times weren’t exactly rosy for the aluminum producer. Like Ford and other businesses, the recession had taken a toll on the company. In early 2009, Arconic announced it was cutting its global workforce by 13 percent and publicly said it made the move to “hold on to cash and cut costs,” according to a 2009 CNN.com story. It also planned to cut its aluminum output by 750,000 million tons per year, and it planned on reporting a loss in the fourth quarter of that year. The next few years weren’t much better for Arconic. In 2013, it reported a $2.3-billion loss, and the company was delisted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in September for the first time in 44 years. Thankfully, a decades-long glut of aluminum was coming to an end, partially due to Ford’s new F-150 coming to market. While business was tough, Arconic kept investing in innovations, like a new bonding treatment for aluminum called Arconic 951. This treatment, applied to rolls of aluminum, creates a bond tougher than welded steel and is the secret behind how Ford was able to use the material for its trucks. Armed with this new technique, Arconic invited Mark Fields (now Ford’s CEO) to visit the Davenport plant in 2013 to showcase its ability to meet Ford’s large demand for the metal. This was after Ford showed the Atlas concept at the 2013 North American International Auto Show. Satisfied with its ability to meet demand and after the success of being able to build a concept, Ford moved forward with the F-150. In January 2014, Ford unveiled the aluminum ’15 Ford F-150 at the North American International Auto Show, sending shockwaves throughout the industry. View Photo Gallery | 19 Photos Photo 4/19   |   Arconic Davenport Works Fire Dept F150 Three Years Later From the onset, Ford’s aluminum F-150 faced criticism and concern over the massive use of aluminum. No manufacturer had tried to use the metal on such a massive scale before. There were concerns about reparability, durability, and consumer demand. Looking back at these issues now, none have panned out to be major problems. The fact is, repair and collision centers have adapted to the truck, and the way it was designed for easier repair (swapping out entire sections) has been without issue. While Chevrolet’s infamous dropping of bricks and the toolbox into the bed of the F-150 might have made for good theater, the reality is the trucks seem to be holding up without massive consumer concerns or recalls. Finally, consumers haven’t lost their desire for the F-150. Strong sales continue, and Ford has expanded its use of the metal to several of its products. Arconic was able to rebound from the recession, recently introducing a new Micromill process that turns aluminum from liquid to solid in seconds, cuts down the production process from 20 days to 20 minutes, and requires one-quarter the floor space and half the energy. Plus, the resulting metal is 40 percent more formable and 30 percent stronger. This will allow Arconic to meet Ford’s increasing need for the metal as well as improve the durability of the ’16 Ford F-150 and all future generations. Overall, the move to aluminum seems like an all-around win for both companies and consumers. This isn’t just our conclusion. One look at the sea of Ford F-150s in the employee parking lot outside of the Davenport Works plant—along with our own driving impressions—confirms our conclusion.

(Reuters) the brief Northeast AsiaBusiness China’s market – sensible people acting insensibly By Grant Newsham May 26, 2017 8:32 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Asia Times is not responsible for the opinions, facts or any media content presented by contributors. In case of abuse, click here to report. The recent US-China 100-day action plan – under which Beijing mostly agreed to do things it was already supposed to do but wasn’t, while the US kept its market wide open – once again shows the Chinese market’s hypnotic effect on foreigners. The allure of a China where one sells one of something to every person in the country can make otherwise sensible people act insensibly. The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Doing business in the People’s Republic of China requires willingness to overlook dangers that in any other country would unnerve foreign investors and businessmen. For starters, take the absence of a reliable legal system – or even being able to count on enforcing a contract. Secure property rights are similarly elusive. Massive capital outflows and the quest for overseas bolt-holes by China’s most affluent citizens are a futures market of sorts, suggesting the locals know something about the business environment that foreign investors don’t. Technology and intellectual property are strong-armed via required “transfer” from foreign companies and the rest is at risk of being stolen; all part of a longstanding government strategy to build up Chinese companies and eventually displace foreign ones. And taking on a local partner is risky. From the early 1980’s when the China market opened until today, stories abound of local joint venture partners milking the business for know-how, and funding, and then going into business as competitors. Even doing due diligence in China is dangerous, with researchers being arrested, or worse. If North Carolina had a similar business environment nobody would invest there, not even the Chinese. Intimidation Foreign companies in China are subject to capricious government pressure and punishment. The recent detention of six Japanese surveying for hot springs on behalf of Chinese clients is a reminder that authorities will take hostages to teach foreign companies — or countries — a lesson, or to achieve some other objective. In 2009, the Australian mining giant, Rio Tinto, ran afoul of the government in the iron ore trade and its country manager (an Australian citizen) and several other employees were arrested. Rio Tinto eventually kow-towed and brought in Henry Kissinger to spring its employees – in exchange for a reported US$5 million consulting fee. Japanese and South Korean companies are prime targets. Riots targeting Japanese-owned (and even Japanese-looking) businesses in China “spontaneously” break out whenever Beijing feels it necessary to make an issue of the Senkaku islands. More recently, South Korea’s deployment of the THAAD anti-missile defense system on land sold by the Lotte Group resulted in most of Lotte’s outlets in China being shut down on trumped up excuses — and the company’s e-commerce sites subjected to cyber attacks. Size doesn’t matter Being big and successful elsewhere means little for a company entering the China market. I had first-hand experience with Motorola in the 1990s and watched one of America’s most respected companies fail in China. The company went all out in China, building factories, handing over technology, employing thousands of locals, and demonstrating its commitment to the market. All was good for a while, but Motorola was really just building up its competition. Today, China electronics company Lenovo owns a good chunk of what was once Motorola. Google and Nokia have also learned the hard way about the Chinese market. Even Apple has felt some government pressure and must know it will someday face rival with Chinese characteristics – and no little bit of Apple technology. Waking up? Despite grumbling in recent years by the American Chamber of Commerce in China, the allure still exists. The evidence is in Boeing’s plan to build a plant near Shanghai by 2018, despite the government’s avowed goal of developing a commercial aviation industry that rivals Boeing and Airbus. However, not to worry since it’s only a “finishing” facility to build older 737s – and it is the price of admission to the market. Boeing – or its shareholders – might recall the president of a once-prominent US aviation electronics firm who commented in the early 1990’s that he didn’t mind handing over technology to the Chinese in exchange for market access. His rationale was the US will always be ahead of China. Not unusual thinking then or now. Part of the difficulty of keeping one’s wits about the realities of the China market is that foreign companies do sometimes make money – sometimes lots of it. But more often than not success is anecdotal and temporary. Assessing commercial success in China requires a long-term look at performance (and as importantly, competitive position) over at least 10 years. Even better, 20 years. This is seldom done. Also, there’s a belief among the foreigners that with just a little more time and effort the riches will come. Casino smiles Indeed, China success stories resemble casino advertisements showing happy people at the craps table. Perhaps true enough as a snapshot. But a more accurate ad would show people walking out of the casino at the end of the night. There might be a few smiles, but far more glum faces. Today’s China is a far cry from 1980 when it perhaps needed some special treatment. The Trump administration (like its predecessors) is wasting its time unless its objective is full and immediate reciprocity. A coercive element is needed, such as punishing Chinese IP theft, unfair trade practices, and strong-arming of American and foreign companies. Until China is pressured to change, it won’t – even if it makes token gestures to temporarily quiet the Americans. It’s perhaps wishful thinking, but someday one hopes to hear a CEO – maybe one without an MBA – declare that until the market isn’t rigged against foreign companies, his company cannot afford to be in China.

Eisenstein Share Share Tweet Comment Email Print advertisement Former Ford CEO Mark Fields fashioned himself an agent of change, promising to transform a Rust Belt auto manufacturer into a high-tech "mobility company." But three years after taking the helm, Fields has been tripped up by changes beyond his own control. The 56-year-old New York native was summarily sent out to pasture, Ford announced Monday, replaced by former Steelcase CEO Jim Hackett. That, along with a series of other high-level management moves, appears to have been months in the making, reflecting the growing frustration among major investors — including the founding Ford family — over weak sales, declining earnings and a stock price down 40 percent since Fields stepped into the CEO role in July 2014.

"He put us in a great position. I'm very thankful to Mark. But this is a time of great change and fortunately we have a transformational leader," Ford said, referring to new CEO Hackett. Officially, Fields tendered his resignation last Friday, "after a discussion he and I had," Chairman Ford said during a subsequent interview on CNBC. But the speed with which a successor was named suggested to industry observers it was only a matter of time, and a question of whether Fields, a 28-year Ford veteran, would jump or be pushed. Field Marshaled in Change Things looked a lot more promising just three years ago, when Fields stepped in for the retiring Alan Mulally. Fields was the protégé of the former Boeing executive, who guided Ford through the Great Recession. It was, in fact, Fields who largely crafted the "Way Forward" plan that let the second-largest U.S. automaker avoid the bankruptcies that nearly destroyed Detroit rivals General Motors and Chrysler. But, after a promising start, a number of factors came into play leading to the management shake-up. "There's no question that all of us were acutely aware that the stock had been languishing," the Ford chairman acknowledged. But there has been growing concern that while Fields had a clear vision of where the auto industry is heading five, even 10 years from now, his grasp of current challenges may have been a bit more murky. In recent years, Fields had been a frequent speaker at the Consumer Electronics Show, underscoring the way the automobile is becoming as much a digital device as a mechanical one. Under his leadership, Ford has rapidly expanded its spending on technology, early this year ordering a major expansion of its new Silicon Valley research center. Technology Up Front Barely a month ago Ford announced a three-way venture with Amazon and Starbucks that will allow motorists with the latest Ford Sync 3 infotainment system to call up the Alexa voice assistant and use it to have a cup of java waiting when they pull into the nearby coffee shop. Ford was hailed by a recent Navigant Research study that declared it the industry leader in development of autonomous vehicles, ahead of Waymo, the self-driving spin-off from Google. Ford plans to have its first fully driverless vehicle in production by 2021. The carmaker has launched car-sharing and ride-sharing projects and is exploring a variety of other new mobility concepts. If one bought into Fields's vision, that is essential, as there will likely be far fewer consumers buying cars in 2025 than there are today, many owners expected to switch to sharing services like Uber and Lyft. Related: Why 95 Percent of Your Driving Won't Be in Your Own Car by 2030 Fields also was betting that those car-share services would opt for electric, rather than gas-powered models. In many ways, his vision echoed that of Elon Musk, and Wall Street has embraced Tesla — last month driving its stock up to the point it had a higher market capitalization than either Ford or General Motors. But the message failed to resonate with Ford investors — especially after the carmaker saw first-quarter sales dip 40 percent to $1.6 billion, with the full-year numbers also expected to decline. "It will be many years before a lot of the stuff Fields has been working on will achieve a payoff," said Joe Phillippi, a long-time Wall Street analyst and now head of AutoTrends Consulting. Having a long-term vision isn't a bad thing, Phillippi stressed, but critics contend Fields lost sight of Ford's short-term challenges. Its passenger car fleet, models like the Fusion and Focus, have been allowed to age without necessary replacements. It has been slow to recognize and respond to some key market shifts, as well — notably the revival of the midsize pickup truck segment. General Motors got there in 2014 with models like the Chevrolet Silverado. Ford's reborn Ranger truck is still a year away.

On October 30, 2001, Ford gave walking papers to Jacques Nasser, another visionary leader who set out to create a very different Ford. Nasser was an early proponent of in-car technologies. He also spent heavily on non-traditional operations, like auto parts and repairs and recycling. But critics felt he ignored the core of Ford's business and, after Nasser's ouster, Bill Ford — then handling dual roles as chairman and CEO — adopted a strategy dubbed "One Ford." That led the Detroit maker to return focus to its core brand, selling off a host of foreign luxury marques, including Volvo, Land Rover and Jaguar, that Nasser had acquired at a premium. While the "Blue Oval" Ford brand quickly rebounded, Mulally eventually killed off domestic Mercury, too. And even now, Lincoln, the homegrown luxury division, continues to struggle. How much CEO Hackett will reverse the course set by Fields is uncertain. He was, in fact, heading Ford's Smart Mobility unit for the last year, so Hackett seems unlikely to completely walk away from many of the projects Fields set in motion. But Chairman Ford made it clear the new chief executive also will have to not only "drive innovation" for the long haul, but improve the carmaker's cost efficiencies and "deliver results around the world." Boosting that stock price is certain to be one of the metrics by which the 62-year-old Hackett will be judged. Paul A.

Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com St. Louis County police have charged and were looking Thursday night for a suspect in a fatal shooting that police believe was linked to one in St. Louis earlier in the day. Two people were killed and one critically injured in the separate shootings. St. Louis County police said Casey Lowery, 36, has been charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting in the 3600 block of Dunn Road. +6  Casey Lowery is charged with murder in the first degree and one count of armed criminal action in St. Louis County. “Detectives believe Lowery is leaving the St. Louis area,” a press release from county police said. “We have information that Lowery was last seen in the area of New Haven, Missouri. Lowery should be considered armed and dangerous. Do not approach Lowery, and contact the police department immediately.” New Haven is in Franklin County, about 60 miles west of St. Louis. Lowery’s address is in the 1100 block of Howell Street in St. Louis. That address is a block from the scene of the first fatal shooting. About 8:30 a.m., a man shot a homeowner in the head in an alley in the 1100 block of Canaan Avenue, critically injuring him in front of an Ameren subcontractor. When police arrived, they found a woman who had been shot nearby. She was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The woman was identified as Keiva Jones, 29. She lived in the same block as the shooting. The homeowner, a man in his 50s, was in critical and unstable condition at a hospital. Witnesses told police the victims were in a relationship, according to a source. St. Louis police have not identified the suspect but say they believe he is 36 years old. About 8:45 a.m. and about four miles away, a gunman opened fire on a vehicle on a Conoco gas station parking lot in unincorporated St. Louis County, wounding a motorist. He died at a nearby hospital, police said. After the shots were fired, both the shooter’s vehicle and victim’s vehicle were seen driving off the lot in the 3600 block of Dunn Road. The victim, a man, was shot at least once, according to St. Louis County police. Police do not know how many people were inside either vehicle when the shooting occurred. In both the Baden and St. Louis County cases, the shooter’s vehicle was described as a mid-’90s blue pickup with a camper shell, prompting police to believe the shootings may be connected. Specifically, the shooter’s vehicle is described as a 1990 gray or blue Chevrolet Silverado, with Missouri license plate 3FT420 and running boards, paint oxidation and rust on the roof and camper shell. Security officers at Boeing in Berkeley called Berkeley police shortly after 9 a.m. to report that a truck had “blown through” several security checkpoints, said Police Chief Art Jackson. The driver did not cause any damage and escaped. The truck matched the description of the shooter’s vehicle that St. Louis County police then shared with surrounding agencies, Jackson said. St. Louis police spokeswoman Leah Freeman said in a statement that police believe the shootings are connected. Lt. John Green, commander of the St. Louis Police Department’s homicide division, gave this account of the Baden shooting: The utility worker, an electrician, showed up at a home on Canaan after a homeowner complained about a burned-out street light in the alley. The worker talked to the homeowner and they stood in the alley looking at the light that needed repairs. Another man, who was a stranger to the utility worker, walked up and began talking to the homeowner. The two men shook hands and talked as if they knew each other. The man who had just walked up pulled a gun and fired a shot at the broken light. “You didn’t need to do that,” the utility worker told the shooter. He told the gunman that he was preparing to fix it. With that, the shooter fired his gun at the homeowner, striking him in the head, and the worker ran to his truck to escape, Green said. The utility worker parked a block or two away, in a spot he considered safe, so he could make a phone call. He had the homeowner’s cellphone number from the work order form, so he tried calling the homeowner. When he looked up, the shooter was standing outside his vehicle. The shooter demanded his phone, then drove away. The utility worker returned to the scene about two hours later to walk the alley with detectives, describing the incident. The woman’s body was found by police when they arrived to investigate. The worker never saw the woman, and police have found no witnesses to her shooting, Green said. Neighbors said the male victim was known on the block to cut people’s grass and hold weekend parties to keep neighborhood children entertained. His home on Canaan, with a small blue plastic pool in the side yard, is about three houses from the vacant lot where he was shot. Crime in the Baden neighborhood is up nearly 25 percent in the last six months from the same period a year earlier. Anyone with information about Lowery’s whereabouts or the shootings is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 1-866-371-8477. Rewards of up to $5,000 are offered for tips.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Drone Stocks to Buy in 2017 A drone specialist, a chipmaker, and an aerospace giant could be some of the best bets now for investors looking to profit from the coming rise of drones. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 25, 2017 at 4:12PM Drones are quickly becoming a massive opportunity for companies and investors alike. The commercial drone market is expected to skyrocket to $23 billion annually by 2022, up from just $6 billion right now. Investors looking to tap into this burgeoning market in 2017 should consider AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV), Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Though none of these companies are a sure bet, these players are well positioned to become top drone stocks. Image source: Getty Images. AeroVironment It's likely you've never heard of AeroVironment, but the company is a leader in the military drone space. It builds unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for video surveillance, as well as versions that can be used for tactical purposes; now, it's taking its drone-building knowledge and applying it to the commercial market as well.  The company announced at the end of last year that it would bring a new UAV to market: the Quantix, designed for commercial applications in areas like agriculture and the energy industry. The quadcopter drone can take off using its propellers, then fly like an airplane to survey crops or industrial energy equipment. AeroVironment earned $264.1 million in revenue in fiscal 2016, up just 2% year over year, and expects revenue between $260 million and $280 million for fiscal 2017. That's not meteoric revenue growth, but this new foray into commercial drones could be the catalyst for the company in the years to come.    Ambarella Ambarella is best known as the manufacturer of the chips in GoPro's action cameras, but the company also produces similar video-processing chips for drone-makers. The company is already a key supplier for the world's largest drone manufacturer, the Chinese firm DJI, and it sells chips to other drone makers as well. The company emphasized on its recent earnings call that it's primarily focused on consumer drones at the moment, and that the market can be a bit unstable. Management is still optimistic about drone prospects this year though. "I just want to emphasize it's going to be volatile on a quarterly basis, but we still feel pretty good this year about the drone growth," said CFO George Laplante during its fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call in late February. Ambarella's fiscal 2017 revenue was down year over year to $310 million from $316 million, and the company expects fiscal 2018 revenue to be up just 3%. But investors should remember that the company is consistently shifting away from its reliance on GoPro, and drones are part of that plan. Additionally, Ambarella managed to grow its fiscal 4Q 2017 revenue by 29% and its GAAP earnings per share by 253%. The chipmaker has lots of room for growth, and its exposure to the drone market should help propel that. Boeing Boeing is a big player in the medium-sized drone space through its subsidiary, Insitu. Most of its drone sales  go to the military market, but it recently ventured into ocean drone space with its purchase of Liquid Robotics last year.   Of course, Boeing is nowhere near a pure-play in the drone space, but the company's many decades of aeronautical experience could be a strong foundation upon which it can build a successful drones business as well. Earlier this year, the U.S. Coast Guard for the first time deployed a ship equipped with a small unmanned aerial system, the Insutu ScanEagle, for a full six-week patrol. The ScanEagle drone was a success, helping the crew of the cutter apprehend multiple smuggling vessels, and that trial run could lead the way for similar uses in the future.  Boeing reported revenue of $94.6 billion in 2016, and expects a slight revenue decline in 2017 to between $90.5 and $92.5 billion. But investors looking to bet on the future of the drone market should certainly give Boeing a good look. Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Jonathan Ernst/Bloomberg) The FAA appointed Ali Bahrami to head its Aviation Safety division. Formerly a senior air safety manager with a 24-year career at the government agency, he was more recently a vice president at the major lobbying organization for the biggest aerospace companies. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Airplanes don’t have revolving doors, but the Federal Aviation Administration evidently does. A former agency veteran, more recently a point man for the aerospace industry, is now the top FAA safety regulator. Ali Bahrami headed the FAA’s important Seattle office before ending a 24-year FAA career to work as a vice president at the lobbying organization for the biggest aerospace companies. Now he’s moving back to the FAA as chief of its Aviation Safety division. FAA Administrator Michael Huerta, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, hired Bahrami this week for the Washington, D.C.-based position. The agency said in a statement that Bahrami’s “depth of experience and collaborative work with industry supports our mission to advance aviation safety. … We are fortunate to have a person of his caliber back at the FAA.” During his previous time at the FAA, Bahrami led efforts to delegate more safety oversight to the airplane and systems manufacturers themselves, a push necessitated by the agency’s lack of manpower to police a global supply chain.

In his Seattle-based role managing the FAA division responsible for operational safety of airliners in the U.S., Bahrami oversaw both the certification of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and the 2013 grounding of the jet, just a year after it entered service, following the severe overheating of batteries on two flights. Bahrami’s office had 20 to 25 staffers working full time on the 787’s certification and so it had to rely in large part on 950 engineers who are paid by Boeing but work as FAA “authorized representatives” to oversee and approve the certification of Boeing jets. Some inside the FAA are critical of this trend toward increased delegation of oversight and aren’t happy about Bahrami’s new appointment. One FAA safety engineer, who asked not to be identified, to preserve his job, said Bahrami was “very pro industry” when implementing the FAA’s push for more safety inspections to be handled by the manufacturers. He predicted that giving Bahrami the top safety position will lead to “more industry control” of safety regulation. Less than three months after the 787 was allowed back in the air in April 2013, Bahrami moved to Washington, D.C., as vice president of the Aerospace Industries Association of America (AIA), which represents some 300 aerospace and defense companies. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg is the AIA’s current board chairman. Testifying before Congress that year, Bahrami made the case that in an era of restricted FAA budgets and manpower, the agency needed to collaborate more with industry in the process of certifying airplanes. More recently, Bahrami voiced the aerospace industry’s concern over President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing new regulations for 60 days and requiring the elimination of two regulations for every new one. That blanket decree briefly halted the FAA’s ability to issue airworthiness directives. “While we strongly support President Trump’s push to trim excessive, unnecessary and costly regulations, a balanced approach … is needed,” Bahrami said in February. “The requirement that each government agency independently comply with the executive order could severely hamper the FAA’s ability to maintain the safety of the air transportation system.” Kenneth Quinn, former chief counsel at the FAA and now chair of the aviation practice at influential law firm Baker & McKenzie, representing major airlines and aerospace companies, said, “To be in a top safety position, you have to have extensive industry experience.” “Bahrami knows safety. He knows certification. He’s eminently well qualified,” Quinn said. Mary Schiavo, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and now a lawyer and an aviation safety analyst with CNN, said U.S. airlines’ safety record in the past 10 years has greatly improved from previous decades, for which Bahrami can take some credit given his previous long tenure at the FAA. “On the revolving door, it’s been going since the creation of the FAA and the DOT so it is not unusual. AIA has tremendous clout at the FAA, so I am not surprised,” Schiavo said. “I just hope Mr. Bahrami does a good job to continue the good trends of the carriers in the U.S.” Dominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com View Comments No personal attacks or insults, no hate speech, no profanity.

Hypersonic spaceplane on schedule for take-off in a few years' time US DEFENCE chiefs say they are a step closer to building a new class of hypersonic aircraft that will allow for cheaper, more reliable, fully automated space travel as early as 2020. By Simon Osborne PUBLISHED: 19:11, Thu, May 25, 2017 | UPDATED: 20:38, Thu, May 25, 2017 DARPABoeing's Phantom Express hypersomic spaceliner The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced it will continue to work with Boeing on the next phase of their Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) programme.  The goal of the programme is to build an autonomous aircraft capable of launching into orbit 10 times over the course of 10 days by 2020. DARPA programme manager Jess Sponable said: “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two.”  Related articles SpaceX to fly tourists to the Moon NEXT YEAR opening up route to WORLD SpaceX to fly two paying tourists around the moon in 2018 DARPAThe team behind the Phantom Express say it is one schedule for a 2020 launch The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two Jess Sponable The spaceplane, known as the Phantom Express, is roughly the size and weight of a modern business jet but will take off vertically like a rocket and fly at hypersonic speeds. The current design of the Phantom Express does not include external boosters like a modern spaceship.  It will be powered by an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants. Eileen Drake, president and CEO of Aerojet Rocketdyne, said: “This engine has a demonstrated track record of solid performance and proven reusability.” DARPAThe Phantom Express could provide defence and commercial opportunities Boeing said the Phantom Express will be capable of deploying a small satellite weighing up to 3,000lbs into low-Earth orbit. On the journey back to Earth, the space plane will land horizontally on a runway, where it can be prepared for the next flight “potentially within hours”. The project is scheduled to begin conducting flight tests in 2020. DARPAThe Phantom Express is a step closer to reality The Best Space Photos of the Year Fri, March 24, 2017 Stunning imagery taken from Space Play slideshow 1 of 16 Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said: “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk.” DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office Brad Tousley said: “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” Related articles Humans to be FROZEN IN TIME for space travel as scientists move to ...

The this part of North 23rd Street is located in the area for the proposed new campus of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com WASHINGTON • President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes almost $382 million to acquire land and begin construction of a new National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency complex in north St. Louis. The beginning of that NGA project, and a proposal to build a new hospital and “blood-processing center” at Fort Leonard Wood in the Ozarks, would make Missouri the top state for new military construction in the fiscal year that begins in October if Trump’s budget priorities are accepted. On top of a proposed $1.4 billion for 14 new FA/18 Super Hornet fighter jets and $874 million for 34,529 JDAM GPS-guided bombs, all built by Boeing in and around St. Louis, the region would reap a large taxpayer defense-spending benefit from Trump’s initial budgetary attempt to fulfill his promise to rebuild the military. Final budget numbers are a long way from set in stone, and members of Congress have indicated they are likely to make major changes, especially to significant cuts that Trump wants to make in domestic spending. “The president’s budget as we all know is a recommendation,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as he was flanked by other members of the Senate GOP leadership, including Roy Blunt of Missouri. “We will be taking into account what the president has recommended, but it will not be determinative in every respect.” Blunt said he was “encouraged” by Trump’s proposal on the NGA construction, and said it would be “one of my top priorities” as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The new NGA facility in St. Louis was approved under the administration of President Barack Obama. There is bipartisan agreement among Missouri members of Congress from the region that it needs to go forward as part of the nation’s defense in a world of escalating intelligence and terrorist threats. The total cost of the new facility, which will host 3,000 NGA employees in an urban setting, has been estimated to be about $1.75 billion. Members of the Illinois congressional delegation, who wanted the new NGA facility to be built near Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, have previously said they would consider fighting appropriations for the St. Louis site. Rep. Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, Ill., “maintains that the St. Clair County site adjacent to Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County is the superior location for NGA-West from a public safety, mission synergy and taxpayer cost perspective,” Bost spokesman George O’Connor said. “He is continuing to monitor developments and will keep asking the tough questions as the budget and appropriations process unfolds.” Trump is proposing $811,000 for land acquisition and $381 million to begin construction in fiscal year 2018 for the NGA site. It’s part of an overall request of about $11.2 billion for new military site construction and military housing around the globe, some of which goes to locations that are classified, according to briefings by Pentagon officials this week. Of that, about $653 million would be spent in Missouri, trumping other states, such as California and Maryland, that have gotten large shares of military construction spending in recent budgets. For instance, in a budget blueprint provided by the Pentagon, the Department of Defense was slated to spend about $7.7 million for construction in Missouri in the current fiscal year, but more than $436 million in Maryland and $585 million in California. Trump’s 2018 budget would push Missouri to the top of the list. Military construction spending in Illinois is expected to be about $76 million this year, according to the department, but the Trump budget does not ask for any new dollars for 2018. Trump’s military construction request also asks for $10 million for a new communications center at the Rosecrans Memorial Airport near St. Joseph, Mo., which is home to the 139th Airlift Wing, the Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center, and the Missouri Air National Guard. It requests $250 million for the first phase of a new hospital at Fort Leonard Wood, and just under $12 million for a “blood-processing center replacement” on the base, which is about 130 miles west of St. Louis.

(Courtesy of Brody McMahan via AP) Seattle and Phoenix were the two fastest-growing big cities last year, depending on how you measure it. They couldn't be more different — and rain is the least of it. Share story By Jon Talton Special to The Seattle Times Seattle was the nation’s fastest-growing city in percentage terms last year, as my colleague Gene Balk reports. With a 3.1 percent gain, the city crossed the 700,000 mark for the first time. The Census Bureau report also showed that my hometown of Phoenix added the most people numerically among big cities, 32,113, to reach 1,615,017. This makes Phoenix the fifth most-populous city in the United States, behind New York, LA, Chicago and Houston. It surpasses Philadelphia (a milestone it hit briefly in the 2000s before falling back to No. 6). Most people in Seattle are likely to react to this news with ambivalence, if not overt horror. By contrast, Phoenix is celebrating madly, as this booster town always does for such numbers. (As a columnist there, I called these events “growthgasms,” which made me few friends.) The difference is explained by the fact that the overriding goal of Phoenix since the middle of the 20th century was to add people. “Growth pays for itself,” was the motto.

In 1950, when Seattle held 467,591 souls, Phoenix for the first time entered the ranks of the nation’s 100 largest cities — barely, at No. 99 with 106,818. It was smaller than Spokane, Wichita, Kan., or Dayton, Ohio. This Phoenix was a walkable oasis, 17 square miles, with a real downtown. It was surrounded by an agricultural empire made possible by rich soil, the confluence of rivers in a wet desert and federal reclamation. They called it “American Eden.” Otherwise, it had no Boeing, no port, no terminus of four transcontinental railroads. It had sunshine, land and more federal help in new defense industries and housing policy to subsidize suburban construction. Be careful what you wish for. The glorious citrus groves, flower fields, abundant shade trees and farms of American Eden are long gone, replaced by gravel, concrete and wide, dangerous avenues connecting real-estate developments. Also gone is most of a tech sector whose growth was neglected as the old stewards died off, replaced by land hustlers and inattention. It certainly doesn’t match the city or metro’s size. Almost all the economic activity of the metropolitan area has shifted to the car-dependent fringes, giving Phoenix some of the worst air quality in the nation. Although downtown has made a comeback, massive teardowns from the 1970s through 2000s destroyed its good bones and cohesion. A light-rail system is a victory — but it doesn’t go to most major employment centers. Those are strung out in freeway office “parks” — the taxpayer-funded freeways making former desert or farmland valuable. Despite aggressive annexation starting in the 1950s, Phoenix is surrounded by huge suburbs that cherry pick economic and cultural assets, engage in blood sport for sales taxes, stymie the more progressive city with their deep red politics, and hold much of the metro’s prosperity. The “Town” of Gilbert’s population is more than 237,000. Peoria, where the Mariners hold Spring Training, is more than 164,000, larger than Bellevue but all spread out. Peoria’s population was less than 4,800 in 1970, a farm town on the railroad. Phoenix, once so new, the city of tomorrow, is now hobbled by miles of linear slums — older single-family house subdivisions — and a massive underclass served, if that’s the word, by some of the most underfunded schools in the nation. Despite low social services, the city has a significant population of the diverse cohorts labeled “homeless.” Exclusive and wealthy Scottsdale sends street people to Phoenix toot sweet. In fact, growth does not pay for itself, particularly with low taxes and barely any impact fees. Population brings carrying costs to any metro area. Still, Phoenix has gotten away with its Ponzi scheme for decades. “People keep moving here, it can’t be too bad,” is the refrain of denial. Even being at the heart of the housing crash didn’t change the fundamental reliance on cheap housing, back-office jobs and sunshine. Good luck with that. Temperatures have gone up 10 degrees in my lifetime and Phoenix faces a dire future from climate change. Philadelphia, with major headquarters, world-class universities and cultural institutions, a spectacular downtown, an abundant rail transit network and proximity to New York City and Washington, D.C., will do fine. It’s a real city. Phoenix has many fighting for improvement, from small entrepreneurs to preservationists and a capable mayor. But they lack the ability to write checks and knock heads. It has no equivalent of Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Jeff Bezos. It has no sizable headquarters of a major worldwide company. The only real university is two branch campuses of Arizona State University. Attracting and retaining adults with bachelor’s degrees or higher (where it badly lags) is hampered by hard-right Arizona’s reputation for bigotry. While Seattle ranks at or near the top of almost any measure of quality, Phoenix almost never does. What Phoenix has is land — nearly 517 square miles in the city alone (vs. about 84 for Seattle) and an economy built around housing and real-estate speculation. Even so, it’s is not particularly affordable for most, especially in the most desirable areas, because wages are so low for such a large city and metro. As a fourth-generation Phoenician, I’m supposed to be bragging. We’re No. 5! Instead, I mourn what was lost and how so few there now even realize it. So in my way I feel your pain, old Seattleites. But don’t forget how many ways this city excels. Growth could be so much worse.   Jon Talton: jtalton@seattletimes.com; on Twitter: @jontalton.

The program aims to achieve a capability well out of reach today — launches to low Earth orbit in days, as compared to the months or years of preparation currently needed to get a single satellite on orbit. Success will depend upon significant advances in both technical capabilities and ground operations, but would revolutionize the Nation’s ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the Nation today is critically dependent. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional airplane nor a conventional launch vehicle but rather a combination of the two, with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten and replacing today’s frustratingly long wait time with launch on demand,” said Jess Sponable, DARPA program manager. “We’re very pleased with Boeing’s progress on the XS-1 through Phase 1 of the program and look forward to continuing our close collaboration in this newly funded progression to Phases 2 and 3 — fabrication and flight.” The XS-1 program envisions a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds. The vehicle would be launched with no external boosters, powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage able to deploy a 3,000-pound satellite to polar orbit. The reusable first stage would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. In its pursuit of aircraft-like operability, reliability, and cost-efficiency, DARPA and Boeing are planning to conduct a flight test demonstration of XS-1 technology, flying 10 times in 10 days, with an additional final flight carrying the upper-stage payload delivery system. If successful, the program could help enable a commercial service in the future that could operate with recurring costs of as little as $5 million or less per launch, including the cost of an expendable upper stage, assuming a recurring flight rate of at least ten flights per year — a small fraction of the cost of launch systems the U.S. military currently uses for similarly sized payloads. (Note that goal is for actual cost, not commercial price, which would be determined in part by market forces.) To achieve these goals, XS-1 designers plan to take advantage of technologies and support systems that have enhanced the reliability and fast turnaround of military aircraft. For example, easily accessible subsystem components configured as line replaceable units would be used wherever practical to enable quick maintenance and repairs. The XS-1 Phase 2/3 design also intends to increase efficiencies by integrating numerous state-of-the-art technologies, including some previously developed by DARPA, NASA, and the U.S. Air Force. For example, the XS-1 technology demonstrator’s propulsion system is an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). Other technologies in the XS-1 design include: *Advanced, lightweight composite cryogenic propellant tanks to hold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants *Hybrid composite-metallic wings and control surfaces able to withstand the physical stresses of suborbital hypersonic flight and temperatures of more than 2,000o F *Automated flight-termination and other technologies for autonomous flight and operations, including some developed by DARPA’s Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program XS-1 Phase 2 includes design, construction, and testing of the technology demonstration vehicle through 2019. It calls for initially firing the vehicle’s engine on the ground 10 times in 10 days to demonstrate propulsion readiness for flight tests. Phase 3 objectives include 12 to 15 flight tests, currently scheduled for 2020. After multiple shakedown flights to reduce risk, the XS-1 would aim to fly 10 times over 10 consecutive days, at first without payloads and at speeds as fast as Mach 5. Subsequent flights are planned to fly as fast as Mach 10, and deliver a demonstration payload between 900 pounds and 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. Another goal of the program is to encourage the broader commercial launch sector to adopt useful XS-1 approaches, processes, and technologies that facilitate launch on demand and rapid turnaround — important military and commercial needs for the 21st century. Toward that goal, DARPA intends to release selected data from its Phase 2/3 tests and will provide to all interested commercial entities the relevant specs for potential payloads. “We’re delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality,” said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO), which oversees XS-1. “Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities.” TAGS: InfoSharing, Spectrum, Telecommunications DARPA’s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program seeks to build and fly the first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would break the cycle of escalating launch costs and make possible a host of critical national security options. As the next step toward a future of routine, responsive, and low-cost space access, DARPA has awarded Phases 2 and 3 of the program to The Boeing Company.

In the Northeast, a spike in delays and cancellations was being reported at several of the region’s busiest airports, including those serving New York City and Boston. All three of the big New York City-area airports – JFK, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty – were among those seeing schedule disruptions.  Those airports are some of the most delay-prone in the United States, often experiencing flight backups even during moderate weather events. FLIGHT TRACKER: Is your flight on time? That was the case Thursday as rainy and cloudy weather moved across the region. Delays averaging anywhere from 30 minutes to three hours were being reported at LaGuarida, Newark and Philadelphia because of “weather/low ceilings” on Thursday afternoon, according to the Federal Aviation Administration’s flight-delay map. Delays at Boston were being reported for the same reason, with average slowdowns of up about three hours, according to the FAA. At JFK, the FAA cited runway construction as main culprit, though weather likely wasn’t helping either.

Nearly 10% of the entire day’s schedule had been canceled at the three New York City-area airports as of 1:15 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware.  Even more flights were delayed. About a quarter were running late at LaGaurdia and JFK while about 15% were off schedule at Newark. Cancellations were less of a problem at Boston, though nearly 1 out of every 5 flights was delayed as of 1:15 p.m., according to FlightAware. The low clouds were creating sporadic delays at Philadelphia, though – so far – disruptions there were more muted than in New York and in Boston. In Washington, thunderstorms blocking flight paths were creating sporadic delays at Washington Dulles. The Washington/Baltimore region remained under the threat of storms into the evening. In California, cloudy weather led to delays averaging about 40 minutes at San Francisco International, according to the FAA. Cancellations were not a major problem there, but delays were a nuisance. More than 5% of the day’s flights were running late, FlightAware said. At Los Angeles, an ongoing runway construction project was leading to slowdowns there. The FAA said delays were averaging about 45 minutes. FlightAware showed that more than 1 out of every 10 flights there was behind schedule as of 1:15 p.m. ET (10:15 a.m. PT).

The this part of North 23rd Street is located in the area for the proposed new campus of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com WASHINGTON • President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget includes almost $382 million to acquire land and begin construction of a new National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency complex in north St. Louis. The beginning of that NGA project, and a proposal to build a new hospital and “blood-processing center” at Fort Leonard Wood in the Ozarks, would make Missouri the top state for new military construction in the fiscal year that begins in October if Trump’s budget priorities are accepted. On top of a proposed $1.4 billion for 14 new FA/18 Super Hornet fighter jets and $874 million for 34,529 JDAM GPS-guided bombs, all built by Boeing in and around St. Louis, the region would reap a large taxpayer defense-spending benefit from Trump’s initial budgetary attempt to fulfill his promise to rebuild the military. Final budget numbers are a long way from set in stone, and members of Congress have indicated they are likely to make major changes, especially to significant cuts that Trump wants to make in domestic spending. “The president’s budget as we all know is a recommendation,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as he was flanked by other members of the Senate GOP leadership, including Roy Blunt of Missouri. “We will be taking into account what the president has recommended, but it will not be determinative in every respect.” Blunt said he was “encouraged” by Trump’s proposal on the NGA construction, and said it would be “one of my top priorities” as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The new NGA facility in St. Louis was approved under the administration of President Barack Obama. There is bipartisan agreement among Missouri members of Congress from the region that it needs to go forward as part of the nation’s defense in a world of escalating intelligence and terrorist threats. The total cost of the new facility, which will host 3,000 NGA employees in an urban setting, has been estimated to be about $1.75 billion. Members of the Illinois congressional delegation, who wanted the new NGA facility to be built near Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County, have previously said they would consider fighting appropriations for the St. Louis site. Rep. Mike Bost, R-Murphysboro, Ill., “maintains that the St. Clair County site adjacent to Scott Air Force Base in St. Clair County is the superior location for NGA-West from a public safety, mission synergy and taxpayer cost perspective,” Bost spokesman George O’Connor said. “He is continuing to monitor developments and will keep asking the tough questions as the budget and appropriations process unfolds.” Trump is proposing $811,000 for land acquisition and $381 million to begin construction in fiscal year 2018 for the NGA site. It’s part of an overall request of about $11.2 billion for new military site construction and military housing around the globe, some of which goes to locations that are classified, according to briefings by Pentagon officials this week. Of that, about $653 million would be spent in Missouri, trumping other states, such as California and Maryland, that have gotten large shares of military construction spending in recent budgets. For instance, in a budget blueprint provided by the Pentagon, the Department of Defense was slated to spend about $7.7 million for construction in Missouri in the current fiscal year, but more than $436 million in Maryland and $585 million in California. Trump’s 2018 budget would push Missouri to the top of the list. Military construction spending in Illinois is expected to be about $76 million this year, according to the department, but the Trump budget does not ask for any new dollars for 2018. Trump’s military construction request also asks for $10 million for a new communications center at the Rosecrans Memorial Airport near St. Joseph, Mo., which is home to the 139th Airlift Wing, the Advanced Airlift Tactics Training Center, and the Missouri Air National Guard. It requests $250 million for the first phase of a new hospital at Fort Leonard Wood, and just under $12 million for a “blood-processing center replacement” on the base, which is about 130 miles west of St. Louis.

The government has not yet secured clearance from the Public Investment Board (PIB) for the project, which is a prerequisite for the Centre to accord 20 per cent of its equity contribution to the ₹2,500-crore project. However, a silver lining is that a survey had been conducted for the construction of metro stations. As much as 10.05 hectares of land ,of which 1.5 hectares in private possession, have to be acquired for the project. Runway extension Similarly, the expansion of the Calicut International Airport has been hanging fire for quite some time. The delay in acquiring land is holding up the extension of the runway. The operation of Boeing B-747, B-777, and Airbus A-330 has been suspended since the tabletop runway is unsuited to handle wide-bodied aircraft under Code E. The Airports Authority of India has already informed the government that the future of the airport depends on acquiring land for extending the runway. Officials even have suggested that the government identify hills in Kozhikode, Palakkad and Malappuram districts to be razed for filling the valley. Road widening Another big project on the back burner is the widening of the Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu Road in the city. Here too, the problem is land acquisition estimated at a cost of ₹284 crore. Hitherto, a sum of ₹60 crore has been allotted by the government for the improvement of Malaparamba Junction. Widening the busy 8.4-km stretch of National Highway 212 (new NH 766) into a four-lane carriageway is required to curtail accidents and ease traffic congestions in the city. The annual budget presented by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had mentioned raising funds through Pravasi Chitty to construct coastal and hill highways. It had proposed to issue bonds to Non-Resident Indians for ₹10,000 crore through the newly created Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. Proposals such as to set up a ₹100-crore Advanced Technology Park at Ramanattukkara and Japanese-Korean industrial cluster in Mavoor have not even moved beyond the embryonic stage. However, the government managed to acquire land in different parts of Kozhikode for the Gas Authority of India Limited’s gas pipeline project despite resistance by local residents.

The aircraft will be the first of four tankers ordered by South Korea, which is the second Asian country to enrol in the A330 MRTT programme. The aircraft was favoured over Boeing’s KC46 and Israel Aerospace Industries’ 767 multi-mission tanker transport (MMTT). Work to transform the civilian A330 aircraft into an MRTT, which will include installation of refuelling systems and military avionics, will be carried out at the company’s facility in Getafe, Spain. Airbus on-going MRTT development project manager Nadège Berthelemy and Airbus DS A330 MRTT Korea programme manager Alvaro Irisarri jointly said that the latest A330-200 version will be fitted with additional capabilities such as the CATIIIB Autoland and other military features. The A330 MRTT was selected by South Korea in June 2015 as its future air-to-air refuelling and transport aircraft after an ‘open and objective competition’. "It can simultaneously perform a variety of missions such as air-to-air refuelling, cargo and passenger transport as well as medical evacuation, Airbus DS stated." The tanker aircraft can carry up to 111t of fuel and is capable of offloading 50,000kg of fuel to a broad range of receivers during a 4-hour loitering mission at over 1,000nm from its take-off point. It can simultaneously perform a variety of missions such as air-to-air refuelling, cargo and passenger transport as well as medical evacuation, Airbus DS stated. According to Airbus, A330 MRTT can trail four Eurofighters, carry 50 maintenance personnel, as well as 12t of equipment over 2,800nm with a single flight. The A330 MRTT features an advanced Airbus Defence and Space aerial refuelling boom system, and/or a pair of under-wing hose and drogue pods, and/or a fuselage refuelling unit.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 24 great B2B and B2C brand journalism sites Advocate Heath Care is asking whether breastfed babies are smarter. Semiconductor chip maker Intel has insights on the top five most impressive game explosions. Power drink maker Red Bull wants you to know about three generations of a high-flying family and its “skytyping” business. All three are examples of a trend that has accelerated in the past six years: brand journalism sites. Recently, I was asked for stellar examples. After hitting up several experts, I offer the list below. Why practice brand journalism? Ragan Communications chief executive Mark Ragan, a former national political reporter and an early advocate of brand journalism, offers his philosophy: Stop begging the media, and become the media yourself. “Newsrooms have been decimated,” Ragan says. “If you want your company’s story told, you’d better write it or shoot it yourself. “But brand journalism works only if your story is credible, is helpful to the reader and eschews all corporate-speak and jargon. If the story is self-serving or it is designed to sell, it’s not brand journalism. It’s marketing.” (Ragan heads Ragan Consulting Group, which works with businesses to establish brand journalism sites.) From videos to white papers David Meerman Scott , another early advocate, defines brand journalism as the creation of web content—videos, blog posts, photos, charts, graphs, essays, e-books, white papers—that deliver value to the marketplace and position organizations as worthy of doing business with. “Brand journalism is not a product pitch,” he says. “It is not an advertorial. It is not an egotistical spewing of gobbledygook-laden corporate drivel.” He adds that those with the traditional skills of marketing, public relations, advertising and copywriting are not the right people to create brand journalism content. “Instead, you need the skills of a journalist,” he says. [RELATED: Learn how to infuse storytelling and great writing into all your communications at the Business Writing Summit.] Here are the sites we came up with: B2B brand journalism The good news, for a B2B company, is that you needn’t sit out this trend as flashy B2C companies like Red Bull hog the limelight. Consider the following. Cisco Systems, the networking hardware company, covers everything from innovative technology hitting the theater stage to IT that skills offer opportunities for Jordanian women. American Express’ OPEN Forum started out as a forum for small businesses, but it has grown into a leading brand journalism site. And just how is virtual reality going to shape the future of consumer experiences? IQ by Intel, in showcasing technology, offers not only the explosions article, but one on athletes and fans preparing for an e-sports competition Down Under. Adobe’s CMO will fill you in about everything from artificial intelligence to the U.S. Census Bureau, all in an effort to interest potential customers in the marketing department. Guys, HSBC Global Connections (and your female colleagues) think it’s high time you figured out “What Women Want—And What Businesses Need To Know.” GE has experimented with polished Facebook Live-casts tied to the Rio Olympics and “drome week.” If you’ve ever wondered how pilots rescue people from an avalanche in the Italian Alps, here’s where to go. UPS’ Longitudes has hosted series on trade and offers a piece titled, “3D Printing—Evolution Rather than Revolution.” Boeing has provided a wealth of stories and videos for aviation fans. A Veterans Day feature might sound internal: “Corps Education: Employees share how lessons learned during militaryservice have helped them at Boeing.” Because the aerospace company’s customers include the Pentagon and many veterans in the airlines industry, it made sense as an outward-facing story, as well. Speaking of the Pentagon, Scott recommends the U.S. military’s Armed with Science site. Where else could you find out how the military is capturing sunlight at Nellis Air Force Base? B2C brand journalism Although giant consumer brands such as Coca-Cola were pathfinders in this area, many hospitals have joined the stampede as they find the public is eager for news about health care and healthy living.

Semiconductor chip maker Intel has insights on the top five most impressive game explosions. Power drink maker Red Bull wants you to know about three generations of a high-flying family and its “skytyping” business. All three are examples of a trend that has accelerated in the past six years: brand journalism sites. Recently, I was asked for stellar examples. After hitting up several experts, I offer the list below. Why practice brand journalism? Ragan Communications chief executive Mark Ragan, a former national political reporter and an early advocate of brand journalism, offers his philosophy: Stop begging the media, and become the media yourself. “Newsrooms have been decimated,” Ragan says. “If you want your company’s story told, you’d better write it or shoot it yourself. “But brand journalism works only if your story is credible, is helpful to the reader and eschews all corporate-speak and jargon. If the story is self-serving or it is designed to sell, it’s not brand journalism. It’s marketing.” (Ragan heads Ragan Consulting Group, which works with businesses to establish brand journalism sites.) From videos to white papers David Meerman Scott , another early advocate, defines brand journalism as the creation of web content—videos, blog posts, photos, charts, graphs, essays, e-books, white papers—that deliver value to the marketplace and position organizations as worthy of doing business with. “Brand journalism is not a product pitch,” he says. “It is not an advertorial. It is not an egotistical spewing of gobbledygook-laden corporate drivel.” He adds that those with the traditional skills of marketing, public relations, advertising and copywriting are not the right people to create brand journalism content. “Instead, you need the skills of a journalist,” he says. [RELATED: Learn how to infuse storytelling and great writing into all your communications at the Business Writing Summit.] Here are the sites we came up with: B2B brand journalism The good news, for a B2B company, is that you needn’t sit out this trend as flashy B2C companies like Red Bull hog the limelight. Consider the following. Cisco Systems, the networking hardware company, covers everything from innovative technology hitting the theater stage to IT that skills offer opportunities for Jordanian women. American Express’ OPEN Forum started out as a forum for small businesses, but it has grown into a leading brand journalism site. And just how is virtual reality going to shape the future of consumer experiences? IQ by Intel, in showcasing technology, offers not only the explosions article, but one on athletes and fans preparing for an e-sports competition Down Under. Adobe’s CMO will fill you in about everything from artificial intelligence to the U.S. Census Bureau, all in an effort to interest potential customers in the marketing department. Guys, HSBC Global Connections (and your female colleagues) think it’s high time you figured out “What Women Want—And What Businesses Need To Know.” GE has experimented with polished Facebook Live-casts tied to the Rio Olympics and “drome week.” If you’ve ever wondered how pilots rescue people from an avalanche in the Italian Alps, here’s where to go. UPS’ Longitudes has hosted series on trade and offers a piece titled, “3D Printing—Evolution Rather than Revolution.” Boeing has provided a wealth of stories and videos for aviation fans. A Veterans Day feature might sound internal: “Corps Education: Employees share how lessons learned during militaryservice have helped them at Boeing.” Because the aerospace company’s customers include the Pentagon and many veterans in the airlines industry, it made sense as an outward-facing story, as well. Speaking of the Pentagon, Scott recommends the U.S. military’s Armed with Science site. Where else could you find out how the military is capturing sunlight at Nellis Air Force Base? B2C brand journalism Although giant consumer brands such as Coca-Cola were pathfinders in this area, many hospitals have joined the stampede as they find the public is eager for news about health care and healthy living.

Search Watch Live Home Vote 2017 UK Brexit Trump World Business Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Sponsored By US government spaceplane contract awarded to Boeing The XS-1 spaceplane could "revolutionise" the ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites. 12:00, UK, Thursday 25 May 2017 Image: The XS-1 programme seeks to build and fly a new class of hypersonic aircraft to launch satellites cheaply Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail Designs for an unmanned, reusable spaceplane have been commissioned by America's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. Boeing will be completing the advanced design work for the Experimental Spaceplane XS-1 programme run by the agency, which is part of the US Department of Defense. The programme aims to create a new class of hypersonic aircraft that would bolster national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space. XS-1 will allow launches to low-Earth orbit in a matter of days, compared with the months or even years of preparation currently needed to get a single satellite into orbit. Its recurring costs could be as low as $5m per launch. Currently, the cheapest low-Earth orbit launches are provided by Elon Musk's SpaceX and can cost around $60m, depending on the mission. The project is ambitious and requires "significant advances in both technical capabilities and ground operations," according to DARPA. If it is successful it would "revolutionise" the US' "ability to recover from a catastrophic loss of military or commercial satellites, upon which the nation today is critically dependent." It aims to build a fully reusable unmanned vehicle, roughly the size of a business jet, which would take off vertically like a rocket and fly to hypersonic speeds. The vehicle would be launched with no external boosters, powered solely by self-contained cryogenic propellants. Upon reaching a high suborbital altitude, the booster would release an expendable upper stage which could deploy a 1,360kg satellite to polar orbit - an orbit in which the satellite passes above both of the Earth's poles. After deploying the satellite, the reusable first stage of the spaceplane would then bank and return to Earth, landing horizontally like an aircraft, and be prepared for the next flight, potentially within hours. To test the spaceplane, DARPA and Boeing are planning to conduct a demonstration of XS-1 technology, flying 10 times in 10 days, with an additional final flight carrying the upper-stage payload delivery system. "We're delighted to see this truly futuristic capability coming closer to reality," said Brad Tousley, director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office, which oversees XS-1. "Demonstration of aircraft-like, on-demand, and routine access to space is important for meeting critical Defense Department needs and could help open the door to a range of next-generation commercial opportunities."

The unmanned jet will fly to suborbital heights before deploying an expendable upper stage, which would carry a payload into low-Earth orbit. The plane is then able to return to Earth and land like a conventional aircraft. “The XS-1 would be neither a traditional aeroplane nor a conventional launch vehicle, but rather a combination of the two – with the goal of lowering launch costs by a factor of ten,” said DARPA. DARPA and Boeing plan to conduct a flight test of the XS-1 space plane, flying it 10 times in 10 days, with initial engine tests set to start in 2019. Full test flights of the XS-1 will commence in 2020.

(Propeller Airports) In Our View Editorial: Alaska flights from Paine Field offer opportunity Thu May 25th, 2017 1:30am Opinion You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By The Herald Editorial Board Next month, Propeller Airports expects to break ground on a planned two-gate passenger terminal at Paine Field Airport that would allow as many as 24 flights a day of regular commercial service from the Snohomish County-owned facility. But until last week, Propeller had no commitment from any airline to offer service from the airport that handles about 100,000 flights a year, from single-engine private aircraft up to Boeing’s largest jetliners built next door. Earlier proposals to build a terminal and offer passenger service stalled when two airlines that looked at Paine Field — Allegiant and Horizon — appeared to lose interest following the recession. That changed last week when Alaska Airlines announced plans to offer up to nine flights a day from Paine Field beginning in fall 2018, flying Boeing 737s and 76-passenger Embraer 175 shorter-range planes. Coming from a growing airline, having last year absorbed competitor Virgin America, Alaska’s announcement is an endorsement of the potential it sees in Paine Field to help it continue its expansion. Alaska is dealing with increased traffic at Sea-Tac International Airport that could limit its plans. For as long as commercial service has been suggested for Paine Field, debate has flown regularly between those who see economic and other advantages and those concerned about negative impacts for noise and traffic. There’s excitement among supporters, who already are speculating as to which destinations Alaska might announce early next year. As reported earlier this week by The Herald’s Noah Haglund, business interests, including the county’s aerospace and medical device manufacturers, have interest in service to several West Coast cities, including Portland — a national hub for Alaska — San Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles and San Diego, a fellow Navy town. Spokane, with its fledgling medical school at Washington State University, makes sense as a connection to Everett and its WSU North Puget Sound campus. Flights to Hawaii would attract interest from sun-starved residents, though Alaska already offers flights from Bellingham to Kona on the big island and Kahului on Maui. The county’s own tourism industry would benefit from connections closer than Seattle and a traffic-choked I-5. Skipping the commute to Seattle also would be a boon to local travelers who, for some West Coast airports, spend more time on the road to Sea-Tac than they do in the air. Mukilteo officials and residents, neighbors to Paine Field, have seen more cause for concern than enthusiasm, but so far have not been successful in court challenges to the county’s lease to Propeller or the Federal Aviation Administration’s decision in 2012 that limited service would not have significant impacts to the neighboring community. Federal and state courts of appeal have turned back the challenges, including a ruling from a state court in January that there were no issues of material fact that could be argued in trial. This isn’t to say Mukilteo residents and officials and others do not have legitimate concerns, but addressing them directly with the county administration and Propeller could offer a better opportunity for resolving those issues. In fact, discussions already are under way between the city and Propeller that could limit noise impacts by adjusting flight paths and flight arrival and departure times. Mukilteo is also addressing traffic concerns through its Harbor Reach Corridor project to create an alternate route to Highway 525 by connecting Beverly Park Road to Harbour Pointe Boulevard, with $15.1 million in state transportation funding and $1 million from the city’s traffic mitigation impact fees. Trying to put the brakes on development of a transportation link such as Paine Field might shift the impacts elsewhere, but it would deprive the county of opportunities to foster employment and address the impacts of growth that we already are dealing with.   Most Read Data: Opioid epidemic still rampant in Snohomish County EVERETT — Snohomish County recorded the state’s second-highest number of fentanyl deaths… May 24th, 2017 by Sharon Salyer Julie Muhlstein Robert Nord, longtime CEO of Everett door company, dies Robert Nord was the scion of a family whose business was once… May 24th, 2017 by Julie Muhlstein Bothell woman bakes braided bread, other Scandinavian treats Joyce Sieben’s home sits in an average north Bothell cul-de-sac.

IranAir has agreed to buy a total of 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft worth a total of $35 billion — $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 passenger jets from Boeing, 100 from its European rival Airbus and 20 turboprop planes from Franco-Italian supplier ATR. All of the aircraft need U.S. export licenses.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to end India’s role as the world’s largest arms importer by asking foreign firms to share technology with local players and then manufacture in India – in return for a slice of the $250 billion analysts estimate New Delhi will spend on its military over the next decade. Under the “Strategic Partnership” model, the government will shortlist and then pick Indian companies to join forces with foreign firms. The winners will be guaranteed billions of dollars of orders to incentivise them to manufacture. “For each platform, one private sector strategic partner will be chosen,” Defence Minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after a cabinet meeting. “You don’t set up a manufacturing facility if you don’t have any hope of getting orders.” Government and industry representatives have been haggling over the details of the model for more than a year, delaying discussions for tens of billions of dollars worth of deals. Indian defence manufacturing is small and dominated by state-run outfits, many of which have been criticised for poor performance. Private firms such as Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra Group, Tata Group and recent entrants Reliance Group and Adani Group are desperate to muscle in on their business. Indian Navy’s Scorpene submarine INS Kalvari. Reuters Indian Navy’s Scorpene submarine INS Kalvari. Reuters Foreign manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus and Saab also see India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Modi was keen to get the project approved before he travels next Monday to Germany, France, Spain and Russia, where buying weapons will be high on the agenda. Among the long-awaited orders that executives hope the new policy could kick-start are a multi-billion-dollar submarine tender and another for a large number of single-engine fighter jets the Indian Air Force says it needs. Lockheed Martin and Saab are in the race for the fighter jets, while companies in Germany, Spain, Russia and France are likely to be interested in the submarine tender. Actual orders could still be years away, as India’s procurement process often moves slowly and specific details of how the policy will work have yet to be released. In June, Modi is also expected to visit the United States, which has emerged as one of the top arms suppliers to India in recent years. Final details India wants to replicate other countries that have used state policy to build leading defence firms. Some executives and analysts have said the new policy could undermine competition and hand winning Indian firms a virtual monopoly, but the government decided it has reached enough of a consensus to push the policy through. “We see the policy as doing something good for indigenisation,” Jayant Patil, Head of Defence and Aerospace at Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest private sector engineering firm, told Reuters. Patil said that industry representatives had raised concerns in recent meetings about how the policy would be structured, specifically on the financial and technical criteria used for selecting partners. “The final details are still awaited. We discussed some roadblocks but we hope they will be addressed,” he said. Larsen’s “unmatched competency” lay in submarines, Patil said, suggesting it would focus on winning that strategic partnership. Some Indian companies are unhappy with a rule restricting them to becoming a strategic partner in just one of four sectors that will be the first covered by the policy – submarines, fighter jets, helicopters and armoured vehicles. Companies such as Reliance, a newcomer to defence, had laid out ambitious plans to build anything from submarines to helicopters and missiles, but the strategic partnership model will likely force it to narrow its focus. Tata, Mahindra and Reliance have all invested money in building helicopters. According to draft guidelines of the model seen by Reuters, the government will use a range of technical and financial criteria to shortlist six Indian companies and several foreign players. The two groups of companies will then begin talks to pitch jointly to the government, with New Delhi choosing the winning team, based in part on how much technology the foreign companies are prepared to transfer to their Indian partners. “With all the effort that has gone into finalising the policy, it can potentially be a turning point in India’s endeavour to have a robust homegrown private defence industrial base,” said Pierre de Bausset, President of Airbus in India. “We will assess the policy fine print when it is released.

The distinctive twin-engine fighter, a version of the F/A-18 Hornet produced by McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, is the backbone of the RCAF, and will be one of the stars of the extensive static display in the air show at RAF Scampton on September 9 and 10. Thousands of Canadian airmen were based in Lincolnshire during the war, serving within the RAF's Bomber Command, Coastal Command and Fighter Command.

Three land-based Canadian Coastal Command squadrons were located in Lincolnshire at RAF North Coates and RAF Strubby, and many of the RCAF's Fighter Command units were based in the area for periods of the war.

Airshow director Paul Sall said: "The history between Lincolnshire and the Royal Canadian Air Force is undeniably strong, with many Canadian Air Force personnel based in the county through the Second World War. "The connection with RAF Scampton is particularly of note, with 30 members of the legendary 617 'Dambusters' Squadron being Royal Canadian Air Force. "To confirm the Royal Canadian Air Force will be sending a CF-18 Hornet to be part of the inaugural Scampton Airshow is just magnificent and reinforces the long-standing relationship with Lincolnshire. "We're yet to receive confirmation which unit will be sending the CF-18 but we're all keeping our fingers' crossed, that given its links with the county, it will come from 401 Squadron." Scampton Airshow tickets can only be purchased in advance at www.scamptonairshow.com. Tickets are priced at £39, with all under-16s able to enjoy the airshow free when accompanied by an adult ticket-holder.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 25 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 4 Distinguished Organizations Identified as National Models for Innovation + Inclusion Leadership The Society for Diversity will recognize the winners of the Innovation + Inclusion Leadership Awards at the Diversity 3.0 Conference in Chicago CHICAGO, IL, UNITED STATES, May 24, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — For the last 8 years, the Society for Diversity (SFD) has recognized the work of outstanding organizations and individuals who have demonstrated excellence in employment equity and workplace inclusion. During SFD’s annual conference at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place in Chicago, Innovation + Inclusion Leadership Awards will be conferred in 4 categories on June 28th. The selected individuals and organizations serve as national models for getting better outcomes from the investment in workplace diversity and inclusion. What has been unique about SFD’s awards is that its national nomination and selection process is completely practitioner led. The Society for Diversity, the #1 global professional association for diversity and inclusion, acknowledges that the quality of equity work has evolved and improved over the years. Therefore, in 2017, SFD added „innovation” to the award to signify how collaboration, new strategies, and technology have changed equity, diversity and inclusion work. The 2017 award winners are: – Individual category: Nzinga C. Shaw, Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer of the Atlanta Hawks Basketball Club – Corporate category: Veterans United Home Loans (VUHL) – Nonprofit category: The Institute for Sustainable Diversity & Inclusion – Education category: Kent State University Andrea Brandon, Society for Diversity Staff Liaison to the Awards Committee, noted that there were several characteristics that stood out about the award winners. Brandon said, „Nzinga Shaw’s leadership as a Diversity & Inclusion Officer has resulted in major changes in the Atlanta Hawks organization, and her work has served as a blueprint for changes in the NBA. Despite the odds being against her as a young, African American woman, Nzinga’s tenacity to see change has paid off and it enables her to stand out above the rest.” Each of the awards recipients have amazing stories to share, and have demonstrated success in a way that can be replicated nationally. For example, Effenus Henderson, Co-Founder at the Institute for Sustainable Diversity and Inclusion, is the former Chief Diversity Officer for Weyerhaeuser, where he worked for 40 years. As a thought-leader, Mr. Henderson has held numerous board level positions, as well as served as the Co-Chair for the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) Diversity and Inclusion Standards Taskforce. The Institute for Sustainable Diversity and Inclusion created a collaborative learning model in partnership with major northwest firms such as Nordstrom, Boeing, Alaska Airlines, T-Mobile, Port of Seattle and more, in order to leverage transformative education and practical tools to address emerging issues in inclusive work environments. Likewise, Kent State University developed an interactive Education and Training Lab that features simulations and intercultural assessment tools to facilitate dialogue and workshops for its 2,200 faculty, staff and students. It was so successful, that the University extended its work to over 500 community-based leaders and partners. Loreli Wilson, Manager of Diversity and Inclusion at Veterans United Home Loans (VUHL), had already implemented several robust diversity interventions when she achieved her Certified Diversity Professional (CDP) Credential from SFD’s Institute for Diversity Certification in 2016. Brandon notes, „VUHL’s overall ability to increase racial diversity and improve their new employee tracking efforts have worked to ensure that employees are not expected to ‚fit’ BEFORE they start working, but that they are engaged to ‚fit’ into a great professional environment, and stay with the company, AFTER they are hired.” Other honorable award nominees include: Gail B. Williams, Hodges University; James Banks, Suffolk County Community College; Felicia Johnson, Goodyear; Sayumi Irey, Bellevue College Social Justice Leadership Institute; Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant, University of Vermont; Eric Guthrie, BetterMEBetterWE; Mission Hospital; Empowerment Through Integration (ETI); and INROADS, Inc. Leah Smiley, President of the Society for Diversity, asserts, „I have personally worked with many of the nominees so I know choosing a winner was a difficult decision. Nevertheless, what makes this awards process organic is the fact that people who work in the field are making the decisions and determining what is most important in advancing this work around the world.” Angela Winfield, Director of the Department of Inclusion and Workforce Diversity at Cornell University and Nikki McGruder, Regional Manager at Diversity Awareness Partnership, served as the Awards Committee co-chairs. The committee evaluated the following criterion in making their decision: – Use of innovative or advanced equity, diversity and inclusion technology – Next generation strategies for inclusion or culture change – Enterprise-wide or management learning/collaboration – Revenue generation or cost savings from equity, diversity and inclusion efforts Winfield said, „The award recipients demonstrated clear, measurable and significant impact. In the diversity and inclusion space, it is easy to be lulled into thinking it is all about increasing awareness and how employees feel, which certainly is important, but it is at least equally important to get tangible results. By designing innovative approaches and programs aimed at making a measurable difference, we advance not only diversity and inclusion, but also our organizations. Each of the award recipients has done just this and moved into a brave new space where diversity and inclusion is bringing benefit to everyone involved.” McGruder added, „Being clear and intentional about driving forward diversity and inclusion goals was the main motivator for the choices I made for award recipients. Being creative in the approach to providing education, training and opportunities to create inclusive environments is what all organizations should be striving for. These recipients have figured out that we can no longer just talk about diversity in a „pie in the sky” way. They are about doing the work to get it done.” Smiley concurs, „The conversation about diversity and inclusion has to move beyond a simplistic discussion about race, gender or political correctness, towards innovations, strategies and skills that get meaningful and intentional results. This is the overarching purpose of the Diversity 3.0 conference.” The awards dinner will be held on Wednesday, June 28th from 6:00pm to 8:00pm and Laura I. Gomez, Founder of Silicon Valley’s Atipica, is scheduled to give a keynote address. Conference attendees will represent diversity and human resource executives from 3 countries and 27 states.

Dedrone currently is headquartered in San Francisco and has operations in Kassel, Germany. The addition of former military advisors and expansion to the D.C. market represents the drone security company’s commitment to protecting federal airspace and operations from all drone threats. Lisa Meserve joins Dedrone as a Federal Sales Manager. Meserve is a U.S. Air Force veteran, having served for over 13 years. She was a government contractor, and DoD civilian for Air Force Space Command before her passion for the startup world was ignited, and she joined SecureLogix Corporation. She comes to Dedrone from Globalscape. Phillip Pitsky joins Dedrone as the Federal Business Development Lead. Before Dedrone, Phil worked for The Boeing Company for more than eight years where he held various roles in strategic development and management positions. Phil served in the U.S. Navy for more than ten years as a Cryptologic Collection Operator where prior assignments included the Naval Security Group Activity Kunia, HI and the USS Gettysburg (CG64) where he deployed to the Persian Gulf, Northern Atlantic, and Eastern Pacific in support of Global War on Terrorism. “Dedrone’s system is designed to be accessible and integrated for individuals, enterprises, and militaries, and bringing on Phil and Lisa to the team advances our knowledge of the needs of federal agencies, intelligence providers, and national defense leaders, and find the best way to provide them custom solutions,” shares Joerg Lamprecht, CEO and co-founder of Dedrone. “Our commercial, off-the-shelf software is a proven drone detection system, unlike any that is on the market. We’re acutely aware of the rise in drone terrorism across the world, and we look forward to working with new partners and customers in the federal space to combine efforts and protect our airspace from all drone threats.” David Prantl, Dedrone’s Vice President of Technology, will be heading operations in Washington, D.C., where he will coordinate with Meserve and Pitsky to expand the startup’s presence and service to the federal market. Prantl joined Dedrone in January 2016 and was previously based in the company’s office in Kassel, Germany. “Dedrone’s offering is the nexus between physical, cyber and airspace security, and it’s the next frontier of communications technology,” shares Dedrone Vice President of Business Development, Sebastian Blum. “With the rise in drone technology, there is a clear connection between rogue, hacker drones and the security gaps that now exist for enterprises and government administrations, including the U.S. military. That is why we’ve brought on Lisa and Phil to the team, and expanded our on-ground operations for government service providers.” About Dedrone Dedrone is the international market and technology leader in the field of drone detection. DroneTracker, which was developed by Dedrone, provides early warning of illegal UAVs and is used to protect industrial plants, government buildings and other critical infrastructure installations against smugglers, spies, and terrorist attacks. Dedrone, based in San Francisco, California, was founded in 2014 by the serial entrepreneurs Joerg Lamprecht, Rene Seeber and Ingo Seebach, and has the backing of reputable international investors.

The order comprises four planes from the A320 NEO family and two Airbus A330-900 aircraft, the leasing company said in a statement. "All six Airbus aircraft have been committed for lease to Portugal's flag-carrier TAP Portugal and will be delivered between 2018 and 2020," BOC said in a statement. Steven Townend, chief commercial officer for Europe, the Americas and Africa at BOC, said the deal with TAP Portugal "represents yet another new European customer" that will help it further expand its portfolio.

In January last year, it announced an order for 30 Airbus A320s worth more than $3 billion to meet growing demand. In March this year, it announced an order for 13 new Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes worth a total of $1.4 billion. This was on top of an order announced in November 2015 for 22 Boeing 737 planes worth $2.27 billion. The single-aisle A320 and B737 families are popular choices among low-cost carriers.

A man and a woman were shot and transported to the hospital. The woman died at the hospital. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com St. Louis County police have charged and were looking Thursday night for a suspect in a fatal shooting that police believe was linked to one in St. Louis earlier in the day. Two people were killed and one critically injured in the separate shootings. St. Louis County police said Casey Lowery, 36, has been charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting in the 3600 block of Dunn Road. +6  Casey Lowery is charged with murder in the first degree and one count of armed criminal action in St. Louis County. “Detectives believe Lowery is leaving the St. Louis area,” a press release from county police said. “We have information that Lowery was last seen in the area of New Haven, Missouri. Lowery should be considered armed and dangerous. Do not approach Lowery, and contact the police department immediately.” New Haven is in Franklin County, about 60 miles west of St. Louis. Lowery’s address is in the 1100 block of Howell Street in St. Louis. That address is a block from the scene of the first fatal shooting. About 8:30 a.m., a man shot a homeowner in the head in an alley in the 1100 block of Canaan Avenue, critically injuring him in front of an Ameren subcontractor. When police arrived, they found a woman who had been shot nearby. She was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The woman was identified as Keiva Jones, 29. She lived in the same block as the shooting. The homeowner, a man in his 50s, was in critical and unstable condition at a hospital. Witnesses told police the victims were in a relationship, according to a source. St. Louis police have not identified the suspect but say they believe he is 36 years old. About 8:45 a.m. and about four miles away, a gunman opened fire on a vehicle on a Conoco gas station parking lot in unincorporated St. Louis County, wounding a motorist. He died at a nearby hospital, police said. After the shots were fired, both the shooter’s vehicle and victim’s vehicle were seen driving off the lot in the 3600 block of Dunn Road. The victim, a man, was shot at least once, according to St. Louis County police. Police do not know how many people were inside either vehicle when the shooting occurred. In both the Baden and St. Louis County cases, the shooter’s vehicle was described as a mid-’90s blue pickup with a camper shell, prompting police to believe the shootings may be connected. Specifically, the shooter’s vehicle is described as a 1990 gray or blue Chevrolet Silverado, with Missouri license plate 3FT420 and running boards, paint oxidation and rust on the roof and camper shell. Security officers at Boeing in Berkeley called Berkeley police shortly after 9 a.m. to report that a truck had “blown through” several security checkpoints, said Police Chief Art Jackson. The driver did not cause any damage and escaped. The truck matched the description of the shooter’s vehicle that St. Louis County police then shared with surrounding agencies, Jackson said. St. Louis police spokeswoman Leah Freeman said in a statement that police believe the shootings are connected. Lt. John Green, commander of the St. Louis Police Department’s homicide division, gave this account of the Baden shooting: The utility worker, an electrician, showed up at a home on Canaan after a homeowner complained about a burned-out street light in the alley. The worker talked to the homeowner and they stood in the alley looking at the light that needed repairs. Another man, who was a stranger to the utility worker, walked up and began talking to the homeowner. The two men shook hands and talked as if they knew each other. The man who had just walked up pulled a gun and fired a shot at the broken light. “You didn’t need to do that,” the utility worker told the shooter. He told the gunman that he was preparing to fix it. With that, the shooter fired his gun at the homeowner, striking him in the head, and the worker ran to his truck to escape, Green said. The utility worker parked a block or two away, in a spot he considered safe, so he could make a phone call. He had the homeowner’s cellphone number from the work order form, so he tried calling the homeowner. When he looked up, the shooter was standing outside his vehicle. The shooter demanded his phone, then drove away. The utility worker returned to the scene about two hours later to walk the alley with detectives, describing the incident. The woman’s body was found by police when they arrived to investigate. The worker never saw the woman, and police have found no witnesses to her shooting, Green said. Neighbors said the male victim was known on the block to cut people’s grass and hold weekend parties to keep neighborhood children entertained. His home on Canaan, with a small blue plastic pool in the side yard, is about three houses from the vacant lot where he was shot. Crime in the Baden neighborhood is up nearly 25 percent in the last six months from the same period a year earlier. Anyone with information about Lowery’s whereabouts or the shootings is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 1-866-371-8477. Rewards of up to $5,000 are offered for tips.

Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com St. Louis County police have charged and were looking Thursday night for a suspect in a fatal shooting that police believe was linked to one in St. Louis earlier in the day. Two people were killed and one critically injured in the separate shootings. St. Louis County police said Casey Lowery, 36, has been charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting in the 3600 block of Dunn Road. +6  Casey Lowery is charged with murder in the first degree and one count of armed criminal action in St. Louis County. “Detectives believe Lowery is leaving the St. Louis area,” a press release from county police said. “We have information that Lowery was last seen in the area of New Haven, Missouri. Lowery should be considered armed and dangerous. Do not approach Lowery, and contact the police department immediately.” New Haven is in Franklin County, about 60 miles west of St. Louis. Lowery’s address is in the 1100 block of Howell Street in St. Louis. That address is a block from the scene of the first fatal shooting. About 8:30 a.m., a man shot a homeowner in the head in an alley in the 1100 block of Canaan Avenue, critically injuring him in front of an Ameren subcontractor. When police arrived, they found a woman who had been shot nearby. She was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The woman was identified as Keiva Jones, 29. She lived in the same block as the shooting. The homeowner, a man in his 50s, was in critical and unstable condition at a hospital. Witnesses told police the victims were in a relationship, according to a source. St. Louis police have not identified the suspect but say they believe he is 36 years old. About 8:45 a.m. and about four miles away, a gunman opened fire on a vehicle on a Conoco gas station parking lot in unincorporated St. Louis County, wounding a motorist. He died at a nearby hospital, police said. After the shots were fired, both the shooter’s vehicle and victim’s vehicle were seen driving off the lot in the 3600 block of Dunn Road. The victim, a man, was shot at least once, according to St. Louis County police. Police do not know how many people were inside either vehicle when the shooting occurred. In both the Baden and St. Louis County cases, the shooter’s vehicle was described as a mid-’90s blue pickup with a camper shell, prompting police to believe the shootings may be connected. Specifically, the shooter’s vehicle is described as a 1990 gray or blue Chevrolet Silverado, with Missouri license plate 3FT420 and running boards, paint oxidation and rust on the roof and camper shell. Security officers at Boeing in Berkeley called Berkeley police shortly after 9 a.m. to report that a truck had “blown through” several security checkpoints, said Police Chief Art Jackson. The driver did not cause any damage and escaped. The truck matched the description of the shooter’s vehicle that St. Louis County police then shared with surrounding agencies, Jackson said. St. Louis police spokeswoman Leah Freeman said in a statement that police believe the shootings are connected. Lt. John Green, commander of the St. Louis Police Department’s homicide division, gave this account of the Baden shooting: The utility worker, an electrician, showed up at a home on Canaan after a homeowner complained about a burned-out street light in the alley. The worker talked to the homeowner and they stood in the alley looking at the light that needed repairs. Another man, who was a stranger to the utility worker, walked up and began talking to the homeowner. The two men shook hands and talked as if they knew each other. The man who had just walked up pulled a gun and fired a shot at the broken light. “You didn’t need to do that,” the utility worker told the shooter. He told the gunman that he was preparing to fix it. With that, the shooter fired his gun at the homeowner, striking him in the head, and the worker ran to his truck to escape, Green said. The utility worker parked a block or two away, in a spot he considered safe, so he could make a phone call. He had the homeowner’s cellphone number from the work order form, so he tried calling the homeowner. When he looked up, the shooter was standing outside his vehicle. The shooter demanded his phone, then drove away. The utility worker returned to the scene about two hours later to walk the alley with detectives, describing the incident. The woman’s body was found by police when they arrived to investigate. The worker never saw the woman, and police have found no witnesses to her shooting, Green said. Neighbors said the male victim was known on the block to cut people’s grass and hold weekend parties to keep neighborhood children entertained. His home on Canaan, with a small blue plastic pool in the side yard, is about three houses from the vacant lot where he was shot. Crime in the Baden neighborhood is up nearly 25 percent in the last six months from the same period a year earlier. Anyone with information about Lowery’s whereabouts or the shootings is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 1-866-371-8477. Rewards of up to $5,000 are offered for tips.

By 2025, industrial robots are expected to perform 25 percent of tasks such as assembly, packaging, and material handling. "Instead of these old factories that are very laborious and have a lot of big machinery, manufacturing is going to look more like software, and have machines that are running off of digital files," said Jonathan Schwartz of Voodoo Manufacturing, a 3-D printing company in Brooklyn, New York. Schwartz and fellow co-founder Max Friefeld rely on 160 3-D printers to manufacture nearly 50 different projects, from key chains to T-Rex shower heads, all at once.

"3-D printing used to be 10 units, 20 unit prototypes. Now we do thousands for every order." The Rebirth of Manufacturing Bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. is a top priority for President Donald Trump, who has made "Buy American, Hire American" a key element in his pro-business agenda. However, the manufacturing industry is no longer what it used to be. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 4.9 million manufacturing jobs have disappeared in the past 20 years — in part because of increased automation. Industry executives say today's manufacturing is about collaboration with innovation, and learning to work hand in hand with robots. Helping to take Voodoo to the next level of a modern-day factory is Jim Allen, director of manufacturing. "I think they're gonna adapt," he said of traditional manufacturing businesses. "There are examples of companies that have been tool and die, automotive, and other industries where [now] they're using robotics." Robots Create Jobs Voodoo isn't the only manufacturing company taking the leap into 3-D printing. Big brands such as GE, Adidas, Boeing, Ford, Nike, Hasbro, and Hershey's are also integrating the technology into their products. The fear of robots replacing humans in the manufacturing industry is a growing concern for millions of unemployed Americans. But Allen says there is a silver lining that comes with technological advances. "Because of automation, we're increasing our productivity. We're able to get more products out there at a lower cost at higher quality. Being able to do that increases demand, increased demand creates more jobs — so it's a self-fulfilling cycle of creating more jobs," said Allen. "We have to be competitive with the other processes and other countries. And that enables us to create more jobs."

The Electron rocket, powered by its 3D-printed Rutherford engine, made it into space - the first time anywhere in the world a rocket capable of reaching orbit has been launched from a private space facility, specifically the Mahia Peninsula in Hawke's Bay. "It has been an incredible day and I'm immensely proud of our talented team," said Peter Beck, Rocket Lab chief executive and founder. The fact something didn't quite go to plan, preventing the rocket from entering orbit, is likely to only be a small speed bump. "I know first-hand how incredibly hard it is to get something to space - a million things have to go right," said Dr George Sowers, former chief scientist of Boeing and Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. "As a matter of statistics, the general record of the launch industry for first flights of a new rocket is around 50 percent. Success was certainly not guaranteed." Electron rocket (Rocket Lab / Facebook) Considering Rocket Lab's small team and their use of an all-new type of rocket and engine, that they made it into space on the first go was impressive enough, said Richard Easther, professor of physics at the University of Auckland. "Achieving orbit on the first try would be a fairytale result with any completely new launch vehicle, and Rocket Lab came tantalizingly close to pulling this off. This will stand as a major accomplishment." Mr Beck says Rocket Lab will now be poring over the data to find out what didn't work. "We have learnt so much through this test launch and will learn even more in the weeks to come." Two more test flights are scheduled this year. Do Rocket Lab's finances stack up? Kris Walsh, former project manager at United Launch Alliance and NASA launch director said Rocket Lab's decision to focus on smaller payloads - when compared with the likes of SpaceX - is not just good from a practical perspective, but a commercial one. "If Rocket Lab can quickly get reliable, on time launches, they can capture a market ignored by the current industry." Dr Sowers however says Rocket Lab will need to upscale its payloads if it hopes to remain commercially viable. "The southern latitude limits customers to high inclination orbits, precluding a portion of the market. It is also a long journey for American or European customers, representing most of the market." He also foresees strong competition from India and China. "If Rocket Lab succeeds, they will be the first commercial company to do so in the small market. Many have failed, including SpaceX, who discontinued the Falcon 1 small launcher after only a handful of launches." Newshub.

The driver did not cause any damage and escaped. The truck matched the description of the shooter’s vehicle that St. Louis County police then shared with surrounding agencies, Jackson said. St. Louis police spokeswoman Leah Freeman said in a statement that police believe the shootings are connected. Lt. John Green, commander of the St. Louis Police Department’s homicide division, gave this account of the Baden shooting: The utility worker, an electrician, showed up at a home on Canaan after a homeowner complained about a burned-out street light in the alley. The worker talked to the homeowner and they stood in the alley looking at the light that needed repairs. Another man, who was a stranger to the utility worker, walked up and began talking to the homeowner. The two men shook hands and talked as if they knew each other. The man who had just walked up pulled a gun and fired a shot at the broken light. “You didn’t need to do that,” the utility worker told the shooter. He told the gunman that he was preparing to fix it. With that, the shooter fired his gun at the homeowner, striking him in the head, and the worker ran to his truck to escape, Green said. The utility worker parked a block or two away, in a spot he considered safe, so he could make a phone call. He had the homeowner’s cellphone number from the work order form, so he tried calling the homeowner. When he looked up, the shooter was standing outside his vehicle. The shooter demanded his phone, then drove away. The utility worker returned to the scene about two hours later to walk the alley with detectives, describing the incident. The woman’s body was found by police when they arrived to investigate. The worker never saw the woman, and police have found no witnesses to her shooting, Green said. Neighbors said the male victim was known on the block to cut people’s grass and hold weekend parties to keep neighborhood children entertained. His home on Canaan, with a small blue plastic pool in the side yard, is about three houses from the vacant lot where he was shot. Crime in the Baden neighborhood is up nearly 25 percent in the last six months from the same period a year earlier. Anyone with information about Lowery’s whereabouts or the shootings is asked to call CrimeStoppers at 1-866-371-8477. Rewards of up to $5,000 are offered for tips.

Under the new Strategic Partnership model, the government will pick Indian firms to tie up with foreign organisations to manufacture fighter jets, armoured vehicles, helicopters and submarines locally. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has raised the limit on foreign investment in the defence sector, and pushed tie-ups between foreign and local firms under the "Make in India" manufacturing campaign. "The new policy will give a substantial boost to domestic manufacturing and service provision, thereby creating employment," a government statement said. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up "Preference in government procurement will be given to local suppliers," it added. India has been investing tens of billions in updating its Soviet-era military hardware to counter longstanding tensions with regional rivals China and Pakistan. But Mr Modi has said he wants to end India's status as the world's No.1 defence importer, and have 70 per cent of hardware made domestically by the turn of the decade. Mr Modi has said he wants to end India's status as the world's No. 1 defence importer, and have 70 per cent of hardware made domestically by the turn of the decade. Last year, British defence giant BAE Systems said it chose India's Mahindra group to build a plant for assembling howitzer artillery guns in the country. The Cabinet also on Wednesday scrapped the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, a government panel seen as being bogged down by stifling bureaucracy. Foreign investments that require government approval will, in future, be cleared by individual ministries, the government said. "Foreign investors will find India a more attractive destination, and this will result in more inflow of foreign direct investment," it said in a statement. Indian defence manufacturing is small, and dominated by state-run firms, many of which have been criticised for poor performance. Private firms such as Larsen & Toubro, the Mahindra Group, Tata Group and recent entrants, the Reliance Group and Adani Group are desperate to muscle in on their business. Foreign manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus and Saab also see India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Analysts have said the new policy could undermine competition and hand the winning Indian firms a virtual monopoly, but the government decided it has reached enough of a consensus to push the policy through. Mr Jayant Patil, head of defence and aerospace at Larsen & Toubro, India's largest private-sector engineering firm, said: "We see the policy as doing something good for indigenisation." Mr Modi was keen to get the project approved before he travels next week to Germany, France, Spain and Russia, where buying weapons will be high on the agenda. According to draft guidelines of the Strategic Partnership model, the government will use a range of technical and financial criteria to shortlist six Indian firms and several foreign players. The two groups will then begin talks to pitch jointly to the government, with New Delhi choosing the winning team based, in part, on how much technology the foreign firms are prepared to transfer to their Indian partners. "With all the effort that has gone into finalising the policy, it can potentially be a turning point in India's endeavour to have a robust home-grown private defence industrial base," said Mr Pierre de Bausset, president of Airbus in India.

Trump Onslaught on International Law and Institutions More Masthead About Lawfare Comments Policy Subscribe to Lawfare The Job Board Calendar Today's Headlines and Commentary Today's Headlines and Commentary By Rachel Bercovitz Thursday, May 25, 2017, 2:14 PM Google+ Reddit LinkedIn The New York Times reports that U.S. intelligence collected last summer exposed discussions between Russian intelligence and political officials about means of influencing President Trump’s positions on Russia through his advisors. The discussions concerned then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, both of whom had indirect connections to Russian officials. The discussions were among the pieces of intelligence prompting the F.B.I. to launch a counterintelligence investigation. President Trump met with European leaders at the NATO summit in Brussels today, delivering an address that failed to mention NATO’s Article 5 commitment to self-defense but instead castigated other members of the alliance not adequately paying the United States. Reports had previously indicated that Trump would reaffirm Article 5. The omission, on the occasion of a ceremony to commemorate NATO collaboration in the wake of 9/11, was received coolly by European leaders, the Post writes. In a doorstep statement delivered Thursday, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said NATO leaders are expected to endorse a decision to bring NATO as an institution into the 68-country coalition fighting the Islamic State—a largely symbolic move that will not entail the coalition’s “engage[ment] in combat operations”—and to reissue national commitments first made in 2014 to invest 2 percent of GDP on defense by 2024. The Associated Press suggests the new commitments do not reflect a sincere escalation in NATO members’ defense commitments, but rather superficial measures taken to persuade the Trump administration that the body has responded to White House imperatives. Trump has committed to opening an investigation into leaks by U.S. officials of information related to the Manchester investigation in recent days, following anger and frustration from the British government at the flow of information released to the press amidst a sensitive terrorism investigation. British Prime Minister Theresa May promised yesterday to mention the matter at today’s NATO summit, the Times reports. In the wake of the leaks, British authorities have halted passing information on the investigation to U.S. officials, the BBC reports. The British police’s searches across Britain and Libya for suspected accomplices in the Manchester concert bombing indicate investigators’ belief that bomber Salman Abedi did not carry out the attack on his own, but likely through the aid of his “network.” British home secretary Amber Rudd suggested this line of investigation in an interview on BBC, stating “it seems likely—possible—that he wasn’t doing this on his own.” Nearly one-thousand British Army soldiers were dispatched to guard “key sites” throughout the U.K. following British Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement on Tuesday of an elevation in the country’s threat level from “severe,” meaning an attack is likely, to “critical,” meaning an attack is expected to be imminent. Reuters reports that the U.S. military’s use of air power in Afghanistan in April was the most intense of any single month since August 2012, when approximately 80,000 U.S. forces were engaged in active combat with the Taliban. This intensification follows a June 2016 Obama administration decision granting the military greater flexibility to support Afghan forces, and stems in part from U.S. commanders’ efforts to root out an incipient Islamic State presence before ISIS proves capable of gaining further ground in the country. Air Force data suggest that the military’s decision to drop the Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb—the so-called “Mother of All Bombs”—on suspected Islamic State militants in eastern Afghanistan on April 14 was part of a broader air campaign. The campaign comes as President Trump considers the Pentagon’s request to deploy an additional 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. troops. The proposal has ignited debate within Trump’s cabinet as to its wisdom and financial implications. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin underscored the administration’s intent to intensify sanctions against Iran, Syria, and North Korea in testimony yesterday before the House Ways and Means committee. Mnuchin also announced that the Treasury has undertaken a review of licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, which were first authorized in 2015 as part of sanctions relief measures provided for by the Iran nuclear accord. IranAir has arranged to purchase 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft, a deal valued at $37 billion at list price, and that includes 80 jets from Boeing and 100 from Airbus. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte suggested that he may the state of martial law he imposed on the island of Mindanao on Tuesday to include the entire country following confrontations between the Philippine military and Islamic insurgents that have resulted in at least 21 deaths. This expansion could lead Duterte to widen his domestic focus on combatting drugs and crime to terrorism as well. Analysts say this widened focus may heighten Duterte’s willingness to cooperate with the U.S. and therefore help rehabilitate relations between the two parties. President Trump lauded Duterte’s “unbelievable job on the drug problem” during an April phone call with the president, in departure from the Obama administration’s line of criticism of Duterte’s extra-judicial killings connected to the Philippine government’s  anti-drug campaign. Brazilian President Michel Temer deployed military personnel to guard federal buildings in Brasília, after clashes between protesters and the police erupted in the capital on Wednesday. Tens of thousands of protesters marched in opposition to austerity measures called for by President Temer, who has inspired poor approval ratings since assuming office in August 2016 following the impeachment and removal from office of his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff. Calls for Temer to step down have intensified over the last week, when the Supreme Court announced its approval of an investigation of Temer for corruption and obstruction of justice.   ICYMI: Yesterday, on Lawfare Benjamin Wittes considered what James Comey may really have said to President Trump on what Trump has said were “three separate occasions” on which Comey informed him that he was not under investigation. Adham Sahloul questioned the Trump administration’s decision to rely on the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in the fight to retake Raqqa, and its failure to establish a strategy for Raqqa’s governance once it is recaptured. Dustin A. Lewis and Jillian Ventura highlighted the launch of a new database on States’ Statements Concerning Syria, a project of the Harvard Law School Program on International Law and Armed Conflict. Stewart Baker posted the latest episode of the Steptoe Cyberlaw Podcast, entitled “A WannaCry Festivus Celebration.” Scott Weiner assessed the implications of parliamentary gridlock in Kuwait that has been sustained by an unusually united and sizable opposition.

The Electron rocket lifted off at 9:20 p.m. Pacific time Wednesday from Rocket Lab's private launch complex on New Zealand's Mahia Peninsula. After a "great" first-stage burn, the company said, the first and second stages of the rocket separated cleanly, followed by ignition of the second-stage engine. Then the fairing – the clamshell-like covering that protects satellites and other payloads at the tip of the rocket – separated as expected. The Electron made it to space three minutes after launch but did not quite reach orbit. The rocket, which did not have a satellite aboard during this test flight, was intended to reach an elliptical orbit, about 186 to 310 miles above Earth at an 83-degree inclination. Electron ended up reaching an altitude of about 155 miles above Earth. Rocket Lab did not release further details about what happened after the rocket's fairing separated. Chief Executive Peter Beck told reporters on a conference call Thursday morning that the company was still reviewing data from the flight. Beck said in a statement late Wednesday night that the company would comb through the 25,000 data channels collected during the test flight to figure out why the rocket did not reach orbit, as well as figure out improvements to the vehicle. "We're really happy with what we achieved yesterday," he said on the call. "We got through all the critical events." Although the company would have liked to reach orbit on its first go, Beck said Wednesday's launch puts Rocket Lab "well ahead for the next test flight and into commercial operations." He has said the top priority of this first test flight was to "gather enough data and experience to prepare for a commercial phase." Rocket Lab said it will aim to reach orbit in its second test flight, which could happen in the next few months. The company's 10-day launch window opened at 2 p.m. Pacific time Sunday, but the launch was delayed by three days because of weather conditions at the company's private launch complex. Rocket Lab completed construction on the launch complex in September. This was the first of three test launches before Rocket Lab starts launching customer payloads. The company already has secured contracts with customers such as NASA and Earth-imaging firm Planet. The growing launch manifest puts pressure on Rocket Lab to test its rockets and move on to commercial service, said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International. Rocket Lab is building a business around the burgeoning small-satellite market. Thanks to technological advancements that slashed satellite development and launch costs, a number of companies, including SpaceX, OneWeb and Boeing, have proposed so-called constellations of hundreds or even thousands of small satellites that would provide low-cost broadband Internet access. To meet the expected demand for launches, companies such as Rocket Lab are tailoring their rockets to give these small satellites a dedicated ride to space. The Electron is small – about 56 feet long, with a diameter of about 4 feet – and is intended to lift small satellites or other payloads weighing up to 330 pounds to a low orbit. The rocket's first stage is composed of nine Rutherford engines, which are powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene. The company said it used 3-D printing for all of the primary components of the Rutherford engine. Beck said Thursday that customers and the company's board of directors were "absolutely ecstatic" about the launch. Customers were able to watch via feeds provided by the company, and the board was in New Zealand for the launch. The launch was not publicly webcast to avoid pressuring the team, Beck said, but he said the next test flight probably would have a live stream available to the public. Recently, there has been a flurry of activity from small-satellite launch vehicle developers. Tucson-based Vector Space Systems launched a test of its Vector-R rocket earlier this month in Mojave, Calif. Another industry player, Long Beach-based Virgin Orbit, is aiming to test LauncherOne – a satellite-launching rocket that will be dropped from beneath the wing of a Boeing 747 – for the first time by the end of the year.

Tarun ShuklaPrerna Kapoor Under the strategic partnership model for defence manufacturing, the govt will shortlist Indian firms for defence JVs with foreign firms to supply fighter jets, helicopters, armoured vehicles and submarines. Photo: Mint New Delhi: The Union Cabinet has approved the much-awaited strategic partnership model which will allow local private sector companies to form manufacturing joint ventures with foreign defence equipment makers—a shot in the arm for the government’s ‘Make in India’ programme as well as efforts by the Indian private sector to make inroads into the lucrative defence equipment business. “The capacity building of the private sector in defence (equipment) manufacturing will begin now,” finance and defence minister Arun Jaitley said after the Cabinet meeting. Indian firms Larsen and Toubro Ltd, Ashok Leyland Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, Tata Group, Punj Lloyd, Adani Group and Bharat Forge Ltd, which have existing defence businesses, are likely to benefit the most from the decision. ALSO READ: FIPB scrapped by Union Cabinet in push for higher FDI A February 2015 report by lobby group Ficci and Centrum Capital estimated that by 2022, the annual opportunity for Indian companies, both state-owned and private, would be around $41 billion. That number could increase further because of the new policy. The Indian defence industry is currently dominated by state-owned manufacturers, including HAL. Jaitley said the policy was designed to ensure firms do get orders. “You don’t set up a manufacturing facility if you don’t have any hope of getting orders,” he said. Under the “strategic partnership” model, the government will shortlist and then pick Indian companies to join forces with foreign firms to make fighter jets, helicopters, armoured vehicles and submarines. Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems, Airbus and Saab are among the key foreign companies looking at the India market. Many like Boeing and Airbus already source products worth $500 million annually from India. Airbus which has partnerships with many Indian players, including Tata group companies, welcomed the policy. “With all the effort that has gone into finalising the policy, it can potentially be a turning point in India’s endeavour to have a robust home-grown private defence industrial base. We hope the segments that have been identified under the strategic partnership model will provide the much needed spark to kick-start the ‘Make in India’ initiative, which we espouse wholeheartedly. We will assess the policy fine print when it is released,” Pierre de Bausset, President & Managing Director, Airbus in India said in an email.

Friday 26th May, 2017 Menu Home International News South Korea News Business News Weather Network Volume No. 15/146 Treasury Chief Says US Reviewing Iran's Aircraft Licenses VOA - Thursday 25th May, 2017 WASHINGTON - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that his department is reviewing licenses for Boeing Co and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, telling lawmakers he will increase sanctions pressure on Iran, Syria and North Korea. "We will use everything within our power to put additional sanctions on Iran, Syria and North Korea to protect American lives," Mnuchin said in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee. "I can assure you that's a big focus of mine and I discuss it with the president." He did not elaborate on the review of the aircraft licenses, which are tied to Iran's compliance with a 2015 agreement with world powers to freeze its nuclear weapons development. IranAir has agreed to buy a total of 200 U.S. and European passenger aircraft worth a total of $35 billion - $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 passenger jets from Boeing, 100 from its European rival Airbus and 20 turboprop planes from Franco-Italian supplier ATR. All of the aircraft need U.S. export licenses.

That comment summarised nine hours of high-octane insights, statements and data downloads testing the temperature of the Asian satellite market at CASBAA’s 17th annual meeting of satellite executives, engineers and investors. “This has been an energising, challenging day which laid out the immediate and long-term opportunities and challenges for the satellite sector in Asia in terms of both commercial and technical issues,” said CASBAA CEO, Christopher Slaughter. “We have been given a lot to think about. Innovation at every level must be at the heart of all our businesses.” According to keynote speaker - AsiaSat CEO Andrew Jordan, video distribution via satellite represents some 70% of revenues for most geo-satellite operators in the region with Ultra High Definition (UHD) and 4K services “all the rage” despite representing a less than 20% transition from Standard Definition services in Asia. “Mobility and broadband are the latest must-have applications, driving HTS (High Throughput Satellites) which is a maturing technology with enormous promise,” The potential benefits and disadvantages of HTS and “cut-throat” competition were an overarching theme of the conference, which also covered such items as in-flight connectivity, maritime services, reusable launch vehicles, flat panel antennas, new satellite manufacturing processes and the on-going promise of the satellite market in India.

EVERETT — There are high hopes of turning Paine Field into a Golden Gate Bridge of sorts — one that soars 30,000 feet in the sky. Or, to conjure up a different image, the Snohomish County airport could become a pipeline to Silicon Valley venture capital. Those are some of the visions flitting through the minds of local business and political leaders, after Alaska Airlines last week became the first carrier to commit to serving a future Paine Field passenger terminal. Alaska plans to start service in the fall of 2018, but is unlikely to reveal specific routes until early next year. That hasn’t stopped speculation. Flights from Everett to California’s Bay Area are among the more enticing prospects. Other locales on the wish lists include Los Angeles, Portland and Spokane. A few sunny vacation spots beckon as well. “You need to go to where the money and the businesses are created. Those are located in the Bay Area and in Los Angeles. They’re coming up here because they need access to cheap power and abundant water,” said Tom Hoban, CEO of Coast Real Estate Services. “Think of Silicon Valley as the Wall Street of the West. It’s just big bundles of money waiting to invest.” Flights to San Jose would be ideal, from Hoban’s point of view, but San Francisco or Oakland would do just fine. Alaska anticipates operating nine daily flights, taking up roughly half the capacity of the planned two-gate terminal. Propeller Airports of New York City signed a lease deal for airport land two years ago and secured a grading permit in April. Groundbreaking is expected in June. Propeller CEO Brett Smith said he’s happy to have Alaska and expects more airline announcements to come. Hoban has a prime perch to see what draws a business to one location versus another. He’s often on the front end of conversations when executives size up the area’s potential from afar or travel here to view properties up close. Often, the deal is dead by the time an out-of-state client makes it up to Everett, after slogging through I-5 traffic from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, he said. That has pushed some businesses south, to communities such as the Kent Valley, Renton or Federal Way. Other execs who otherwise might have been receptive to Snohomish County have opted instead for places such as Salt Lake City. “Those opportunities, if we get a Bay Area service, will open up for us now,” said Hoban, who also writes a column for The Herald Business Journal, which is owned by The Daily Herald parent company Sound Publishing. Where Alaska flies from Paine Field depends on how the company wants to use the airport and how it answers key questions, said George Hamlin, a longtime aerospace-industry insider and owner of Hamlin Transportation Consulting. The airline focuses on direct flights, rather than connecting through hub airports. Sea-Tac is its busiest airport, with dozens of flights every day. Hamlin put good odds on Paine Field service to major West Coast cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego or Las Vegas. Everett Mayor Ray Stephanson also likes the idea of a direct San Diego link, given the sizable Navy presence in both towns. “I do think, even though the Navy has stayed neutral on this issue, they do a lot of training in San Diego,” Stephanson said. “My sense is that maybe personnel will use this regional airport a significant amount.” For fun? The mayor would be on board with Palm Springs, California, Reno or somewhere in Hawaii. Washington State University might add to the appeal of a Spokane connection, now that the school based in nearby Pullman has opened WSU North Puget Sound at Everett. A Portland route would take Everett travelers to a hub for international flights. Stephanson brought up that possibility, as did Patrick Pierce, president and CEO of Economic Alliance Snohomish County. “We’re a fast-growing county in a fast-growing region,” Pierce said. “Anything to open up more transportation options is a good thing, in our eyes.” Aerospace and medical device manufacturers stand to benefit from air service, as their employees meet with clients throughout the United States and beyond. There could be customer pipeline for local tourism: touring aircraft museums or the Boeing plant, visiting the Tulalip Resort Casino, hiking the Cascade foothills or going whale-watching. Passenger service appears ever closer, but hurdles remain. Alaska still needs federal government approval for its service. Mukilteo hasn’t given up its long-running legal fight, either. Attorneys for the city have asked the state Supreme Court to review its challenge to Propeller’s lease agreement with the county, arguing for more environmental studies. The city and its allies have lost in the courts. They hope to void the lease. At the same time, Mukilteo leaders have struck up a dialogue with Propeller. The city has sought to minimize disruptions to neighborhoods by limiting late-night and early morning flights, as well as the routes pilots use. Traffic is another worry. While Paine Field air service might take a few cars off I-5 that otherwise would have headed to Sea-Tac, it promises to add to existing congestion on Mukilteo Speedway. To improve the situation, Mukilteo plans to build a new parallel arterial to carry some of the load. The Harbour Reach Corridor Project would be built out by 2021 at a cost of about $16 million.

Ask EV-Box (Video) May 25th, 2017 by James Ayre  What are the 6 biggest changes that will be occurring in the mobility sector before the year 2030? Self-driving taxis (aka robotaxis)? V2V technology rollout? Wide-scale adoption of plug-in electric vehicles? A blog post and video on the EV-Box website recently explored this question and seems worth discussing here. The list is a fair bit different than mine, which makes me curious to hear what other people have to say. Personally, I’d probably say: self-driving taxis; self-driving freight truck service; zero-emissions zones in some cities; electrified ferry service; a large-scale rollout of electric vehicles; and the demise of personal diesel vehicles — in no particular order. With regard to the EV-Box blog post, the 6 were: The Boring Company; electric planes; (jaw)dropping battery prices; exponential growth of charging points; self-driving cars; and “consumer trumps politics.” Here are some excepts (the first 3): #1 The Boring Company The next and best solution to city congestion? An underground tunnel will transport cars on electric skates traveling at 200 km/h (130 miles/h). How on earth is this feasible? Ask Musk. In his recent TED Talk, Musk revealed his recipe for rescuing California from severe city congestion. “It affects people in every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life. It’s horrible. It’s particularly horrible in LA.” #2 Electric planes From Airbus to Larry Page. The backing of electric plane development is the real deal. The first electric planes are expected to last in the air for about 1600 km (1000 miles) by 2030. A company called Zunum Aero, backed by Boeing and JetBlue, hopes to make this a reality. Touted the “Tesla of the Air” and the “Chevy Volt for Planes”, Zunum is now building a fleet of hybrid-electric planes, focusing on improving regional flights, especially within the US. #3 (Jaw)dropping battery costs Battery prices are dropping by about 20% a year, and automakers no longer deny the importance of building an electric fleet. Companies like Volkswagen, Toyota, BMW, Audi, Volvo, Mercedes and many others are spending billions to speed up their development process and bring in new electric models before 2020. The future development of better battery designs is expected to help reduce the cost. Prices are expected to drop to $100/kWh before 2030, while energy density will double. Second-life batteries will be reused for clean energy storage and consumption at home. How do we know that this is serious? Well, even oil companies admit that fuel “demand will flatten out” after 2030. I’ll confess here that I’m very skeptical of The Boring Company as anything but a niche solution to traffic congestion problems, so I’ll have to disagree with the blog post there pretty emphatically. With regard to choice number 2, electric planes, that’s a more interesting subject — electric aircraft certainly stand to disrupt the short-haul flight market, if battery prices fall enough. But I’m not sure that any major changes in that sector will occur before 2030. I might be wrong about that, though. Choice number 3 I can’t argue with at all, though — there are big changes coming with regard to electric vehicle battery prices well before 2030.

By Peterson Tumwebaze National carrier, RwandAir, will at 12:45pm tomorrow, take off for the first direct commercial flight to Gatwick International Airport, London's second busiest airport. The first European destination by the airline will be serviced by a brand new Airbus A330 aircraft that boasts of in-flight connectivity. The airline will fly to the English capital three times a week. The addition of Gatwick - London takes the airline to 22 destinations served currently. This direct seamless long-haul flight to the Europe's financial capital, according to aviation experts, is an important milestone towards improving trade relations between Rwanda, the region and the European continent. It also makes the route more competitive and more efficient which will ultimately benefit passengers. Rwandan exporters say they are excited and looking forward to taking full advantage of the opportunities abound. "We anticipate increased volumes in terms of exports to the European market through the UK," said Epimaque Nsanzabaganwa, the horticulture division manager at the National Agricultural Export Development Board (NAEB). RwandAir has already offered to cut freight charges for exporters to as low as $0.95 per kilogramme. Donatille Nibagwire, the managing director of FLORIS Export Company, said the new developments are very likely to change the dynamics of the country's export business. Boosting tourism Meanwhile, experts say flights to Europe's financial capital will boost tourism between the UK and Rwanda. Osborn Kinene, the Rwanda Eco-Tours country manager, said the flights will lead to increased number of tourists visiting the two countries. "Rwanda is counting on tourism to boost its exports, therefore creating a seamless connectivity between Rwanda and other markets means people can now find it easier to travel between destinations," he told The New Times. Connecting Kigali to markets in Asia, Europe and later alone America means increase in volumes of trade as well as enhanced tourism which will drive economic development and sustainability, Kinene added. In addition, Rwanda has recently become one of the countries that offer tourists a 'Big 5' experience, having reintroduced both lions and eastern black rhinoceros into Akagera National Park. The introduction of direct flights to London by RwandAir brings to enhanced and affordable connectivity, which will boost tourism, one of the country's main foreign exchange earners. Last month, the airline launched direct flights to Mumbai, India's financial capital. More long-haul flights in the offing Meanwhile, RwandAir is scheduled to launch flights to New York and later other Asian destinations. On the African front, the airline plans to fly to Conakry in Guinea, Bamako in Mali, as well as Dakar, Senegal, Lilongwe in Malawi and Durban in South Africa. Last year, the airline acquired its first A330-200 and A330-300 Airbus planes, boosting its fleet to 11 aircraft and capacity to compete globally. It is also scheduled to take delivery of another brand new Boeing before end of the month. RwandAir carried more than 650,000 passengers last year and projects to transport over three million in the next five years. Patrick Gakuru, a Kigali-based aviation expert, said the airline's recent expansion and growth strategy is reflection of Rwanda's resilience. "The growth of aviation business in Rwanda is a reflection of the general economic performance which has showed resilience under the good leadership of President Kagame," Gakuru said. RwandAir is IATA Operational Safety Audit certified. The globally-recognised and accepted evaluation certification confirms that the airline's operational management and control systems meet international civil aviation safety and other standards.

BUSINESS Rocket Lab's Electron rocket reaches space, but not orbit, in first test flight Huntington Beach small-satellite launch firm Rocket Lab launched its Electron rocket for the first time in a test Wednesday night. The rocket made it to space, but not to orbit. Huntington Beach small-satellite launch firm Rocket Lab launched its Electron rocket for the first time in a test Wednesday night. The rocket made it to space, but not to orbit. Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter In a significant step for one of Southern California’s growing private space startups, Rocket Lab said its Electron rocket made it to space in its first test flight Wednesday night, but did not reach orbit as planned. The test launch of the rocket, which did not have a satellite aboard, was the first of three planned by Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab faces pressure to prove its rockets are reliable so it can move on to commercial service, said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International. The company has secured contracts with customers such as NASA and Earth-imaging firm Planet. The Electron rocket lifted off at 9:20 p.m. Pacific time Wednesday from Rocket Lab’s private launch complex on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula. After a “great” first-stage burn, the company said, the first and second stages of the rocket separated cleanly, followed by ignition of the second-stage engine. Then the fairing — the clamshell-like covering that protects satellites and other payloads at the tip of the rocket — separated as expected. The rocket was intended to reach an elliptical orbit, about 186 to 310 miles above Earth at an 83-degree inclination. The Electron ended up reaching an altitude of about 155 miles. Huntington Beach-based Rocket Lab did not release further details about what happened after the rocket’s fairing separated. Chief Executive Peter Beck told reporters on a conference call Thursday morning that the company was still reviewing data from the flight. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket made it to space, but not orbit, in its first test flight Wednesday night. The small-satellite launch company based in Huntington Beach will attempt a second test flight in the next few months. Rocket Lab's Electron rocket made it to space, but not orbit, in its first test flight Wednesday night. The small-satellite launch company based in Huntington Beach will attempt a second test flight in the next few months. See more videos The company said in a statement late Wednesday night that it would comb through the 25,000 data channels collected during the test flight and figure out why the rocket did not reach orbit, as well as figure out improvements to the vehicle. “We’re really happy with what we achieved yesterday,” Beck said on the call. “We got through all the critical events.” Although the company would have liked to reach orbit on its first go, he said Wednesday’s launch puts Rocket Lab “well ahead for the next test flight and into commercial operations.” He has said the top priority of this first test flight was to “gather enough data and experience to prepare for a commercial phase.” Rocket Lab said it will aim to reach orbit in its second test flight, which could happen in the next few months. The launch was delayed by three days because of weather conditions at the company’s private launch complex. Rocket Lab completed construction on the launch complex in September. Rocket Lab is building a business around the burgeoning small-satellite market. Thanks to technological advancements that slashed satellite development and launch costs, a number of companies, including SpaceX, OneWeb and Boeing, have proposed “constellations” of hundreds or even thousands of small satellites that would provide low-cost broadband Internet access. To meet the expected demand for launches, companies such as Rocket Lab are tailoring their rockets to give these small satellites a dedicated ride to space. Small satellites currently hitch a ride into space by squeezing onto rockets purchased by larger companies that are deploying their own satellites or other payloads. In February, Planet launched 88 of its small satellites aboard the Indian Space Research Organization’s PSLV rocket. That rocket’s primary mission was to deliver a larger Earth observation satellite to orbit. Aspiring small-satellite launch providers say their services will allow small satellite firms to have more say in the timing of launches, as well as the orbit where the satellite will be placed. Tucson-based Vector Space Systems launched a test of its Vector-R rocket earlier this month in Mojave, Calif. Another industry player, Long Beach-based Virgin Orbit, is aiming to test LauncherOne — a satellite-launching rocket that will be dropped from beneath the wing of a Boeing 747 — for the first time by the end of the year. The Electron is small — about 56 feet long, with a diameter of about 4 feet — and is intended to lift small satellites or other payloads weighing up to 330 pounds to a low orbit. The rocket’s first stage is composed of nine Rutherford engines, which are powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene. The company said it used 3-D printing for all of the primary components of the Rutherford engine. Customers were able to watch via feeds provided by the company, and the Rocket Lab board of directors was in New Zealand for the launch. The launch was not publicly webcast to avoid pressuring the team, Beck said, but he said the next test flight probably would have a live stream available to the public.

(GeekWire Photo / Chelsey Ballarte)More The High Dive is known for drawing crowds into the local music scene, but this week, music wasn’t what drew nearly 200 people to the venue – it was NASA. Nerd Nite Seattle is a monthly gathering at the bar in the city’s Fremont neighborhood, featuring beer, tasty Mexican food, science talks and, of course, nerdy Seattleites. Tuesday night’s event drew in plenty of the regulars, plus an assortment of first-timers. One of the first-timers was NASA astronaut Anne McClain. She mingled with the crowd, and then got on stage to speak about her rigorous astronaut training, share hilarious stories about other members of her astronaut class, and reflect on how growing up in Washington state made her want to go to space. “I decided when I was about 3 years old, the first time I told my mom I wanted to be an astronaut,” said McClain, who is now 37. “Luckily she is a bit of a nerd herself, and so she really fostered that.” Young McClain and her family (who came out to support her at Nerd Nite) were frequent visitors to the Pacific Science Center. They also went to the Space Needle, where McClain played pretend-astronaut. “I remember riding the Space Needle and going up in the elevator and being scared, but thinking, ‘This is going to be like going up a launch tower,’ and so I would sit there and try to face that fear,” she said.   Almost 200 people turned out for Nerd Night’s NASA event at the High Dive in Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood. (GeekWire Photo / Chelsey Ballarte)More McClain followed up on her childhood dream by attending West Point and becoming an Army major, helicopter pilot and flight instructor. In 2013, she won a spot in NASA’s most recent class of astronaut candidates. She’s still waiting for her first spaceflight assignment, but in the meantime, she’s playing a role in the development and testing of future spaceships. This week may have marked the first time the denizens of Nerd Nite Seattle hosted an astronaut, but it wasn’t the first time they’ve gathered to talk about space. Nerd Nite volunteer Jenny Haaland said they’ve hosted talks about planets and other space topics before. One Star Wars night in particular got very intense. Nerd Nite’s quirkiness is a big part of its appeal. Haaland said she loves finding out what people are passionate about, and taking in the night’s nerdy atmosphere. “Bars tend to be very insular, and Nerd Nite just isn’t,” she said. “People are willing to turn to one another and say, ‘Well, what did you think about that?’ and talk about what we just heard.” Nerd Nite does bring in some families – but a large pool of attendees are in their early careers, typically working at tech firms such as Amazon and Boeing. Amazon software development engineer Michael Li said he enjoys coming because it’s a refreshing break after a long day’s work. What better place for a NASA-focused Nerd Nite than Seattle’s Fremont neighborhood — self-proclaimed Center of the Universe and home to the towering Fremont Rocket. (GeekWire Photo / Kurt Schlosser)More McClain’s Seattle visit was part of a NASA tour program known as Destination Station, which sends astronauts, researchers and outreach specialists to cities across the country. The Destination Station team also checks in with local companies to spread the word about commercial opportunities in space. During this week’s stopover, the team visited Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin rocket venture, Microsoft and Starbucks. Among the topics that came up at Starbucks were the challenges of managing product shelf life and brewing coffee in zero-G, said Pete Hasbrook, an associate program scientist for the International Space Station program. Tuesday’s Nerd Nite ended with an inspiring video about the space station and its crew, plus a round of audience questions that sparked a conversation about leadership in space. Inspiring the nerd crowd may not have been the only thing on McClain’s schedule, but being at the High Dive and reconnecting with her childhood memories were definitely among the highlights. “I still feel inside like a little kid from Spokane with a dream,” she said. “My heart would race when I went to Pacific Science Center because I would pretend to be an astronaut, and now I get to come back and give back to the community that I think compelled me to where I am.” More from GeekWire: NASA’s newest women astronauts get the Glamour treatment: Want to join them? ‘A Beautiful Planet’: Astronauts and space moviemakers reflect on film’s final frontier A room with a changing view: Seattle artist watches as Amazon grows up and up around her First live ultra-HD video from space features oohs, ahhs and zero-G ping pong Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Mark Zuckerberg: The most important thing I built at Harvard Yahoo Tech The most important announcements from Google's big developers' conference Yahoo Tech The new Samsung Galaxy does 27 things the iPhone doesn't Yahoo Finance How the Microsoft Surface Pro compares to Apple's best Yahoo Tech A widely praised Supreme Court decision still doesn't fix the broken patent system Yahoo Tech This RoboCop car comes with an intruder-chasing drone as a sidekick Yahoo Tech Utah law that could send online bullies to jail criticized Associated Press Why Amazon let 4,000 dogs into its Seattle headquarters Yahoo Tech Uber inadvertently underpaid New York City drivers for over two years Yahoo Tech Pinterest now uses AI to figure out what you're eating in photos Yahoo Tech New iPhone 8 pictures mean our worst nightmare might be happening BGR News No, your Apple computer isn't immune from ransomware Yahoo Tech Now I get it: Ransomware Yahoo Tech 'Prey' review: You'll never be more afraid of a coffee cup Yahoo Tech iPhone 'saves life' of Manchester bomb victim by stopping flying shrapnel International Business Times How to avoid the massive WannaCry ransomware attack Yahoo Tech U.S. top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to 'patent trolls' Yahoo Tech How Google's trying to make the mobile web look less ugly Yahoo Tech This $300 Surface Pro clone might be better than the real thing BGR News How to delete your data from your old devices Yahoo Tech Google Home's mastermind has no intention of losing to Amazon Yahoo Tech
