Boeing had suspended flights after a fault was found in an engine part. CFM International, which makes all 737 engines, appeared to suggest that testing of the turbine discs might take weeks, but the FAA seems to have been reassured enough to allow flight testing to continue. Boeing had been due to deliver the first 737 MAX 8 to Indonesia’s Malindo Air, possibly as early as next week. The flight ban put that schedule in doubt. Norwegian Air and Southwest Airlines are also due to receive 737 MAXs over the next few months.

Hood to Nacogdoches to scope out a landing spot for Memorial Day. (Source: KTRE Staff) NACOGDOCHES, TX (KTRE) - Veterans and others are in for a treat this Memorial Day in Nacogdoches. A preview of what's to come flew in Thursday morning.  The newest and largest utility helicopter used by the U.S. Army will be on public display. On Thursday, crewmen scoped out a landing zone. The Boeing CH-47F has a distinct sound.  It's the distinct sound of the Boeing Chinook CH-47F. This latest model of an American twin-engine, tandem rotor heavy-lift helicopter is building memories for crewmen in the air.  While on the ground, it renews memories for Vietnam veterans, including Rickey Wittner, a former Chinook flight engineer. "We flew the A models,” Wittner said. “And this is the F model. A lot of difference." Army Sgt. Anquan Bagley said the biggest difference is a fully integrated, digital cockpit management system. That takes five computer screens. "The pilots can see all of their gauges that they need to see,” Bagley said. “They get all their indications from the engines, and actually their flight instruments as well." The price tag crept up to about $36 million. What hasn't changed is the CH-47 remains to be the world's most reliable and efficient transport helicopter, capable of handling loads up to 24,000 lbs. "The Chinook is the 18-wheeler in the sky,” Wittner said. "Right now you are in the cabin area,” Bagley said as he showed off the Chinook. “This is where we hold all the cargo that we're not actually sling loading outside the aircraft with the sling set. So as you can see right now we actually have the aircraft kinda configured in the cargo configuration." Yet it's combat ready, which is something Wittner knows all about. "I got shot down July 10, 1970. I was standing in the window,” Wittner said. “First RPG hit the engine. Second one hit the metal. And the third one hit the post right beside the door." Old and new war stories will be shared on Memorial Day when the Chinook returns to Nacogdoches for a Memorial Day tribute for a Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, the late Oscar P. Austin.  "The public needs to come and support it because Congressional Medal of Honor is not an award lightly given out,” said Mike Bishop with the U.S. Marine Corps Vietnam Veterans Association. “And this young man needs every bit of this honor." The fastest helicopter in the U.S. will quickly make the return trip to Nacogdoches to make this Memorial Day a memorable one for all who attend.  You can see the Chinook Memorial Day when it lands behind Nacogdoches First Baptist Church at 411 North Street. Tours will follow a marker dedication to start sharply at 10 a.m. to honor Private First Class Oscar P. Austin. For more information on the CH-47F Chinook, click here. Copyright 2017 KTRE.

The carrier said in a statement that the new Dreamliner will be delivered in April 2018 and will operate the airline’s long haul routes, gradually replacing its Airbus A330s. A total of 5 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft will have entered Gulf Air’s fleet by end-2018 with an additional two aircraft arriving by end-2019 and three arriving by end-2020, it added. Maher Salman Al Musallam, Gulf Air CEO, said: “We are 12 months away from welcoming the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to the Gulf Air fleet – a historic moment in our trajectory and yet another important step in our strategic direction towards furthering Gulf Air’s fleet modernisation process. "As we look to strengthen our presence across the globe, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners will also serve to enhance Gulf Air’s operational efficiency while offering enhanced passenger comfort. I am confident our guests will be delighted with the experience of flying with our newest aircraft.” Gulf Air’s Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners will offer 282 seats in a two-class configuration, with 26 Falcon Gold Class seats and 256 Economy Class seats. “The 787 customer base is growing not just globally but in the Middle East as well with airlines such as Gulf Air taking delivery of the Dreamliner,” said Marty Bentrott, Vice President – Sales, The Middle East, Turkey, Russia & Central Asia, Boeing Commercial Airplanes.  “We are confident that the 787-9 will help Gulf Air achieve a new level of efficiency and profitability and will contribute to their future growth and success.” Follow @ArabianBusiness Related: Stories Bahrain's Gulf Air inks $37m deal for new aircraft seats Bahrain's Gulf Air adds extras to pre-paid services bundle Bahrain's Gulf Air says to open new route to Georgia Bahrain's Gulf Air to resume Sri Lanka flights in January Companies Gulf Air Also in Transport Revealed: the logistical challenge posed by Dubai Expo 2020 Emirates to launch third daily flight to Brisbane Also in Bahrain More Bahrain reforms likely to retain GCC financial aid $100m fund launched in Bahrain to help SMEs growth Join the Discussion Disclaimer:The view expressed here by our readers are not necessarily shared by Arabian Business, its employees, sponsors or its advertisers.

ROS LBoard 1 Mahathir concedes BN will win 3-cornered fights FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Boeing resumes 737 MAX test flights after brief grounding Reuters | May 13, 2017 Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline. NEW YORK: Boeing Co said on Friday it resumed test flights of its $110-million 737 MAX 8 jetliner, just two days after saying it had grounded the entire fleet to address an engine problem. The resumption of flights, which the plane maker said was backed by air safety regulators, is good news for Boeing and engine-maker CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France. CFM had said flaws in the forging of a disc inside the engine could have led to cracks. Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline. Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing’s ability to deliver the new jetliners on time. The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights. “Our plan remains to start deliveries this month,” he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs. Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete. The engines, known as the LEAP-1B, were being shipped back to plants in Lafayette, Indiana, and Villeroche, France, for inspection. Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday that the company hoped to fix the problem “within a few weeks.” Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far. The problem stemmed from a forging issue noticed on low-pressure turbine discs after they were sent to CFM from a supplier. A second supplier had stepped up production, CFM said. Andries said on Thursday that CFM still hoped to deliver as many as 500 LEAP engines this year, including variants used by Airbus And China’s COMAC.

By Julie Johnsson and Richard Clough, Bloomberg Boeing resumed some flights of its new 737 Max jetliner two days after detecting a potential manufacturing flaw in the engines. The company was cleared by regulators to fly planes powered by spare engines that don’t include the possibly defective part in the Leap turbine, which is made by General Electric and Safran. The restart of some flights raised the possibility that Boeing could maintain its commitment to deliver the first of the upgraded 737 jets next week to Malindo Air, an affiliate of Indonesia’s Lion Mentari Airlines. Boeing said earlier this week that a possible quality defect in the Leap engine’s low-pressure turbine discs had come to light recently during supplier inspections and hadn’t affected flight testing. About 30 affected engines are being shipped to locations in the U.S. and France to be torn down and inspected in the coming days, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE Aviation. The questionable components come from a single disc supplier, and the 737 Max planes being flown now use discs from other manufacturers, he said. Boeing still plans to start deliveries of the 737 Max this month, said Doug Alder, a spokesman for the Chicago-based planemaker.   Most Read Corrections deputy accused of misconduct with inmate EVERETT — A Snohomish County corrections deputy is accused of kissing an… May 11th, 2017 by Diana Hefley Bothell’s Country Village shops’ future remains uncertain BOTHELL — The future of the quirky Country Village with its giant… May 12th, 2017 by Jim Davis Arlington officer’s ‘deja vu’ moment leads to car prowl arrests ARLINGTON — Arrests aren’t always made accompanied by lights and sirens.

Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing's ability to deliver the new jetliners on time. The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights. "Our plan remains to start deliveries this month," he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs. Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete. The engines, known as the LEAP-1B, were being shipped back to plants in Lafayette, Indiana, and Villeroche, France, for inspection. Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday that the company hoped to fix the problem "within a few weeks." Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far. The problem stemmed from a forging issue noticed on low-pressure turbine discs after they were sent to CFM from a supplier. A second supplier had stepped up production, CFM said. Andries said on Thursday that CFM still hoped to deliver as many as 500 LEAP engines this year, including variants used by Airbus And China's COMAC.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Holy Land Principles Resolution-izes Four More Companies Holy Land Principles Resolution-izes Four More Companies                                   Forces recognition of the elephant in the (board) room CAPITOL HILL. Wednesday, May 11, 2017— Four major American companies that do business in Israel/Palestine have recently been presented with shareholder resolutions regarding their fair employment in that area. The Capitol Hill-based Holy Land Principles, Inc. presented shareholder resolutions/proposals asking Boeing, Pepsi, UPS and Marriott [Hotels] International to “sign”/implement the 8-point set of Holy Land Principles— a corporate code of conduct for American companies doing business in Palestine/Israel. The Holy Land Principles are pro-Jewish, pro-Palestinian and pro-company. The Principles do not call for quotas, reverse discrimination, disinvestment/divestment or boycotts—only for fair employment by American companies doing business in the Holy Land. Both Pepsi and UPS were presented with the same resolution last year. Fr. Sean Mc Manus— President of the Capitol Hill-based Holy Land Principles, Inc. and Irish National Caucus— explained: “We have coined the word “ Resolution-ized”  to hammer home an important truth. For the first time in history, American companies doing business in Palestine/Israel- Israel/Palestine are being challenged on their record of fair employment. It is the very first time Shareholder Resolutions on fair employment have been submitted, which is of real significance. Isn’t it extraordinary that this had never been done before? Imagine, 542 of the top American companies doing business over there, and their fair employment record escaped all scrutiny by American shareholders, consumers and stakeholders! But, of course, the same myopia prevailed regarding American companies in Northern Ireland until we launched in 1984 the Mac Bride Principles— on which the Holy Land Principles are based. And, then, the Mac Bride Principles changed the entire fair employment dynamic in Northern Ireland. The Holy Land Principles can do the same in Palestine/Israel-Israel/Palestine.” Fr. Mc Manus added: “Next year,Holy Land Principles will present all four companies  with a resolution on them to disclose the breakdown of its workforce there using the nine job categories which are utilized in the U.S. Department of Labor’s EEO-1 Report (Equal Employment Opportunity): 1. Officials and managers; 2. Professionals; 3. Technicians; 4. Sales; 5. Office and clerical; 6. Craft Workers (skilled); 7. Operatives (semiskilled); 8. Laborers (unskilled); 9. Service workers.” Below is an analysis of the four votes. Boeing. Chicago, IL. May 1, 2017 The Holy Land Principles resolution received over 12 Millionabstentions. At the close of business on May1, 2017, the share value of Boeing was $182.39. So, the value of the share votes for Holy Land Principles represented over 2 Billion dollars ($2,293,501,539.75). The value of abstentions was over 4 Billion dollars ($4,444,163,255.74). Therefore, the combined total money not supporting Boeing was over 6 Billion dollars ($6,737,664,795.03), and, therefore, a total of 36, 940,977 votes not supporting Boeing.   Pepsi. New Bern, NC. May 3, 2017 (Second presentation) The Holy Land Principles resolution received over 29 Million votes 29,376,403 (3.19%), with 76,474,772 abstentions. At the close of business on May3, 2017, the share value of PepsiCo was $111.79. So, the value of the share votes for Holy Land Principles represented over 3 Billion dollars ($3,283,988,091.37). The value of abstentions was over 8 Billion dollars ($8,549,114,761.88). Therefore, the combined total money not supporting PepsiCo was over 11 Billion dollars ($11,833,102,853.25), and, therefore, a total of 105,851,175 votes not supporting Pepsi. UPS. Wilmington, DE. May 4, 2017 (Second presentation) The Holy Land Principles resolution received over 88 Million votes, 88,529,398   (5.6%) with 112,424,446 abstentions. At the close of business on May 4, 2017, the share value of UPS was $107.05, so the value of the share votes for Holy Land Principles represented over 9 Billion dollars ($9,477,072,055.90). The value of abstentions was over 12 Billion dollars ($12,035,036,944.30). Therefore, the combined total money not supporting UPS was over 21 Billion dollars ($21,512,109,000.20), and, therefore, a total of 1,579,985,540 votes not supporting UPS.   Marriott [Hotels] International. Washington, DC. May 5, 2017 The Holy Land Principles resolution received over 79 Million votes 79,599,610 (2.6%) with 102,951,400 abstentions. At the close of business on May 5, 2017, the share value of Marriott was $97.05, so the value of the share votes for Holy Land Principles represented over 7 Billion dollars (7,725,142,150.50).  The value of abstentions was over 9 Billion dollars (9,991,433,370).  Therefore, the combined total money not supporting Marriott was over 17 Billion dollars ($17,716,575,520.50), and, therefore, a total of 182,551,010 votes not supporting Marriott.   Note on Pfizer Resolution: The Holy Land Principles resolution  before Pfizer ( Short Hills, NJ. April 27, 2017), unfortunately had to be withdrawn when the presenter fell sick at the last moment. END. Fr. Sean Mc Manus President Holy Land Principles,Inc. Irish National Caucus P.O.

X Potential engine fault will not delay Norwegian Air launch Boeing halts flights of 737 Max, but Norwegian’s Irish-US service to go ahead, says airline about 13 hours ago Barry O'Halloran The Boeing 737 Max: The US airline manufacturer said that a possible flaw in an engine part had come to light during an inspection at its suppliers. Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images         Norwegian Air International says that the discovery of a potential flaw in the engines of one the latest Boeing aircraft will not delay the launch of its planned Irish-US flights. Boeing has temporarily suspended flights of its new 737 Max aircraft, which Norwegian plans to use on its Irish routes, after detecting a potential minor fault in the engines. The airline said that the delay is likely to push back the delivery of the craft that it will use on the Irish routes, but added that it would not affect the launch of the services themselves. “Norwegian has been informed of the temporary pause in the testing of the Boeing 737 Max,” a spokesman said. “Boeing has given us a new delivery date of our first Max, which is a few days later than previous estimates. However, this will not delay the launch of our upcoming transatlantic routes from Ireland to the US.” Inspection The US airline manufacturer said this week that a possible flaw in an engine part had come to light during an inspection at its suppliers, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran. Boeing added that the new craft remained on schedule for delivery later this month. Industry analysts suggested that the disruption caused is unlikely to last long and that the manufacturers would iron out the problem quickly. One described it as a bump on the road. Norwegian Air will be one of the first carriers to fly the Boeing 737 Max craft commercially. The craft is predicted to be one of the fastest-selling models ever launched by Boeing.       Topics: Boeing General Electric Norwegian Air Safran Ireland United States Read More Bombardier chair exits management amid backlash over pay Emirates airline profit falls for first time in five years Maersk sees shipping recovery on horizon as profit tops forecast Uber deemed transport service by EU top court adviser Lufthansa swings to first Q1 profit since 2008 Jet2 launching eight new routes from Belfast airport Boeing profits rise 19% despite drop in revenue Shannon Airport to undergo ‘significant’ investment programme Airline lobby group proposals aim to cut air traffic control strikes Europe’s aviation sector faces uncertainty, conference told  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy IMF warns help-to-buy scheme adding to property pressures Work Four ways to employ self-explaining in your own learning Gaelic Football Jim McGuinness: The Border rivalries are needed, especially in Leinster Ireland A bicycle trip around Tipp with a golden centre Sponsored Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes The Story of Home: A dream of tiny houses The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Benedict Redgrove By Gian Volpicelli Friday 12 May 2017 We may live in a digitised world where distance doesn't matter, but moving objects from one continent to another still requires a lot of effort. Then again, certain things are just too hard to move around using conventional methods. Take Boeing, the American aerospace firm. In 2003, it announced that the fuselage of its new passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner, would be constructed from several one-piece, barrel-shaped sections - up to 31 metres long - rather than by metal slabs bolted together. Replacing the Invincibles: inside the Royal Navy's controversial £6.2 billion warships Replacing the Invincibles: inside the Royal Navy's controversial £6.2 billion warships Naval Engineering 19 Mar 2017 ADVERTISEMENT That makes the craft lighter, but it also makes it much harder to transport the plane's components from where they were manufactured - Italy, Japan, Kansas and South Carolina - to Washington State, for final assembly. "We started looking at every method to move these sections around the world," says David Beck, an engineer from Boeing. "We looked at the possibility of sea shipping, but the sections were too big for  ships, and ocean routes were not dependable or fast enough." Eventually, Boeing resolved to build its own solution to the problem. The company bought four of its 747 jets from Chinese and Malaysian airlines, and transformed them into a new kind of plane that was capable of airlifting the Dreamliner's parts. Initially known as Large Cargo Freighters, the planes were later christened the Boeing 747 Dreamlifters. READ NEXT The bizarre and groundbreaking designs of cargo planes The bizarre and groundbreaking designs of cargo planes By Gian Volpicelli 14 items The bizarre and groundbreaking designs of cargo planes + 14 "We took a saw and cut the whole fuselage off. Then we took off the tail and added a three-metre section at the top, so that the 787's sections could fit," Beck says. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT This plane's bathroom cleans itself with UV lights This plane's bathroom cleans itself with UV lights By Emily Reynolds On leaving the hangar at Taipei Taoyuan International Airport, where it was built in August 2006, the first Dreamlifter made for an awkward sight - but at 1,840 cubic metres, it has the largest cargo hold in the world. The C-5 Galaxy's latest upgrade is the C-5M Super Galaxy. It's used by the US Air Force as a long-range, military transport aircraft. It is the largest aircraft in the US armed forces' inventory. Benedict Redgrove The craft's tail is linked to the rest of the fuselage by hinges, so that it can swing open when cargo operations start. Dreamlifter components then slide through the plane's open rear on a system of tracks, before the jet takes off and flies to its next stop. The Dreamlifter has cut shipping times of 787 parts from one month to a day. "It's just an incredible tool," he says. ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT In-flight Wi-Fi coming to a European jaunt near you In-flight Wi-Fi coming to a European jaunt near you By Ruby Lott-Lavigna Subscribe to WIRED The Dreamlifter may look like a bizarre piece of work, but it's not the only aircraft that opens at unusual angles. Since the late 60s, the US armed forces has relied on Lockheed Martin's strategic airlift C-5 Galaxy - a mean-looking, 75-metre craft that is able to flip up its nose and tail to let in cargo. It can even kneel on its landing gear when needed, to stoop at a lower height. The plane has been a fixture of US military missions from Vietnam to Iraq. It can load about 880 cubic metres of freight - including tanks, ammunition and Apache helicopters. It can also carry up to 75 troops. David Hale, a manager at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, explains that, although the C-5 Galaxy is one of the largest military aircrafts in the world, that does not mean it is cumbersome. Quite the opposite, in fact. "Everything, from its 68-metre wings that give it a huge lift to its engines and 28-wheel landing gear, is designed for quicker take-offs," he explains. "The plane can take off from runways as short as 1,500 metres. That is significantly shorter than airstrips used by smaller passenger jets [which are around 1,800 metres]." READ NEXT DIY jet almost ready to fly DIY jet almost ready to fly By Jason Paur Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works' P-791 prototype is mothballed in an aircraft hangar in Palmdale, California. Helium has been replaced with air in the craft, so that people can still appreciate its design elements. Benedict Redgrove Indeed, Lockheed Martin is working to do away with airstrips altogether. Over the past 20 years, researchers at the company's Skunk Works - Lockheed's experimental lab - have been reinventing a mode of transport that many thought was dead in the water: the airship. Unlike the disaster-prone, hydrogen-filled blimps of bygone days, though, Lockheed Martin's next-generation airships are filled with helium. And they only partly rely on the gas for flying, because they generate additional lift from their aerodynamic shape. This makes the craft simpler to control through its propulsion systems. The Skunk Works' first prototype, the P-791, completed its first test flight in 2006, convincing the lab of the technology's potential. Airships could have the capability to float over a location for weeks without refuelling, making them a good option for surveillance operations. But Lockheed Martin's researchers are much more keen on large-cargo shipping. "When we started researching airships," recalls Craig Johnston, Skunk Works' director of business strategy and development, "we thought: 'How can we drive down the cost of delivering cargo to areas with no infrastructure, roads or waterways?'" The two pilots were the only cargo on the P-791 when the airship embarked on its proof-of-concept flight in 2006. Lockheed Martin's first commercial airship will be able to carry 19 passengers, or 20 tonnes of cargo. Benedict Redgrove The Skunk Works' latest helium creation is LMH-1, a 91-metre airship that can carry 20 tonnes of goods - or 19 passengers - and float where planes, helicopters and ships dare not land. The LMH-1, like the P-791, is equipped with a landing system borrowed from hovercraft technology. The system blows air beneath the airship, creating a buffer that helps it touch down regardless of the surface's conditions. "This makes it possible for the plane to land everywhere," Johnston says. "Water, ice or sand: the airship can manoeuvre on all those surfaces. It does not need an airstrip." ADVERTISEMENT The airship, which will debut in 2019, has already attracted commercial interest: UK-based company Straightline Aviation has ordered 12 airships in a $480 million (£389m) deal. An exclusive look inside Nasa: from retro rockets to robots that will take us to Mars An exclusive look inside Nasa: from retro rockets to robots that will take us to Mars 39 items 06 Oct 2016 It plans to lease the craft to mining companies to transport ore, machinery and personnel. Straightline has also partnered with charity RAD-AID to transform an airship into an itinerant flying clinic. These crafts are currently off limits to civilians, but in the future they could once again have civilian uses. "We have had queries by business operatives who think this could be a nice platform for tourism. For instance, by creating safari airships," Johnston explains. "Then again, we have also had queries from people who were looking to buy their own, personal air-yacht."

Then the Boeing Business Jet might just be what you have been looking for! Based on the Boeing 737, the Business Jet Max 8 offers ample room, and that is exactly why most companies and individuals prefer it over a Gulfstream G650 or Bombardier Global Express. Even in a world that is more connected than ever, your physical presence is required and can take you all over the world. With the generous space as offered by the Business Jet Max 8, it allows you to create an office or home, even a combination of the two, in the sky. While capable of offering luxurious seating arrangements for 50 people, the majority of the clients actually opt to accommodate less. They take advantage of the space and implement board rooms, dining rooms, bathrooms with showers, or a master suite to get some much-needed rest. As if that is not enough does Boeing also offer a special panoramic window as an option. Developed together with GKN Aerospace’s Fokker business, it measures 4.5 feet by 1.5 foot, allowing a generous amount of natural light to enter the cabin, while at the same time offer spectacular views. It also further enhances the way clients can personalize their Business Jet Max 8. The BBJ Max 8 is fitted with the new CFM LEAP-1B engines, which improve fuel efficiency and extend range. This range is 6.555 nautical miles, yet for those who find a private jet based on the Boeing 737, a bit confining can rest assure: Boeing’s Business Jet division also offers VIP versions of the 747, 777 as well as the 787. But what they all offer is a way to even call the air above the clouds your home or office. Who said that the sky was the limit?

(CNN)– Three Boeing mechanics caused $4 million of damage and could have sparked a mid-flight fire while repairing one of the planes in the Air Force One fleet, a federal investigation has found. The oxygen system aboard one of the two VC-25 aircraft available to President Donald Trump was contaminated while the plane was undergoing maintenance at a Boeing plant in San Antonio, Texas between April 1 and April 10, 2016, according to an incident report released by Air Force investigators this week. The mechanics “caused the mishap by supplying and using non-oxygen clean tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks,” according to the report. Tools and components used to repair a plane’s oxygen system must be cleaned in a particular way to remove any residue that could react when it comes into contact with oxygen, the report noted. If left unchecked, a contaminated oxygen system could increase the risk of fire or even cause an explosion. Last year’s mishap did not result in any injuries and the aerospace contractor paid for the damages. “Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President’s aircraft,” Boeing told CNN in a written statement. The incident had previously been reported by the Air Force Times. The investigation was triggered when one of the Boeing mechanics notified his superiors that something looked awry, according to Boeing. “We took swift action to self-report the incident to the US Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government,” the company’s statement said. The US Air Force has completed a number of independent inspections on the aircraft and determined that it meets all FAA Federal Aviation Administration and US Air Force requirements, according to Boeing, which added that the plane has returned to the Air Force and is preparing for presidential service.

The three mechanics were checking for leaks in oxygen systems on Air Force One last year when they used tools, parts, and an unauthorised cleaning procedure. The damages were paid for by Boeing and are a part of a contract for heavy maintenance on the Air Force One fleet between the company and the US Air Force. Mechanics working on the planes need to use tools and parts that are cleaned in a specific way to remove any residue that could react with oxygen upon contact, potentially igniting in-flight fires or even an explosion. The tools and parts, after the specialised cleaning, can only be exposed to oxygen for a short time - anywhere between two and five minutes - before they need to be cleaned again. Read more Darth Vader was on Air Force One's TV as President Trump bombed Syria Here’s what happened: One mechanic gave another contaminated tools and parts to work with and said they were clean. The second later learned that the tools had been exposed to air for too long. The first mishap mechanic also gave the second some cleaning fluid at one point and said, “Here [is] some cleaning fluid. Do with it what you want. Use it if you want, but I don’t know anything about it,” according to the report. The third mechanic helped find contaminated parts in the process. Donald Trump's first 100 days: in cartoons 33 show all Donald Trump's first 100 days: in cartoons 1/33 Donald Trump's first 100 days in office were marred by a string of scandals, many of which caught the eye of the Independent's cartoonists 2/33 Trump's first 100 days have seen him aggressively ramp up tensions with his nuclear rivals in North Korea 3/33 Mr Trump has warned of a "major, major conflict" with the pariah nation lead by Kim Jong Un 4/33 Mr Trump dropped the "mother of all bombs" on alleged ISIS-linked militants in Afghanistan, amid an escalation of US military intervention around the globe 5/33 Mr Trump has been accused of falling short of the standards set by his predecessors in the Oval Office, including Franklin D Roosevelt 6/33 The tycoon's ascension to the White House came at a time when the balance of power is shifting away from Western nations like those in the G7 group 7/33 Western politicians, including the British Conservative party, have been accused of falling in line behind Mr Trump's proposals 8/33 Brexit is seen to have weakened Britain, reducing still further any political will to resist American leadership 9/33 Mr Trump's leadership has been marked by sudden and unexpected shifts in global policy 10/33 Trump's controversial missile strike on Syria, which killed several citizens, was seen by some analysts as an attempt to distract from his policy elsewhere 11/33 The President has also spent a large majority of his weekends golfing, rather than attending to matters of state 12/33 Though free of gaffes, a visit from Chinese president Xi Jinping spotlighted trade tensions between the two states 13/33 One major and unexpected setback came when Mr Trump's Healthcare Bill was struck down by members of his own party 14/33 Mr Trump has been a figure of fun in the media, with his approval at record lows 15/33 A string of revelations about Mr Trump's financial indiscretions did not mar his surge to the White House 16/33 Outgoing President Barack Obama was accused of wiretapping Trump Tower by his successor in America's highest office 17/33 The alleged involvement of Russian intelligence operatives in securing Mr Trump the presidency prompted harsh criticism 18/33 The explosive resignation of Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who lied about his links to the Russian ambassador, was just one scandal to hit the President 19/33 Many scandals, such as the accusation Barack Obama was implicated in phone-hacking, first broke on Mr Trump's Twitter feed 20/33 Donald Trump's election provoked mass protests in the UK, with millions signing a petition to ban him from the country 21/33 Donald Trump cited a non-existent terror attack in Sweden during a campaign rally 22/33 Donald Trump stands accused of stoking regional tensions in Eastern Asia 23/33 North Korea has launched a number of failed nuclear tests since Mr Trump took power 24/33 Theresa May formally rejected the petition calling for Mr Trump to be banned from the UK 25/33 When Mr Trump's initial so-called Muslim ban was struck down by a federal justice, the President mocked the 69-year-old as a "ridiculous", "so-called judge" 26/33 A week after his inauguration, Theresa May met with Mr Trump at the White House 27/33 Donald Trump's first days in office were marked by a hasty attempt to follow through on many of his campaign promises, including the so-called Muslim ban 28/33 Donald Trump's decision to ban citizens of many majority-Muslim countries from the US sparked mass protests 29/33 Revelations about Donald Trump's sexual improprieties were not enough to keep him from being elected President 30/33 British PM Theresa May was criticised by many in the press for cosying up to the new President 31/33 One of Mr Trump's top aides, Kelly Anne Conway, was mocked for describing mistruths as "alternative facts" 32/33 British PM Theresa May was quick to demonstrate that her political aims did not hugely differ from Mr Trump's 33/33 Donald Trump's inauguration, on 20 January 2017, sparked protests both at home and abroad The fluid in question could have been successfully used to clean the tools but the mechanics weren’t privy to proper techniques. They then cleaned their tools in the wrong way before working on passenger and medical oxygen systems on board. Boeing said in a written statement to CNN that it "fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President's aircraft." And, "We took swift action to self-report the incident to the US Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government." The incident happened at a time when Boeing was behind schedule on maintenance and was requiring employees to work mandatory 12-hour shifts. Workers were working six and seven days in a row, sometimes without a day off for weeks.

(Reuters) Maintenance lapse by Boeing mechanics causes $4m of damage Three airline mechanics carrying out maintenance on a Boeing aircraft available to US President Donald Trump could have sparked a fire due to a lack of oversight and failure "to observe explicit warnings" while repairing it. A federal investigation found that the shoddy work of the mechanics caused $4 million of damage while repairing the plane in the Air Force One fleet. The oxygen system aboard the VC-25 aircraft was contaminated while the plane was undergoing maintenance at a Boeing plant in San Antonio, Texas between April 1 and April 10, 2016, Air Force investigators reported this week. The mechanics "caused the mishap by supplying and using non-oxygen clean tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks", CNN cited the report as saying. It is imperative that tools and components used to repair a plane's oxygen system be cleaned in a particular way to remove any residue that could react when it comes into contact with oxygen. A contaminated oxygen system can trigger fire or blast. Luckily, the lapse did not cause any injuries and the aerospace contractor paid for the damages. "Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President's aircraft," Boeing told CNN in a written statement. Probe was launched when one of the Boeing mechanics alerted his superiors. "We took swift action to self-report the incident to the US Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government," the company's statement said. The plane has returned to the Air Force and is preparing for presidential service. But the controversy will not die down soon. Hackles are being raised over the potential fallout due to the failure to use proper cleaning procedures on the President's aircraft. Fingers are being pointed at Boeing's training and oversight methods. Share More > Vote MORE FROM International Americas Trump's Air Force One plane could have 'caught...

The interior of your private 747 could look like this Hugh Morris 12 May 2017 • 1:18pm Jetting into town on your own private jet is pretty baller, sure. But what if you wanted to super-size the personal flying experience and invite 200 friends along for the ride? Unfortunately, you would need to reach for something only achieved by a handful of people in aviation history before you and try and get your hands on a jetliner, such as a 747 or A320.  So can I buy a jetliner? Absolutely. How many digits does your bank balance have? Because if it’s less than seven you better start saving. Let’s assume, first, the plan is to buy a brand new plane from Boeing, one of two big daddies of the aircraft business, the other being Airbus, but for the simplicity of this piece let's consider the former. In the same way any manufacturer puts its products up for sale, the Boeing website has a commercial section aimed at potential buyers, complete with a pricelist listed in US dollars. How much does a Boeing plane cost? For the would-be jetliner owner after a basic model, the 737-700 starts at $82.4million, about £64.1m, or for just $16million more, the 737-800, which is Ryanair’s aircraft of choice. Anyone after a more spacious plane might want to consider the 787 Dreamliner, starting at $229.5million (£178.5m). The most expensive option on the books is the 2019-expected 777-9, which would set you back a cool $408.8million (£318m). A post shared by The Boeing Company (@boeing) on Nov 1, 2016 at 12:51pm PDT Boeing points out that the prices given are averages “reflecting a range of available options and configurations for each model” with varying “performance, capability, interiors, avionics, fuel capacity, etc”. The good news is that, if your mate fancies one too, you might be able to wangle a discount. Private jets' incredible interiors What sort of thing do I need to consider? Do you want the sort of space that would suit seven friends on a luxury stag or hen, or is Iron-Maiden-and-posse-on-tour more your vibe? Boeing has a handy interactive aircraft comparison feature to deal with all the conundrums on buying your first aircraft - two aisles or one? 242 seats or 467? 38,180 gallons of fuel capacity or 53,985? Remember also to think about range - how far the plane can fly in a single flight. There is no point in splashing out a couple of hundred million pounds only to realise your dream of hopping over to the Philippines has been dashed because you accidentally purchased the short-range model. How do I pay? “An important first step in sourcing the airplane is to consider financing options,” states Boeing, before explaining that most buy via “operating lease” and “direct purchase”, which means essentially renting the aircraft or using a mortgage-type loan to steadily assume equity of the plane. Which planes do airlines use the most today? It is unlikely though that anyone but an airline would purchase a brand new aircraft (and many airlines lease their planes, anyway). It is also key to remember that though purchasing an aircraft might be considered capital expenditure, the cost of actually flying the thing runs yet higher. On top of safety checks, aviation authority certificate acquisition and maintenance, each flight can cost up £20,000 in fuel, take-off and landing fees. A “go-around” aborted landing, in the case of high winds or a last-minute emergency, might alone cost £4,000. Timelapse video shows super-fast construction of a BA 787-9 Dreamliner 03:59 What about second-hand planes? Less glam but more realistic, the second-hand aircraft market is vast. Plenty of models have a decent shelf life but have been shed by airlines wanting to update their fleets - the 747 being a current example of an aircraft that is leaving more carriers than it is joining. Also, the rate of depreciation is rapid. President Trump owns a customised 757 - and you could too, sort of Head over to GlobalAir.com, an aviation marketplace of 20 years of standing, where you can pick up a 1991 Boeing 737 with a mere 53,000 flying hours under its belt for just $6million (£4.6m). “This aircraft… is in impeccable condition. Completely refurbished in 2016. 44 luxury seats and interior… Going at a very good price,” the seller, Delta World Charter, beams. How the aircraft compare D There are no 747s available at the moment, but an answer on Quora, the Q&A website, estimates that used one might cost between $10million and $100million. Do many people own their own commercial aircraft? Clearly plenty of people own your more traditional, smaller, private jets, but how many people are flying round in their own (heavily customised) jetliners? The most prominent man to boast such a privilege is perhaps the leader of the free world, Donald Trump, whose 757 caused a controversy in the early days of his presidency when he said he would rather keep flying in it rather than the more secure Air Force One. Roman Abramovich, Chelsea football club owner, has a Boeing 767 dubbed the “Bandit”. Lord knows why. Best of | Travel Truths Other names who have acquired jetliners at huge costs and then converted them into airborne palaces include Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, Joseph Lau and the Sultan of Brunei. Of course, as the rich get richer, owning a commercial aircraft that was more often used to fly fare-paying commoners around the world is not as rare as it used to be. Indeed, Boeing has launched Boeing Business Jets bringing “the best of commercial aviation into the realm of private air travel”. “Our customers put a high premium on quality and mobility,” Boeing says. “Most often, they want access to the same amenities in the air as they have on the ground including an office, bedroom, shower, dining facilities, entertainment areas and more.” Boeing offers a choice of its own Boeing Business Jets or the more typical MAX aircraft, 787, 777 and 747s. What’s the alternative? Charter a jet or kit your garden shed out like a plane, buckle up, stow your tray table and prepare to pretend to take off.

If left unchecked, the mistake could have led to an explosion on the aircraft - which is one of the two planes known as Air Force One when it carries the President - according to an accident report. Contamination to the VC-25A aircraft was put right by Boeing, at a cost of $4million. President Donald Trump pictured onboard Air Force One in January. An incident report found mistakes were made in repairing one of the planes used to transport the President, but this has now been repaired The blunder was made last year, while Barack Obama was still president. He is pictured boarding Air Force One on a visit to Kenya and Ethiopia The error was made during a routine depot maintenance on the plane's oxygen system in April last year, Air Force Times reports.  The incident report said Boeing workers 'caused the mishap by supplying and using non-oxygen clean tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks'. It added that they 'failed to observe explicit warnings concerning cleanliness'. In a statement to CNN, Boeing - which is contracted to build and maintain the Presidential fleet - said: 'Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President's aircraft.'

Share this article Share One of the Air Force One planes pictured in the sky in 1999, during the Bill Clinton presidency It continued: 'We took swift action to self-report the incident to the US Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government.' Since the mistake was spotted, independent inspections have been carried out and it meets all Federal Aviation Administration and US Air Force standards, Boeing said. The affected plane will soon be ready to carry President Donald Trump, the company stated. Boeing declined to tell CNN whether the mechanics involved are still employed. Air Force One is operated by the Presidential Airlift Squadron from Maryland's Andrews Air Force Base. The two planes currently in use were brought into service during George H. W. Bush's administration, having been ordered by Ronald Reagan.  Read more: Boeing mechanics caused $4 million in damage to Air Force One's oxygen system Plane in Air Force One fleet was at risk of catching fire - CNNPolitics.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 29 shares Most watched News videos Moment bystander is shot by gunman during standoff with police Moment two Mustangs spin out and crash at car show in Arizona GRAPHIC: Shocking moment Mexican soldier 'executes suspect' Surfer and his five-year-old son carve it up together Jealous dog tries to intercept owner's kisses for baby Un-bear-able!

The oxygen system aboard one of the two VC-25 aircraft available to President Donald Trump was contaminated while the plane was undergoing maintenance at a Boeing plant in San Antonio, Texas between April 1 and April 10, 2016, according to an incident report released by Air Force investigators this week. The mechanics "caused the mishap by supplying and using non-oxygen clean tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorised cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks," CNN quoted the report as saying. Tools and components used to repair a plane's oxygen system must be cleaned in a particular way to remove any residue that could react when it comes into contact with oxygen, the report noted. If left unchecked, a contaminated oxygen system could increase the risk of fire or even cause an explosion. Last year's mishap did not result in any injuries and the aerospace contractor paid for the damages. "Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President's aircraft," Boeing told CNN in a written statement on Thursday. The incident had previously been reported by the Air Force Times. The investigation was triggered when one of the Boeing mechanics notified his superiors that something looked awry, according to Boeing. "We took swift action to self-report the incident to the US Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government," the company's statement said. The US Air Force has completed a number of independent inspections on the aircraft and determined that it meets all Federal Aviation Administration and US Air Force requirements, according to Boeing, which added that the plane has returned to the Air Force and is preparing for presidential service. --IANS ksk/bg SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Soldiers vs Stone Pelters Pakistan's betrayal hurts 56" Pakistan's BAT!

The regulatory hurdle could push back the resumption of 737 MAX flights, a potentially serious issue for Boeing if it delays the scheduled first deliveries of the $110 million plane to airlines this month. The delivery of a plane is a crucial step for Boeing since it receives the bulk of its payment when it turns over the aircraft keys and airlines fly their new planes home from the factory. Boeing and engine maker CFM International must submit data to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the FAA has to “review it and determine that those engines can be cleared for flight,” said Jamie Jewell a spokesman for CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France. It was not immediately clear how long that process might take. The FAA spokeswoman said she was checking on the matter. Boeing said it still plans to deliver the first of the planes to customers this month. It said on Wednesday it had suspended 737 MAX test flights due to a quality issue with some of the low-pressure turbine discs in the engine, known as the LEAP-1B. The nickel-based alloy discs had a flaw from forging that could make them prone to cracking, Jewell said, adding that discs from a second supplier were not affected. However, the FAA review applies to all LEAP-1B engines, Jewell said, not just the 30 to 40 with suspected bad parts. “In their mind, all LEAP-1B engines are equal,” she said. KEY MONEYMAKER Boeing has engines at the factory without the suspected parts, but CFM and Boeing “have to demonstrate to the FAA’s satisfaction that the issue is not present,” Jewell said. The engines could be installed in short order once approval is granted, Jewell said. The “suspect engines” will be shipped to CFM facilities in the United States and France for inspection and possible repair. Safran said earlier Thursday that it expected inspections to be completed within a few weeks. “We are doing everything to ensure that the first delivery can go ahead in May,” Safran Aircraft Engines’ Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. Boeing had been set to deliver the first 737 MAX on Monday to Malindo Air of Malaysia. Boeing has built up an inventory of planes outside its Renton, Washington, factory, and at a nearby Seattle airport known as Boeing Field. Reuters counted 23 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes at the facilities this week, excluding test aircraft. The 737 MAX 8 carries a list price of $110 million but typically sells at a steep discount. more from business Infosys not planning major layoffs: COO tells employees in email May 13, 2017 08:15 IST Does it make economic sense to invest in real estate sector in tier-2 cities?

The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a programme that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travellers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3 per cent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 per cent at $28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing’s inventory, “as planes essentially sit waiting for engines,” said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. “Investors are acutely focused” on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. Malaysian carrier Malindo Air was set to receive the first 737 MAX delivery on Monday and use the jet for its Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route from May 19. But Malindo CEO Chandran Rama Muthy said that it does not plan to use the plane until May 22, without elaborating on the reason for the delay. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected “a few days’ delay.” “This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,” spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines Co, the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group Inc, which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. “There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field,” Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.— Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← ‘US will aggressively enforce trade rules’ Comey’s firing leaves political case to successor → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Saving is fun Trump tells Comey not to talk to press Testifying the rich history Ahmad ibn Majid: ‘Shahabuddin,’ The Lion of the Sea Read More ...

One of the two 747-200B aircraft, which is designated as Air Force One when the president flies, was being serviced at a Boeing plant in San Antonio from April 1-10, 2016, according to an incident report released by Air Force investigators this week. The oxygen system became contaminated when mechanics "caused the mishap by supplying and using non-oxygen clean tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks," according to the report. Any residue must be removed it comes in contact with oxygen. If not fixed, a contaminated oxygen system could increase the risk of fire or even cause an explosion, the report said. "Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the president's aircraft," Boeing told CNN in a written statement. The incident report also noted three deficiencies by Boeing: 1) One mechanic failed to observe "explicit warnings" on cleanliness working on the oxygen system; 2) In adequate oversight over the "timeliness and quality" of maintenance performed"; 3) Mechanics didn't "absorb or retain" oxygen system training and cleanliness procedures. "We took swift action to self-report the incident to the U.S. Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government," the company's statement said. The Air Force has determined the plane meets all Federal Aviation Administration and Air Force requirements after inspection, according to Boeing. The plane was returned to the Air Force, which it is preparing for presidential service. Boeing builds and services the president's two VC25 jets, which are military versions of the Boeing 747. The two Air Force One jets were ordered by President Ronald Reagan and delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush's administration. Boeing has a contract two build two Air Force One jets. "They were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One," Trump said at a rally on Febl 18 in Melbourne, Fla. Can you believe this? I said, 'No way.' I said, 'I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. I refuse.'" Trump said he's negotiated $1 billion in savings for the planes, an amount the Air Force can't account for. The two new jets would replace the two planes by at least 2024 -- three years past Trump's tenure if he is voted out of office after one term.

The oxygen system aboard one of the two VC-25 aircraft available to President Donald Trump was contaminated while the plane was undergoing maintenance at a Boeing plant in San Antonio, Texas between April 1 and April 10, 2016, according to an incident report released by Air Force investigators this week. The mechanics "caused the mishap by supplying and using non-oxygen clean tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks," according to the report. Tools and components used to repair a plane's oxygen system must be cleaned in a particular way to remove any residue that could react when it comes into contact with oxygen, the report noted. If left unchecked, a contaminated oxygen system could increase the risk of fire or even cause an explosion. Last year's mishap did not result in any injuries and the aerospace contractor paid for the damages. "Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President's aircraft," Boeing told CNN in a written statement. The incident had previously been reported by the Air Force Times. The investigation was triggered when one of the Boeing mechanics notified his superiors that something looked awry, according to Boeing. "We took swift action to self-report the incident to the US Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government," the company's statement said. The US Air Force has completed a number of independent inspections on the aircraft and determined that it meets all FAA Federal Aviation Administration and US Air Force requirements, according to Boeing, which added that the plane has returned to the Air Force and is preparing for presidential service. Boeing has a contract with the US Air Force to not only build the President's aircraft but also to perform critical maintenance on both planes in the fleet. The damaged aircraft is operated by the Presidential Airlift Squadron at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. But the potentially dangerous outcome of failing to use proper cleaning procedures on the President's aircraft has raised questions about Boeing's training and oversight methods. Investigators found that the mechanics "failed to observe explicit warnings concerning cleanliness" while working on the oxygen system -- one of three major factors identified as leading to the contamination. The incident report also noted that Boeing failed to exercise adequate oversight over the repair procedures, and the mechanics failed to learn the information taught during oxygen system training. While Boeing would not comment on whether the mechanics mentioned in the report remain employed by the company, spokesman Ben Davis did tell CNN that they have "completed multiple investigations and corrective action plans so that we ensure stellar performance in the future." The two Air Force One jets currently in use were ordered by President Ronald Reagan -- the interiors were selected by first lady Nancy Reagan -- and were delivered in 1990 during George H.W. Bush's administration. Both are getting increasingly expensive to fly and maintain. Boeing is currently developing a replacement Air Force One model -- a project that famously caught the attention of President-elect Trump late last year. "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Trump tweeted at the time. Within hours of the tweet, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was on the phone with Trump for the first time, congratulating the President on his election win, committing to control the jet's cost and extending an invitation to Trump to visit his company's factories, according to one person familiar with the call. Boeing has said it currently has an Air Force One contract worth $170 million. Copyright 2017 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

The oxygen system aboard one of the two VC-25 aircraft available to President Donald Trump was contaminated while the plane was undergoing maintenance at a Boeing plant in San Antonio, Texas between April 1 and April 10, 2016, according to an incident report released by Air Force investigators this week. The mechanics "caused the mishap by supplying and using non-oxygen clean tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks," according to the report. RELATED: Report finds dozens of parked BMWs have unexplained fires Tools and components used to repair a plane's oxygen system must be cleaned in a particular way to remove any residue that could react when it comes into contact with oxygen, the report noted. If left unchecked, a contaminated oxygen system could increase the risk of fire or even cause an explosion. Last year's mishap did not result in any injuries and the aerospace contractor paid for the damages. "Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President's aircraft," Boeing told CNN in a written statement. The incident had previously been reported by the Air Force Times. The investigation was triggered when one of the Boeing mechanics notified his superiors that something looked awry, according to Boeing. "We took swift action to self-report the incident to the US Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government," the company's statement said.

(Reuters) Akio Toyoda, president of Japan's auto giant Toyota Motor, speaks at a press conference to announce its 2017 financial results at the head office in Tokyo on May 10, 2017. (AFP / Toru Yamanaka) 2 photos SEATTLE: Boeing said it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric (GE) and Safran SA of France. The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer. Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts. A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build-up in Boeing’s inventory, “as planes essentially sit waiting for engines,” said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners. “Investors are acutely focused” on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said. Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. Malaysian carrier Malindo Air was set to receive the first 737 MAX delivery on Monday and use the jet for its Kuala Lumpur-Singapore route from May 19. But Malindo CEO Chandran Rama Muthy told Reuters that it does not plan to use the plane until May 22, without elaborating on the reason for the delay. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a “a few days’ delay.” “This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh,” spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email. Southwest Airlines, the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s. American Airlines Group, which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment. The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International. CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine. “There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field,” Jewell said. All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said. It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.

The regulatory hurdle could push back the resumption of 737 MAX flights, a potentially serious issue for Boeing if it delays the scheduled first deliveries of the US$110 million (RM477 million) plane to airlines this month. The delivery of a plane is a crucial step for Boeing since it receives the bulk of its payment when it turns over the aircraft keys and airlines fly their new planes home from the factory. Boeing and engine maker CFM International must submit data to the US Federal Aviation Administration and the FAA has to “review it and determine that those engines can be cleared for flight,” said Jamie Jewell a spokesman for CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France. It was not immediately clear how long that process might take. The FAA spokeswoman said she was checking on the matter. Boeing said it still plans to deliver the first of the planes to customers this month. It said on Wednesday it had suspended 737 MAX test flights due to a quality issue with some of the low-pressure turbine discs in the engine, known as the LEAP-1B. The nickel-based alloy discs had a flaw from forging that could make them prone to cracking, Jewell said, adding that discs from a second supplier were not affected. However, the FAA review applies to all LEAP-1B engines, Jewell said, not just the 30 to 40 with suspected bad parts. “In their mind, all LEAP-1B engines are equal,” she said. Key moneymaker Boeing has engines at the factory without the suspected parts, but CFM and Boeing "have to demonstrate to the FAA's satisfaction that the issue is not present," Jewell said. The engines could be installed in short order once approval is granted, Jewell said. The "suspect engines" will be shipped to CFM facilities in the United States and France for inspection and possible repair. Safran said earlier yesterday that it expected inspections to be completed within a few weeks. "We are doing everything to ensure that the first delivery can go ahead in May," Safran Aircraft Engines' Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. Boeing had been set to deliver the first 737 MAX on Monday to Malindo Air of Malaysia. Boeing has built up an inventory of planes outside its Renton, Washington, factory, and at a nearby Seattle airport known as Boeing Field. Reuters counted 23 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes at the facilities this week, excluding test aircraft.

Norwegian will also fly from Dublin, Shannon and Belfast to Rhode Island and New York. Boeing said it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 Max aircraft due to an engine issue. It is jointly made by General Electric and Safran of France. The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 Max to a Malaysian airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule. Boeing and enginemaker CFM said it does not know how long the delay will last. Boeing shares fell over 1%. The 737 Max replaces a version of Boeing’s best- selling single-aisle aircraft and low-cost carriers see the fuel-efficient design as the best way to make transatlantic travel profitable. Norwegian boss Bjorn Kjos said last month the airline felt compelled to use American-made Boeing to establish a good relationship with the Trump administration, which has made US-made manufacturing a priority. The Trump administration gave the go-ahead to Norwegian after more than a year of delays under the Obama administration. Competitor Airbus has introduced the similar fuel-efficient A320Neo aircraft. A Norwegian spokesperson said “Norwegian has bee informed of the temporary pause in the testing of the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing has given us a new delivery date of our first Max, which is a few days later than previous estimates. However, this will not delay the launch of our upcoming transatlantic routes from Ireland to the US.” Additional reporting Reuters READ MORE Visit the section home page here © Irish Examiner Ltd.

The oxygen system aboard one of the two VC-25 aircraft available to President Donald Trump was contaminated while the plane was undergoing maintenance at a Boeing plant in San Antonio, Texas between April 1 and April 10, 2016, according to an incident report released by Air Force investigators this week. The mechanics “caused the mishap by supplying and using non-oxygen clean tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorised cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks,” CNN quoted the report as saying. Tools and components used to repair a plane’s oxygen system must be cleaned in a particular way to remove any residue that could react when it comes into contact with oxygen, the report noted. If left unchecked, a contaminated oxygen system could increase the risk of fire or even cause an explosion. Last year’s mishap did not result in any injuries and the aerospace contractor paid for the damages. “Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President’s aircraft,” Boeing told CNN in a written statement on Thursday.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Testing, certification the last big hurdle in tanker production Dan Catchpole Fri May 12th, 2017 6:17pm BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Already behind schedule, Boeing’s KC-46 aerial refueling tanker is going to be later still. When Boeing delivers the first KC-46 late this year, the U.S. Air Force will get the most-versatile tanker in the world, company officials say. Completing testing and certification is the last big hurdle. Boeing is more than halfway through the process, but plenty more remains. Clearing Federal Aviation Administration certification “is our current challenge for completing the program,” said Mike Gibbons, a Boeing vice president and general manger of the KC-46 program. Last month, Boeing added a sixth test plane to quicken its progress through testing and certification. Earlier this year, the company told government officials that it had condensed the testing and certification schedule, and that it expected to start delivering three tankers a month in September and finish in February 2018. A March report from the Government Accountability Office cautioned that the pace was ambitious and at risk of taking longer than expected. At the time, Boeing dismissed the report as overly cautious. However, the first KC-46A Pegasus slated for delivery is not expected to fly until October, Gibbons said. The original deadline was to deliver the first 18 combat-ready tankers to the Air Force by this August. Supplier and design problems dogged the tanker’s development. Boeing won the contract to develop the tanker for the Air Force in 2011. The tanker is based on its successful 767 jetliner. The contract capped taxpayer costs at $4.9 billion. The delays and changes have cost Boeing roughly $2 billion in cost overruns. The latest charge was for $140 million, which Boeing reported in April. It came from the cost of rolling lessons from flight testing back into the production line, Gibbons said. “We don’t expect to learn anything more out of flight testing,” he said. Ground testing going on now at Edwards Air Force Base in California and next month at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland could uncover other rework, which would happen this summer, he said. With testing and certification about 65 percent complete, the list of things that can create expensive surprises for Boeing is dwindling. The Air Force plans to buy 179 KC-46s over the next 10 years as it begins upgrading its aging tanker fleet. The U.S. has more than 400 jet tankers. Most are Boeing KC-135s, which were developed in the 1950s. McDonnell Douglas designed the bigger KC-10 in the 1970s. Unlike those older tankers, the KC-46 is built to perform multiple missions. It can refuel aircraft in flight, haul cargo, and move passengers or medical patients. It takes less than two hours to switch from one role to the other. The KC-46 can refuel two aircraft at the same time with hoses — called drogues — trailing from pods mounted near its wingtips. It also can extend a single drogue or a boom — essentially a rigid straw — from the rear of its fuselage. No tanker has ever gone through FAA certification before, a process that has proven much more time consuming than Boeing originally had expected. Only about 3 percent of the aircraft and its systems receive only military certification due to being classified material. The plane can operate covertly at night without lights visible to the naked eye. Instead, the tanker has infrared lights to direct the pilots flying fighter jets and other aircraft coming in to gas up. Those pilots use night-vision goggles to see the infrared lights. On current tankers, huge incandescent floodlights bathe the boom. In mid-December, Boeing and Air Force test crews flying in a KC-46 over Eastern Washington successfully refueled a C-17 cargo plane at night and without visible lights. The operation went so smoothly, the C-17 pilots said they prefer the blacked-out method to floodlights, said Sean Martin, head of Boeing’s boom testing. When a pilot puts on or takes off night-vision goggles, it takes 15 minutes for the eyes to adjust. That costs valuable time and fuel during combat. The KC-46 system means American warplanes will have more time over targets — if it comes to that, he said. “We’ve designed a system so good, it’s going to change how the Air Force fights,” Martin said.

New Delhi (Sputnik) – Indian Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba would also be attending the events ashore. "Four Indian Naval Ships – Sahyadri, Shivalik, Jyoti and Kamorta – and an Indian Navy Long Range Maritime Patrol and Anti-Submarine Warfare aircraft P-8I would exercise with the RSN and RSAF as part of SIMBEX-17," the Indian Navy said. Apart from senior defense officials, Indian defense companies including shipbuilders Mazagon Dock Limited, Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers, Goa Shipyard are participating in the IMDEX-17. Indian companies are expected to aggressively market its equipment such as naval vessels and missiles like Akash and BrahMos at the event. The indigenous INS Sahyadri is a multi-role stealth frigate while INS Kamorta is an anti-submarine warfare corvette. This year would be the 24th edition of the annual maritime bilateral exercise between India and Singapore. Indian naval assets have been increasingly deployed in recent times to address the main maritime concerns of the region. In addition, as part of the Indian Government's vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region), the Indian Navy has also been involved in assisting countries in the Indian Ocean Region with EEZ Surveillance, Search and Rescue, and other capacity-building and capability enhancement activities. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

CFM had said flaws in the forging of a disc inside the engine could have led to cracks.Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline. Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing's ability to deliver the new jetliners on time. The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday.Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights. "Our plan remains to start deliveries this month," he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs. Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete.The engines, known as the LEAP-1B, were being shipped back to plants in Lafayette, Indiana, and Villeroche, France, for inspection. Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday that the company hoped to fix the problem "within a few weeks."Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far. The problem stemmed from a forging issue noticed on low-pressure turbine discs after they were sent to CFM from a supplier. A second supplier had stepped up production, CFM said. Andries said on Thursday that CFM still hoped to deliver as many as 500 LEAP engines this year, including variants used by Airbus (AIR.PA) And China's COMAC.

Regulators cleared the planes to fly as long as they’re powered by spare engines that don’t include the possibly defective part, Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said Friday. Supplier CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Safran SA, alerted the planemaker late last week to a manufacturing quality problem with low pressure turbine discs in the Leap engines. Boeing is racing to inspect the engines and meet delivery commitments to Indonesia’s Lion Mentari Airlines, the largest Max customer. The Chicago-based planemaker would need to hand over the first of the upgraded jets to Lion affiliate Malindo Airways early next week if the Malaysian budget airline is to meet the May 19 service start it has advertised. That Max was the only one to fly Friday, Alder said. “The plan remains to start deliveries this month,” he said. Lion Air said it hasn’t received any notice of a delivery delay from the U.S. manufacturer. Norwegian Air Shuttle is also slated to receive its first 737 Max in late May. Stock Impact The newest 737’s progression to market had gone smoothly until this week, and Boeing shares fell Wednesday after the company said it would ground the fleet of more than 20 Max planes. Engine faults have also marred the debuts of Airbus SE’s A320neo and Bombardier Inc.’s C Series single-aisle jets. Boeing’s potential quality flaw appears to be a “temporary manufacturing issue” at a second-tier supplier, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group. The setback is probably less significant than the mechanical problems snarling deliveries of a Pratt & Whitney-powered Airbus jet or the engine fire in 2014 that grounded the C Series, he said. The engine issue disclosed by Boeing this week “is nowhere near the technical uncertainties that the Airbus product has had,” said Howard Rubel, an aerospace analyst at Jefferies. “They know right away what the problem is, as opposed to we have to figure it out,” Rubel said. “To me this is like a tempest in a teapot.” The manufacturer is counting on a smooth market entry for the 737 Max, the latest version of a half-century-old airplane family that is the company’s largest source of profit. For now, much of the fledgling Max fleet remains grounded as Boeing, CFM and federal regulators develop a plan to clear the engines. Boeing fell 0.4 percent to $183.25 at the close in New York. GE dropped 2.1 percent to $28.27 after Deutsche Bank AG downgraded the stock earlier in the day for unrelated reasons. Potential Flaw On Wednesday, Boeing revealed a possible quality or manufacturing defect in the Leap 1-B model, created specifically for the Max. The planemaker hadn’t detected any issues with the low pressure turbine during more than 2,000 hours of flight testing. Boeing also had a small stash of Leap engines on hand that were unaffected, Alder said. Inspectors will tear down and examine about 30 affected engines at facilities in the U.S. and France, said Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for GE. The components came from a single disc supplier, and the 737 Max planes being flown now use discs from two other manufacturers. The Leap uses advanced materials, including durable ceramics, to improve performance and deliver better fuel efficiency over past models. The engine, also offered for aircraft such as the Airbus A320neo, competes with Pratt & Whitney’s geared turbofan to power a new generation of narrow-body planes. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Both engine makers have faced teething problems with their new products. Airbus has fallen behind in deliveries of the A320neo as Pratt’s turbine encounters durability issues including failure of a carbon air-seal, deterioration of the steel liner inside the combustion chamber and metal chips found in the main gearbox. Executives of Air Lease Corp., a Los Angeles-based aircraft lessor, warned during a May 5 earnings call that the CFM-powered model was also facing delays. CFM faces a steep production increase for the Leap, as Boeing and Airbus plot to increase narrow-body production by 33 percent through decade’s end. After delivering 77 of the engines last year, 28 fewer than it had predicted, CFM has targeted producing as many as 500 Leaps this year and about 2,000 in 2020. The manufacturing quality control problem appears to have been restricted to a batch of parts at one supplier, and not a fundamental flaw in the engine’s cutting edge technology. “There are no Leap design issues and we don’t anticipate any change in our build plan for 2017,” Matt Cribbins, GE vice president for investor communications, said in a bulletin Friday.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar Business Local Business More WestJet pilots poised to unionize amid intensifying worker unrest Amanda Stephenson, Calgary Herald, Calgary Herald  05.12.2017 An WestJet Boeing 737 takes off from Calgary International Airport.Gavin Young / Calgary Herald WestJet CEO Gregg Saretsky Gavin Young / Calgary Herald ShareAdjustCommentPrint WestJet Airlines — the Calgary-based carrier that has made non-unionization part of its corporate brand for more than 20 years — is set to become a union shop. In a secret ballot, WestJet pilots voted 62 per cent in favour of joining the Air Line Pilots Association International (ALPA), a large international union that represents pilots at 32 airlines across North America, including Air Transat and Jazz Aviation. WestJet’s shares fell four per cent to close Friday at $21.98 each as the airline prepared for eventual negotiations of the union’s first collective agreement for more than 1,400 pilots. Chief executive Gregg Saretsky – who vowed in December to “go down fighting” to prevent unionization at WestJet – said in a statement Friday he was disappointed with the vote, “but we are dedicated to moving forward as a team.” “We will now focus on engaging in constructive dialogue with ALPA and concentrate on the continued success of the organization for guests, employees and shareholders,” Saretsky said.   WestJet has been non-unionized since its first flight in 1996, and has long prided itself on a positive corporate culture and feel-good workplace environment. Because of its employee share purchase program, most WestJet employees own stock in the airline — and the company makes regular use of the slogan “Owners Care” to differentiate itself from its competition, particularly Air Canada. Capt. Rob McFadyen, a WestJet pilot and a member of the ALPA organizing committee, said in a statement that pilots want protections for health, retirement, fatigue, safety and legal issues, and they will seek that support through their new union. As Canada’s second largest airline, WestJet has long been an appealing target for unions, who have launched several failed campaigns over the decades. But employee unrest at the company has intensified over the past four years — a period that has been marked by rapid expansion at WestJet. Since 2013, WestJet has launched a separate regional airline, introduced a new premium economy seating category, and made its first foray into Europe. In recent weeks, WestJet has strayed even farther from its roots as a low-cost carrier with a simple business model. The airline has said it will move ahead with its international expansion plans by purchasing at least 10 Boeing Dreamliners, with options for an additional 10, allowing the carrier to reach new destinations in Asia, South America, and Europe. In April, the airline announced it would launch a no-frills carrier to serve “price sensitive” travellers before the end of the year, a move some analysts have suggested may be creating unease among pilots concerned about the potential impact on wages and working conditions. The vote appears to be a “logical response” to the push for no-frills air service and other trends in the industry that deal with controlling costs, said David Camfield, an associate professor of labour studies at the University of Manitoba. “Those kinds of changes will have negative effects for pilots around scheduling, job security, potentially pay,” Camfield said. “This degree of uncertainty and the prospect that there will be a deterioration of working conditions is something that would be on the minds of many pilots.” WestJet said it doesn’t know what impact the unionization vote would have on the airline’s ambitions for ultra-low-cost service, but it was forging ahead with its purchase of wide-bodied planes. Chris Murray, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital, said the vote creates new uncertainty about WestJet’s expansion plans, given that pilots must sign off on them. The airline must now gain that approval with an organized union that will be seeking collective bargaining negotiations, which could create additional delays, Murray said. “It may also change their perspective on what the cost profile would look like, and change their minds in perhaps going forward with some of these initiatives,” he said. Saretsky has said repeatedly that he remains convinced unionization would harm the relationship the airline currently has with it employees, and create a system of bureaucracy that would get in the way of direct conversations between management and staff. The union is now turning its focus to a membership drive and establishing pilot representatives in Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver, laying the foundation for a new executive council and negotiations for the first collective agreement. WestJet said the vote does not affect pilots who fly for its regional airline Encore.

The UK's plans to remanufacture 50 of its older Apache Longbow helicopters to the AH-64E standard appear to have been curtailed, with just 38 being included in this contract announcement. (IHS Markit/Patrick Allen) The contract, which was announced by the US Department of Defense (DoD) on 11 May, will be complete by 31 May 2024. Included are three crew trainers and spares. These UK helicopters will form part of the wider Lot 7-11 production runs for the US Army and other FMS customers. Though the precise nature of the remanufacturing process for the UK helicopters has not been disclosed, it is understood to involve a number of the existing systems (not including the engines) being cross-decked from the old Apache Longbow to the new Apache Guardian airframes. This allows costs to be saved as many of the more expensive items that have already been paid for can be reused. As previously reported, the first Apache Guardian for the UK is due to come off the US production line in early 2020, with the type beginning to enter service with the British Army Air Corps (AAC) in 2022. The AAC's existing Apache Longbows are due to be withdrawn from service between 2023 and 2024. While this contract is for 38 AH-64E Apache helicopters, the UK government has previously announced that it would spend USD2.3 billion on updating 50 of its 66 Longbow helicopters to the latest standard. It is not clear if that number has been reduced, or if the remaining 16 helicopters will be included in follow-on contracts. However, the fact that the conclusion date of this contract coincides with the planned out-of-service date of the current Longbows indicates that 38 is the new final number. Want to read more?

According to the report, between April 1-10, 2016, "three Boeing mechanics supplied and used contaminated tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak checks" on one of the VC-25 aircraft in the Air Force One fleet. There weren't any injuries resulting from the lack of proper procedure, but not cleaning tools properly before working on the oxygen system can create a fire hazard. The report notes that the cost of remediating the contamination in the oxygen system came to over $4 million, paid for by Boeing (ba). "Boeing fully understands the level of responsibility that comes from working on the President's aircraft," Boeing told CNN in a statement. "We took swift action to self-report the incident to the US Air Force. The oxygen system was remediated by Boeing at no cost to the government."

Conducted at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, the demonstration involved the flight testing of Talon HATE pods on two F-15C aircraft. During the testing, Talon HATE pods allowed test pilots to share information through the military’s Link 16, Common Data Link and Wideband Global SATCOM satellites. USAF Talon HATE manager lieutenant colonel Christopher Bradley said: “We’ve completed developmental flight testing. “We look forward to fielding this system, not only to immediately provide aircrews with actionable information faster and at a higher quality, but also to help the air force learn important lessons for the employment of tactical gateway systems in the future.” The tests also proved the capabilities of the intra-flight datalink network used by the F-22 aircraft. "We look forward to fielding this system, not only to immediately provide aircrews with actionable information faster and at a higher quality, but also to help the air force learn important lessons." Using Talon, pilots can now transmit information quickly between the F-15C and other air force aircraft and weapon systems. Boeing’s Talon HATE programme manager vice-president Paul Geery said: “This aerial network is a giant leap forward in tactical fighter capability with real-time connectivity and expanded information sharing. “We are now demonstrating secure datalink connections between F-15Cs and F-22s in a way that integrates information for the pilot into a common operating picture.” Boeing plans to conduct additional tests later this year with advanced sensors, which will offer improved aircraft targeting capabilities.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: J.C. Penney — The retailer earned an adjusted six cents per share for its latest quarter, compared to forecasts for a 21 cent loss. Revenue fell below forecasts, however, and same-store sales slid 3.5 percent compared to estimates of a 0.6 percent drop. Fiat Chrysler — The automaker voluntarily recalled 1.25 million Ram pickup trucks to fix a software issue involving the restraint system. The company said it knows of one fatality and two injuries related to the issue. One million of those trucks were sold in the U.S. market. Nordstrom — The retailer reported adjusted quarterly profit of 43 cents per share, well above estimates of 27 cents a share. Revenue was slightly above forecasts, but the comparable-store sales drop of 0.8 percent was more than analysts were anticipating. Sprint — Sprint and its controlling shareholder SoftBank have started preliminary talks about merging Sprint with T-Mobile US, according to a Bloomberg report. Corning — The glassmaker was awarded $200 million from Apple's new Advanced Manufacturing Fund. The money will support Corning's efforts to advance state-of-the-art glass processing. General Electric — GE was downgraded to "sell" from "hold" at Deutsche Bank, which also cut 2018 earnings estimates for the company and said the stock is overvalued given its weak earnings quality. AstraZeneca — The drugmaker said its immunotherapy drug durvalumab was shown to reduce the risk of death from lung cancer. Boeing — Boeing's 737 MAX jetliner will need its engines re-approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) before the jetmaker can begin deliveries after the new jet was grounded due to an engine issue. It is unclear how long the re-approval process might take. A spokesperson for engine maker CFM said discussions with the FAA are currently taking place. Wal-Mart — CEO Douglas McMillon has been ordered by a judge to answer questions in a shareholder lawsuit pertaining to alleged bribery in Mexico. McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International when the alleged incidents took place. Wal-Mart said it is reviewing the order and considering its next steps. Anthem — Anthem failed in its bid to get a judge to order Cigna not to terminate its merger deal with Anthem. Anthem will have until Monday to decide if it will appeal the case to the Delaware Supreme Court. The Justice Department, along with 11 states, won their legal bids last year to halt the $54 billion deal, and Cigna accused its rival health insurer of breaching the agreement by failing to get regulatory approval. Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, and Netflix – These stocks are all undervalued, according to billionaire investor Mark Cuban. He made his comments in an interview with CNBC's "Fast Money." CA Technologies — The software company reported quarterly profit 54 cents per share, beating estimates of 49 cents a share. Revenue was above forecasts, as well. Its results were helped in part by better-than-expected profit margins and software fees, but it did give full-year earnings guidance that was below Street forecasts. The Trade Desk — The company earned an adjusted 18 cents per share for its first quarter, well above consensus estimates of one cent a share. The provider of programmatic advertising technology also saw revenue come in above forecasts, as is its full-year guidance. Tiffany — The luxury goods retailer was upgraded to "buy" from "neutral" at Goldman Sachs, with a price target of $107 per share. Goldman said Tiffany offers a unique exposure to a resurgence in the luxury category, spurred by international tourists and the U.S. high-end consumer.

The move is the latest attempt by TCI to stop Safran's US$9 billion deal with struggling Zodiac, which the British hedge fund considered too expensive even before the latest profit warning from the maker of aircraft seats. In a letter to the Safran board dated May 12, TCI said instead of pursuing the takeover, which would take up a lot of management time and focus, it should instead look to fix a problem with its new LEAP engine. Boeing suspended some flights this week due to a problem with the design of Safran's LEAP-1B engine, which powers its 737 MAX jets. "Due to the extreme pressure that Safran is under to ramp up production of the LEAP engine, the board should immediately cancel the agreement to buy Zodiac Aerospace," TCI founder Christopher Hohn wrote in the letter. Advertisement Advertisement "Safran management currently has no capacity to integrate Zodiac or to execute the complex restructuring that will be required. At this critical time the company should be focused solely on the ramp up of the LEAP." A spokeswoman for Safran declined to comment. Boeing says it has identified a problem with some of the low pressure turbine discs in the LEAP engine, which is made by a CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran. Safran, though, said on Thursday there was no design fault and that checks would be completed in a few weeks. It said production of the engines would not be affected because a second supplier for the same part was boosting its supplies. CFM aims to deliver "as close as possible to 500" in total for Boeing, Airbus and China's COMAC. Safran recently reported forecast-beating first-quarter revenue and reaffirmed its 2017 outlook, which includes plans to boost production of the LEAP engine to 2,000 units a year during the next three years. While Hohn said he backed Safran as it was structured now, trying to hit that target while also fixing problems at Zodiac would be a "considerable and unnecessary distraction". "It would consume management time and demand a reallocation of talented Safran employees to run Zodiac's troubled business. This would significantly increase the risk of the LEAP program developing expensive and damaging problems."

The Defense Department said Thursday the modification covers remanufacturing of 38 AH-64 Apache aircraft as well as the provision of three Longbow crew trainers to the U.K. military. The Army Contracting Command obligated the full amount of the modification from fiscal 2010 “other” funds at the time of award. Boeing will perform work in Mesa, Arizona, through May 31, 2024. The U.K.’s ministry of defense said in July 2016 that it would buy up to 50 AH-64Es for the country’s army as well as nine P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance planes for the U.K. air force as part of two foreign military sales deals with the U.S. government worth a combined $6.2 billion.

A B-17 tail gunner during the war, 93-year-old Fred Parker of Lacey, recounts that time Steve Bloom sbloom@theolympian.com Entertainment May 11, 2017 3:51 PM Ride aboard one of the bombers made famous during World War II By Jeffrey P. Mayor jmayor@thenewstribune.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story By most of today’s airline standards, this flight leaves a lot to be desired. The seats are uncomfortable and don’t recline. Smoke spews from the engines as they start up. There’s no in-flight entertainment system nor do you get a minibag of snack mix. The brakes squeal, loudly. And when the engines power up for takeoff, oh, the noise. It makes a flight even on publicity-challenged United seem good. What makes it all worthwhile, though, is the opportunity to ride aboard a World War II-era B-17 bomber. The Experimental Aircraft Association and its Cascade Warbird Squadron No. 2 is offering rides aboard Aluminum Overcast on Friday (May 12) through Sunday as the centerpiece of activities at the Olympic Flight Museum. “This plane should be in a museum, behind velvet ropes,” said Neil Morrison of Port Townsend, one of the pilots flying the bomber Wednesday. “But here, you get a chance to ride a flying piece of history,” chimed in Matt Ott, crew chief. Throughout the war, more than 12,700 B-17s were built, including more than 6,900 at Boeing Plant 2 in Seattle. “Aluminum Overcast” is just one of about a dozen B-17s still capable of flying. There are fewer than 50 complete airframes still in existence. This particular Flying Fortress, a B-17G model, was built in May 1945 in Burbank, California, under a license from Boeing by Vega Aircaft Co., now Lockheed Martin. Too late to be sent into action, the plane was destined to be scrapped. Before it could be cut up, the plane was purchased in 1946 for $750 and began a civilian career that included aerial mapping, fire fighting and hauling cattle. The plane was retired in 1976. In 1978, a private group bought the airplane and restored it to commemorate the original Aluminum Overcast that was shot down in August 1944 while over France during its 34th combat mission. In 1979, the aircraft was donated to the Experimental Aircraft Association. It was on display until 1983, when a 10-year restoration effort began to make the plane airworthy again. Now, as the plane tours the country, anyone has a chance to experience a flight aboard one of the most famous planes from World War II. On a series of preview flights Wednesday, eight B-17 veterans were on hand to take to the sky once again aboard a familiar plane. Among them was 93-year-old Fred Parker of Lacey. He survived 33 missions as a tail gunner. Parker was somber for a moment as he looked across the tarmac toward the plane. “The guys that didn’t make it back, that’s what I think about when I see that plane,” he said. But Parker was unabashed in his admiration for the rugged bomber. “We never came back with all four engines running,” he said. “There were times we shouldn’t have made it back, but those planes hung in there.” As the plane soared over downtown Olympia, bumping in the thermals of a sunny day, younger passengers moving about the plane could only guess what Parker and his crew mates experienced. But they thrilled at the opportunity to sit in the nose of the plane, looking out the expanse of Plexiglass of the bombardier’s station. The waist gunner positions offered great views as the plane circled the Capitol. With the Plexiglass removed, you could stick a camera out the port above the radio operator’s station. After the short flight and the plane came to a stop on the ramp, the 10 passengers burst into applause, letting out whoops of excitement and thanks. It was, after all, no ordinary flight aboard just any plane. Visit Aluminum Overcast What: The B-17 bomber will be at the Olympic Flight Museum. It will be open for ground tours and flights will be offered. The flight experience is about an hour long, with 24 minutes spent in the air. When in the air, passengers can move around the plane. Also on hand will be military re-enactors and other displays. When: Friday (May 12)-Sunday. Where: Olympic Flight Museum, 7637 Old Highway 99 SE, Olympia. Cost: Museum admission is $5. Ground tours on “Aluminum Overcast” are $10 a person or $20 a family. Flights paid in advance are $409 for Experimental Aircraft Association members and $449 for nonmembers, or $435 and $475 when purchased at the airport.

The regulatory hurdle could push back the resumption of 737 MAX flights, a potentially serious issue for Boeing if it delays the scheduled first deliveries of the $110 million plane to airlines this month. The delivery of a plane is a crucial step for Boeing since it receives the bulk of its payment when it turns over the aircraft keys and airlines fly their new planes home from the factory. Boeing and engine maker CFM International must submit data to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the FAA has to "review it and determine that those engines can be cleared for flight," said Jamie Jewell a spokesman for CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France. It was not immediately clear how long that process might take. The FAA spokeswoman said she was checking on the matter. Boeing said it still plans to deliver the first of the planes to customers this month. It said on Wednesday it had suspended 737 MAX test flights due to a quality issue with some of the low-pressure turbine discs in the engine, known as the LEAP-1B. The nickel-based alloy discs had a flaw from forging that could make them prone to cracking, Jewell said, adding that discs from a second supplier were not affected. However, the FAA review applies to all LEAP-1B engines, Jewell said, not just the 30 to 40 with suspected bad parts. "In their mind, all LEAP-1B engines are equal," she said. KEY MONEYMAKER Boeing has engines at the factory without the suspected parts, but CFM and Boeing "have to demonstrate to the FAA's satisfaction that the issue is not present," Jewell said. The engines could be installed in short order once approval is granted, Jewell said. The "suspect engines" will be shipped to CFM facilities in the United States and France for inspection and possible repair. Safran said earlier Thursday that it expected inspections to be completed within a few weeks. "We are doing everything to ensure that the first delivery can go ahead in May," Safran Aircraft Engines' Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. Boeing had been set to deliver the first 737 MAX on Monday to Malindo Air of Malaysia. Boeing has built up an inventory of planes outside its Renton, Washington, factory, and at a nearby Seattle airport known as Boeing Field. Reuters counted 23 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes at the facilities this week, excluding test aircraft. The 737 MAX 8 carries a list price of $110 million but typically sells at a steep discount.

Maybe he won’t save the world. But with a new doc and Netflix show, the Science Guy is, at the very least, saving his career John Semley May 3, 2017 Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   Bill Nye hosts National Park Foundation ‘View-A-Thon’ at Mashable on November 29, 2016 in New York City. (Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images) About thirty minutes into David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg’s new documentary Bill Nye: Science Guy, which made its international premiere this week at Toronto’s Hot Docs film festival, a montage of interviewees express a shared suspicion: Bill Nye is dead. For a generation coming of age in the mid-1990s, Nye was everywhere. In his trademark blue lab coat and bowtie, Bill Nye (“The Science Guy”) introduced kids watching his super-popular PBS show to the wild world of science, through zippily edited experiments, pop song parodies (like “AC/DC Charge” by Billy Ray Cyrcuits) and a welcome dose of comedy that enlivened the doldrums of elementary school science class. He was—at the risk of overstating it—the Michael Jordan of science. So where did he go? “It took me this long to find the right people to work with,” says Nye, who recently revived his Science Guy persona for his new Netflix talk show Bill Nye Saves The World. He rattles off a list of TV shows and documentaries he’s appeared in since the glory days of Bill Nye the Science Guy: BattleBots, The Eyes of Nye, 100 Greatest Inventions, and half a dozen more. He laments that these programs, worthy as they are, lacked the “pop” of the Science Guy show that made him a star. “The other problem was that these shows weren’t extensions of me,” Nye says. “Anybody could have hosted these shows and they would have come out fine. Whether you like him or not, The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon has to be an extension of Jimmy Fallon. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert has to be an extension of Stephen Colbert. Chelsea Lately has to be an extension of Chelsea Handler, or it just won’t work.” Bill Nye leads demonstrators on a march to the U.S. Capitol during the March for Science in Washington, U.S., April 22, 2017. (Aaron Bernstein/Reuters) Bill Nye Saves the World has plenty of pop—and plenty of Bill Nye. Back in the bowtie and lab coat, tinkering around with beakers and burners in front of live studio audiences—comprised largely by 20- and 30-somethings for whom Nye served as a de facto substitute science teacher—and a suitably catchy, repetitive theme song (courtesy rapper/producer Tyler, The Creator, no less). For the Science Guy himself, Bill Nye Saves the World is the realization of a lifelong ambition. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1977 and landing a lucrative engineering job with Boeing, Nye shifted gears, pursuing a career in comedy after winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest. “I spent a lot of time trying to write comedy, trying to write jokes, performing in comedy sketches,” he recalls. “In my day we studied The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. This was the grail, the big dream in the sky: to be Johnny Carson. And I mean, I’m there! I’m not Johnny Carson, but I’ve got my own talk show. Check me out, man!” That could very well be the pitch for Bill Nye Saves the World: “The Tonight Show for pop science.” There’s Nye’s commingling of comedy and science, pre-taped segments, and panel discussions with experts on a given subject. Every inch of the lavishly designed sound stage feels like an extension of Nye. It’s like a straight-up sequel to the beloved Bill Nye: The Science Guy. And that’s the problem. Nye still talks to his audience, who are now fully matured adults, as if they’re wide-eyed little kids watching PBS. As its host fist-bumps his correspondents, screams “Woohoo!” at one or another experiment, and creaks his way through dorky jokes, Bill Nye Saves the World is pandering to the point of feeling embarrassing. It also borders on irresponsible. Take episode four, “More Food, Less Hype,” which discusses genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Pulling off his best Dr. Frankenstein impression, Nye paints “this image of mad scientists mixing tarantula genes into eggplants!” He then dispatches a correspondent to a farmer’s market, in an obviously Kimmel-ish turn, to expose the ignorance of consumers and organic food activists when it comes to GMOs. It’s a classic example of building a straw man: reducing an argument to broad caricature in order to easily refute it. While some people may find genetically modified foods just straight-up “icky,” many of the larger concerns have less to do with the genetics and more to do with the economics, like how gargantuan agrochemical corporations like Monsanto exploit biological patents to exert a stranglehold on family farmers and other croppers not using Monsanto-branded seeds. It’s not necessarily about the bioethics of breeding more resilient soybean crops or growing larger strawberries; it’s about the corporate ethics of GMO giants rigging (or splicing) the game to bolster their bottom lines. It may be easy to excuse such lapses in argumentation. After all, Bill Nye is the Science Guy, not the Corporate Ethics Guy. And given how frequently Nye is attacked for his lack of actual scientific credentials—Alvarado and Sussberg’s new doc digs into this rather deeply, even showing archival footage of Sarah Palin undermining Nye’s scientific bona fides—it may be understandable that he wants to stick to the science, if only to bolster that perceived lack of credibility. “If Sarah Palin were to say, ‘I think Bill Nye is a first-class mechanical engineer,’ that would be troubling in a whole different way,” Nye says, laughing. “An endorsement from Sarah Palin is not a good thing.” Nye has been hearing these criticisms for so long that they roll off him like water off a duck’s back. Despite his prominence in the scientific community (or at least the pop scientific community), he’s less a “real scientist” than an accessible figurehead—a kind of science mascot. But the documentary levels an even harsher criticism at Nye—one he takes more seriously. It’s the accusation that his prominence, his persona, his whole Science Guy shtick, is a play for fame, the end-result of a wannabe comedian realizing his aspirations of stardom. “It made me feel bad,” says Nye of the claim that he’s only in it for the fame. “When you get laughs, it’s very exciting, as a comedian. When you see a student’s eyes light up, as a teacher, that’s also very exciting. When you don’t feel well, and you don’t want to perform, too bad. That’s the way it goes.” Still, he barely allows himself a moment to be ruffled by the apparent arraignment of his sincerity. “Yes!” he screams, through the phone, fully alive and unembarrassed. “I love being on television! Yes! I’m a performer! Yes! That’s me! The show must go on!” For Nye, science and superstardom seem one and the same. Even when his new show exhibits distasteful cajoling of its Millennial audience, or a lack of genuine scientific rigour (or indeed, a sense that he is actively shilling for Monsanto), it becomes difficult to blame, let alone dislike, Bill Nye. After all, he never claimed to be a real scientist. Only a Science Guy.

The result includes AGC’s receipt of an $891 million tax benefit related to the elimination of the company’s net deferred tax liability―a result of the company’s March 31 change in tax status from a corporation to a limited liability company (LLC). “The conversion to an LLC structure increases our equity base, thereby strengthening our balance sheet and allowing us to continue to grow and execute on our business plan, while at the same time providing a more tax efficient structure for our parent, Pacific Life,” ACG CEO Khanh Tran said March 31. The company, now known as Aviation Capital Group LLC, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Life Aviation Holdings, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Newport Beach, California-based Pacific Life Insurance Co. With the tax-status conversion, AGC will be taxed as a partnership for US income-tax purposes. “Therefore, for periods after March 31, 2017, we will be a flow-through entity for US tax purposes and not subject to federal or state income tax at the partnership level,” AGC explained in a note to its Q1 financial statement, released May 11. “Instead, our members will be responsible for income taxes on our US federal and state taxable income.” AGC’s equity profile on March 31, the end of the first quarter, totaled $2.7 billion, compared to $1.9 billion at the end of 2016. For 2016, AGC reported a full-year net profit of $78 million, down 11.4% from $88 million the previous year. ACG reported $232.7 million in revenue for 1Q 2017, down 1.7% from 1Q 2016. Quarterly expenses rose 35.6% year-over-year to $286.6 million, leaving AGC with an operating loss of $53.9 million, reversed from a $25.3 million operating profit in 1Q 2016. ACG’s impairment of aircraft expenses more than tripled to $125 million during the quarter, compared to a year ago. As of March 31, AGC’s portfolio comprised 267 owned and managed aircraft, including 123 Airbus A320-family aircraft; three Airbus A330s; 128 Boeing 737-family aircraft; 10 refurbished Boeing 757s and three Boeing 767s. The company has firm orders and commitments for 159 aircraft from manufacturers and third parties, including 61 A320neo-family aircraft; 21 A320ceos; 60 737 MAX-family aircraft; seven Boeing 787s; eight current-engine 737s; one Boeing 777; and one refurbished 757. AGC said the weighted average age of its owned portfolio aircraft is six years. AGC expects to take delivery of 32 new aircraft in 2017. AGC’s first-quarter transactions included a long-term lease agreement with LOT Polish Airlines for three new 787-9s, slated for delivery in March 2018. AGC also has a sale and lease-back agreement with Vietnam-based low-cost carrier (LCC) Jetstar Pacific for 10 new A320-200s, with the first two expected to be delivered in June 2017 and the remaining eight slated for the third and fourth quarters of 2017.

Seattle has become one of the most important top tech hubs in the world, with an all-star lineup of homegrown companies and massive offices for out-of-towners looking to get their hands on the region’s deep roster of tech talent. Andrew Dumont. (Curious Capital Photo) But the city that spawned Microsoft, Amazon, Expedia, F5 and Zillow still comes up short in funding sources for early stage companies, with a lack of options for local startups to get off the ground. Andrew Dumont and Cameron Borumand want to change that. In February they began raising money for a new venture capital fund focused on early stage investments called Curious Capital. The fund is based in Seattle, but it wants to invest in startups throughout the Pacific Northwest. Curious Capital has already cut a couple small checks, and the fund is actively investing. They declined to say what companies they’ve invested in, and did not disclose the target size of the new fund. But the arrival of a new funding source in Seattle is good news for those who’ve argued that the Northwest — despite its amazing array of technologists and world-class companies — still falls short when it comes to bankrolling the next-generation of companies. The Curious Capital co-founders both hail from Washington state, and recently returned to Seattle from stints in New York and San Francisco. Dumont’s mother fell ill, and that brought him back to Seattle earlier this year, though he had always intended to return some day. Borumand is a born and raised Pacific Northwesterner, who comes from a Microsoft and Boeing family. He felt the pull of home and wanted to get involved in Seattle’s booming tech scene. The Seattle region has long been critiqued for its general lack of investors, both early-stage angel investors and later-stage venture capitalists. Dumont and Borumand have experienced what they say are stronger funding networks in New York and San Francisco with more options to choose from. And while there are many angel investors who got rich at places like Microsoft or Amazon and now invest as a hobby, Dumont said that the Pacific Northwest needs more options for early stage startups. “For an ecosystem to be healthy from a fundraising standpoint, you need more active funds, more active investors supporting it,” says Dumont, adding that they plan to invest across a wide array of sectors, from consumer-oriented companies to business-to-business software. The partners likely will stay away from up-and-coming biotech startups. Cameron Borumand (Curious Capital Photo) Dumont has founded and worked for startups in Seattle, including Moz, where he was business development director. He eventually made his way to New York City, where he worked as an entrepreneur in residence at Betaworks, a startup studio similar in concept to Seattle’s Pioneer Square Labs. Dumont went on to become chief marketing officer at Bitly, a Betaworks spinoff company. Borumand brings the financial expertise. He is a former investment banker for Vaquero Capital in San Francisco, where he worked on later-stage financing for companies. One thing you won’t see in these descriptions, a long track record of raising funds. “We are kind of bootstrapping a venture fund, which is completely illogical; it’s pretty stupid in a lot of ways,” Dumont said. “But we really believe in what we are doing, so that’s why we are doing this.” That means raising capital is among the biggest challenges. To overcome this, Dumont and Borumand are starting small, and pitching their expertise as a benefit. They aren’t taking a salary, nor have they attached any fees to the fund. In addition to funding, Curious Capital wants to be hands on with companies it invests in, helping them with growth plans and strategies to bring their products to market. Curious Capital isn’t the only company to come forward to fill the investor void in Seattle. Last month, GeekWire reported on a new fund called Flying Fish Venture Partners. Founded by Seattle angel investors Heather Redman, Geoff Harris, and Frank Chang, Flying Fish is focused on helping early-stage startups in the Pacific Northwest get through their Series A round of funding and scale to the next level. Dumont said he knows his firm won’t entirely fix funding issues in Seattle, but it’s a start. Curious Capital also wants to be a cheerleader for the region, promoting work done by local startups. Dumont said Pacific Northwest entrepreneurs are much less likely to brag about their work than counterparts in New York or San Francisco. “I think one of the challenges here — one of the gifts and curses of Seattle people, including myself — is that we put on our headphones and we work, but we don’t boast much. We don’t talk much about what we are doing,” Dumont said. “We are able to build awesome companies here because we are so focused on what we are working on. But it actually hurts because a lot of people don’t know there are a bunch of people building early stage companies here.” Nat Levy is a staff reporter at Geekwire covering a variety of technology topics, including Microsoft, Amazon, tech startups, and the intersection of technology with real estate, courts and government.

The company has built about 25 of the planes and each has two engines. The 737-8 uses Leap-1B engines manufactured by CFM International, a 50/50 joint venture between General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) and France’s Safran. The company also manufactures two other versions of the engine: the Leap-1A for Airbus’s A320neo and the Leap-1C for China’s C919. Neither of the other engine variations is affected by the FAA decision. The issue came to light earlier this week when a CFM quality inspection revealed that a part in the Leap-1B’s low-pressure turbine section displayed some cracking. Boeing and CFM determined that the problem was related to a batch of parts received from one supplier that had used an incorrect manufacturing process for making the part. Boeing and CFM are being required to submit data to the FAA for review and the FAA will decide if the repaired engines can be cleared for flight. There is no estimate of how long this process will take. The first delivery of a 737-8 to a customer is scheduled for later this month, and Boeing says it still plans to make the delivery on time. That’s important to Boeing not just for the optics, but the company doesn’t receive the final (large) payment for an airplane until it is delivered to the customer. The list price for a 737-8 is $112.4 million. Boeing’s stock traded up about 0.8% in Friday’s premarket, at $185.40 in a 52-week range of $122.35 to $187.21.

(Reuters) US aviation regulator must reapprove engines on jetliner before it can take flight, begin deliveries The US aviation regulator must reapprove the engines on Boeing's 737 MAX jetliner before it can take flight and begin deliveries, the engine maker said, after the new aircraft was grounded due to an engine problem. The regulatory hurdle could push back the resumption of 737 MAX flights, a potentially serious issue for Boeing if it delays the scheduled first deliveries of the $110 million plane to airlines this month. The delivery of a plane is a crucial step for Boeing since it receives the bulk of its payment when it turns over the aircraft keys and airlines fly their new planes home from the factory. Boeing and engine maker CFM International must submit data to the US Federal Aviation Administration, and the FAA has to "review it and determine that those engines can be cleared for flight", said Jamie Jewell, a spokeswoman for CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and Safran. It was not immediately clear how long that process might take. The FAA is working with CFM and Boeing "to develop a proposed plan to clear the engines," said spokeswoman Laura Brown. Boeing said it still plans to deliver the first of the planes to customers this month. It said on Wednesday it had suspended 737 MAX test flights due to a quality issue with some of the low-pressure turbine discs in the engine, known as the LEAP-1B. The nickel-based alloy discs had a flaw from forging that could make them prone to cracking, Jewell said, adding that discs from a second supplier were not affected. However, the FAA review applies to all LEAP-1B engines, Jewell said, not just the 30 to 40 with suspected bad parts. "In their mind, all LEAP-1B engines are equal," she said.   Key moneymaker Boeing has engines at the factory without the suspect parts, but CFM and Boeing "have to demonstrate to the FAA's satisfaction that the issue is not present", Jewell said. The engines could be installed in short order once approval is granted, Jewell said. The "suspect engines" will be shipped to CFM facilities in the United States and France for inspection and possible repair. Safran said earlier Thursday that it expected inspections to be completed within a few weeks. "We are doing everything to ensure that the first delivery can go ahead in May," Safran Aircraft Engines' CEO Andries told reporters. The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. Boeing had been set to deliver the first 737 MAX on Monday to Malindo Air of Malaysia. Boeing has built up an inventory of planes outside its Renton, Washington, factory, and at a nearby Seattle airport known as Boeing Field. Reuters counted 23 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes at the facilities this week, excluding test aircraft. The 737 MAX 8 carries a list price of $110 million but typically sells at a steep discount.

Taiwan’s military purchases “have boosted the local economy of and employment in states such as Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Utah, Ohio and Pennsylvania,” the Cabinet said as part of the public comment process for a 90-day trade review being conducted by the US. Companies like Raytheon Co, Lockheed Martin Co, Boeing Co, Sikorsky and BAE Systems PLC have benefited from Taiwan’s purchases of missile defense systems, attack helicopters, fighter jets and other amphibious assault vehicles, it said. Taiwan said that despite its efforts to build up an indigenous defense, “this will not affect our military procurement from the US” and it would continue to procure goods, including military hardware. The 40-page English-language response released by the Cabinet late on Thursday stated that US-Taiwan ties were a “top priority” and that the nation and is “open to any possible proposals that will strengthen US-Taiwan trade relations on a fair and mutually-beneficial basis.” It provided rare detail on the effect of the nation’s military purchases on the US and follows US President Donald Trump’s call for allies to pay their fair share of defense costs, reduce trade gaps and boost US jobs. From 2008 to 2015, Taiwan was the seventh-largest source of procurement for US military-related goods and on average, military sales have amounted to US$2 billion annually, the Cabinet said. It said that trade data accounting for arms sales, as well as the after-sales services and personnel training that come with it, would further close the overall trade gap between the two nations. In late March, Trump ordered the US Department of Commerce and trade representative to conduct a 90-day review of the causes of massive US trade deficits. This story has been viewed 1071 times.

This market research report also lists four other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. Competitive vendor landscape According to the research analysis, the global electric propulsion satellite market is expected to grow at a CAGR of close to 14% during the forecast period. The market is highly competitive, where vendors compete based on the cost of developing electric propulsion technology for satellites, advancement of technologies, overall weight and size of satellite platforms, as well as the reliability of satellites. To enhance their respective market share, prominent vendors are emphasizing on offering futuristic solutions for both orbital injection and station-keeping process, while ensuring all customer demands are met.

Photo courtesy of the CHS robotics team. The Cordova High School Wolverines robotics team won a lottery ticket to compete at the FIRST World Championships in Houston, Texas, in April, an opportunity to spend four days learning, collaborating, and competing with the best student minds in world. The FIRST Tech Challenge competition included 128 teams from around the globe with kids from across the US and dozens of countries. The world championships were held at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, with over 10,000 kids competing across four different robotics categories. Arriving on opening day, the team was immediately in awe at the size and festive atmosphere of the event. The entire convention center was abuzz with excited students eager for the competition. Each team had an assigned 10×10 ‘pit’ area in the expo hall, which functioned as a home base for the students to work on their robots between matches, share information about their team and community outreach, and as a social hangout spot. Nearby the expo area was the ‘Innovation Fair’ where big tech companies such as Rockwell Collins, Disney, Boeing, NASA, and more had booths for students to learn how their companies work with robotics. Dozens of colleges had tables providing students the opportunity to learn more about their programs, and scholarship opportunities. As the competition unfolded, we were overwhelmed by the open collaboration across the teams, with kids sharing design ideas, approaches to building robots and driving systems, code sharing, and more. The students exchange contact information with several teams and spent with several Alaskan teams that had won in our state and regional events in the west coast. Between competition matches, our students spent a lot of time talking with kids from around the world, exploring the other robotics leagues, and at the innovation fair. Each day the expo and matches started around 8 am, going until 5 pm, with evening activities following. Our students also attended a major league baseball game at Minute Maid Park, visited a technology innovation center for startup tech companies, attend the exclusive ‘RoboProm’ for high school students, the opening celebration city block party with live music and sit-in flight simulators, as well as a full day at the NASA Space Center. Having won a lottery ticket, being the youngest rookie team in our division, and knowing this was the world championship, our team’s main focus was to collaborate with other students, learn more about the competition and robot designs, and gain additional skills to improve for next season. We also had a modest goal of winning at least one match and not coming in last place in our division. The team exceeded all our goals coming back with a wealth of knowledge, peer contacts, and true inspiration for evolving our local program to higher levels. We also won two matches and ended up placing 119th of 128 teams, which for a program with over 5,000 FTC teams globally technically ranks Cordova in the top 3 percent of all robotics teams. The students are truly inspired after this event and ready to take CHS Robotics to the next level of competition and get more kids involved next year. This was a huge opportunity for our students and school that would not have been possible without the support from the Cordova School District and our local sponsors. A big thank you to everyone who supported the new Cordova robotics programs this year and a special thank you for those who financially helped our team attend the world championships, including: Robot Logo Sponsors: AC Value Center, Cordova Telephone Cooperative, FyrSoft (fire-soft), Native Village of Eyak, and Shoreside Petroleum Event Sponsors: Albert & Maria Newnam, Andra & Nathan Doll, Barry & Gayle Beckett, Camtu’s, Childrens Pallas, Copper Valley Wireless, Cordova Wireless Cooperative, Cully Wooden, Dez Jenson, Goodrich Accounting, Harborside Pizza, HI Monkey, Joann & John Thomas, Laura’s, Lures Salon & Spa, Nichols, North Star Lumber, Plumbline Supply, Prince William Sound Motel, PWSSC, Sheryl & David Glasen, Stacy Plum, Teal Lohse, Terry Kennedy, Trident Seafoods Also special thanks to the high school assistant coaches who helped us during the season and event travel: Bryan Mills, Darren Traxinger, Jared Niles To see more pictures from the World Championships or to keep track of the robotics program during the summer and next school year you can follow us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/groups/cordovafirst/ Jeremiah Beckett is the CHS Tech Club Advisor SHARE Facebook Twitter Previous articleTender Restored Next articleObituary: Bert Henry Nichols Sr. The Cordova Times The Cordova Times is Prince William Sound's oldest newspaper, publishing since 1914.

T+L Newsletters It's your fault.  Travelers boarding American Airlines’ new fleet of Boeing 737MAX aircraft later this year might notice something missing: The seat-back entertainment screen. The airline announced the change, which comes as more and more passengers are traveling with their own personal devices, in a statement sent to employees Tuesday. “More than 90 percent of our passengers already bring a device or screen with them when they fly,” airline representatives wrote in the statement. “Those phones and tablets are continually upgraded, they’re easy to use, and most importantly, they are the technology that our customers have chosen.” Related: How to Book American Airlines Business Class for the Price of Economy So instead of staring at the seatback in front of them, passengers on American will have the option to watch movies, television shows, and live television on their phone, tablet, or laptop—all without needing to purchase in-flight Wi-Fi. Passengers will also be able to stream from on-demand platforms like Netflix and Amazon, or purchase high-speed Wi-Fi on board to surf online. “It makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seat-back monitors that will be obsolete within a few years,” the airline statement reads. Seat-back monitors will still be available for passengers flying American Airlines internationally on the Boeing 777s, 787s, and on Airbus A330s, A350s, and A321s. The airline also plans to have completed the installation of their speedier satellite-based Wi-Fi aboard half of its narrow-body jets by 2018, and on its entire fleet by the end of 2019.

Three Boeing Co. mechanics “failed to observe explicit warnings” and contaminated one VC-25A plane’s oxygen system, increasing the risk of fire, according to the report. The VC-25A model, built especially to transport presidents, requires “oxygen clean” equipment and regulators to prevent risk of fire. Mechanics performing heavy maintenance on the plane in San Antonio, Texas “supplied and used contaminated tools, parts, components, a regulator, and an unauthorized cleaning procedure while performing oxygen system leak check,” the report says. The first mechanic supplied contaminated parts for the oxygen system, which the second mechanic worked on installing. A third mechanic tried to help by providing “cleaning solution in an unauthorized procedure in an attempt to sanitize these parts.” The second mechanic installed the contaminated parts, which affected the whole system. The Air Force accident investigators said “the cost to remediate the known contamination of the oxygen system is over $4 million, which was paid for by Boeing.” “We took swift action to self-report the incident to the Air Force, and we remediated the oxygen system at no cost to the government,” Boeing spokesman Ben Davis told the Air Force Times. “We fully understand the level of responsibility that comes from working on the president’s aircraft, and we’re committed to our partnership with the Air Force to provide the highest standard of support for the VC-25.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman The making of a satellite I’ve been passionate about space and space exploration for as long as I can remember. As a young child, I was lucky enough to be able to visit the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and I still remember being completely amazed and in awe of the incredible machines on display and the idea of floating around in space. Many hours watching Star Trek in the years that followed probably solidified my desire to work in the space industry, so there was really no doubt what kind of job I was going to apply for when I left university. Fast forward and I’ve been working in the space industry for ten years now, the last three with Inmarsat. I still love going down to the cleanroom to see the spacecraft coming together and I can’t wait to watch the launch of our Inmarsat-5 Flight 4 (I-5 F4) satellite at SpaceX soon! The satellite journey – from contract to launch pad What many people may not realise is that getting a communications satellite to the launch pad is a process that typically starts at least four years before the rocket bursts into life. To make sure we end up with a satellite that does the job, day-in, day-out, for 15 years or longer with no possibility of maintenance, we follow a strict design and development process. We conduct a series of reviews throughout the design phase, to check that the design is adequate and will comply to our requirements. Then during manufacture an Inmarsat representative will physically inspect virtually every single part on the spacecraft, right down to the level of nuts, bolts or individual solder joints! The making of an Inmarsat satellite officially commences with the signing of a contract with one of the major satellite manufacturers, and in the case of I-5 F4, that manufacturer was Boeing, which has built all four of our advanced fifth generation satellites that make up the Global Xpress constellation. The contract lays out all of our key requirements, explaining exactly what we want the satellite to do, the design rules to which it should be built, and a long list of the tests that it needs to pass before we will accept it. The I-5 satellites are based on one of Boeing’s existing platforms so they had already defined all of the main parts that would be assembled into the spacecraft, for example the thrusters, the computers, the batteries and the fuel tanks. Qualifying a satellite The first big activity with any spacecraft is to then to check the ‘qualification’ status of every single part. ‘Qualification’ is a very important concept in the space industry. It’s how we decide whether a part is OK to be put on our spacecraft or not. To be ‘qualified’ it must have been put through a rigorous set of tests which simulate the space environment. This includes: a fairly violent vibration test (to simulate the shaking that’s experienced during the launch) a shock test (to simulate what happens when the different stages of the launch vehicle separate) a radiation test (our spacecraft fly outside the Earth’s magnetic field, which means they are not protected from the Sun’s radiation like we are on the surface) thermal vacuum testing (to make sure the spacecraft can survive the extreme temperatures of space). A thermal vacuum test is carried out in a big cylindrical chamber which we seal and then pump out all of the air to make a vacuum, as in space. We then run a cooling fluid around the walls of the chamber at any temperature we choose, to simulate the thermal environment that the unit will see inside the spacecraft. Later we also test the complete spacecraft in a chamber like this, and for that test we run liquid nitrogen (at -180°C) around the chamber walls to simulate the coldness of space. This test can last for several weeks, so you might see many tankers turning up throughout the test to deliver more liquid nitrogen! Launch ready If the part survives all of these tests, and still works just the way it did before the tests began, then we can say it’s ‘qualified’ for spaceflight. While we like to use parts that we know have already passed these tests, Inmarsat is at the forefront of the satellite industry and therefore our spacecraft tend to be some of the most complex as we constantly push the manufacturers to develop more advanced and more capable technologies. Finally, after testing, Inmarsat will review the results with the manufacturer and make sure that everything is working exactly in line with all those requirements that we put in the contract. And if everything checks out, then we’re ready to head to the launch pad! About the author Graham Johnson joined Inmarsat in 2014 and has been working as the Spacecraft Platform & Operations Engineer on the S-band satellite for Inmarsat’s European Aviation Network. After graduating from Cambridge University in 2006 with a Master’s degree in Engineering, Graham spent eight and a half years at Airbus Defence & Space where he worked primarily as a Thermal Engineer on BepiColombo, an ESA spacecraft due to launch in 2018 to explore Mercury: the innermost planet in our Solar System.

(NASA) NASA study warns against having crew on rocket’s first flight Fri May 12th, 2017 6:50am BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. By Justin Bachman / Bloomberg News A NASA working group has concluded after a two-month review that sending astronauts on the first flight of its massive new rocket wouldn’t be feasible due to the immense costs of safely accommodating a crew on the planned 2019 mission, the first step in America’s return to human space exploration. The Trump administration has expressed a desire to quickly restart the manned spaceflight program. But with rare exception, NASA tests rockets first without astronauts, given the huge risks associated with space vehicles. Rockets in the early years of space flight were unreliable in test phases and sometimes blew up on the pad or shortly after liftoff. Even today, such disasters occasionally strike private rocket firms such as Orbital ATK and SpaceX. Despite tremendous advances, rocket science retains its reputation as a notoriously risky endeavor. NASA’s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot Jr., requested the study in mid-February. The group determined relatively quickly that changing the existing strategy would likely cost several hundred million dollars and disrupt schedules for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and new Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, according to a person familiar with the study. The Boeing Co. is the prime contractor for the core stages and avionics of the Space Launch System. The group’s consensus hasn’t been formally announced, and NASA’s decision-or that of President Donald Trump-on whether to add crew to the SLS’s first flight could disregard the findings, said the person, who requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss NASA’s internal review. If so, a White House request for additional NASA funding in 2018 would need to be made relatively quickly. NASA officials declined to comment on the findings or when an announcement would be made. “Any time you are trying to rapidly add capabilities, you are asking for trouble in a system like this,” said Casey Dreier, director of space policy at The Planetary Society, which lobbies for greater funding of space science and exploration. “Changing the plans midstream is where you start to incur cost that is not commensurate with your return. “You’re working with these massive programs that are spread out and integrated over multiple centers and supply chains,” Dreier said. “Changing that just throws things into chaos.” The SLS program is the centerpiece of NASA’s effort to send humans into the solar system, starting with the first manned mission beyond Earth orbit in a half century. The Space Launch System is the largest rocket in NASA history, similar in size to the Saturn V rockets used in the Apollo program but offering far more thrust. Ultimately, NASA envisions sending humans to Mars. Beyond the question of whether to fly astronauts aboard the first flight, NASA has been struggling with delays and development problems on both Orion and the behemoth SLS, which was initially scheduled to fly last year. That mission was later moved to November 2018, although a Government Accountability Office report issued last month found that date unrealistic; the rocket’s first exploratory mission, EM-1, is now seen as occurring by 2019 at the earliest-without any crew aboard. NASA has yet to formally reschedule the EM-1 flight date, but told the GAO it would do so by Sept. 30, the end of the current U.S. budget year. That mission is designed to send the Orion on an orbit beyond the moon. A second flight with crew, called EM-2, is scheduled as an eight-day journey around the moon in 2021, although industry observers expect that time frame to slip. To include astronauts in the first launch, the Orion capsule would require life support and a fully working launch abort system, which is designed to help the crew capsule escape a failure. Such a shift would incur significant expense and delays. Sending astronauts into space on the first flight of the SLS and Orion would mark a radical departure from NASA practice, given that the agency has typically first flown new vehicles into space without crew. The Space Shuttle Columbia’s first flight, in April 1981, was the first and only time NASA has sent a new craft into space with astronauts. (An earlier shuttle test model, Enterprise, wasn’t designed for space and flew only in the atmosphere.) “With space, it takes a lot of time to do stuff because space is actively trying to kill you, every second, and there’s never enough budget,” Dreier said. “Cost is not the [main] problem, it’s just that NASA doesn’t do things that way,” said Lori Garver, the agency’s deputy administrator from 2009 to 2013, citing the risks to human life. “They fly them first.” In February, William Gerstenmaier, associate administrator of the agency’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, said NASA probably wouldn’t put a crew on the first flight if it couldn’t be done by 2019. Apart from the tight development schedules, Mother Nature has also dented NASA’s plans. In early February, a tornado struck NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the SLS and Orion module are being built, damaging several buildings and hampering work on both vehicles. The program has also had to contend with welding glitches on the SLS and a May 3 incident in which the dome of a liquid oxygen tank on the core stage was severely damaged during the manufacturing of test hardware. NASA and Boeing are investigating the mishap, which was first reported May 10 by NASA Watch, a site that covers the agency. The SLS and Orion programs have both enjoyed deep support from Congress, which in recent years has allocated more funds for each than NASA has requested. The SLS-Orion program’s estimated cost stands at $23.8 billion, including $2.8 billion for launch infrastructure being developed at Cape Canaveral, Florida. A crunch to make the Orion module astronaut-worthy on its first flight could also collide with other White House budget priorities, many of which will cost tens of billions of dollars: a wall on the Mexican border, an infrastructure-renewal plan, and a large increase in U.S. military spending. A 2018 budget “blueprint” from the Trump administration suggests a $19.1 billion NASA budget, including $3.7 billion for continued SLS and Orion development. The plan amounted to an overall cut of about 1 percent. In the recent budget compromise to fund the government until October, Congress allocated NASA about $19.7 billion.   Most Read Corrections deputy accused of misconduct with inmate EVERETT — A Snohomish County corrections deputy is accused of kissing an… May 11th, 2017 by Diana Hefley Arlington officer’s ‘deja vu’ moment leads to car prowl arrests ARLINGTON — Arrests aren’t always made accompanied by lights and sirens.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Politics Taiwan vows to continue buying arms from US and put bilateral ties as 'top priority' Taipei says that its weapons purchase will boost employment in at least 6 US states. By Nandini Krishnamoorthy May 12, 2017 12:08 BST Close Donald Trump risks tensions with China in unprecedented talk with Taiwan Wochit Taiwan has reiterated its eagerness to buy more weapons from the US, a move that is likely to irk China. The island nation also said that it would place the US-Taiwan ties as its "top priority" and it was open to any trade proposal to strengthen relations "on a fair and mutually-beneficial basis." In a 40-page report released by Taiwan's cabinet late on Thursday (11 May), the government provided rare details about the impact of Taiwan's military purchases on the US. Touting benefits to its sole arms supplier, Taipei said that its military purchases have "boosted the local economy of and employment" in at least six US states - Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Utah, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Tsai Ing-wen government told the US in a rare public comment Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Sikorsky and BAE Systems PLC were among the companies that have profited from Taipei's purchase of missile defence systems, fighter jets, attack helicopters and other amphibious assault vehicles. The announcement came as part of the public comment process for a 90-day trade review being conducted by the US, Reuters reported. Although Taiwan is also concentrating on developing its own indigenous defence, it will not affect the country's military procurement from the US, Tsai's government said. The US is Taiwan's sole arms supplier and is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself. However, China has never appreciated the arms deals and its anger has reportedly slowed down the pace of sales, Reuters noted. Beijing, which considers Taipei as its own, has always been cautious over the island nation's diplomatic ties with major countries. It has also not ruled out military retaliation if Taiwan attempts to declare independence. Taiwan's military spending have amounted to $2bn (£1.5bn) per annum between 2008 and 2015, and the country is the seventh largest buyer of defence equipment. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen waves as she boards Hai Lung-class submarine (SS-794) during her visit to a navy base in Kaohsiung, Taiwan on 21 March 2017REUTERS/Tyrone Siu China has usually reacted angrily at the US' intention to help Taiwan improve its air force by providing advanced radars, munitions and missiles. Taipei's current announcement could also prove a setback for the Trump administration following efforts to build a closer and stronger relationship with China.

Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. James Comey firing The White House is still struggling to get its story straight on why President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Trump’s crew settled (kind of) on an explanation, then the President blew it all up in an interview with NBC. Team Trump — including Vice President Mike Pence, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and others — said Trump made the decision based on the deputy attorney general’s recommendation and NOT the Russia investigation. But then Trump undercut them all and said he’d been thinking about dumping Comey for a while now and “this Russia thing” was part of his thought process. Gee, thanks boss. But that wasn’t the only story to unravel. Team Trump had also said Comey had to go because morale was in the trash over at the FBI. But Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe shot that down, too. He told the Senate intelligence committee that Comey enjoyed “broad support within the FBI and still does to this day.” And that’s probably one of the reasons why Trump’s planned visit today to FBI headquarters got scratched, sources tell CNN. In the interview, Trump also said he directly asked Comey during a dinner this year if he was under investigation. Trump said Comey said no. Did that really happen? Only Comey can answer that question, and so far he’s not talking. CNN’s Stephen Collinson writes that Trump’s long-simmering animosity toward Comey is just the latest example of how the President’s anger could be dangerous for the nation. 2. ICE ICE just wrapped up its largest anti-gang operation ever, resulting in more than 1,300 arrests over six weeks. But it didn’t target immigrants. Most of the people arrested — 993 — were Americans. Fewer than 400 arrestees were here illegally. Those nabbed included members of the Bloods, the Crips and the notorious MS-13 gangs. Meanwhile, CNN’s Sara Weisfeldt reports that Jeanette Vizguerra — a mother of four who has been holed up in a Denver church for 86 days for fear of deportation — has been granted a temporary stay by ICE. She plans to walk out of the church this morning. 3. Hepatitis C and opioids New hepatitis C infections are up sharply, and health officials think the opioid epidemic is to blame. New virus infections almost tripled — to 2,436 cases in 2015. Most of the rise involves people in their 20s who inject drugs. That’s led folks at the CDC to think that the opioid epidemic, which has slammed rural and suburban parts of the country, is the reason. People who have gone from taking prescription pills to injecting heroin (an opioid made from morphine) are a big part of the new infections. 4. Air Force One Talk about a bad day at the office. Three mechanics at Boeing caused $4 million of damage while working on a plane in the Air Force One fleet. And did we mention, they also could have started an in-flight fire? The mechanics contaminated the plane’s oxygen system when they cleaned it back in April 2016. Boeing said they didn’t follow proper procedures. If the contamination hadn’t been discovered, it could have sparked a fire or explosion. Boeing said it has since fixed the problem but wouldn’t say if the mechanics were fired. 5. Sushi If you’re eating breakfast, you may want to skip this item. You’ll need to start being extra careful with your sushi, because it could be contaminated with parasites. A new report says anisakiasis, an illness caused by eating parasite-contaminated fish or seafood, is rising in Western countries. That’s because eating sushi and other raw or uncooked fish is gaining popularity here. And if you get anisakiasis, it’s nothing nice. Think gastrointestinal pain, nausea and vomiting. Ugh. So how do you protect yourself? You could give up sushi. Or you could make sure it has been properly heated or frozen to kill parasites. This just in … Attorney General Jeff Sessions is paving way for stricter sentences, ending an Obama-era policy meant to limit cases with mandatory minimum penalties for nonviolent drug crimes.

Privacy Policy In today’s digitally connected global village, the most valuable commodity is information. That’s why long-time friend and colleague Richard Aboulafia, one of the most influential aerospace/defense analysts in the world, charges corporate and government clients thousands of dollars for an hour-long consultation. But friendship has its perks. Earlier this week, I obtained an hour of Richard’s expensive insights for the price of a Sam Adams and a cheeseburger. Richard currently serves as vice president of analysis for the Teal Group, a research group based in Fairfax, Virginia. Now that Congress has finally passed a budget, I asked him for his latest take on the aerospace/defense industry, with an emphasis on what it all means for investors. As Richard told me between bites of his lunch: “Defense is taking over from commercial aerospace as the real growth driver in this industry. Export markets are very strong, primarily driven by tensions in the Mideast, Asia, and Europe. Global military spending is heading upwards, a trend that will continue for the rest of the decade. A key beneficiary of this increase will be air power.” U.S. defense procurement already has gotten a big boost during Trump’s administration, reflected by the $1.1 trillion spending bill for fiscal 2017 that was passed by Congress last week. The White House won $15 billion in additional funding toward Trump’s repeated promises to rebuild the military. As indicated by the chart below, robust Pentagon funding provides powerful tailwinds that should make defense stocks resistant to market and economic setbacks: Source: Office of Management and Budget The Big Five… You face many investment risks in 2017. Jim Pearce, chief investment strategist of PersonalFinance, says a stock market correction probably lies ahead this year. Cyclical economic patterns also suggest that the aging, eight-year-old recovery is about to run out of steam. Another risk is inflation, which in recent months has shown signs of stirring. Jim points out that aviation’s technological innovation will help it weather the rocky days to come, even against the reemergence of inflation: “Computers have been used for decades to optimize the design of planes so that they require less steel, carbon and plastic, and use less fuel. As a result, profits for airplane builders and airlines are less susceptible to wide swings in commodity prices.” This confluence of favorable factors makes America’s aerospace/defense contractors one of your best bets now. In order of annual sales generated by defense, the Top Five players are: Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), Boeing (NYSE: BA), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), Raytheon (NYSE: RTN), and General Dynamics (NYSE: GD). Think of these five companies as weapons of mass wealth. They make the jet fighters, drones, missiles, and other defense systems that the U.S. and foreign nations increasingly demand in a tumultuous world. According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress, the Top Five’s biggest clients are located in hot spots currently in the news, such as the Korean peninsula, the Asian subcontinent, and the Middle East. Global defense spending rose in 2016 to $1.57 trillion, ushering in what’s expected to be an entire decade of booming military expenditures in the U.S. and around the world, according to the annual Jane’s Defense Budgets Report. Jane’s annual report examines and forecasts defense spending for 105 countries. Highlights from the latest report: The U.S. defense budget represents about 40% of the total global defense budget. Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, over $9.35 trillion has been allocated to U.S. defense spending. India in 2016 overtook Saudi Arabia and Russia to become one of the top five defense spenders globally for the first time. Western Europe’s fight against terrorism and fears of an expansionist Russia should add approximately $10 billion to defense budgets across the region over the next five years. The takeaway: Aerospace/defense stocks are reliable generators of long-term profits, as well as hedges against corrections, recessions and inflation. Let’s take a quick look at the world’s five biggest defense firms, all of which are based in the United States. Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman: As major manufacturers of military planes and combat jets, these three behemoths monopolize the global military aircraft business. They’re large-cap blue chips that are positioned to reap the lion’s share of the spoils. Raytheon: The company’s engineering expertise in sensors and guidance systems continues to be coveted by America’s top brass and allies around the world. Raytheon is the largest missile maker in the world and a major play on the growing use of drones. General Dynamics: GD provides combat vehicles, surface ships, submarines, maintenance repair and overhaul for military aircraft, and information technology solutions for the military services. ATRO’s wild ride… While I’m on the topic of aerospace/defense, now’s a good time to answer this recent letter to the editor on Astronics (NSDQ: ATRO), a small-cap maker of aerospace electronics for military and commercial customers: “Any thoughts on the price action of ATRO after earnings this week? I know it’s thinly traded and not widely followed but I was surprised by the apparent good response to earnings and then a sharp reversal the next day.” — Richard F. I recommended ATRO in my article in the March 22 issue of our flagship publication, Personal Finance (“Astronics’ Triple Boost From Defense”). I’m still bullish on the stock. The fact is, Astronics initially spiked because of a stellar earnings report. It’s true that ATRO traded on atypically high volume on Friday, May 5. As Richard witnessed, the stock lost more than 7% to close at $30.82 (after jumping more than 7% the previous day). On Friday, 421,870 shares traded hands on 3,244 trades. However, over the last month, the stock averaged a daily volume of only 162,827 shares a day. Keep in mind, when an inherently strong stock such as ATRO undergoes wild up-and-down spikes in trading volume, it could be perceived as a bullish signal. With a modest market cap of $898.3 million, ATRO tends to get little notice from analysts, but a spike in volume indicates that the stock has landed on Wall Street’s radar. This greater market awareness could be setting the table for a significant upward trajectory for the stock. Higher volume also creates a level of support for further price advances. Jim Pearce added Astronics to the PF Growth Portfolio on March 17. I would view Friday’s plunge as a buying opportunity. As of this writing, the stock price hovers at around $31. My projection is that Astronics is on track to generate year-over-year earnings growth this year of at least 15%. One reason that I particularly like Astronics is its status as a small cap stock, which gives it considerably more room for growth than its mega-cap brethren. Got any questions or comments? Drop me a line: mailbag@investingdaily.com — John Persinos Jim Fink’s million-dollar secret… Jim Fink, chief investment strategist of Velocity Trader, has developed a proprietary trading methodology that multiplies the gains of regular stocks. He can take regular stock movements of 8%, 17%, or 34% and exponentially leverage them to generate profits of 100%, 300%, or even 800%. When Jim Fink first launched his top-tier trading service Velocity Trader, he was confident enough to issue this challenge to readers: “If I don’t deliver 24 triple-digit winners in the next year… I’ll cut you a check for $1,950.” Sound crazy? Well, he has already followed through. In less than a year, Jim racked up twenty-four triple-digit winners, along with more than thirty double-digit winners. As Jim explained it to me: “I don’t trade regular stocks because of the high costs. What I’ve found is that I’m able to earn the same, or more, in profits by spending a fraction of the investment costs of common stocks. Think about it: a rate of return is the dollars of profit divided by the dollars at risk. So, if you can minimize your dollars at risk, and then make the same dollars of profit, your potential rate of return is vastly higher.” Jim made himself a multi-millionaire from his system.

Related: Community Transit starts Paine Field work for rapid bus line LYNNWOOD — Community Transit is boosting its options for bus riders this fall with a new route to Paine Field, more trips to downtown Seattle and the University of Washington, and increased service on Sundays. The new Route 107 will operate between Lynnwood Transit Center and the Boeing Co. plant and Paine Field via Mukilteo Speedway. Buses will run only weekdays during the peak hours of the commute with three northbound trips in the morning and three southbound trips in the evening. Also, changes will be made to early morning and afternoon service on Route 105 to meet increasing demand to the Paine Field area. The route will be extended north from the Mariner Park & Ride along Airport Road to serve Paine Field, Boeing, Seaway Boulevard and Hardeson Road. The extended trips will operate both directions weekdays only from 5 to 8 a.m. and 1:45 to 6 p.m. There will be 23 additional trips each weekday to downtown Seattle and the University of Washington. Buses will run in the morning and evening with the routes and times to be determined based on ridership demand, according to a district press release. Another big change is planned for Sundays. There will be a total of 37 midday trips added on Route 240, serving Stanwood to Smokey Point, Route 271, serving Gold Bar to Everett, and Route 280, serving Granite Falls and Everett. This will provide hourly service all-day compared to the current schedule with buses running every two hours. As a result of the expanded bus service, the Dial-A-Ride Transportation, or DART, service will be expanded as well. The district makes DART available to eligible residents within three quarters of a mile of a local, non-commuter fixed route during the same hours the bus operates. The changes, which will begin Sept. 24, were approved by the district’s board of directors last week. Money for the increased service will come from the sales tax increase approved by voters in 2015.

Related: More bus rides coming to Paine Field, UW, downtown Seattle The first phase of construction on Community Transit’s Swift Green Line started last week, with orange safety fences going up around the site of the new Seaway Transit Center, across from the entrance to Boeing’s Everett factory near Paine Field. Swift is a bus rapid transit-style service that uses dedicated bus lanes in as many areas as possible to provide a quicker and more reliable trip. There also are fewer stops, people pay at stations before they board, and buses aim to arrive every 10 minutes and leave within 10 seconds — much like a light rail or subway system. The Seaway Transit Center will open in mid-2018 and serve as a hub for Paine Field-area bus service, including Community Transit, Everett Transit and King County Metro Transit buses, along with private shuttles. Swift service itself won’t begin until early 2019. The transit center will mark the northern terminal of the Swift Green Line. From there, the Green Line will follow Airport Road south, intersect with the existing Swift Blue Line at Highway 99, continue east on 128th Street, and then head south on Highway 527 to end at the Canyon Park Park and Ride in Bothell’s technology hub. Community Transit’s Swift Blue Line has operated on Highway 99 since 2009. The service attracts more than 1.6 million riders a year. Excavation of the Seaway Transit Center site is expected to begin within the next few weeks. Contractors also will widen and add turn lanes on 75th Street SW. The $11 million transit center project is funded with a state grant, federal funds and Community Transit funds. Meanwhile, a compromise budget deal reached by Congress ensures $43.2 million in federal funds will continue to flow to Community Transit to finish the Swift Green Line. Speaking of the Green Line… Street Smarts reader P. Tierney, of Mill Creek, worries traffic backups at 164th Street and Highway 527 (Bothell-Everett Highway) will only get worse after Community Transit expands bus stops there to serve the Swift Green Line. “Cars will not be able to pass when the bus is there and traffic will back up more. If transit would move the stop 60 to 80 feet south, both pedestrians and motorists would be safer and the traffic backup could be reduced,” Tierney wrote. The location of the bus stop is aimed at safety, Community Transit spokesman Martin Munguia said. “Locating Swift stations close to the intersection is the safest choice for pedestrians,” Munguia said. “It allows easy transfers to other buses and easy access to local stores and destinations. It also discourages jaywalking.” About 300 people each day use existing bus stops at that intersection, which is near Mill Creek City Hall and Mill Creek Town Center. The Swift Green Line station is expected to serve more than 600 customers a day when it starts operation. “Swift buses in Mill Creek will come by every 10 minutes and are only stopped for about 10 seconds at a time,” Munguia added. “That’s just 60 seconds every hour that a (Swift) bus will be at the station.” Construction of that station and 30 others is pending until a contractor is selected, likely late this summer. The stations are expected to be built between fall 2017 and fall 2018. Have a question? Email us at streetsmarts@heraldnet.com. Please include your first and last name and city of residence.

Taiwan's military purchases "have boosted the local economy of and employment in states such as Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Utah, Ohio and Pennsylvania," the government said as part of the public comment process for a 90-day trade review being conducted by the United States. Companies like Raytheon Co, Lockheed Martin Co, Boeing Co, Sikorsky and BAE Systems PLC have benefited from Taiwan's purchases of missile defence systems, attack helicopters, fighter jets, and other amphibious assault vehicles, it said. Taiwan said that despite its own efforts to build up an indigenous defence, "this will not affect our military procurement from the U.S." and that it would continue to procure goods, including military hardware. Taiwan and the United States usually keep a low profile on their military exchanges because it angers Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. The United States is the island's biggest political ally and is obligated under U.S. law to help Taiwan defend itself. The 40-page English-language response released by Taiwan's cabinet late Thursday stated that U.S.-Taiwan ties were a "top priority" and that the island was "open to any possible proposals that will strengthen U.S.-Taiwan trade relations on a fair and mutually-beneficial basis." It provided rare detail on the impact to the United States of Taiwan's military buys and follows President Donald Trump's calls for allies to pay their fair share of defence costs, reduce trade gaps and boost U.S. jobs. From 2008 to 2015, Taiwan was the 7th largest source of procurement for military-related goods for the United States and on average military sales have amounted to $2 billion annually, Taiwan said. It said that trade data accounting for arms sales, and the after-sales services and personnel training that come with it, would further close the overall trade gap between Taiwan and the United States. In late March, Trump ordered the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a 90-day review of the causes of massive U.S. trade deficits and U.S. officials have said they plan tougher enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws and will initiate more unilateral trade deals. In an interview with Reuters last month, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said she doesn't rule out purchasing the F-35s, the most expensive and advanced stealth jet in the U.S. arsenal. Her comment drew immediate objection from China's defence ministry which said China was resolutely opposed to any country selling arms to Taiwan. (Reporting by J.R.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan will continue to buy arms from the United States with its purchases boosting employment in at least six U.S. states and narrowing the bilateral trade gap, the government has told the United States, in rare public comment sure to anger China, which claims the island as its own. Taiwan's military purchases "have boosted the local economy of and employment in states such as Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Utah, Ohio and Pennsylvania," the government said as part of the public comment process for a 90-day trade review being conducted by the United States. Companies like Raytheon Co, Lockheed Martin Co, Boeing Co, Sikorsky and BAE Systems PLC have benefited from Taiwan's purchases of missile defence systems, attack helicopters, fighter jets, and other amphibious assault vehicles, it said. Taiwan said that despite its own efforts to build up an indigenous defence, "this will not affect our military procurement from the U.S." and that it would continue to procure goods, including military hardware. Taiwan and the United States usually keep a low profile on their military exchanges because it angers Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. The United States is the island's biggest political ally and is obligated under U.S. law to help Taiwan defend itself. The 40-page English-language response released by Taiwan's cabinet late Thursday stated that U.S.-Taiwan ties were a "top priority" and that the island was "open to any possible proposals that will strengthen U.S.-Taiwan trade relations on a fair and mutually-beneficial basis." It provided rare detail on the impact to the United States of Taiwan's military buys and follows President Donald Trump's calls for allies to pay their fair share of defence costs, reduce trade gaps and boost U.S. jobs. From 2008 to 2015, Taiwan was the 7th largest source of procurement for military-related goods for the United States and on average military sales have amounted to $2 billion annually, Taiwan said. It said that trade data accounting for arms sales, and the after-sales services and personnel training that come with it, would further close the overall trade gap between Taiwan and the United States. In late March, Trump ordered the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a 90-day review of the causes of massive U.S. trade deficits and U.S. officials have said they plan tougher enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws and will initiate more unilateral trade deals. In an interview with Reuters last month, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said she doesn't rule out purchasing the F-35s, the most expensive and advanced stealth jet in the U.S. arsenal. Her comment drew immediate objection from China's defence ministry which said China was resolutely opposed to any country selling arms to Taiwan. (Reporting by J.R.

Photos Videos Topics Live WI 218/5 (100) - PAK 376/10 (146.3) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kapil Mishra Emmanuel Macron Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Bahubali 2 News World News Taiwan to continue buying arms from United States, boosting U.S. jobs Shares1 Fri, 12 May 2017-09:18am , Reuters Taiwan will continue to buy arms from the United States with its purchases boosting employment in at least six U.S. states and narrowing the bilateral trade gap, the government has told the United States, in rare public comment sure to anger China, which claims the island as its own. Taiwan's military purchases "have boosted the local economy of and employment in states such as Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Utah, Ohio and Pennsylvania," the government said as part of the public comment process for a 90-day trade review being conducted by the United States. Companies like Raytheon Co, Lockheed Martin Co , Boeing Co, Sikorsky and BAE Systems PLC have benefited from Taiwan's purchases of missile defence systems, attack helicopters, fighter jets, and other amphibious assault vehicles, it said. Taiwan said that despite its own efforts to build up an indigenous defence, "this will not affect our military procurement from the U.S." and that it would continue to procure goods, including military hardware. Taiwan and the United States usually keep a low profile on their military exchanges because it angers Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. The United States is the island's biggest political ally and is obligated under U.S. law to help Taiwan defend itself. The 40-page English-language response released by Taiwan's cabinet late Thursday stated that U.S.-Taiwan ties were a "top priority" and that the island was "open to any possible proposals that will strengthen U.S.-Taiwan trade relations on a fair and mutually-beneficial basis." It provided rare detail on the impact to the United States of Taiwan's military buys and follows President Donald Trump's calls for allies to pay their fair share of defence costs, reduce trade gaps and boost U.S. jobs. From 2008 to 2015, Taiwan was the 7th largest source of procurement for military-related goods for the United States and on average military sales have amounted to $2 billion annually, Taiwan said. It said that trade data accounting for arms sales, and the after-sales services and personnel training that come with it, would further close the overall trade gap between Taiwan and the United States. In late March, Trump ordered the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a 90-day review of the causes of massive U.S. trade deficits and U.S. officials have said they plan tougher enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws and will initiate more unilateral trade deals. In an interview with Reuters last month, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said she doesn't rule out purchasing the F-35s, the most expensive and advanced stealth jet in the U.S. arsenal. Her comment drew immediate objection from China's defence ministry which said China was resolutely opposed to any country selling arms to Taiwan.

Credit: NASA NASA managers have ruled out putting a crew on board an Orion capsule atop the agency’s huge Space Launch System rocket for the gargantuan booster’s maiden flight in 2019, citing technical risks and higher costs, up to as much as $900 million, agency officials said Friday. Earlier this year, the Trump administration asked NASA to look into the possibility of either adding a crew to Exploration Mission 1, EM-1 for short, or moving up the launch of EM-2, the flight NASA already earmarked for the SLS booster’s first piloted mission. That flight is targeted for launch in the 2021 timeframe. The NASA study concluded that while it would be possible to upgrade the Orion spacecraft to accommodate a crew for the EM-1 flight — equipping it with life support systems, crew displays, a validated launch abort system and other critical elements — it would have required an additional $600 million to $900 million in funding. And there would be additional technical risk and likely delays to accelerate software development and to retrofit the EM-1 Orion capsule to support a two-person crew. As a result, acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said agency managers and White House officials agreed it made more sense to stick with the original plan, launching an uncrewed Orion capsule atop the first SLS booster in 2019, followed by a piloted mission using an upgraded version of the rocket two years later. “At the end of the day, we found it technically feasible to fly a crew on EM-1 as long as we had a commitment of additional resources and schedule, and recognizing the technical risks we identified still were going to need a mitigation plan,” Lightfoot told reporters Friday. “It really reaffirmed the baseline plan we had in place was the best way for us to go,” Lightfoot said. “Leave EM-1 uncrewed.” “It’s really consistent with our available resources, and while it still has technical risk, we have a good handle on that and how an uncrewed mission will actually help EM-2 be a safer mission when we put crew on there.” And so, NASA will stick with plans to launch a “Block 1” SLS rocket in 2019 to boost an unpiloted Orion capsule on a three-week flight beyond the moon and back to a high-speed re-entry and ocean splashdown. The launch date recently slipped from late 2018 to 2019 — the exact date is TBD — because of a variety of factors, including manufacturing delays caused by recent tornado damage at the Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans where the SLS rocket is being built. In any case, EM-2, featuring an astronaut crew, would be launched atop a Block 1B SLS rocket in the late 2021 timeframe. Unlike the EM-1 rocket, the Block 1B version of the SLS would feature a more powerful, human-rated “exploration upper stage,” or EUS. The long-range plan is to use the SLS to send astronauts beyond the moon in the mid 2020s before eventual flights to Mars. The long gap between the SLS’s initial test flight and the piloted EM-2 mission, driven in large part by NASA’s budget and a variety of technical hurdles, has raised concerns in some quarters about maintaining public and congressional support in a program with years between flights and competing demands on agency funding. President Trump even joked recently, during a video chat with two space station crew members, about launching astronauts to Mars “during my first term or, at worst, during my second term.” Lightfoot said Friday there have been no discussions with the administration about near-term astronaut flights to Mars. Just getting EM-1 off the ground will be difficult enough. The Government Accountability Office concluded last summer that NASA will have spent some $23 billion through EM-1 developing the SLS rocket, the Orion capsule and ground infrastructure. Putting a crew aboard would have driven that cost even higher. “We needed additional funding, and we needed additional time,” said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA’s director of space flight. “We knew both of those had to be there, because we had certain components that just were not there. We didn’t have crew displays, we didn’t have an active abort system, we didn’t have an active life support system. So we knew those had to get added in.” In its initial configuration, the SLS Block 1 rocket will be made up of two shuttle-heritage five-segment solid-fuel boosters provided by Orbital ATK and a huge Boeing-built first stage powered by four hydrogen-burning RS-25 space shuttle main engines provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne. The Block 1 version features an interim upper stage derived from Boeing’s Delta 4 rocket powered by a single hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL-10B2 engine. That upper stage is not currently human rated. Even in its initial configuration, the giant SLS rocket will generate a ground-shaking 8.8 million pounds of thrust — 15 percent more than NASA’s legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket — enough to boost the 5.75 million-pound rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere. Together with the second stage engine, the SLS Block 1 will be able to put 154,000 pounds into low-Earth orbit. NASA eventually plans to build a Block 2 version of the SLS feature advanced strap-on boosters with a liftoff thrust of 9.2 million pounds.

Cornyn has in recent weeks become a more outward defender of President Trump. McCabe on Thursday contradicted the White House on a range of topics. Advertisement The men are two of at least four people who will interview to replace James Comey, whom Trump suddenly fired earlier this week, the people said. The others are Alice Fisher, a defense lawyer who previously led the Justice Department’s criminal division, and Michael Garcia, a judge on the New York State Court of Appeals who served as the US attorney for the Southern District of New York. Get Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here All four will be interviewed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the two top officials in the Justice Department. The list is not a comprehensive accounting of finalists for the FBI director positions. It is possible other candidates could be considered, officials said, and the ultimate decision falls to Trump. Justice Department officials also have interviewed four other candidates to serve as interim FBI director, though it is possible McCabe could stay on in that role if he were not selected for the permanent job. Advertisement The job also requires Senate confirmation. Whoever is selected is appointed to a 10-year term but can be removed by the president. Trump’s sudden removal of Comey from the position this week set off a political firestorm in Washington, fueling fears that the president was trying to stifle the bureau’s investigation into possible coordination between his campaign and Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Trump acknowledged Thursday that he was thinking of the Russia controversy when he decided to dismiss Comey. Previously, White House officials said he was acting on the recommendation of the top Justice Department officials. Trump said, though, that he would have removed Comey no matter the advice from Rosenstein or Sessions. Cornyn, 65, is a former Texas attorney general and state supreme court justice and is serving his third term in the Senate. He is Senate majority whip, and his term is due to end in 2019. If Cornyn were selected, there likely would be Democratic concern about handing over the nation’s premier law enforcement agency. Cornyn has in recent weeks become more of an outward defender of Trump. Earlier this week, he dismissed the idea that Trump fired Comey to impede the FBI’s Russia inquiry, terming it a ‘‘phony narrative.’’ McCabe, who had been the FBI deputy director before Comey was fired, might be a more palatable choice for Democrats. At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Thursday, he heaped praise on his former boss and did not hesitate to rebut narratives advanced by the White House, including its attempt to minimize the Russia investigation. He is a longtime FBI agent who led the Washington field office before he was elevated to the bureau’s No. 2 post in 2016. Loading comments...

The timeline for confirmation of the new FBI director is unclear, but should happen 'quickly', a source told Fox News.  'We are moving quickly and expeditiously to pick an interim and a permanent replacement, and we’re doing our due diligence - we’re not going to cut any corners,' said the source.  Meeting this weekend: (left to right) Lawyer Alice Fisher and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn Also up: (left to right) Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and New York Court of Appeals Associate Judge Michael J. Garcia Fired on May 9 by Trump, FBI Director James Comey is set to be replaced 'quickly' according to a White House source There are 11 candidates in total, according to the outlet. The four meeting at the Department of Justice this weekend will talk with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy Rod Rosenstein.  Of the first four candidates under consideration, the only woman on the list, Alice Fisher, was a deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Criminal Division under George W. Bush.   Bush appointed her in a 'recess appointment' over objections from Democrats due to the belief that she may have supported torture techniques at Guantanamo Bay, according to the Associated Press. She testified in favor of Neil Gorsuch at his Supreme Court Justice confirmation hearing and currently works at Latham & Watkins law firm in Washington DC where she is managing partner. If she gets the nod, she will be the first female FBI Director. Trump caused a storm of controversy by firing Comey, who was in charge of the investigation into Russia's influence on the election Also headed to the DOJ this weekend is John Cornyn, the Senate Majority Whip and sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee.  He recently cancelled a speech at Texas Southern University in Houston over fierce opposition from students who objected to his votes to approve Attorney General Jeff Sessions and DeVos, his vote for a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, and his vote against federal funds for sanctuary cities, reported CNN. Meeting with Sessions will also be Andrew McCabe, who was Comey's number two and is currently Acting FBI Director. He joined the agency in 1996 and started in the New York office. In the wings: (left to right) Former NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly and former House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers (Left to right) Executive assistant director for the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services branch of the FBI and House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Trey Gowdy CBS News reports that McCabe's chances of becoming permanent director are slim because his wife, Jill McCabe, who was running for a seat on the Virginia State Senate, received $500,000 in campaign donations in 2015 from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close ally to the Clintons. Critics have said he should have recused himself from the email investigation. The 11 candidates shortlisted to replace FBI director James Comey  Mike Rogers, former House Intelligence Committee chairman Andrew McCabe, acting FBI director  Michael Luttig, former federal appellate court judge  Ray Kelly, former New York City police commissioner  Alice Fisher, former assistant attorney general Michael Garcia, former New York prosecutor  Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. Paul Abbate, executive assistant director for the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services branch of the FBI John Suthers, mayor of Colorado Springs Larry Thompson, former deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush  John Cornyn, Senate majority whip, R-Texas    The last of the four is Judge Michael J. Garcia of the New York Court of Appeals, appointed by Andrew Cuomo, and who previously served as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York. He previously was Vice President of the Americas for INTERPOL, the international police organization, from 2003 to 2006. From 2012 to 2014, he was Chair of the Investigatory Chamber of the Ethics Committee of the Federation Internationale de Football Association, according to his bio on the court's website.  Of the remaining seven on the short list, the most well-known is former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, whose name has been bandied about for FBI Director in the past. Kelly spent five decades in the NYPD, was the longest-serving NYC Police Commissioner, was in charge of investigating the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, was the Director of Police under the United Nations mission in Haiti, and served the Bill Clinton administration as Treasury Department Undersecretary for Enforcement.  He was a candidate for secretary of Homeland Security during President Obama’s first term, and later to head up the FBI in 2011 when Director Robert Mueller stepped down.  The next most well-known name on the list is probably Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman. Rogers worked as an FBI agent in the 1990s. He is also an ex-Michigan four-term congressman who led the House Intelligence Committee but retired from the House in 2015. He led Trump's national security transition team until he was ousted, reportedly because he came in with Gov. Chris Christie, who was also ousted, reported NBC News. He is considered a 'hard-line conservative.' (Left to right) Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers and VP of Boeing Michael Luttig Also on the short list: Atlanta attorney and former deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush, Larry Thompson Candidate Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina led the congressional probe into Hillary Clinton's actions surrounding Benghazi. He was also critical of Comey's decision not to prosecute Clinton in the email server investigation, according to The State. FBI veteran Paul Abbate is the executive assistant director for the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services branch of the FBI. He began his career with the agency in 1996 and worked in New York City as part of the SWAT team, according to theFBI. He also served in various positions in the FBI in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Newark, Los Angeles, and Detroit.  An unusual pick is Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers, who is a past prosecutor, state prisons chief and attorney general, according to The Gazette. He is in his first term as mayor of his hometown, but came highly recommended with GOP circles. 'John Suthers is nonpolitical when it comes to carrying out the laws of the United States and doing what is right,' Former Gov. Bill Owens said. 'He'd always do the right thing - by the book and enforce the law.' Another interesting pick is Michael Luttig former federal appellate court judge appointed by President George Bush who is the current executive vice president of Boeing.

The motel was on a chunk of downtown property where Amazon planned to eventually erect yet another set of sparkling buildings to meet its insatiable need for office space in this city, where it has come to embody both the region’s economic boom and its struggles with affordability. The hotel would be torn down and the shelter kicked out when that time came. Instead, Amazon has decided to let the shelter stay. In an unusual arrangement, the company has agreed to give the shelter, Mary’s Place, a permanent home inside one of the new office buildings for which it will break ground in the fall. Amazon will give roughly half of the six-story building to the shelter, providing it with 47,000 square feet of space with private rooms that can hold 65 families, or about 220 people and their pets. The facility, expected to open in early 2020, will have its own entrance and elevators. Latest business videos “I see it as this huge gift because everywhere we go, we end up leaving,” said Marty Hartman, the executive director of Mary’s Place, which runs seven transitional shelters around the Seattle area meant to house families until they can find permanent homes. “You come in and become a fabric of the neighborhood you’re in, and then you say goodbye. That’s a hard thing for a lot of people to do.” In an interview at the current Mary’s Place site owned by Amazon, which was bustling with families returning to the shelter for the evening, John Schoettler, Amazon’s vice president for global real estate and facilities, said the company would spend “tens of millions of dollars” on the design and construction of the shelter’s portion of the building. Amazon will pay the utilities for Mary’s Place, which will occupy the space rent free, although the organization will continue to pay its own staff. Schoettler said Amazon originally allowed the shelter to stay in the motel because of the severity of Seattle’s homelessness crisis, which had prompted the city’s mayor to declare a state of emergency in 2015. Schoettler said Amazon was impressed by Mary’s Place, and he described its plan to give the shelter a permanent home as an investment in the neighborhood. In San Francisco, Google, Salesforce and others have funded a campaign to find permanent housing for homeless people. But Nan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, D.C., said she was unaware of any other private corporation integrating a homeless shelter into its building. “Too often, homelessness gets pushed to the other side of the tracks,” Roman said. “Keeping them as neighbors is nice.” In Seattle, the plan could also help burnish Amazon’s image, which has taken some hits, including being a target of antigentrification activists. Amazon has also been bashed for being disengaged from civic life relative to local stalwarts known for their philanthropic giving, like Boeing, Microsoft and Starbucks. More recently, that has begun to change, with gifts like Amazon’s $10 million donation for the construction of a computer science building at the University of Washington. “Its reputation in Seattle has certainly suffered,” said Alan Durning, executive director of Sightline Institute, a nonprofit research organization focused on the Pacific Northwest. “Doing things like this may be in its enlightened self-interest, right on site for the world to see.” Amazon is also a different company from just a few years ago. It has 30,000 employees in the city, making it Seattle’s largest private employer, and it has transformed large swaths of the downtown and South Lake Union neighborhoods. While the company not long ago consistently lost money, Amazon now regularly turns a profit thanks to its lucrative cloud-computing business, giving it more financial breathing room for activities like philanthropy. Seattle’s homelessness crisis has also worsened, with tent encampments sprouting up by the side of freeways, under bridges and in parks. The surrounding King County area had the third-largest homeless population in the country last year, after New York and Los Angeles, according to an annual report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. More than 10,000 people are homeless in the area, with more than 4,000 of them living on the streets, the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness estimated in a report last year. One of the residents of Mary’s Place, Patricia Abbott, a mother of four, said she became homeless after losing her job when her son was injured and she needed to tend to his medical needs. She has been at the facility for six months and learned of Amazon’s support for the organization at the shelter’s Christmas party when she received an American Girl doll for one of her children from the company. “There’s people out there who really do care,” Abbott said. Schoettler said he proposed the plan to let the shelter remain at a meeting in January of Amazon’s senior leadership, including CEO Jeff Bezos. Schoettler made the invitation to Hartman of Mary’s Place last week, she said in an interview on Monday. “It’s permanent,” Schoettler said, pausing for a moment before adding, “until homelessness is solved.” Nick Wingfield is a New York Times writer.

CBS News Logo News Latest US World Politics Entertainment Health MoneyWatch SciTech Crime Sports Shows Video More In Depth Photos Mobile Radio Local Shop Log In CBSN By William Harwood CBS News May 12, 2017, 5:28 PM NASA rules out crew on first flight of super rocket NASA is developing the heavy-lift Space Launch System rocket to boost Orion crew capsules beyond low Earth orbit on flights to the moon and beyond. NASA Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email NASA managers have ruled out putting a crew on board an Orion capsule atop the agency's huge Space Launch System rocket for the gargantuan booster's maiden flight in 2019, citing technical risks and higher costs, up to as much as $900 million, agency officials said Friday. Earlier this year, the Trump administration asked NASA to look into the possibility of either adding a crew to Exploration Mission 1, EM-1 for short, or moving up the launch of EM-2, the flight NASA already earmarked for the SLS booster's first piloted mission. That flight is targeted for launch in the 2021 timeframe. Play Video CBSN Watch NASA's most powerful rocket booster ever built NASA is testing its most powerful rocket booster ever built. CBSN's Meg Oliver and Elaine Quijano show us the impressive video. The NASA study concluded that while it would be possible to upgrade the Orion spacecraft to accommodate a crew for the EM-1 flight -- equipping it with life support systems, crew displays, a validated launch abort system and other critical elements -- it would have required an additional $600 million to $900 million in funding. And there would be additional technical risk and likely delays to accelerate software development and to retrofit the EM-1 Orion capsule to support a two-person crew. As a result, acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot said agency managers and White House officials agreed it made more sense to stick with the original plan, launching an uncrewed Orion capsule atop the first SLS booster in 2019, followed by a piloted mission using an upgraded version of the rocket two years later. "At the end of the day, we found it technically feasible to fly a crew on EM-1 as long as we had a commitment of additional resources and schedule, and recognizing the technical risks we identified still were going to need a mitigation plan," Lightfoot told reporters Friday. "It really reaffirmed the baseline plan we had in place was the best way for us to go," Lightfoot said. "Leave EM-1 uncrewed." "It's really consistent with our available resources, and while it still has technical risk, we have a good handle on that and how an uncrewed mission will actually help EM-2 be a safer mission when we put crew on there." An artist's concept of NASA's huge Space Launch System rocket on pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center. After conducting a study at the request of the Trump administration, agency officials have ruled out putting a crew on board the first flight of the huge rocket. NASA And so, NASA will stick with plans to launch a "Block 1" SLS rocket in 2019 to boost an unpiloted Orion capsule on a three-week flight beyond the moon and back to a high-speed re-entry and ocean splashdown. The launch date recently slipped from late 2018 to 2019 -- the exact date is TBD -- because of a variety of factors, including manufacturing delays caused by recent tornado damage at the Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans where the SLS rocket is being built. In any case, EM-2, featuring an astronaut crew, would be launched atop a Block 1B SLS rocket in the late 2021 timeframe. Unlike the EM-1 rocket, the Block 1B version of the SLS would feature a more powerful, human-rated "exploration upper stage," or EUS. The long-range plan is to use the SLS to send astronauts beyond the moon in the mid 2020s before eventual flights to Mars. The long gap between the SLS's initial test flight and the piloted EM-2 mission, driven in large part by NASA's budget and a variety of technical hurdles, has raised concerns in some quarters about maintaining public and congressional support in a program with years between flights and competing demands on agency funding. President Trump even joked recently, during a video chat with two space station crew members, about launching astronauts to Mars "during my first term or, at worst, during my second term." Lightfoot said Friday there have been no discussions with the administration about near-term astronaut flights to Mars. Just getting EM-1 off the ground will be difficult enough. The Government Accountability Office concluded last summer that NASA will have spent some $23 billion through EM-1 developing the SLS rocket, the Orion capsule and ground infrastructure. Putting a crew aboard would have driven that cost even higher. "We needed additional funding, and we needed additional time," said Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's director of space flight. "We knew both of those had to be there, because we had certain components that just were not there. We didn't have crew displays, we didn't have an active abort system, we didn't have an active life support system. So we knew those had to get added in." In its initial configuration, the SLS Block 1 rocket will be made up of two shuttle-heritage five-segment solid-fuel boosters provided by Orbital ATK and a huge Boeing-built first stage powered by four hydrogen-burning RS-25 space shuttle main engines provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne. The Block 1 version features an interim upper stage derived from Boeing's Delta 4 rocket powered by a single hydrogen-fueled Aerojet Rocketdyne RL-10B2 engine. That upper stage is not currently human rated. Even in its initial configuration, the giant SLS rocket will generate a ground-shaking 8.8 million pounds of thrust -- 15 percent more than NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket -- enough to boost the 5.75 million-pound rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere. Together with the second stage engine, the SLS Block 1 will be able to put 154,000 pounds into low-Earth orbit. NASA eventually plans to build a Block 2 version of the SLS feature advanced strap-on boosters with a liftoff thrust of 9.2 million pounds. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Full-year revenue slid a little to $1.104 billion, from $1.112 billion. In spite of global uncertainties and challenges in the maintenance, repair and overhaul sector from excess capacity and aggressive pricing, there remain growth opportunities, SIAEC said. The firm will continue to invest in strategic partnerships and advancing innovations, and maintain vigilance on costs. For example, SIAEC has inked agreements with Boeing on fleet management and Airbus on heavy maintenance business. A memorandum of understanding has been signed with Stratasys - a leading 3D printing and additive manufacturing solutions company - to offer design, engineering, certification support and parts production to airlines. "These initiatives will strengthen the group's core competencies and service offerings, and position us well to seize emerging opportunities for long- term growth," SIAEC said. The firm has proposed a final dividend of 9 cents per share and a special dividend of 5 cents per share. Together with the interim dividend of four cents per share paid earlier, the total dividend payment for the year will be 18 cents per share. The total payment amounts to about $157 million.

LOUIS (AP) - Christina Thompson was joking when she texted her dad last month after days of unrelenting thunderstorms near his rural southern Missouri home: "Are you getting washed away?" She didn't realize that hours earlier, the 69-year-old retiree had been swept to his death as he tried to cross a flooded patch of road to get home. William Floyd's body was found five days later, still in his 2009 Kia Spectra, which was wedged onto a log with only its bumper and rear tires visible. "Why would he do that?" Thompson asked of her father's ill-fated decision to drive through the water. "I was just wondering, 'What was he thinking?' My dad was smarter than that. It just didn't make sense." In this undated photo provided by his daughter Christina Thompson, William Floyd is seen. Floyd died in April 2017 when his car was swept away as he tried to drive through water over a gravel road near Salem, Mo. About 61 percent of flood-related deaths in the U.S., since 2011 have involved people in vehicles. (Courtesy of Christina Thompson via AP) Such tragedies are all too common. Despite public service announcements, warning signs, barriers and even gates at flood-prone crossings, the majority of flood deaths in America involve people trying to drive through water on flooded roads. "It is frustrating," said Todd Shea, warning coordinator meteorologist for the National Weather Service in La Crosse, Wisconsin. "It gets back to human nature. Sometimes you look at these cases and you just have to shake your head." Data compiled by Shea shows that 595 Americans have died in floodwater since 2011. A few fell into rivers or drowned while fishing on flooded waterways. And some children died playing too close to high water. But 61 percent of victims died in vehicles, often after driving around barriers or ignoring signs warning them to turn back. Texas, with its vast rural areas and many waterways, has had more flood-related deaths than any other state since 2011. Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said too many people underestimate the power of water and "think emergencies and disasters happen to somebody else." When torrential rains in late April led to flooding across Missouri, five people, including Floyd, died driving onto flooded roads. The death toll would have been worse if not for hundreds of water rescues. Among those rescues were nine calls in Joplin, the Missouri town devastated by a 2011 tornado that killed 153 people. Fire Chief Jim Furgerson said rescuers put their own lives on the line to save people in flooded cars. "We take precautions with life vests, we have ropes, but you don't know if there's something hidden in the water that's going to cut you or catch your ankle," Furgerson said. Kidd was involved in countless water rescues earlier in his career when he was a firefighter in San Antonio. "We would ask people, 'Why did you drive around a barricade?' or, 'Why did you drive into the water?'" he said. "The number one answer was, 'I didn't know any other way to get to where I was going.' We've got to change that mindset." Officials throughout the U.S. are trying. Several state agencies and the National Weather Service have produced public service announcement videos warning that just a foot of water can sweep away and car and 18-24 inches of water can do the same to a larger vehicle. Several states place "When Flooded Turn Around Don't Drown" warning signs provided by the weather service at flood-prone crossings. Many cities and towns, including Joplin, have installed gates that block passage at flood-prone areas when the water rises. Missouri and other states use electronic highway billboards to warn drivers of dangerous areas. Flash flood alerts can be sent to cellphones. Kim and Shea said they are hopeful technology will eventually go even further, such as phone alerts warning drivers they are approaching a flooded-out road. Experts agree, though, that common sense must prevail. Thompson still grapples with why her dad - a former Boeing worker and "master tinkerer" who could fix anything - opted to take back roads home from a wedding reception that night, driving down a steep gravel road into eventual disaster. "When there's ice and snow, you stay home. Why is rain so different? A road is still impaired," she said. "It's important, too, that people understand: This doesn't happen very often, but we forget that it can happen. People underestimate it, and that's sad." ___ Suhr reported from Kansas City, Missouri.

Image: NASA When NASA’s next big rocket launches for the first time, chances are good it won’t have people on board. For the last two months, the space agency has been studying what it would take to fly a crew of two on the maiden flight of the Space Launch System, or SLS — the monster rocket that NASA has been developing to take people into deep space and on to Mars. Specifically, NASA wanted to know if such a crewed flight could be done safely by 2019. But after figuring out the costs and challenges associated with putting astronauts on that inaugural mission, called EM-1, NASA says doing a crewed flight first wouldn’t be the best way to go. “it is difficult to accommodate changes needed for a crewed EM-1 mission at this time.” “After evaluating cost, risk, and technical factors in a project of this magnitude, it is difficult to accommodate changes needed for a crewed EM-1 mission at this time,” NASA’s acting administrator, Robert Lightfoot, sent in an email to agency employees that was obtained by The Verge. So for now, it seems that NASA will stick with its original strategy for debuting the SLS: doing an uncrewed flight first, followed by a crewed mission. However, the vehicle’s targeted launch dates are probably going to slip a bit. Originally, NASA had planned to launch the first SLS mission in November 2018, sending an uncrewed spacecraft called Orion on a three-week trip around the Moon. That mission plan still stands, but technical challenges and limited budgets are forcing NASA to push back the launch date to 2019. An exact date will be decided upon in the coming months. A follow-up flight with crew inside Orion is tentatively scheduled for no earlier than 2021, but will probably be pushed back as well. An artistic rendering of the Orion crew capsule. Image: NASA NASA only started thinking about changing the mission plan earlier this year, after Lightfoot sent out a memo to employees saying NASA would study the feasibility of putting people on the first fight of the SLS. NASA later admitted that appointees for the Trump administration had directed the agency to look into that possibility, according to Space News. Lightfoot said in press conference today that putting a crew on the first flight of the SLS was technically feasible. However, a lot of technologies would have to be accelerated, such as a life support system to keep the crew alive and abort system that could save the crew in case of an emergency during flight. Plus it would have cost a lot more money, approximately between $600 million and $900 million extra, and NASA would have needed additional time to pull it off. Lightfoot said that a 2020 flight was more likely if people needed to be on board. So NASA conferred with the White House and agreed that the best route would be stick with its original plan all along. Putting crew on the first flight of a new vehicle isn’t usually how NASA does things Putting crew on the first flight of a new vehicle isn’t usually how NASA does things, though. Typically, the agency does an uncrewed test flight first to determine if a vehicle is safe. The Saturn V rocket, for instance, did a mission without passengers before crew rode on board, and the future space taxis that SpaceX and Boeing are developing to take NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station will fly empty first to make sure they are safe for crew. However, one notable exception to this rule was the first flight of the Space Shuttle, which carried a crew of two into orbit around Earth. It was a bold move at the time, but NASA needed a pilot in the Shuttle to control the vehicle’s landing. It’s been bad news for the SLS program in recent weeks. NASA admitted that part of a propellant tank needed for testing out the rocket was damaged at the agency’s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. And one of NASA’s associate administrators, Bill Gerstenmaier, acknowledged to the Government Accountability Office two weeks ago that the first flight of SLS would likely slip to 2019.

Brian Calhoun) Redstone Arsenal-based Army Contracting Command has awarded a $488 million dollar modification for work to re-manufacture British Apache attack helicopters to the newest standard.  The contract was announced in an announcement from the Pentagon. It is for work on re-manufacturing 38 Apache's to the E model standard, along with three crew trainers and assorted spares. Work is expected to be completed by 2024. Work will be done in Mesa, Arizona.  The British operate license-built versions of the Boeing AH-64D Longbow Apache, all 67 of which were built by AgustaWestland. Differences include folding rotor blades and Rolls-Royce engines instead of the GE T700. +1  A British AH1- Apache helicopter conducts operations in Helmand province, Oct. 12.

Station commander Peggy Whitson and rookie flier Jack Fischer began what was expected to be a 6-1/2-hour spacewalk more than an hour late, after a cable supplying power and cooling water to Fischer's spacesuit developed a leak. The spacewalk was the 200th outing in support of station assembly and maintenance since construction of the $100 billion laboratory, which flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, began in 1998. Fischer ended up sharing Whitson's spacesuit servicing system, which caused both to burn through their spacesuits' battery power faster than usual. That prompted the U.S. space agency to shorten the outing and assign the astronauts just one task. The pair breezed through their first priority, replacing a faulty, 200-pound (90 kg) electronics box that routes commands and data to experiments. With time to spare, they then tackled chores slated for the original spacewalk, including installing a cable to troubleshoot a cooling system problem with the station's $2 billion dark matter detector, mission commentator Rob Navias said. They also attached a debris shield onto an exposed docking port that is being prepared for commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Boeing Co <BA.N>. It was Fischer's first spacewalk, and the ninth for Whitson, who last month broke the record for cumulative time in orbit by a U.S. astronaut. "All of the major work has been accomplished," Navias said. "It's been an highly successful spacewalk in spite of a somewhat uncertain beginning."

Based on end use, the commercial platforms segment is projected to lead the aviation asset management market during the forecast period. The correlation between economic development and air traffic is evident, and the outlook for future development of the global aircraft fleet is also robust. As per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global aircraft fleet will double by 2034, which evidently exhibits huge opportunities for growth of the commercial platforms segment of the aviation asset management market. On the basis of service type, the leasing services segment of the aviation asset management market is anticipated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Contract negotiation/renewal, lease renewal, and remarketing, among others, are some of the major leasing services in the aviation asset management market. The aviation asset management market in the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to grow at a considerable rate, whereas the Middle East aviation asset management market is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. Growth in passenger traffic has resulted in the increase in demand for new aircraft in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East regions. This increase in new aircraft demand is anticipated to boost the aviation asset management market during the forecast period. Stringent government regulations restrain the growth of the aviation asset management market. The market is also broadly dependent on airline software that is yet to be developed.

Credit: NASA TV/Spaceflight Now Astronauts Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer put on spacesuits Friday and headed outside the International Space Station for several repair and maintenance tasks, but the duo only completed part of their originally planned work after a leaky cooling umbilical delayed the start of their spacewalk. Mission control in Houston marked the official start of the spacewalk at 9:08 a.m. EDT (1308 GMT), when the atmospheric pressure inside the station’s Quest airlock passed below 1 pound per square inch. NASA adjusted the normal starting point for a spacewalk — when the astronauts switch their suits to battery power — after a troublesome servicing and cooling umbilical forced forced the duo to use their spacesuit’s internal electrical supply during final spacewalk preps and depressurization of the airlock. The umbilical was not part of the spacesuit, NASA said, but a piece of support equipment inside the space station. It provides power, cooling and communications capability to the spacesuit before the astronauts exit the space station, according to Rob Navias, the NASA TV commentator for Friday’s excursion. Teams noticed a small water leak in the umbilical early Friday. Friday’s spacewalk was the ninth of Whitson’s career, and the first for Fischer, who gleefully remarked on the occasion. “Oh my gosh, this is beautiful,” Fischer said as the station sailed 250 miles over the Atlantic Ocean east of Puerto Rico. “Isn’t it?” Whitson replied. “The biggest slice of awesome pie I’ve ever seen,” Fischer said. “No awesome sauce?” Whitson said, referring to one of Fischer’s favorite sayings. “How about a ginormous fondu pot bubbling over with piping hot awesome sauce?” Fischer joked. Mission control radioed the astronauts that Friday’s spacewalk would be limited to run around four hours, not the six-and-a-half hour duration originally planned, due to the problem. NASA expected the shortened spacewalk meant Whitson and Fischer would probably only have time to complete one of the jobs planned Friday — the replacement of a large avionics box that routes telemetry and power to experiments and spare parts mounted on a depot outside the space station. In the end, the pair accomplished most of the spacewalk’s planned objectives. Their first job was to remove and replace an ExPRESS Carrier Avionics box located on the starboard-side S3 truss of the space station. A replacement unit was delivered to the outpost aboard an Orbital ATK Cygnus supply ship last month. Whitson and Fischer made quick work of the avionics box swapout, and mission control gave the astronauts the green light to secure a piece of separated insulation on the space station’s Japanese robotic arm and work on a data connector for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, a particle detector and cosmic physics experiment outside the station. Fischer repaired the Japanese robotic arm’s thermal insulation, while Whitson installed a terminator cap on the AMS instrument, a massive experiment attached to the station truss designed to study dark matter and antimatter. The terminator cap will enable a telemetry path from AMS, allowing engineers to investigate the performance of cooling pumps inside the instrument that may need to be repaired or replaced on a future spacewalk. Fischer also got the go-ahead to fasten micrometeoroid and orbital debris shielding to Pressurized Mating Adapter No. 3, which was recently relocated from the Tranquility module to the Harmony module, where it will receive a new docking mechanism next year for future link-ups with commercial crew spaceships developed by Boeing and SpaceX. The astronauts did not have time to complete other jobs in Friday’s spacewalk plan. The pair planned to set up a new high-definition video camera and a pair of wireless antennas outside the research complex, but those tasks will be deferred to another spacewalk. Whitson and Fischer returned to the station airlock and began pressurizing it at 1:21 p.m. EDT (1721 GMT), wrapping up a 4-hour, 13-minute spacewalk. Friday’s excursion was the 200th spacewalk in support of space station assembly and maintenance since December 1998, and the fifth this year. Email the author.

The investment will be in the Harrodsburg, KY plant. “This investment will ensure our plant in Harrodsburg remains a global center of excellence for glass technology” said said Wendell P. Weeks, Corning’s chairman, chief executive officer and president in a statement.  Ticker Security Last Change %Chg Apple CEO Tim Cook, like many of his U.S. counterparts including Ford (F) and Boeing (BA), have received sharp criticisim from President Donald Trump for manufacturing products overseas. That pressure is resonating with corporate America as many companies dial back plans for overseas plants. Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), was among the first to make commitments to creating U.S. jobs under the new administration. In the U.S., Apple now supports 2 million jobs across all 50 states, including 450,000 jobs attributable to Apple’s spend and investment with U.S.-based suppliers.

Warren Buffett warned other business leaders that health care costs, not corporate taxes, are slowing the U.S, economy, The New York Times reported. (“Physician” photo courtesy of Pexels). Wall Street reacts to Comey case On Wednesday, Bloomberg took a look at whether President Trump’s abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey will impact the White House’s economic agenda. Investors are concerned the decision will slow or halt Trump’s pledges to bolster infrastructure spending, reform the tax code and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Experts told Bloomberg the decision “muddies the agenda” and that it’s “hard to see any political and policy upside in firing Comey….” At least one analyst said the move could have more impact for overseas investors. Buffett warns about health care Despite Donald  Trump’s repeated proclamation that corporate taxes are hindering the U.S. economy, Warren Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, has a different take. At the company’s annual meeting this past weekend, Buffett told investors the tax system is not crippling the American economy. The New York Times reported Buffett said chief executives focused on lowering their tax bills should turn their attention to lowering health care spending, which is stymying U.S. corporate profits. Buffett said tax rates have fallen as a share of gross domestic product, while health care costs have soared from 5 percent of G.D.P. 50 years ago, to 17 percent today. Seattle and Silicon Valley converge On Thursday, The Economist took a look at how Seattle and Silicon Valley are becoming extensions of each other, despite the 800 miles that separate the two. They have similar roots: Both grew during gold rushes. While Silicon Valley emerged as a maker of small things (Apple phones) and Seattle focused on larger technologies (Boeing planes, Microsoft computers), the two are increasingly linked by cloud computing. Amazon is based in Seattle, and most startups run their business on the e-commerce giant’s cloud-computing platform. Many of Seattle’s burgeoning firms have California-based parent companies. As the two regions have converged, Rich Barton, the founder of Zillow and Expedia, told The Economist he’d like to see travel between them become more efficient through high-speed rail. Retailers sober up It hasn’t been smooth sailing for the retail industry, feared to be facing another recession. On Tuesday, the Associated Press reported more than twice as many stores have closed this year than at the same point last year. Bankruptcies also are far outpacing last year’s rate on top of the sharpest pace of job cuts in seven years. The AP reported the reasons behind the slump are different than the last time around: Shoppers’ habits have changed as they increasingly rely on online deals. That’s put pressure on department stores, including Macy’s, Kohl’s and J.C. Penney. And the bad news continues: The Limited closed all of its remaining 250 stores, Payless ShoeSource is closing 400 stores, and Ambercrombie & Fitch, BCBG and Wet Seal are also retreating. Steel bets on spending America’s steel industry is cheering President Donald Trump’s pledge to protect the country’s manufacturers against cheaper imports and invest as much as $1 trillion in infrastructure spending over the next decade. The New York Times on Thursday reported that American producers have long complained that China treats its subsidized steel industry as a “giant government jobs program,” putting American producers at a disadvantage as the Chinese unload steel at fire sale prices. Steel workers at Nucor, an American steel maker, make on average $80,000 a year—and these workers are betting on bigger paydays thanks to Trump’s focus on trade and manufacturing. Tribune prepares to pack Crain’s Chicago Business dug into the impact of the $3.9 billion sale of Tribune Media to Sinclair Broadcast Group. Since Sinclair already has a headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland, it’s likely the Trib’s Chicago headquarters will go. Tribune Media has its roots in Chicago, dating to the 1847 launch of the Chicago Tribune and the launch of WGN Radio in 1924. For Chicago, the merger marks the end of the group’s long history in the city as most corporate roles at the newly merged media conglomerate will be in Baltimore, rather than the midwest. In addition to the $3.9 million sale, Sinclair also will acquire $2.7 billion in Tribune Media debt, Sinclair said in a statement.

Crown copyright 12 May 2017 at 12:56, Gareth Corfield The US Coast Guard is well chuffed with its new Scaneagle drone – the same drone that the Royal Navy is ditching later this year, seemingly for lack of funds. The coastal force, which, because of chronic manpower shortages, is lending engineering personnel to the RN for keeping frontline warships at sea, deployed the USCGC Stratton along with one Scaneagle on a six week patrol around California earlier this year. “By the end of the deployment, the aircraft had directly assisted the STRATTON crew with conducting four interdictions, seizing more than 1,676 kilograms of illicit contraband valued at $55m and apprehending ten suspected drug traffickers,” said Insitu, makers of Scaneagle, as reported by British defence industry newswire Shephard News. Insitu, makers of the Scaneagle, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing. The contract for deployment of the single drone for one year is worth $4.5m. Although Scaneagle had been bought by the RN for £30m back in 2013, the drone is set to leave British service late this year. It was originally procured by the RN as an “urgent operational requirement”, which is defence-speak for “please, Mr Chancellor, stump up the cash for this thing we desperately need”. The good thing for the MoD is that UORs are not paid for out of the defence budget. The bad thing is that because they’re not paid for out of the defence budget, UOR kit is only ever temporary – unless the MoD decides to bring it “into core”, which means adding yet more spending to the already overstretched defence budget. We have asked the MoD for comment and to confirm the out-of-service data for Scaneagle. Although the RN seemed keen to keep Scaneagle in service, using it during the Unmanned Warrior roboat exercise last year, it appears that the aerial surveillance capability it brings will be replaced by the Lynx Wildcat helicopter – the same Wildcat whose crews must land to move vital tactical data around on USB sticks. ® Tips and corrections 23 Comments MORE Drone Royal Navy Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register French drone bods Parrot wheel out 'prosumer' division If you can afford to spend $5k on a camera drone, they want to be your go-to folk 11 Comments US Navy developers test aircraft carrier drone control software Turning a flying robot petrol station into a sort of maritime NSA 22 Comments America's mystery X-37B space drone lands after two years in orbit Pic Mysterious craft likely to be surveillance testbed 76 Comments Brit firm lands £58m EU spy drone 'copter contract Who needs humans to gaze over the seas anyway? 17 Comments Parcel bods Hermes become latest London drone delivery droogs Another reason for non-delivery, perhaps? 26 Comments Drone maker DJI quietly made large chunks of Iraq, Syria no-fly zones Supporting The War Against Terror, one update at a time 35 Comments Whitepapers Mobile App Security Program Management Handbook Whether you are starting from square one with a mobile app security initiative, have ad-hoc tasks you want to consolidate, or just want to improve an existing program.

GOL continued to rationalize operations during the Brazilian summer to meet reduced passenger traffic, which was down 739,000 passengers compared to 1Q 2016. The airline reduced the number of seats available for sale by 13% during the quarter. GOL’s operating revenues declined 2.5% year-over-year (YOY) to BRL2.6 billion, attributable, the company said, to its reduction in capacity and concurrent optimization of aircraft utilization. GOL’s first quarter operating expenses increased 5.3% to BRL2.4 billion. The company posted an operating profit of BRL253.2 million, down 42.1% from BRL437.2 million in 1Q2016, representing an EBIT margin of 9.6%. “[While] passengers transported in 1Q17 decreased 8.3% over 1Q16, GOL’s load factor increased two percentage points to 79.6% … [and] aircraft utilization was at 10.5 flight hours per day, [a] 16.7% increase over 1Q16,” GOL said. Overall traffic was up 0.7% to 9.6 billion RPKs as capacity decreased 2% to 12 billion ASKs. “Our absolute market cost leadership is key to our value proposition and allowed us to provide [competitive] fares and service in the market, even during a challenging industry environment,” GOL CFO Richard Lark said. The company’s first-quarter net yield fell 6.5% to BRL 24.02 cents as RASK was down 0.5% to BRL 22.01 cents and CASK increased 7.4% to BRL 19.91 cents. GOL’s CASK ex- fuel rose 11.6% to BRL 13.79 cents. GOL’s fuel expenses during the quarter were down 2.8% to BRL735.8 million. As of March 31, out of a total of 124 Boeing 737 NG aircraft (96 737-800s and 28 737-700s), GOL was operating 116 aircraft. Four of the remaining aircraft will be returned to lessors while the other four have been sub-leased to another airline. The average age of GOL’s fleet was 8.4 years at the end of the quarter. The company said it has 120 firm aircraft acquisition orders with Boeing for fleet renewal by 2027; the next GOL 737 is expected to be delivered in July 2018. Looking ahead, GOL adjusted its full-year 2017 operating margin (EBIT) guidance to be in the 6% to 8% range. GOL’s total seat guidance for 2017 continues to show a decrease of -3% to -5% with capacity down between 0% and -2%. By the end of 2017, GOL will have 115 aircraft in its operational fleet. Total volume of departures for 2017 will decrease between -3% and -5%. The average load factor for the year is expected to be between 77% and 79%. The company’s non-fuel CASK is expected to be +/- BRL14 cents for the year. Mark Nensel mark.nensel@penton.com Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now The big issue in one of last week's most hotly contested area mayoral races wasn't crime or taxes or economic development. No, more than 40 percent of Plano residents who voted wanted to turn back time. They want the Collin County city, one of the fastest-growing in the country, to put the brakes on urban development and keep Plano "suburban." Good luck with that. Job relocations by huge companies including Toyota, Liberty Mutual Insurance, JPMorgan Chase, FedEx and Boeing have made Plano the envy of the country. So why are 4 in 10 Plano residents who voted in a snit about the town's growing business and residential base? Well, they are ticked at all the new apartments and don't want the traffic and congestion that come with economic success. They are entitled to their opinions, but in the great arch of history, they will wind up a footnote. Driving forces: Toyota's road to the future merged well with Plano's corporate path More than 7 million people are living in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. During the next decade, almost 2 million more folks will be here. By the 2020s, we'll have more than 10 million. They all need someplace to live, someplace to work, someplace to shop and eat. And, most of them will have cars. It's going to be a mess — get over it. Nothing we can do short of sabotaging our economy will stop it. Does that really sound like a plan? Rather than fight against higher density, communities and their residents are going to have to figure out how to embrace it and make it work best for everybody. Not everyone will be happy. But we can't keep building farther and farther out into the next vacant farm field just so everyone can have their own quarter-acre of suburbia. The infrastructure costs of pushing north to Oklahoma are too high, and all those people living on the south banks of the Red River would have to commute to jobs in Plano, Frisco and Dallas clogging the roads just the same. Apartments have long been a lighting rod for the no-growers. But the only way we can house the thousands of young people moving to D-FW every year to fill new jobs is to build scads of rental units. More than 50,000 apartments are under construction in North Texas. We need every one of them if all the 20-somethings headed our way for careers are going to have roofs over their heads. Homeownership rates are at decades low and the average homebuyer is now in their mid- to late 30s. If we don't build apartments, where are our young workers and residents going to live? Most of the people who are against new apartments haven't set foot in one in years. Go look at the latest rental units in Legacy West, Frisco or Dallas' Uptown. You'll be surprised at the lifestyle. Get ready for carmageddon as D-FW's big new developments open this year Almost a third of the renters in these complexes are now 50-plus folks who don't want a house. Instead of fighting denser housing, city planners, politicians and residents are going to have to roll up their sleeves and figure out how to deal with the complicated issues of transportation, infrastructure and affordable housing. It's going to be a long, tough haul to accommodate the growth in this region, but fighting to stop it or wishing it wouldn't happen isn't an alternative. Back in the late 1970s, when I started writing about real estate, one of the projects was a series of stories about the "mixed blessing" of growth in North Texas. Companies including American Airlines had just discovered D-FW and were moving thousands of people here. Some locals I talked to almost 40 years ago were already lamenting the pace of expansion — with only 2 million people living here, mind you. If, as a North Texas resident, you are against growth, you'd better start filling out a change of address card. Millions more people are coming and we've got to be ready for them. The $3 billion Legacy West development in Plano will include apartments for more than 2,000 people, along with offices expected to house up to 20,000 workers.

The 747 Jumbo Jet took to the skies in 1970 and made long-haul flying affordable for the masses; then, in 2007, the Airbus A380 Superjumbo lumbered into the skies — a gravity-defying miracle machine capable of flying more than 850 passengers. Sadly, with a maximum of 128 passengers, Concorde proved too small and inefficient to sell fares at anything but astronomical prices. After a glorious, but loss-making, 27 years, economics triumphed over engineering and it was mothballed in 2003. Now, it looks like the A380 Superjumbo is going the same way but for the polar opposite reasons. So vast is this cruise ship of the skies that the airlines who’ve bought it are struggling to fill it. Combined with its gas-guzzling four engines, that makes it hugely inefficient to run. Not only that, but only a small number of airports in the world are big enough to cope with it. After an initial flurry of orders, demand from airlines ground to a halt years ago. Singapore Airlines — one of the Superjumbo’s biggest customers, recently gave one back, unable to make it pay, and placed its next big order with smaller craft from Boeing. Malaysia Airlines’ Irish chief executive Peter Bellew is even mulling a plan to cram more seats into his empty A380s and use them to ferry 800 Muslim pilgrims a pop to Mecca. Emirates, by far the A380’s biggest customer, yesterday reported an 82% collapse in profits. Like Malaysia and others, it has suffered from Trump’s clampdown on travel from Muslim countries, but also blamed Brexit and European terrorism.  Even without those factors, there is an absurd overcapacity in long-haul that is hurting everybody. Airlines are trying to minimise the damage by flying more, smaller planes like Airbus’s twin-engine A350, offering greater flexibility and choice to long-haul passengers. For many industry experts, that can only lead you to one conclusion: Emirates will soon start cancelling its A380 orders. And, if that happens, production of this mighty feat of human endeavour would surely come crashing down to ground. Along with the £530 million we taxpayers invested in aid to launch it. But what of the 747; the plane that single-handedly meant pretty much anyone on an average salary could join the jet set?   The troubles affecting the A380 are also buffeting its rival. Though it may be smaller, it still flies at least 345 passengers. And, also like the A380, it has four hungry engines to feed. Orders have dried up, and gloomsters are suggesting its days are numbered, too.  But unlike the A380, the 747, and even Concorde, had long, illustrious careers. The A380 will barely last a decade. It will go down in history as aviation’s biggest flying white elephant.

 Billionaire Richard Branson reveals his 5 tips for making good business decisions Lindsay Dodgson May 12, 2017, 5:13 AM 2,467 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Virgin Group now owns over 200 companies. Joe Skipper/Reuters When it comes to running a successful company, Richard Branson is a seasoned pro. He started his first business aged just 17 and has been in the game for 50 years, making billions of pounds along the way. Currently, the Virgin Group owns over 200 companies in more than 30 countries worldwide. On the Virgin website, Branson has just revealed some of his top tips on making good business decisions. He said it is not that different to sitting on a jury, as you should tackle all reasonable doubt before making a judgement. Here are five rules which he believes have got him to where he is today: 1. Don't judge a book by its cover Branson said although he's big on first impressions, he doesn't let them influence his decision making. If you have a good feeling about an idea, you may well be right, but it's important to be objective. 2. Do your homework You should go digging around for any red flags, said Branson, because discovering the drawbacks of a new venture after you've done the deal doesn't do you any favours. It's especially important to do some investigating when everyone is unanimously in favour of going ahead with the idea, he added. "Nothing is perfect, so work hard at uncovering whatever hidden warts the thing might have and by removing them you’ll only make it better still," Branson said. 3. Avoid making decisions in isolation Branson refers to something called "the decision stream," which is basically how every decision has an impact on your ability to take on future opportunities. While one idea might seem too exciting to pass on, you have to consider how it will affect your existing projects or priorities. Weigh up the risks of putting something on hold, or prioritising it over your other ideas. 4. Do everything you can reduce risk According to Branson, all wise investors find inventive ways to mitigate losses if things go wrong. "For example, when we started Virgin Atlantic, the only way I got my business partners in Virgin Records to begrudgingly accept the risks involved was by getting Boeing to agree to take back our one 747 after a year if things weren’t working out as we hoped," he said. "To this day, with giant, capital-intensive ventures like Virgin Galactic and Virgin Voyages, we always spend a lot of time in finding inventive ways to mitigate the downside." 5. Give it time Branson says the "orchestrated procrastination" approach is worth trying because doing more research than less is very rarely a bad thing. Giving yourself more time might mean you find better alternatives, or the market could change and you'll find yourself glad you didn't take the chance.

provided by Research and Markets 12 May, 2017, 05:00 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Target Drones Market by Engine Type, End-user, Platform, Target Type and Region - Global Forecast to 2022" report to their offering. The target drones market is projected to grow from USD 3.79 Billion in 2016 to USD 6.20 Billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 8.55% The increasing demand of target drones in militaries across the globe is a key factor expected to drive the growth of the market. The market has been segmented based on engine type, end user, fit, platform, target type, and region. Based on engine type, the target drones market has been segmented into internal combustion engines, and jet engines, among others. The jet engine segment is estimated to dominate the market in 2016. The high adoption rate of jet engine target drones in militaries, due its excellent maneuvering and high speed capabilities is one the reason for the growth of the segment in near future. Based on end user, the market has been segmented into defense, homeland security, and commercial. Defense is estimated to be the largest segment of the target drones market, since target drones are majorly used for anti-aircraft, anti-missile, and anti-submarine military trainings in the defense sector. Target drones are also used for missile and weapon calibration testing. Based on fit, the target drones market has been segmented into linefit and customized fit. The linefit segment is estimated to lead the market, as the customized fit segment is present only in the U.S. and the U.K. Based on platform, the market has been segmented into aerial targets, ground targets, underwater targets, and sea surface targets. Aerial targets segment is estimated to be the largest segment of the market, since only aerial targets can be used for anti-aircraft, anti-missile military trainings and missile calibration testing. The trainings are performed by all segments of armed forces, such as air force, navy and military. Based on target type, the market has been segmented into full-scaled, sub-scaled, towing, free flying, and sporting. The sub-scaled segment is estimated to lead the market, as sub-scaled models are cheap alternative to simulate enemy threat instead of using an actual aircraft during training. The adoption rate of sub-scaled target drones is very high in all armed forces across the globe. The geographical analysis of the market covers regions, such as North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, MENA, and rest of the world. North America is estimated to lead the global target drones market in 2016, owing to the increasing defense expenditure in training programs and the rise in budget allocated for procurement of target drones in the U.S. Market Dynamics Drivers Increased Emphasis on Enhanced Military Training Advantages of Target Drones Over Manned Target Vehicles Restraints Lack of Skilled and Trained Personnel Opportunities Full-Scaled Conversion of Target Drones for Simulation of Real War Scenario Need for Target Drones for Homeland Security Applications Challenges Sustainable Power Sources for Improved Endurance of Drones Companies Mentioned ASV Global Aerotargets International, LLC Air Affairs Australia Pty Ltd.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Space Environment Health Nature Archaeology Science Space Nasa must stop wasting time on the ISS and focus on Mars, says Buzz Aldrin The Apollo 11 moonwalker said it is not feasible to support both ambitions. By Agamoni Ghosh May 12, 2017 08:55 BST Former Nasa astronaut Buzz Aldrin gestures during a press conference in Geneva - file pictureFabrice Coffrini/ AFP Nasa must stop wasting time and funds on the International Space Station (ISS) and solely focus on its Mars exploration programme, former astronaut Buzz Aldrin has said. Aldrin, who was the second person to walk on the Moon after Neil Armstrong, said: "We must retire the ISS as soon as possible. We simply cannot afford $3.5bn (£2.7bn) a year of that cost." The former astronaut was speaking at the 2017 Humans to Mars conference in Washington DC on 9 May. The Apollo 11 moonwalker, who has been an active supporter of Mars exploration, said if Nasa wants to send humans to Mars by 2033, it should forget about the ISS, an astronaut-occupied spacecraft that has been orbiting Earth since 1998. Instead, the former astronaut recommends such operations be handed over to private players along with other lower-Earth orbit operations. Although Nasa has handed approval to an array of lower-Earth orbit projects to players like SpaceX, Orbital ATK and Boeing to ferry cargo and crew from the ISS, a chunk of Nasa's budget is diverted to the station. Nasa has spent close to $60bn on the ISS from 1985 to 2015 according to Space Review despite it being a joint venture between various space agencies that include the ESA and the Roscosmos. Aldrin says more cooperation should be established between the Chinese and US to explore the cislunar area (the space between the Earth and Moon) and dock a base there that acts as a testing ground for Mars operations. China has already drawn detailed plans for cislunar missions and Nasa has also stated that its astronauts will need to dock near the Moon before they can approach Mars. "Let's be certain that we've developed a sustainable plan to stay on Mars," said Aldrin about colonisation plans. "No flags and footprints this time." In 2015, Aldrin had revealed that former US president John F Kennedy had originally wanted to go to Mars and not the Moon, but engineers told him the Red Planet was just a "little bit too far".

The CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said the cases involved extortion of state subsidies, embezzlement of poverty relief funds, misappropriation of compensation for land requisitions, abuses of power and receipt of kickbacks. Those named on the list were mainly low-level bureaucrats. A total of 3,333 officials in 2,412 cases have been exposed since the CCDI established the monthly reporting system to disclose such violations in July 2015. Investigation found that extortion of state subsidies for agriculture was the most common misdemeanor, followed by misappropriation of compensation for land requisitions and embezzlement of allowances for house renovation, according to the CCDI.

Wanting to remain anonymous, the man said in a statement, "It's life changing! I don't even know how many zeros are in $50 million." "I'll share it with family and friends, if I'm winning, I want everybody along with me to win." "I genuinely want to help people, so some sort of charity." Although the Sydneysider may appear very lucky, former co-owner of Milestone Financial Services Darren Laudenbach told Xinhua, "If you're not good with money to begin with, winning the lottery probably isn't going to help you." In fact, statistics from the National Endowment for Financial Education in the United States showed more than 70 percent of people who win the lottery are bankrupt within five years and often suffer relationship breakdowns with friends and family. "I recommend that if you win the lottery, you seek professional advice," Laudenbach said.

Saab and Lockheed are both pitching for an estimated 200 to 250 fighter jets that the Indian Air Force says it needs.Reuters | Updated: May 12, 2017, 11.34 AM IST An IAF aircraft refuels fighters during an airshow. NEW DELHI: The government presented a long-delayed plan to industry officials on Thursday for selecting private arms manufacturers to help build an indigenous defence industry, an official document seen by Reuters showed. Local companies will be chosen as strategic partners that can combine with foreign firms to manufacture single-engine fighter aircraft, helicopters, submarines and armoured vehicles, according to the document. New Delhi hopes the yet-to-be-finalised "Strategic Partnership" model will boost the role of private companies, grow India's small defence industry, which is dominated by state-run companies, and end its role as the world's largest arms importer. Officials from Tata Sons, Reliance Industries, Larsen and Toubro and Adani Enterprises among others attended a presentation made by defence and finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday, a defence ministry official said. New Delhi will use a range of financial and technical criteria to pick companies for "design, development and manufacturing of strategic (defence) platforms for future," the document showed, without naming any company. The ministry of defence said in a statement that Jaitley had met with industry representatives on Thursday to discuss the proposed model but did not go into specific details. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to reverse India's dependence on imports by building a local manufacturing industry. The government is forecast to spend $250 billion on modernisation of its armed forces over the next decade. Industry experts say delays in finalising procurement policies have undermined India's efforts to get local, largely inexperienced, companies to tie up with foreign manufacturers, a necessary step if domestic firms are to utilise the latest technology. Foreign manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BAE Systems and Saab are looking to India as one of the biggest sources of future growth. Saab and Lockheed are both pitching for an estimated 200 to 250 fighter jets that the Indian Air Force says it needs. Ankur Gupta, vice-president, Aerospace and Defence at consultancy EY said the strategic partnership policy would "give the much-needed impetus to private companies and build their business case to make serious long-term investments in India." Among the basic requirements under the plan, Indian firms must have a consolidated turnover for each of the last three years of more than 40 billion rupees ($621 million) to qualify, the document said. Six Indian companies will be shortlisted, and will then choose among several foreign partners. Indian companies will be permitted to speak with multiple foreign firms to work out a tie-up, but can only offer to work together with one of them at the time of bidding. The helicopters, submarines, armoured fighter vehicles and fighter jet orders are expected to be multi-billion-dollar deals.

MICHAEL COONS/Acorn Newspapers California’s proposed “sanctuary state” bill, the toxic cleanup at the Santa Susana Field Lab and healthcare were among the many topics discussed at a town hall meeting hosted by Assembly member Dante Acosta at Simi Valley City Hall last week. More than 100 constituents, a large number being seniors, attended the Republican assemblyman’s May 4 event, which for the most part was devoid of protesters and remained orderly throughout. Acosta, whose 38th District includes Simi Valley, said he found the hour-long event to be very effective. “I thought everyone was very considerate of each other and polite in the sense that, even though there were some tough questions, everyone was respectful,” he said in an interview after the meeting. “Overall, it was a great conversation with the community.” Q&A—Mary Bandini of Simi Valley asks 38th District Assemblymember Dante Acosta, right, about state laws governing sexual assault during a May 4 town hall. Wyatt Woodson, a representative from Acosta’s office, holds the microphone. MICHAEL COONS/Acorn Newspapers Range of concerns Joe Panzarello of Simi Valley asked Acosta about Senate Bill 54, also known as the “sanctuary state” bill. Proposed by state Sen. Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles), SB 54 has passed the state Senate and is heading to the Assembly. If signed into law, SB 54 would prevent law enforcement agencies from using their resources to help with immigration enforcement. “We have a huge problem with illegal aliens in this state, so where is SB 54 at in the process?” Panzarello asked. “It was going to be voted on . . . but I think it’s been delayed because of pressure from some people to make California a sanctuary state, which I don’t want.” Acosta, who has publicly opposed SB 54, told Panzarello it was “pulled out of committee,” which means the bill is somewhat in limbo until it is introduced to the Assembly. Another speaker, Simi Valley resident Mary Bandini, asked Acosta to be a “champion for changing the laws when it comes to sexual assault.” “It’s something everyone cringes at but no one wants to talk about,” she said. “I’m asking you to work on the penal codes that say a rapist gets six years in prison as a maximum sentence or that they pay a fine of up to $10,000, when the National Sexual Assault Center has said it costs a minimum of $122,000 to help the victim.” In response, Acosta said he was committed to continuing to work on public safety issues and would meet with Bandini to further discuss her concerns. The most heated exchange of the night was between Acosta and Simi resident Leanna Brand, who wanted to know what level of cleanup the assemblyman supports for the Santa Susana Field Lab, which is in the process of being remediated by Boeing Co. and government agencies. Acosta responded to the question by saying that Boeing recently entered an agreement with the North American Land Trust to preserve its portion of the property—about 2,400 acres of the 2,850-acre site—as open space. Unsatisfied with the answer, Brand said her question was “a simple one” and continued to push Acosta for his stance. “You may think it’s simple, but there are some people who have no idea what you’re talking about,” the assemblyman told her. Ultimately, Acosta closed his response by saying he supports a cleanup alternative that “makes sure people are safe.” One Simi woman who did not give her name questioned Acosta about healthcare, saying she was astonished that some disorders like autism and ADHD are classified as preexisting conditions. She also asked him about Senate Bill 562, also known as the Healthy California Act, which calls for the creation of a universal single-payer healthcare system for all residents in the state. The bill passed the Senate Health Committee and is headed to the Appropriations Committee next. “I want to know what’s going to happen here in California and how we can be protected if something happens in Congress,” she said, alluding to the proposed American Health Care Act that passed the U.S. House of Representatives. The assemblyman responded by saying healthcare is a very complex issue and proponents of SB 562 say it “sounds great because it pays everybody’s medical bills.” But he cautioned that the bill’s author, state Sen. Ricardo Lara (D-Huntington Park), is unable to answer questions about how the state will cover the cost. “If (SB 562) survives the Senate and then comes to the Assembly, we can have this conversation again to continue the dialogue on what’s best for this district,” he said.

The Belarusian leader made the statement during a meeting here with the governor of the Rostov region of Russia Vasily Golubev. Lukashenko reminded that earlier the cooperation between the Belarusian Belaruskali and the Russian Uralkali has collapsed not through the fault of the Belarusian side. He added that he has proposals to resume the cooperation. The president stressed that the Belarusian side is ready for competition and doing business in a humane way or even in a brotherly way. He specified that such agreements can be concluded only on an honest and principled basis. Earlier, Lukashenko announced his readiness to cooperate with Uralkali. He said that the representatives of this company repeatedly applied for the resumption of work with Belaruskali in production and sales of fertilizers. At the same time, he noted that the interests of the Belarusian side should be observed by 200 percent. Uralkali severed relations with Belarus in July 2013. Almost a month later, the head of Uralkali was arrested in Minsk. These events caused a collapse in the global potash market.

According to an official release issued on Thursday in the economic capital Cotonou, the committee of ministers of WAGP and the commissioner of mining and energy of Ecowas will hold the meeting to that effect. "The meeting of Cotonou is initiated by Benin's minister responsible of mining and energy. It is purposed to seek ways and means to eliminate the bottlenecks that impede the smooth operation of the project," the release said. The West African gas pipeline project (WAGP) is a private-public based enterprise that includes Benin, Togo, Ghana and Nigeria which is the main provider of gas resources. It is designed to enable a community use of the gas from Nigeria for electricity production and affordable, good quality and quantity industrial heat production. Initiated in September 1995, WAGP commenced commercial production from March 2011 and faced several challenges. These are a weak satisfaction to the demand for gas due to vandalism on export pipelines in Niger Delta in Nigeria, financial difficulties of the West African gas pipeline company and cumulated arrears of billings of Volta River Authority (VRA) of Ghana. In aggregate, Chevron-Texaco, Shell, NNPC from Nigeria, Volta River Authority (VRA) hold 96 percent participation in the project, while BenGAZ SA from Benin and SOTOGAZ from Togo hold each 2 percent participation.

Station commander Peggy Whitson and rookie flier Jack Fischer began what was expected to be a 6-1/2-hour spacewalk more than an hour late, after a cable supplying power and cooling water to Fischer`s spacesuit developed a leak. The spacewalk was the 200th outing in support of station assembly and maintenance since construction of the $100 billion laboratory, which flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, began in 1998. Fischer ended up sharing Whitson`s spacesuit servicing system, which caused both to burn through their spacesuits` battery power faster than usual. That prompted the U.S. space agency to shorten the outing and assign the astronauts just one task. The pair breezed through their first priority, replacing a faulty, 200-pound (90 kg) electronics box that routes commands and data to experiments. With time to spare, they then tackled chores slated for the original spacewalk, including installing a cable to troubleshoot a cooling system problem with the station`s $2 billion dark matter detector, mission commentator Rob Navias said. They also attached a debris shield onto an exposed docking port that is being prepared for commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Boeing Co . It was Fischer`s first spacewalk, and the ninth for Whitson, who last month broke the record for cumulative time in orbit by a U.S. astronaut. "All of the major work has been accomplished," Navias said. "It`s been an highly successful spacewalk in spite of a somewhat uncertain beginning."

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory U.S. President Donald Trump is considering 11 people to replace fired FBI Director James Comey, according to a White House official, and the Department of Justice will begin interviewing people on Friday or during the weekend. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing that Trump would fill the job “as soon as he finds a candidate that fits the qualities that he feels are necessary to lead the FBI.” The pick will be under intense scrutiny since Comey was fired while leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s probe of possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Here are the 11 people under consideration: RAY KELLY Kelly was New York City’s police commissioner longer than any other person. Although the city saw historic drops in crime under his leadership, there is some controversy over his use of stop-and-frisk, an anti-crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband. Trump has praised that method. MIKE ROGERS The former FBI agent was a congressman from Michigan until 2015 and served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Rogers also briefly advised Trump’s transition team on national security issues. ALICE FISHER Fisher was an assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice under former President George W. Bush. She currently works at the law firm Latham & Watkins. TREY GOWDY Gowdy is a House representative from South Carolina and a former federal prosecutor. He led a two-year special congressional committee investigation that accused former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department of failing to protect four Americans killed in a 2012 attack in Libya. JOHN CORNYN The Republican senator from Texas is the Senate’s second-ranking member. He previously was Texas attorney general. PAUL ABBATE Abbate has long worked in the FBI and currently serves as the executive assistant director for the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. Before that, he was the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office.

MICHAEL LUTTIG Luttig, a former Justice Department lawyer and appellate court judge, has served as executive vice president and general counsel of Boeing since 2006. LARRY THOMPSON Thompson was U.S. deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003 under Bush. He also served as senior vice president for government affairs and general counsel for PepsiCo. ANDREW MCCABE McCabe became acting director of the FBI this week following Trump’s abrupt firing of Comey. Until Tuesday, he was the bureau’s deputy director.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a briefing that Trump would fill the job "as soon as he finds a candidate that fits the qualities that he feels are necessary to lead the FBI." The pick will be under intense scrutiny since Comey was fired while leading the Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe of possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Here are the 11 people under consideration: RAY KELLY Kelly was New York City's police commissioner longer than any other person. Although the city saw historic drops in crime under his leadership, there is some controversy over his use of stop-and-frisk, an anti-crime tactic in which police stop, question and search pedestrians for weapons or contraband. Trump has praised that method. MIKE ROGERS The former FBI agent was a congressman from Michigan until 2015 and served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Rogers also briefly advised Trump's transition team on national security issues. ALICE FISHER Fisher was an assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice under former President George W. Bush. She currently works at the law firm Latham & Watkins. TREY GOWDY Gowdy is a House representative from South Carolina and a former federal prosecutor. He led a two-year special congressional committee investigation that accused former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's State Department of failing to protect four Americans killed in a 2012 attack in Libya. JOHN CORNYN The Republican senator from Texas is the Senate's second-ranking member. He previously was Texas attorney general. PAUL ABBATE Abbate has long worked in the FBI and currently serves as the executive assistant director for the Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. Before that, he was the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office. MICHAEL GARCIA The former New York prosecutor currently serves as an associate judge on the New York Court of Appeals. JOHN SUTHERS Suthers is the former Colorado attorney general and the current mayor of Colorado Springs, Colorado. He also was the executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections. MICHAEL LUTTIG Luttig, a former Justice Department lawyer and appellate court judge, has served as executive vice president and general counsel of Boeing since 2006. LARRY THOMPSON Thompson was U.S. deputy attorney general from 2001 to 2003 under Bush. He also served as senior vice president for government affairs and general counsel for PepsiCo. ANDREW MCCABE McCabe became acting director of the FBI this week following Trump's abrupt firing of Comey. Until Tuesday, he was the bureau's deputy director.
