Posted 26 Oct 2016 02:40 The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the "What's Next?" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young Enlarge Caption  Email More A A BRUSSELS: Boeing voiced more optimism on Tuesday about going ahead with a new aircraft to fill a gap in its product line, but said the time frame for producing such a plane remained years away. "I would say we're a little bit more optimistic today than we have been" about the "middle of the market" plane, Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said at a briefing on Boeing's market outlook in Brussels, ahead of Boeing's results report on Wednesday. But Tinseth said other projects will come first: bringing its 737 MAX single-aisle aircraft into service next year, adding a longer Dreamliner, the 787-10, in 2018 and developing the 777X, due in 2020. "So whatever we're going to do here, it will come after we get all those other things done," Tinseth said. Boeing is under growing pressure to produce the middle of the market plane, which would fill a gap between its largest 737 MAX model and the smallest 787. Earlier this month, the head of Qatar Airways took the opportunity of an order announcement to further press Boeing to build such a plane. Asked in a Reuters interview when he wanted to hear more about the plane, Al Baker said: "Yesterday!" Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in the same interview that Boeing continues to evaluate the idea and talk with customers. In addition to building the jets already on the drawing boards, Boeing's first order of business in the mid-market segment is to protect its flank from European rival Airbus , which has gobbled up orders in that space. Airbus' A321neo is larger than Boeing's competing 737, and Boeing said it is studying a stretched version, dubbed the MAX 10, that would be easier to make than an all-new middle of the market plane. But the 737 MAX 10 is not seen coming to market until after the smallest version comes out in 2019. Boeing could develop both a 737 MAX 10 and a new middle of the market plane, Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said at an investor conference last month. But no decisions have been made. "We could potentially do both," he said. Boeing also could compete with the planes it has already, he added. Analysts are looking for Boeing to report profit of US$2.62 per share when it posts third-quarter results on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The use of two 23-year-old Boeing 757-200s have again come under scrutiny from deputy leader Ron Mark after one broke down en route to India where Mr Key is set to hold a number of high level meetings, including with his counterpart Narendra Modi. The Boeing was scheduled for only brief stopover in Australia but developed mechanical problems in Townsville meaning Mr Key and his delegation was forced to stay the night and wait for a replacement plane which took off this afternoon for India. 'The Air Force are not happy with what's happened' 02:09 Our Political Reporter Katie Bradford reports from Townsville where the airforce plane carrying John Key to India has broken down. Source: Breakfast The Boeing that broke down has been slated for replacement, but Mr Mark says the Defence Force shouldn't have to foot the bill. "If the Prime Minister wants 'PM 1' then his own department should fund the $140 million it will cost for something like an Airbus A320 instead of the New Zealand Defence Force," he said. "Alternatively, we have an award-winning state airline that can do that job by charter or by buying a seat like the rest of us." Mr Mark said the plane flew just 571 flight hours between January 2013 and September 2015, a fifth of what a commercial plane would do. Prime Minister's India trip halted over NZDF plane hitch 04:44 John Key will spend the night in Townsville while a new plane is flown out to meet him and his delegation. Source: 1 NEWS "It sounds counter-intuitive, but aircraft are much easier to maintain if they're kept flying than sitting on the tarmac," he said, highlighting his concerns about commercial jets flying too few hours in military service. It's not the first time in recent months the PM has had plane trouble. One of the 757s was grounded for several hours in Laos last month after Mr Key attended the East Asia Summit. The plane was flown to Guam for repairs while Mr Key attended the Pacific Islands Forum before returning to New Zealand.

Yankee Analysts Home Earnings Finance Global Markets About Us Privacy Policy Boeing Co (NYSE:BA): a Look into Earnings & What Analysts are Expecting By William Abels - October 24, 2016 SHARE Facebook Twitter For the most recent quarter, 7 analysts weighing in on Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) had predicted that the company would report earnings per share of $-0.88 for the period ending on 2016-06-30.  On 2016-07-27, the firm reported actual earnings of $-0.44 for fiscal Q2 representing an EPS surprise amount in per share dollar terms of $0.44.  Just prior to the release, analyst’s estimates had a standard deviation of 0.1.  Looking ahead to the next fiscal quarter, Wall Street analysts are expecting earnings per share of 2.62 for the period closing on 2016-09-30. This is the Zacks Consensus estimate calculated as the arithmetic average of all the individual analyst EPS estimates according to their own proprietary methodology (BNRI Accounting).  Investors are expecting that Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) will issue their earnings release on or around 2016-10-26. In comparing the results to the same quarter a year ago, the firm posted earnings of $2.52 for the period which endend on 2015-09-30. Analyst Sentiment Leading up to the next earnings announcements investors should pay close attention to the analysts sentiment on the stock and which direction they are revising their estimates.  Over the past 6 months 2 sell-side analysts have lowered their long term earnings per share estimates on the stock.  During that same period 3 analysts have increased their earnings expectations for the firm.  So what does this mean?  Typically if a large percentage of analysts lower their revisions, the company is more likely to disappoint the Street.  If a large number of brokerage firms increase estimates prior to earnings, the company is more likely to impress with their numbers. Looking ahead to long term projections, Zacks has calculated a long term mean estimate of 12.2.  This is the best estimate for both revenue and earnings over the next three to five years.  Three months ago this number stood at 12.56. Analyst Price Targets Now turning to where analysts believe Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) shares are headed.  According to the 11 analysts covering the shares, the consensus price target stands at $151.727.  The standard deviation of all estimates is $22.365.  The most aggressive analyst on the name has a price target of $183.  The analyst with the most bearish outlook on the stock has a target price of $103.  The latest analyst revision was recorded on 2016-10-20. Each of the 11 covering analysts have also provided a Buy, Sell or Hold recommendation on the stock.  As of 2016-10-23, 8 have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, 1 have a Buy rating, 5 have a Hold rating and 1 have a Sell or Strong Sell.  Taking a look back three months ago to compare sentiment, at that time 8 had a Strong Buy, 1 had a Buy, 5 had a Hold and 1 had a sell rating.  Zacks breaks all of the recommendations down into a integer based number in order to get an average recommendation rating on the stock.  The scale is on a 1 to 5 basis where 1 represents a Strong Buy and 5 a Strong Sell.  Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has a mean recommendation of 2.09.  In looking at the historical ratings numbers we can see that the stock had a mean rating of 2.11 one month ago, 2.11 two months ago and 2.09 three months ago.    William Abels LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Latest Netflix Up More Than 3% October 5, 2016 Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Closes Fast-Casual Prototypes as Part of “Strategic...

A top Airbus executive thinks that his company will overtake Boeing in terms of annual aircraft deliveries by 2020, but this goal may be a stretch. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 24, 2016 at 4:10PM For the past several years, Boeing (NYSE:BA) has reliably outpaced top rival Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) in terms of annual aircraft production. However, Airbus has accumulated a larger order backlog than its American rival. At the end of September, it had 6,749 unfilled orders for commercial airplanes, compared to 5,612 unfilled orders at Boeing. Popular models like the A320neo have driven huge growth in Airbus' order backlog. Image source: Airbus. Last week, Airbus commercial aircraft chief Fabrice Bregier boldly proclaimed that Airbus will overtake Boeing in terms of annual deliveries by 2020. Let's take a look at the two companies' order books and production plans to evaluate the likelihood of that occurring. A close race in the narrow-body segment In terms of raw numbers, the A320 and 737 narrow-body aircraft families dominate production at Airbus and Boeing, representing more than 70% of their combined output. Last year, Airbus delivered 491 A320-family aircraft, while Boeing maintained a slight edge with 495 deliveries of its stalwart 737 family. Last year, both companies were officially producing narrow-body units at a rate of 42 per month. They are ramping up production over the next several years. By 2020, Airbus plans to build 60 A320neos per month, while Boeing intends to increase 737 MAX production to 57 per month. On its face, that means Airbus would be building 720 A320neos a year, compared to 684 737 MAXs for Boeing. However, the actual gap would be smaller, in all likelihood. On the one hand, Boeing's actual production typically lags its official capacity by a modest amount. Realistically, its annual output at a 57-per-month official rate would be 675 to 680 units. On the other hand, Airbus operates on an 11.5-month production calendar, so a 60-per-month production rate would translate to about 690 deliveries per year. Boeing is boosting the 737 production rate to keep pace with Airbus. Image source: Boeing. It's possible that Airbus could try to push production rates even higher to take advantage of its larger backlog. However, with annual order volumes trending down -- through the end of September, Airbus had only captured 317 net orders for the A320 family in 2016 -- the company is likely to be cautious about further rate increases. Boeing looks to maintain strong wide-body production The wide-body market has been Boeing's last bastion of dominance. In 2015, Boeing delivered 267 wide-body units, nearly double Airbus' total of 144 wide-body deliveries. However, Airbus' wide-body output is on the rise as A350 production ramps up. Meanwhile, Boeing will struggle to keep its wide-body delivery count at the historic highs reached in 2015 and 2016. Production of the 787 Dreamliner has stabilized at 12 per month. With a backlog of roughly 700 unfilled orders, Boeing should be able to churn out 144 787s annually for the foreseeable future. An earlier plan to increase production to 14 per month will probably remain dormant, though, barring an uptick in demand. Production of the 787 has stabilized at the highest rate ever for a wide-body aircraft. Image source: Boeing. Meanwhile, Boeing is ramping up production of the venerable 767 to a rate of 2.5 per month. Half of that production capacity is needed for Boeing's contract to build 179 aerial refueling tankers for the U.S. Air Force. Most of the rest will be used to deliver a steady stream of freighters to FedEx. On the other hand, Boeing is slashing 747 production by more than half, to just 0.5 per month. It also plans to reduce the delivery rate for the 777 family to 5.5 per month by 2018, compared to 8.3 per month recently. Many analysts now believe that Boeing will need to cut 777 production even further. Based on this outlook, Boeing will be delivering fewer than 250 wide-body units annually by 2018. Output could recover somewhat by 2020 as the new 777X enters service, but it will remain below last year's total of 267 unless Boeing has enough demand to raise 787 production to 14 per month. Can Airbus catch up on the wide-body side? Last year, Airbus delivered just 14 A350s. However, it hopes to deliver as many as 50 this year, while ramping up to a production rate of 10 per month by the end of 2018. That means it will be building up to 114 per year in 2020. Airbus has expressed interest in pushing A350 production as high as 13 per month. Its backlog of 769 unfilled orders at the end of September could potentially support higher production. That said, order activity has been slow lately. (The A350 has just 33 net orders year to date.) If order activity remains weak, a production increase to 13 per month wouldn't be sustainable for very long. On the flip side, demand for the Airbus A380 is plummeting. Airbus plans to deliver just 12 a year starting in 2018. The A330 family is the big wild card. Production rates have been very unstable lately, reaching a high of 10 per month in 2013, but then falling to nine per month in 2015 and six per month in 2016, only to increase again in 2017 to seven a month. In theory, the arrival of the A330neo in late 2017 should allow Airbus to ramp up production again. However, demand for the A330neo has been lackluster. Airbus has obtained just 186 firm orders, some of which are scheduled for delivery at least as late as 2024. It also has 150 unfilled orders for the current-generation A330. That may be enough for Airbus to maintain the new seven-per-month rate, but it can't raise production without a big influx of orders. A330neo demand has been disappointing thus far. Image source: Airbus. Thus, barring a rebound in demand for wide-body aircraft, Airbus is likely to be delivering a little more than 200 widebodies annually in 2020. That would be up by more than 40% from 2015. Can Airbus deliver? Airbus is poised to dramatically narrow the gap between its output and that of Boeing. On the narrow-body side, it is on track to outpace Boeing's annual production by 10 to 15 units by 2020. However, Boeing is likely to maintain its wide-body lead for the foreseeable future. Based on currently announced production plans, Boeing would deliver at least 40 more wide-body units than Airbus on an annual basis in the 2019 to 2020 period. Even if 777 deliveries briefly dip as low as four per month, it would still maintain a sizable lead over Airbus. The most plausible way for Airbus to overtake Boeing by 2020 would be to ramp up A320neo production beyond 60 per month. That's probably not a good use of capital, though. Delivering the most airplanes is a point of pride, but the real goal is to deliver a good return for shareholders. In that respect, Airbus and Boeing both have bright prospects.

With a backlog of roughly 700 unfilled orders, Boeing should be able to churn out 144 787s annually for the foreseeable future. An earlier plan to increase production to 14 per month will probably remain dormant, though, barring an uptick in demand. Production of the 787 has stabilized at the highest rate ever for a wide-body aircraft. Image source: Boeing. Meanwhile, Boeing is ramping up production of the venerable 767 to a rate of 2.5 per month. Half of that production capacity is needed for Boeing's contract to build 179 aerial refueling tankers for the U.S. Air Force. Most of the rest will be used to deliver a steady stream of freighters to FedEx. On the other hand, Boeing is slashing 747 production by more than half, to just 0.5 per month. It also plans to reduce the delivery rate for the 777 family to 5.5 per month by 2018, compared to 8.3 per month recently. Many analysts now believe that Boeing will need to cut 777 production even further. Based on this outlook, Boeing will be delivering fewer than 250 wide-body units annually by 2018. Output could recover somewhat by 2020 as the new 777X enters service, but it will remain below last year's total of 267 unless Boeing has enough demand to raise 787 production to 14 per month. Can Airbus catch up on the wide-body side? Last year, Airbus delivered just 14 A350s. However, it hopes to deliver as many as 50 this year, while ramping up to a production rate of 10 per month by the end of 2018. That means it will be building up to 114 per year in 2020. Airbus has expressed interest in pushing A350 production as high as 13 per month. Its backlog of 769 unfilled orders at the end of September could potentially support higher production. That said, order activity has been slow lately. (The A350 has just 33 net orders year to date.) If order activity remains weak, a production increase to 13 per month wouldn't be sustainable for very long. On the flip side, demand for the Airbus A380 is plummeting. Airbus plans to deliver just 12 a year starting in 2018. The A330 family is the big wild card. Production rates have been very unstable lately, reaching a high of 10 per month in 2013, but then falling to nine per month in 2015 and six per month in 2016, only to increase again in 2017 to seven a month. In theory, the arrival of the A330neo in late 2017 should allow Airbus to ramp up production again. However, demand for the A330neo has been lackluster. Airbus has obtained just 186 firm orders, some of which are scheduled for delivery at least as late as 2024. It also has 150 unfilled orders for the current-generation A330. That may be enough for Airbus to maintain the new seven-per-month rate, but it can't raise production without a big influx of orders. A330neo demand has been disappointing thus far. Image source: Airbus. Thus, barring a rebound in demand for wide-body aircraft, Airbus is likely to be delivering a little more than 200 widebodies annually in 2020. That would be up by more than 40% from 2015. Can Airbus deliver? Airbus is poised to dramatically narrow the gap between its output and that of Boeing. On the narrow-body side, it is on track to outpace Boeing's annual production by 10 to 15 units by 2020. However, Boeing is likely to maintain its wide-body lead for the foreseeable future. Based on currently announced production plans, Boeing would deliver at least 40 more wide-body units than Airbus on an annual basis in the 2019 to 2020 period. Even if 777 deliveries briefly dip as low as four per month, it would still maintain a sizable lead over Airbus. The most plausible way for Airbus to overtake Boeing by 2020 would be to ramp up A320neo production beyond 60 per month. That's probably not a good use of capital, though. Delivering the most airplanes is a point of pride, but the real goal is to deliver a good return for shareholders. In that respect, Airbus and Boeing both have bright prospects.

Instead, the Macon plant will close in December when its defense work runs out. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Hit by slumping sales of the 747, Boeing has dropped a plan to save its defense plant in Macon, Ga., by making fuselage panels for the jumbo jet there. Boeing said Monday the Macon plant will close in December. The company’s 747 production is now at one jet every two months, About 120 people work at the plant, which opened in 1988 and has made parts for C-17 military transport planes and Chinook helicopters. Boeing praised the “unmatched professionalism” of the workforce at the plant and said it will try to assist employees finding jobs at other Boeing sites.

Just a year ago, Triumph Group, which currently builds the 747 fuselage panels in Hawthorne, Calif., decided to exit the program as slowing of production to one jet per month made the venture unprofitable. Boeing decided to take the work in-house and, starting in 2018, have the Macon workers make the panels as their military work came to an end. But demand for the 747 has slumped further, forcing Boeing to cut production again from last month and to kill the plan to invest in Macon. Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes unit “has determined that it does not have a business case at this time for taking on the Macon site,” the company said in a statement. “Following the completion of defense work in December, site operations will conclude with no planned restart.” Boeing cited “the continuing soft cargo market and the accompanying reduced demand for very large cargo freighters” as the reason for abandoning its plan. In a message to Everett employees working on the jumbo jet, Bruce Dickinson, 747 program vice president, acknowledged the move looks ominous for the 747’s future, but tried to offer reassurance. He wrote that Triumph will continue to supply the fuselage panels into 2019, giving Boeing more time to work out where it will place the work afterward. “Many may ask if this is a sign the 747 program is ending in the near-term. No, it is not,” Dickinson told employees. “We simply do not have to make a work placement decision at this time. “In addition, there are numerous active sales campaigns with key customers, and our Sales team is working aggressively to complete those sales,” Dickinson said. Because some orders listed in the 747 backlog are doubtful, without further sales, Boeing can plausibly count on delivering just 26 more of the airplanes. Depending on the scheduled delivery dates, that could stretch out the program to the end of the decade.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 24, 2016 at 8:25AM In the past few years, Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) has become the most profitable airline in the U.S. It's keeping up the momentum in 2016 despite a massive surge in competition in its markets. Over the past 12 months, Alaska Air has generated a stellar 24.8% pre-tax margin. Looking ahead, Alaska Air plans to dramatically expand its presence in California by buying smaller rival Virgin America (NASDAQ:VA). It hopes to close that acquisition by the end of 2016, but must first resolve an ongoing antitrust review by federal regulators as well as a separate antitrust lawsuit brought by private citizens. Alaska Air hopes to finalize its merger with Virgin America soon. Image source: Alaska Airlines. Whether or not Alaska manages to close the Virgin America merger in the next few months, the company is on track to continue posting strong results in 2017 and beyond. Let's take a look at how it will do so. Continuous fuel-efficiency gains After two years of benefiting from sharp fuel price declines, airlines (including Alaska Airlines) are starting to face year-over-year fuel price increases. However, offsetting this, Alaska has been improving its fuel efficiency by about 2% annually by replacing its oldest planes with modern Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s. In total, Alaska improved its fuel efficiency by 25% between 2004 and 2015. In 2017, Alaska will complete the process of replacing all of its previous-generation 737-400s with new Boeing 737-900ERs. (Alaska Air CFO Brandon Pedersen quipped last week that the 737-900ER is like a Prius with wings; it uses less fuel than a 737-400 despite having 25% more seats!) The other benefit of retiring the last 16 737-400s is that it will simplify Alaska's maintenance operations. That will offer an additional cost reduction opportunity. Alaska Airlines' fuel-efficiency gains will slow down after 2017, but they won't stop. Beginning in early 2018, Alaska will add Boeing's 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 9 to its fleet. According to Boeing, those models will offer double-digit fuel efficiency improvements relative to the 737-800 and 737-900ER. Alaska Airlines will add the new Boeing 737 MAX 8 to its fleet in early 2018. Image source: Boeing. Growing ancillary revenue Boosting non-ticket revenue has been a key focus for most airlines, and Alaska is no exception. Earlier this year, it revised its co-branded credit card agreement in order to provide more benefits for cardholders and bring in more revenue. The company expects credit card-related revenue to continue growing in the years ahead. Additionally, Alaska Airlines has started to retrofit its fleet with a new section of extra-legroom seats, dubbed "Premium Class." Tickets for the new seats will go on sale next month for flights starting in early January. Alaska plans to finish the retrofit program by the end of 2017. Alaska Air executives have forecast that this initiative will add $50 million of incremental operating profit in 2017. By 2018, the annualized impact will be more than $85 million. Competitors are finally easing up For the past several years, competitors have been growing rapidly in Alaska Airlines' markets. Indeed, since early 2015, Alaska has consistently reported double-digit increases in competitive capacity. Not surprisingly, this growing competition has driven fares lower. Alaska's ability to maintain its stellar profitability during this period has been remarkable. In 2017, Alaska Airlines may finally get a respite from this competitive capacity growth. Based on currently published schedules, Alaska is set to face a 9% uptick in competitive capacity in Q1 2017 but a modest 1% increase by Q2. (For comparison, competitive capacity surged 13% year over year last quarter.) If competitive capacity growth really does sink to low single-digit levels by Q2 2017, it will set the stage for a return to solid unit revenue growth at Alaska Airlines. Virgin America would provide even more upside The combination of steadily improving fuel efficiency, rising ancillary revenue, and a tamer competitive environment should help Alaska Air offset much of the headwind from rising oil prices in 2017 and beyond. Completing the Virgin America merger would be the icing on the cake. When the merger was first announced, Alaska estimated that the Virgin America acquisition would add $100 million in pre-tax income immediately. By 2020, when all the merger synergies would be realized, the Virgin America acquisition should add $325 million to Alaska's pre-tax income. Thus, it's obvious why Alaska Air is eager to address any antitrust issues and complete the merger. However, the nice thing for investors is that the company has plenty of room for long-term profit growth even without the benefits of the merger.

Demand for Cobham’s maritime satellite and communications products is “subdued,” the wireless-connectivity arm has operational issues and needs funds, and extra costs have been incurred from technical glitches on space-related programs, the Wimborne, England-based company said in a statement. Receipts from the supply of refueling gear -- the market for which Cobham is best known -- to Boeing Co.’s KC-46 tanker program have also been delayed as the company works to meet U.S. Federal Aviation Administration conditions, locking up about 40 million pounds ($49 million) in cash until the year’s end. Departing CEO Bob Murphy said on a conference call that Cobham is wrestling with one-time operating challenges “to get the business right-footed and to move forward,” adding: “We don’t have a long-term issue.” Including gains from a drop in the value of the pound since Britain’s vote to exit the European Union on June 23, trading profit will be between 255 million pounds and 275 million pounds, Cobham said. That’s a 10 percent downgrade in expectations, Sandy Morris, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note to clients. Cobham shares had their steepest intraday drop since April 26 and traded almost 17 percent lower at 133.7 pence as of 11:55 a.m. in London, taking the decline this year to 44 percent and valuing the company at 2.28 billion pounds. New Direction The forecast-cut is the third since November 2015. Even though Cobham expects an improvement in the fourth quarter “from increased volumes in a number of areas,” that won’t be sufficient to meet earlier guidance, the manufacturer said. It didn’t provide a forecast for the year starting January. Cobham in August named David Lockwood, head of wireless communications and electromagnetic developer Laird Plc, to become CEO by Jan. 1, succeeding Murphy, whose $1.46 billion acquisition of wireless specialist Aeroflex had aimed to dilute the company’s focus on shrinking defense markets. The purchase, while “important strategically” amid a downturn in U.K. and U.S. military spending, placed an “incredible amount of stress on the near-term financial success of the business,” Murphy said Monday. Since the acquisition, Cobham has disposed of businesses in four separate transactions to shore up cash and reduce debt. Delivery snags at the wireless unit also prompted it to raise 500 million pounds in a rights issue in April, a move that Morris said at the time was “tough medicine” for investors.

REUTERS/Alwyn Scott 1/2 left right Mechanic Andrew Newingham uses a wireless headset and voice-controlled computer to quickly input details about an auxiliary power unit engine needing repairs at a Honeywell Aerospace service center in Phoenix, Arizona September 6, 2016. REUTERS/Alwyn Scott 2/2 By Alwyn Scott | PHOENIX PHOENIX In search of higher profits margins, Boeing Co (BA.N) is aiming to win more of the lucrative market for replacement parts and repair services, pitting the plane maker against major suppliers who view that growing $62 billion a year market as their turf. Boeing told Reuters it has added 35,000 parts to stocks it positions around the world to serve airlines in the last year, after analyzing its vast store of aircraft data to see where the parts will be needed. It has also cut prices on 24,000 parts to be more competitive, and it is expanding training and other services. Boeing is trying to capture more profit from spare parts made under license by suppliers as well. To get there, it is producing some new parts in house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. The maker of such flagship jets as the 787 Dreamliner and top-selling 737 has been building its aftermarket business for years. But as demand for planes has slowed over the last 18 months, Boeing is now turning more aggressively to spare parts and services to help meet its own ambitious targets of doubling overall margins to the mid-teens by 2020. The main reason: a dollar of added aftermarket sales is more valuable than a dollar of new aircraft sales. Boeing's aftermarket sales have risen over the last three years and are outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters. "That means we're taking market share," he said. Boeing's effort is ratcheting up competition with many of its biggest suppliers, including Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N), and repair operations such as Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) Technical Operations and Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) Technik - which are all taking action to defend their lucrative franchises. Aftermarket sales typically offer margins of 20 percent or more - which makes expanding its presence in that market crucial to Boeing's effort to hit Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg's overall profitability goal, analysts say. Boeing doesn't break out aftermarket revenue, and has not publicly discussed its aftermarket strategy in detail. Analysts estimate parts and services generate about $15 billion a year, or nearly 16 percent of Boeing's $96 billion in annual sales, split roughly evenly between its commercial aircraft and defense businesses. Industry experts say Boeing aims to more than triple aftermarket sales to as much as $50 billion over the next 10 years. Boeing declined to confirm a specific target, but the company's "leadership has set high aspirations," Floyd said. "We are investing heavily into these businesses." Boeing has logged its largest number of orders for its "GoldCare" aircraft maintenance service this year, and now counts 60 customers and 2,200 planes in the program. "We're seeing the returns on these investments," Floyd said. "COMPETIMATES" Boeing partners with the likes of Honeywell Aerospace to do some repairs. But both are trying to increase their own sales of repairs and parts to airlines. That's why the two manufacturing heavyweights are "competimates," said Mike Beazley, vice president of aftermarket sales at Honeywell. "There's a segment of the market that will pay a premium to deal with one company" through Boeing GoldCare, he said. But many "would still like to have a direct relationship with the biggest suppliers." At Honeywell Aerospace's 360,000 square-foot aftermarket center in Phoenix, the largest of its 40 repair stations around the globe, Andrew Newingham recently circled a small auxiliary aircraft engine on his workbench. As a robotic voice called out questions and Newingham answered, a computer logged details about what work the engine needed, reducing to minutes what was formerly an hours-long task involving paper checklists and typing on a computer. Honeywell aims to cut engine repair times to 20 calendar days or less, and offers upgrades and enhancements when engines come in for repairs. "What keeps us competitive and allows us to win new business is being able to offer speed," said Steve Foust, senior plant director.  WINNING ON PRICE Repair organizations also are reacting as Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) try to grab business. Boeing partners with Lufthansa Technik [LUFT.UL] on some services. But it also undercuts Lufthansa on others. Low-cost, long-haul airline Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL), for example, considered several service groups, including Lufthansa Technik. In the end it picked GoldCare to maintain its 737 MAX and 787 jets, Asgeir Nyseth, chief operating officer of Norwegian Group, said in an interview.  Boeing's service "was the cheapest one," he said, adding Norwegian benefited from the increased competition Boeing provided. Boeing and Airbus "have the advantage that they can combine an after-sale service package with the sale of the aircraft," said Lufthansa Technik's Frank Berweger, senior vice president of corporate sales for the Americas. In part to counter the aircraft makers, Lufthansa Technik plans to quadruple investment in research and product development to 200 million euros ($219.52 million) to 2018 from 2015, on top of increased spending on tooling and training to service new Boeing and Airbus jetliner types. Engine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Pratt & Whitney locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, says Boeing will find it difficult to capture $50 billion in services revenue annually -- not to mention making a profit -- given the strength of some of the suppliers and specialist service companies. "Boeing has to be agile and cost competitive enough to win business from established players," Michaels said. "They need to be entrepreneurial. That's a challenge."

COL, -0.43% today reported fourth quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings per share from continuing operations increased 14% to $1.58, compared to $1.38 in the prior year. Total sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 were $1.45 billion, a 4% increase from the same period in fiscal year 2015. Total segment operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 60 basis points to 22.6% and segment operating earnings increased 7% to $326 million, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2015. Fiscal year 2016 sales were $5.26 billion, compared to $5.24 billion in fiscal year 2015. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 6% to $5.50, compared to $5.19 in the prior year. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations totaled $723 million in fiscal year 2016, compared to $749 million in fiscal year 2015. Free cash flow was $530 million in fiscal year 2016, compared to $539 million in fiscal year 2015. The Company announced financial guidance for its fiscal year 2017. This financial guidance is based on stand-alone expectations for Rockwell Collins and does not contemplate the acquisition of B/E Aerospace that was separately announced today. The Company expects revenue between $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion and free cash flow in the range of $600 million to $700 million. Total segment operating margins in 2017 are expected to be about flat with 2016. Integral to this guidance are the following assumptions for the Company's reporting segments in comparison to fiscal year 2016: Government Systems sales are expected to grow low-to-mid single-digits. Commercial Systems sales are expected to be about flat. Information Management Services sales are expected to be up mid-to-high single-digits. "I'm pleased to report a strong quarter of operational performance highlighted by double-digit earnings per share growth and robust quarterly free cash flow generation," said Rockwell Collins Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Ortberg. “As we look to fiscal year 2017, we expect continued recovery in Government Systems driven by an improved budget environment. We also expect our Information Management Services business will continue to grow as a result of the ongoing demand for aircraft connectivity. Our Commercial Systems business is expected to be flat as air transport OEM growth is being offset by lower business jet sales and aftermarket parts recycling. We look forward to completing the acquisition of B/E Aerospace which will significantly enhance our long-term outlook.” Following is a discussion of fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter sales and earnings for each business segment. Commercial Systems Commercial Systems, which provides aviation electronics systems, products and services to air transport, business and regional aircraft manufacturers and airlines worldwide, achieved 2016 fourth quarter results as summarized below.               (dollars in millions) Q4 FY16 Q4 FY15 Inc/(Dec) Commercial Systems sales Original equipment $ 351 $ 372 (6 )% Aftermarket 251 251 — % Wide-body in-flight entertainment 8   13   (38 )% Total Commercial Systems sales $ 610   $ 636   (4 )%   Operating earnings $ 130 $ 146 (11 )% Operating margin rate 21.3 % 23.0 %   Original equipment sales decreased due to lower business aircraft OEM production rates, unfavorable customer timing for airline selectable equipment, and lower Airbus A330 production rates. These decreases were partially offset by higher product deliveries in support of the Airbus A350, Boeing 787, and Bombardier CSeries production rate increases, as well as higher customer-funded development program revenues. Aftermarket sales were flat as higher air transport entry-into-service spares sales were offset by lower business jet cabin retrofit sales. Operating earnings and operating margin decreased due to lower business jet sales, a $4 million charge related to employee headcount reductions, and higher research and development expense and amortization of pre-production engineering costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by cost savings initiatives from previously announced restructuring plans. Government Systems Government Systems provides a broad range of electronic products, systems and services to customers including the U.S. Department of Defense, other government agencies, civil agencies, defense contractors and ministries of defense around the world. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, Government Systems sales categories have been consolidated as a result of an internal reorganization and are delineated based on the underlying product technologies. The previously reported sales categories of Communication products, Surface solutions and Navigation products are now primarily consolidated into Communication and navigation. Government Systems sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 have been reclassified to the current year presentation. Results from the fourth quarter of 2016 are summarized below.               (dollars in millions) Q4 FY16 Q4 FY15 Inc/(Dec) Government Systems sales Avionics $ 457 $ 400 14 % Communication and navigation 205   181   13 % Total Government Systems sales $ 662   $ 581   14 %   Operating earnings $ 168 $ 129 30 % Operating margin rate 25.4 % 22.2 %   Avionics sales increased due to higher fixed-wing platform revenues, simulation and training program sales, and sales from a classified program. Communication and navigation sales increased due to higher ARC-210 product sales, data links sales, and GPS-based product revenues, partially offset by the wind-down of an international electronic warfare program and lower international deliveries of targeting systems. Operating earnings and operating margin increased primarily due to higher sales volume, cost savings from previously announced restructuring plans, and lower company-funded research and development expense. In addition, favorable development program contract adjustments were offset by unfavorable warranty adjustments. Information Management Services Information Management Services (IMS) provides communication services, systems integration and security solutions across the aviation, airport, rail and nuclear security markets. Results from the fourth quarter of 2016 are summarized below.               (dollars in millions) Q4 FY16 Q4 FY15 Inc/(Dec) Information Management Services sales $ 173 $ 167 4 %   Operating earnings $ 28 $ 29 (3 )% Operating margin rate 16.2 % 17.4 %   IMS sales increased due to growth in aviation related businesses and higher non-aviation related sales due to the timing of nuclear security program revenues. These increases were partially offset by certain favorable adjustments recorded in the aviation related businesses in the prior year. IMS operating earnings and operating margin decreased primarily due to certain favorable adjustments recorded in the aviation related businesses in the prior year, partially offset by higher earnings from the higher sales volume. Income Taxes The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 29.7% for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 compared to a rate of 30.8% for the same period last year. The lower current year effective income tax rate from continuing operations was primarily due to differences in the availability of the Federal R&D tax credit. Cash Flow Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $723 million in fiscal year 2016, compared to $749 million in fiscal year 2015. The $26 million decrease was primarily due to unfavorable net working capital changes, partially offset by lower income tax payments. The company paid a dividend on its common stock of 33 cents per share, or $43 million, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fiscal Year 2017 Outlook This financial guidance is based on stand-alone expectations for Rockwell Collins in fiscal year 2017 and does not contemplate the acquisition of B/E Aerospace that was separately announced today: --   Total sales     $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion -- Total segment operating margins About 21.0% -- Free cash flow $600 million to $700 million [(1)] -- Total research & development investment $900 million to $950 million [(2)] -- Full year income tax rate 28% to 29% (1) - The Company's free cash flow expectations assume the Company will make a $55 million discretionary contribution to the company’s qualified defined benefit pension plan, capital expenditures will total about $200 million, and net pre-production engineering costs capitalized in inventory is expected to increase about $50 million in fiscal year 2017. (2) - Total research and development investment consists of company and customer funded research & development expenditures as well as the net increase in pre-production engineering costs capitalized within inventory. Non-GAAP Financial Information Total segment operating margin is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled to the related GAAP measure, Income from continuing operations before income taxes, in the Segment Sales and Earnings Information schedule in this press release. Total segment operating margin is calculated as total segment operating earnings divided by total sales. The non-GAAP total segment operating margin information included in this disclosure is believed to be useful to investors' understanding and assessment of the Company's ongoing operations. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is reconciled to the related GAAP measure, Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations below. Free cash flow is calculated as Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations less Property Additions. The non-GAAP free cash flow information included in this disclosure is believed to be useful to investors' understanding and assessment of the Company's ongoing operations.       Year Ended September 30 (dollars in millions) 2016     2015 Cash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations $ 723 $ 749 Less: Property Additions (193 ) (210 ) Free Cash Flow $ 530   $ 539     Conference Call and Webcast Details Separately today, Rockwell Collins announced the acquisition of B/E Aerospace. Due to this pending transaction, both Rockwell Collins and B/E Aerospace have canceled their previously scheduled earnings conference calls and webcasts.

McKenna Japan's defense ministry is laying the foundation for introducing the Bell Boeing V-22 into its military operations by familiarizing its populace with the speedy tiltrotor. The Japan Times reported that a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey conducted operations Oct. 24 at the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force camp in the city of Kisarazu so officials could assess noise from the aircraft's operations. In a related move, that newspaper said, the defense ministry is planning Osprey demonstration flights near Saga airport in southwest Japan on Nov. 8 "to give the local government the opportunity to assess the proposed deployment of the aircraft at the site." That demonstration, at the request of Saga Prefecture’s governor, also is aimed at assessing the V-22’s noise emissions. Japan plans to start using the tiltrotor in stages beginning in early 2018, and they could begin operating from Saga in early 2019. The Ground Self-Defense Force camp in Kisarazu, a city of 135,000 about 25 nautical miles southeast of Tokyo in Chiba Prefecture, is to be used as a maintenance base for Ground Self-Defense Force and U.S. Marine Corps Ospreys. The newspaper said V-22s deployed at USMC Air Station Futenma in Okinawa Prefecture would undergo regular maintenance starting in January at the Kisarazu camp, with the work performed by Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. The municipal government and the assembly in Kisarazu have asked the defense ministry to measure Osprey noise levels to evaluate their impact on the environment, The Japan Times said. In the demonstration there, the MV-22 circled over the camp and hovered above the runway while ministry personnel measured the noise, the newspaper said, adding that Ground Self-Defense Force pilots also flew a Boeing CH-47 over the base to compare noise levels.  Related News Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertise with us Rotorcraft Jobs Search Jobs: Browse all jobs Post jobs Post Resume View Resumes Most Read Most Commented 2008 Buyer’s Guide Directory Listings: Directory Sikorsky Seeks Innovative Kids Webinar Focuses on Rotorcraft Boom, Near-Term Prospects Helitech Speaker: Certification Inconsistency Slows Helicopter OEMs Celebrating St Michael's Day: AAAA Honors Army Aviators GoPro Unveils Camera Drone In Bid to Save Stock Prices EASA Revision of SPI Regulation Continues Global Eagle, Shareco to Form New Joint Venture Avionics Magazine :: RVSM Avionics: Down to the Wire Celebrating St Michael's Day: AAAA Honors Army Aviators Do you receive The Rotorcraft Collective?

New Zealander Richard Smith will captain the first of the first regular Emirates superjumbo services between Auckland and Dubai, starting on October 31. The North Shore-raised 51-year-old is one of 95 Kiwi pilots among more than 4000 flying for the Middle East airline. He describes his job and what it's like to fly the world's biggest airliner, the 575-tonne A380. Where did you learn to fly? I learned to fly at Ardmore, it was a typical general aviation background where you do anything you can to try and get more hours. I became an instructor in Palmerston North ended up in Hastings doing ambulance flights. My first airline job was Eagle Air flying the (Embraer) Bandeirante aircraft and moved on to Ansett in New Zealand when it was still around. How long have you been at Emirates I've been flying with Emirates for 16 years. I joined on Boeing 777s as a first officer for three years then a captain. I've been on A380s for about three years. I grabbed the opportunity to move to the A380 for a bit of variety, it almost revitalises your career a bit. What's the difference between the 777 and the A380? (Besides the yoke or centre stick in the Boeing and the sidestick located on the side console of the pilot in the Airbus) They're both fantastic aircraft with the way that they're set up with fly-by-wire. With the A380 on the runway when you take off you feel as if you're in a massive airplane - but it's very light in the controls. The movements are very subtle. Richard Smith from New Zealand, an A380 pilot for Emirates. Continued below.

I saw it come up and the company contacted me. They try their best to get local pilots to operate the first new flights. Every three or four months I do the Auckland flight. Coming from New Zealand it's much better to do the direct flight and not go via Australia. How is the four-person flight crew organised during the 17-hour flight. For the ultra-long range flights four pilots are split in two crews for each sector. The operating crew do the take off and landing and then split the flight in half with the augmenting crew. The operating crew have the second rest and come back (into the cockpit) about an hour before landing. What are the most challenging parts of the flight? Takeoff and landing are the most dynamic part of the flight - the main challenge is the huge variety of airports ranging from freezing in Moscow to tropical a few days later. Watch: Emirates' 360° cockpit tour of Airbus A380: Use mousepad, click pad and compass to fly through the cockpit Most of the flight is spent on autopilot, what are you doing during that time? When in cruise we're monitoring the flight path and keeping a close eye out for airports nearby in case of any eventuality. It's a big aircraft with lots of passengers so the potential for a medical diversion is always there. We do fly a long way away from airports over ocean and the North Pole. When in cruise you're keeping a careful eye on your surroundings and the environment to make sure where you are if you're required to go anywhere else. In the newer A380s pilots rest in a secure compartment in the lower area of the plane. What's it like? There's plenty of room to get up and move around. We've got the IFE (inflight entertainment) You try and get as much rest as you can in there but if you don't fall asleep you watch a movie What's the food like? Similar to passenger meals but they're all different because we cant eat exactly the same stuff on board because of the danger of food poisoning We try to keep it as healthy as possible, there's plenty of fruit on board. Is it ever boring? It's rare to be flying with the same person. You're flying with guys who are from all parts of the world with completely different cultures and background to what your used so you talk to them. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

(NYSE: BA) and arch-rival Airbus are scheduled to report third-quarter results before U.S. markets open Wednesday morning. Neither has had a particularly strong first three quarters writing new orders, and both have experienced some delivery delays resulting from delays to an engine fix (Airbus) and supplier problems delivering aircraft interiors (both Boeing and Airbus). Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect Airbus to post adjusted EBIT of $759 million, down sharply from $1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenues are expected to rise from $15.35 billion to $15.55 billion. Boeing’s expected earnings per share (EPS) comes to $2.62, up from $2.52 a year ago, and revenues are estimated to fall from $25.8 billion in the third quarter of 2015 to $23.6 billion. Boeing’s new 737 MAX narrow-body commercial jets are expected to enter service as early as March of 2017. Airbus delivered its competitor, the A320neo, in January, but problems with the Pratt & Whitney geared turbo-fan engine have slowed deliveries to a trickle. In the wide-body market, Boeing recently took an order for 10 777s, but it is still short of its goal of 40 to 50 a year needed to maintain production at current levels. We don’t expect an announcement of a production cut because the company is likely going to have to write down some costs on its CST-100 space capsule. That’s too much bad news for the quarter. Airbus has shipped less than half the number of wide-body A350s it had originally forecast for the year, but the company insists that it will still reach its forecast level of 50 for the full year. Interior supplier Zodiac is shouldering the blame for the delays. Several analysts have weighed in on Boeing’s results, and Buckingham Research pretty well sums up the bear case for the stock: The frustration among investors is that sentiment remains negative, BA has lowered numbers throughout 2016, is hinting at further volume reductions, yet the negative thesis hasn’t worked post Boeing reporting 4Q15 results in January. That’s likely because very little BA has said after January has altered investor FCF [free cash flow] forecasts. We think that could change, however, after 3Q16 as we expect several headwinds to drive consensus FCF estimates lower including: slowing advances, 777X inventory build, lower than expected 777 production rates and the [commercial aircraft division’s] margin impact, 787 cash taxes, and the increasing potential that weak pricing and slowing orders may not allow BA to recognize the entire $28B of 787 deferred production. We see 10%/(30)% upside/downside risk in our best/worst case scenarios. Buckingham maintains a Neutral rating on the stock with a price target of just $103. The equity team at S&P recently maintained its Buy rating on the stock, along with a $172 target price ahead of earnings. Their upside thesis: We see price appreciation over the next several years as commercial aircraft demand remains strong, B787 and B737 production ramps, cash returns to shareholders rise via increased stock repurchases and dividends, pension headwinds diminish and additional B787 and B777X orders drive a reacceleration in BA’s wide-body aircraft orders. While we remain concerned about a drag from defense as U.S. defense spending slows, the operation’s size relative to the commercial business, strong cost control performance and sizable international exposure will help moderate this headwind, we think. Risks to our opinion and target price include slowing global economic growth, incremental U.S. defense budget pressures, military contract losses and delays and cost overruns in bringing new aircraft to market and ramping production. JPMorgan has a Neutral rating and a $152 price target. The analysts updated their model for third-quarter deliveries and estimate adjusted EPS estimate for the quarter at $2.70. The full-year estimate is unchanged at $6.45. The firm’s investment thesis and risks were noted as follows: We rate BA Neutral based on concerns about the profitability of the commercial aero business, growth in the defense business, 787 cash flow, and market concerns around aircraft demand that might cap valuation. However, Boeing remains a leading and entrenched player in its industry with solid cash flow and a reasonable valuation. In addition, we do not expect aircraft demand to roll over imminently. Downside risks to our rating include a failure to lower 787 unit costs, a decline in demand for new aircraft, worse than expected execution on core commercial programs, and a greater-than-expected decline in defense earnings. Upside risks are stronger than expected aircraft demand, better than expected BCA margins, and outsized cash profitability on the 787 program. Earlier in October, Jefferies reiterated its Buy rating and $165 price target. The analysts said: There is a reasonably good investment case for Boeing. We believe the company understands that it needs to drive productivity and to hit development milestones. While civil orders have been slow year-to-date, recent progress with customers demonstrates that the current product is attractive. Cash Flow and EPS growth create an attractive valuation. Merrill Lynch has an Underperform rating on the stock and a $125 price objective. Airbus shares closed down 2.6% in Paris Tuesday at €53.39 (about $58.12), in a 52-week range of €48.07 to €68.50. The 12-month price target on the stock is €69.80. Boeing stock traded up about 0.9% in the early afternoon, at $138.74 in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $150.59. The 12-month price target is $148.71.

Presidents And Other Prominent Figures Who Passed On Huge Salaries Like Trump Says He Will Essent Takes A Nasty Spill, But Is It All Washed Up? (Investor's Business Daily) Andrew Left, founder of Citron Research, may have made an exception this time around. Deviating from his customary sell theme, Left recommended going long on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). In a chat with Business Insider's Linette Lopez, Left called out a pair trade: selling Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) on uncertainties over what will befall Facebook when its sharing matures and buying Amazon as he sees long-term value. In the current low interest rate environment, Left sees difficulty in finding shorts. Additionally, Left feels timing is important, as good shorts tend to have negative rebates. With the U.S. Presidential election results now a foregone conclusion according to Left, he would be focused on whether the government is serious about regulation pricing on prescription pharmaceuticals and the companies levered to it and those which are vulnerable. In May, Left went long on Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE: VRX). However, the stock lost quarter of its value by mid-July, when Left divulged new short position in the company. It was Left's accusations against Valeant of creating fraudulent invoices through a network of pharmacies it controls that brought the stock down with a thud in 2015. The report compiled by Citron Research compared Valeant to Enron, the energy-trading firm that collapsed in a 2001 accounting scandal.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy It may be a while before Govt’s plan to build fighter jets in India takes off Nayanima Basu   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Local manufacturing hinges on proposal to make the country an export hub New Delhi, October 25:   The government’s plan to manufacture single-engine fighters in the country is likely to face delays even though the Defence Ministry has notified request for information (RFI) from three firms to participate in the programme under the ‘Make in India’ initiative. US aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin and Sweden’s SAAB have approached the government as a response to the RFI with their “unsolicited proposals” that have apparently failed to “impress” the Defence Ministry, a senior official told BusinessLine. This is because, even though these companies have enumerated their plans to manufacture these jets under the ‘Make in India’ programme, the Ministry is keen on plans to transform India into an export hub for these jets, the official said. Once the RFI is issued, the government floats Request for Proposals (RFPs) to shortlist the competing firms, according to norms. However, the government is learnt to be taking one step at a time in selecting the firm that will finally be chosen to manufacture the fighter jets here. “The RFP will take time to be issued. A lot of factors need to be ascertained here apart from Make in India, logistics and infrastructure. The issue here is that once the armed forces buy these, what thereafter? Hence, export is a big factor, and indigenisation will play a crucial part in it,” the official said. Boeing has already offered to manufacture their F/A-18 Super Hornet here with full transfer of technology (ToT) to their Indian joint venture partners. Lockheed Martin has gone a step ahead and said it will develop a warplane F-16 Block 70 exclusively for the Indian market. The US government is also aggressively pushing for these two under the US-India Defence Trade and Technology Initiative. On the other side, Swedish SAAB has said it will build an entire industrial ecosystem in India under ‘Make in India’ for the Gripen E. Talks on selling the Gripen E were held during the visit of Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven to India in February. Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha had earlier said that the proposals from these three firms had been received by the government but nothing had been decided. “An early decision on indigenous ‘Make in India’ fighter aircraft project will greatly enhance our operational capability in the near term,” he had said during the Air Force Day earlier this month. The Defence Ministry plans to replace the ageing MiG-21s with these fighter jets. Last month, India had finalised a $8.7-billion deal to procure 36 French Rafale warplanes.

Boeing Co (BA) Stock Boeing is a great company that's just a bit pricey to buy right now By Lawrence Meyers, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 25, 2016, 11:28 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is STILL Cheap, Somehow 7 Buys for 7 Donald Trump Fears That Won’t Come True General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is an Overpriced Juggernaut Recent Posts: General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is an Overpriced Juggernaut 7 Buys for 7 Donald Trump Fears That Won’t Come True Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Is STILL Cheap, Somehow View All Posts As I continue to journey through the Dow Jones Industrial Average, seeking out the stocks to buy from the venerable index, I’ve come across Boeing Co (NYSE:BA). Immediately, one of the things I like about Boeing stock is that it is part of an effective oligopoly. Source: Wikimedia There just aren’t that many large capacity passenger airplane manufacturing companies in the world. You certainly know all of them by number: 737 on through the 787. In fact, Boeing is finally re-tooling the 737 into the 737 Max. Yet that’s not the only thing BA builds that flies. It is a massive supplier of some of the most advanced military aircraft in the world. You’ve seen these on the news and in the movies, including but not limited to the Apache helicopter, Air Force One, B-1B Lancer, the famous B-52 bomber, the massive C-17 cargo plane, the Chinook helicopter and fighter planes like the F/A-18 Super Hornet, The Growler, F-15 Strike Eagle and plenty of bombs and missiles. The Backbone of Boeing Stock Boeing has also been an intrinsic part of our space program, offering satellites, the International Space Station, launch systems and space access vehicles. What Stocks Will Win the 2016 Election? Stop and think for a moment, especially next time you’re at an airport, and consider all the logistics and support services that go along with these complex machines. We’re talking support, spare parts, training, maintenance, missile and defense systems, supply chain management, engineering support … it’s mind-boggling if you think about it. The degree of complexity regarding all these products should honestly make Boeing stock owners proud. BA has been an innovator and leader, and essential to our national defense, our reach into space and our transportation network in the skies. The primary risk to BA stock is some huge change in demand for commercial aircraft, which is tied to the long-term health of the economy. When the economy was hit with its two biggest shocks — post-9/11 and during the financial crisis — Boeing stock fell 35% and 60% respectively. Both turned out to be perfect buying opportunities for BA stock because people will always need to fly. Boeing has 27% of its revenues coming from U.S. government contracts, but it seems unlikely that these contracts will be curtailed. There will always be some short-term competitive losses to other contractors, but over time, these even out.

While investors appear to be growing more optimistic, with the stock running up toward a 9 ½ month closing high in morning trade Tuesday, some analysts have expressed concern that the market for commercial widebody jets, which for Boeing include the 777 and 787 model aircrafts, has continued to act as a headwind. UBS analyst David Strauss said in a recent not to clients that “widebody demand trends have worsened” in recent months, and that he believes a 35% cut in global widebody production, as well as a 35% reduction in widebody rates, is needed to bring supply and demand back in balance. Meanwhile, here’s what analysts are expecting from Boeing’s results: Earnings: Boeing BA, -1.25%  is expected to report earnings per share of $2.61 for the quarter to Sept. 30, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet, up from $2.52 in the same period a year ago. The FactSet EPS consensus has declined over the last couple months, from $2.67 as of Aug. 31. FactSet Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts, as well as buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has a consensus EPS estimate of $2.66, based on 62 estimates. Boeing had reported a narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter, after missing expectations in the first quarter. That quarterly profit miss was the first for Boeing in over four years. Revenue: The FactSet revenue consensus is $23.6 billion, below the $25.8 billion reported a year ago. On Aug. 31, the FactSet consensus was $23.7 billion. Those crowdsourced by Estimize are projecting, on average, revenue of $23.6 billion. Boeing beat the FactSet revenue consensus the last five quarters. Stock price: Despite the recent strength, Boeing’s stock has still underperformed its peers, and the broader stock market, by a wide margin so far this year. It has lost 3.9% year to date through Tuesday, while the SPDR Industrials Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLI, +0.38%  has climbed 7.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  has gained 4.3%. Most analysts are bullish on the shares, with the average rating of 24 analysts surveyed by FactSet the equivalent of overweight. The average stock price target of $148.28 was 6.7% above current levels. Other issues: One area of focus for investors may be any commentary on the commercial cargo market, after chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said at an industry conference last month that the segment remains “flat” and would be a “continuing watch area,” according to a transcript provided by FactSet. Regarding the widebody market, Muilenberg said he was seeing more hesitation, as orders were flat. He said that was partially the result of declines in cargo traffic, as well as slow economic growth and political unrest globally. Earlier this month, Boeing announced a deal with Atlas Worldwide Holdings AAWW, -0.50%  to convert nine 767 widebody passenger planes into cargo freighters. This comes about five months after Atlas announced a deal to provide air cargo services to e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +3.36% AMZN, +3.36% Also in early October, Qatar Airways said it ordered 40 Boeing widebody jets worth $11.7 billion, and signed a letter of intent to buy up to 60 single-aisle planes worth $6.9 billion. Investors may also be keenly focused on any changes to Boeing’s financial outlook for 2016. The following table reflects the guidance Boeing provided in July. Boeing 2016 financial outlook Financial metric Boeing guidance FactSet consensus Total revenue $93.0 billion to $95.0 billion $94.0 billion Adjusted EPS $6.10 to $6.30 $6.34 Commercial airplanes deliveries 740 to 745 744 Commercial airplanes revenue $64.0 billion to $65.0 billion $64.8 billion Military aircraft revenue about $12.3 billion $12.4 billion Network & space systems revenue about $7.3 billion $7.4 billion Global services & support revenue about $9.4 billion $9.4 billion Boeing Capital revenue about $300 million $332 million Boeing Co., FactSet More from MarketWatch How I became a cyborg and joined an underground medical movement Trump-inspired bond rout may have exhausted itself—for now Donald Trump, Barack Obama Appear at White House Together Related Topics Earnings Markets U.S. Stocks Tomi Kilgore Tomi Kilgore is MarketWatch's deputy investing and corporate news editor and is based in New York.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Updated Oct. 25, 2016 at 1:53 PM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter SEATTLE, Oct. 25 (UPI) -- A Boeing training center for P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft has been installed at the U.S. Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Wash. The Navy installation is scheduled to begin receiving the aircraft beginning next year. "About 70 percent of the training we do for our P-8 crews happens in this building," said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Kyle Cozad. "That is going to make that wonderful aircraft last longer and longer. As much as 45 years." The center will use a training system that uses simulators and classroom-based materials to train pilots and mission crews to operate the aircraft, its sensors, communications and weapons systems. "Integrated, ground-based training is critical to U.S. Navy operations," said Tom Shadrach, Boeing P-8 program manager, Training Systems and Government Services. "This new facility will help to effectively and efficiently train aircrews before they ever leave the ground." Boeing currently provides P-8A aircrew training devices, electronic classrooms and courseware at its Integrated Training Center at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Fla.

The T-X programme aims to bridge the gap between primary training on the T-6 Texan II and advanced fighters such as the F-22 and F-35. Claire Apthorp takes a look at who has joined the race and what they are planning on bringing to the table. In September, Boeing and Saab revealed the design that the team will propose for the US Air Force’s (USAF’s) T-X competition: an all-new aircraft designed specifically for the programme featuring cutting-edge technologies, tools and manufacturing processes. Two aircraft were rolled out at the unveiling ceremony, showing a single engine (General Electric F404 engine), twin-tailed aircraft with advanced glass cockpit and embedded training. Few hard and fast details have been released about its capabilities by the team, but it is being hailed as an aircraft designed to evolve as technologies, missions and training needs change, while being more affordable and flexible than older, existing aircraft, including the air force’s ageing T-38 that the T-X programme is working to replace. The competition heats up Other designs have been unveiled by three teams: a team led by Raytheon including Leonardo, Honeywell Aerospace and CAE; a Lockheed Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) partnership, and a consortium headed by Northrop Grumman, including BAE Systems and L-3 Link Simulation & Training. The Raytheon team’s bid is the T-100 integrated air training system: a fully integrated flying and ground-based training system that can download training missions from frontline fighters, and embed training simulation with live virtual blended constructive capability. The aircraft is an advanced variant of the M-346, a next-generation twin-engine aircraft (powered by two F124 engines) with advanced cockpit (modern head-up display, customisable large-area display and fully-integrated helmet mounted display) and avionics emulators. Ground-based training and simulation will be powered by CAE USA. "The Lockheed Martin offering is the T-50A aircraft, building on the heritage of its T-50." The Lockheed Martin offering is the T-50A aircraft, building on the heritage of its T-50, more than 150 of which are currently in service with military forces. The system is designed to mimic the capabilities of the fifth-generation aircraft students will be training to fly, with advanced aerodynamic performance, digital flight controls/fly-by-wire, with next-generation air traffic management systems, all operating from an anthropometrically designed fifth-generation cockpit. The T-50A’s configuration is based on the FA-50 currently in production for the South Korean military. This aircraft incorporates air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons, along with an avionics suite that contains an electronic warfare suite, a multi-mode radar and an advanced data-link. The T-50A is being billed by the team as a low-risk, ready now solution. The aircraft undertook its initial flight test in June 2016, and the final assembly and check-out site is under construction in Greenville, South Carolina. Less is known about the solution that the Northrop Grumman team is set to offer. No official word has been given by company executives on the form the system will take, but it will be a purpose-built, newly designed aircraft – a so-called ‘clean sheet’ design as with the Lockheed Martin offering. Images released on social media in August showed what company officials have since confirmed is the team’s prototype aircraft undertaking high-speed taxi tests in California. The aircraft, as with the Northrop-developed T-38, is a twin-engine design with large vertical tail. Closing capability gaps The USAF plans to acquire 350 T-X trainers to replace 431 T-38s in autumn 2017. The aircraft’s initial operational capability is set for the end of 2023, at which point the new aircraft will take over the air force’s training needs for undergraduate pilot and introduction to fighter fundamentals. Ultimately the air force is looking to meet its fighter pilot training requirements more effectively and affordably while reducing inefficiencies that have crept into the T-38 Talon programme. According to Brigadier General Dawn Dunlop, the director of plans, programs and requirements at Air Education and Training Command (AETC), the T-38 is “no longer a practical trainer to prepare air force pilots for newer, more advanced aircraft” such as the F-22 and F-35. At present twelve of 18 advanced pilot training tasks cannot be completed with the T-38, meaning the AETC has to rely on fighter and bomber formal training units to complete the training at a much greater cost. Additionally, cockpit and sensor technologies have moved on in a fundamental way since the T-38 entered service with the US military in the 1960s. While upgrades have installed glass cockpits in the T-38, the programme is now seriously struggling with inabilities to upgrade the aircraft’s performance and simulated sensor capabilities to meet the needs of pilots training for fourth and fifth generation jets and teach the critical skills required. Furthermore, the T-38’s availability has been below the 75%requirement since 2011, meaning that on the whole, the aircraft is not mission-capable. Narrowing the field The road to upgrading the USAF’s fast jet training capabilities is a winding one, and the air force initially released draft requirements for the replacement aircraft in 2012. These requirements have undergone a number of iterations and refinements – closely involving industry collaboration to shape a more capable and affordable solution – with official requirements released in March 2016. Of the more than 100 requirements listed, the three key performance characteristics that will close training gaps in current capabilities are sustained G, simulator visual acuity and performance, and aircraft sustainment. "The road to upgrading the USAF’s fast jet training capabilities is a winding one." The sustained G-specific parameters have been clarified by the air force, as a minimum “threshold” requirement of 6.5G and the desired “objective” requirement of 7.5G. The understanding is that these parameters, accompanied by the other T-X requirements, will offer the necessary performance capabilities to train air force pilots well into the future.   With respect to manoeuvrability, AETC has clarified that the T-X must maintain the required load factor for a minimum of 140 degrees in a descending 180-degree turn. Initiated at or above 15,000ft pressure altitude, at or below 0.9 Mach, and at or above 80%fuel weight, the aircraft’s flight path angle during this manoeuvre can be no lower than 15 degrees nose low while losing no more than 2,000ft of vertical altitude and 10%of the initial airspeed. The embedded training element is also of note, requiring synthetic sensors and data link capabilities that will ensure the T-X aircraft very closely approximates the real platform. The final request for proposal is expected to be published before the end of 2016; what will follow remains to be seen, but with the T-X programme possibly the most prestigious and lucrative fast jet training programme underway, the stakes for all bidders are high and it’s likely to be an exciting ride.

A Boeing 787 belonging to Colombia's national airline, Avianca, flying from Madrid to Bogotá with some 200 passengers aboard was cruising at high altitude in Venezuelan airspace on Friday night when a military plane was spotted on radar a short distance away, the Colombian Defense Ministry said in a statement. The Avianca pilot, who notified Colombian aviation authorities about the plane, was forced to divert sharply from the flight path before the military aircraft peeled off. The jetliner resumed its course about four minutes later. Venezuelan air defense authorities told their Colombian counterparts that the military aircraft was on a routine patrol; however, Colombia’s Defense Minister wants a better answer. Luis Carlos Villegas, who discussed the incident with Venezuela’s Defense Minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino on Saturday, said he has asked his country’s Foreign Ministry to demand a formal explanation for the “routine patrol.” The Colombian Defense Ministry said the two men did agree to strengthen their early warning communications systems. Venezuelan officials had not commented publicly on the incident, which comes during a tension-filled standoff between the country's President Nicolás Maduro and his opponents over the government's decision to suspend a recall referendum against the embattled socialist leader. Maduro frequently accuses neighboring Colombia of plotting with his critics to undermine his rule. Relations between the two nations have been hit by a number of crises over the past decade as Venezuela has taken on a more leftist, anti-American role in the region, something that sets the country in opposition to Colombia's traditionally staunch support for the United States. Maduro, who is on a multi-nation tour of the Middle East, personally ordered an investigation, the Colombian Defense Ministry said. Avianca briefly halted flights to Caracas and said it would reroute several flights to avoid Venezuelan airspace. But on Saturday it issued a statement saying it would resume flights to Venezuela on Sunday “following clarifications between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela.” Colombians across the political spectrum expressed alarm, attributing political overtones to the incident. "These maneuvers put in serious risk the lives of the passengers on the plane," said Rodrigo Lara, president of the Radical Change party. "It's more evidence of the unpredictability of Nicolás Maduro's government." Avianca is one of the few foreign airlines still serving Caracas after a number of carriers slashed service or stopped selling tickets in the country because Maduro's government, facing a severe cash crunch triggered by low oil prices, hasn't allowed the companies to repatriate some $3.8 billion in funds held in the country. The Associated Press and EFE contributed to this report.

The Waltham, Massachusetts-based defense and technology company announced Monday that it has a shovel-ready site in Meridian. Raytheon's space and airborne systems division headquarters is in McKinney. "We anticipate the Meridian facility will create hundreds of new jobs," spokesman B.J. Boling said in an email. A Raytheon radar factory in Forest, Mississippi, has about 800 employees, according to a news release from Mississippi's congressional delegation. Three other international partnerships are competing: Northrop Grumman Corp. and BAE Systems; Boeing and Saab AB; and Lockheed Martin and Korean Aerospace Industries Ltd. Raytheon's principal partners are Leonardo-Finmeccanica, CAE USA and Honeywell Aerospace. The Air Force has said it expects to award contracts next fall. It is expected to formally ask for proposals in December, Boling wrote. Boeing and Northrop Grumman say they have built all-new planes for the competition. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon say their entries are upgrades of existing planes. The Air Force released requirements for what it calls the T-X trainer project in March. The current trainer, Northrop Grumman's T-38, was first built in 1961. It can be used to teach only six of 18 advanced pilot training tasks, and fewer than 75 percent of the 431 planes are usable, the Air Force said. "New, cutting-edge training aircraft are critical to our national security, and I am confident that Mississippi workers can help provide those planes," U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its defense subcommittee, said in the delegation's news release. "I look forward to this competition and I am excited that Meridian may play an expanded role in defense of our nation." Other members of Mississippi's delegation were equally enthusiastic. "Mississippi's talent base is as skilled and prepared for high-tech manufacturing jobs as any in the nation and this is further proof of that," said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat.

The use of two 23-year-old Boeing 757-200s have again come under scrutiny from deputy leader Ron Mark after one broke down en route to India where Mr Key is set to hold a number of high level meetings, including with his counterpart Narendra Modi. The Boeing was scheduled for only brief stopover in Australia but developed mechanical problems in Townsville meaning Mr Key and his delegation was forced to stay the night and wait for a replacement plane. It has been slated for replacement, but Mr Mark says the Defence Force shouldn't have to foot the bill. "If the Prime Minister wants 'PM 1' then his own department should fund the $140 million it will cost for something like an Airbus A320 instead of the New Zealand Defence Force," he said. "Alternatively, we have an award-winning state airline that can do that job by charter or by buying a seat like the rest of us." Mr Mark said the plane flew just 571 flight hours between January 2013 and September 2015, a fifth of what a commercial plane would do. "It sounds counter-intuitive, but aircraft are much easier to maintain if they're kept flying than sitting on the tarmac," he said, highlighting his concerns about commercial jets flying too few hours in military service. It's not the first time in recent months the PM has had plane trouble. One of the 757s was grounded for several hours in Laos last month after Mr Key attended the East Asia Summit. The plane was flown to Guam for repairs while Mr Key attended the Pacific Islands Forum before returning to New Zealand.

Back To Top[*] Boeing takes on peers, partners in bid for replacement parts business Oct. 25, 2016 - 06:00AM JST In search of higher profits margins, Boeing Co is aiming to win more of the lucrative market for replacement parts and repair services, pitting the plane maker against major suppliers who view that growing $62 billion a year market as their turf. Boeing told Reuters it has added 35,000 parts to stocks it positions around the world to serve airlines in the last year, after analyzing its vast store of aircraft data to see where the parts will be needed. It has also cut prices on 24,000 parts to be more competitive, and it is expanding training and other services. Boeing is trying to capture more profit from spare parts made under license by suppliers as well. To get there, it is producing some new parts in house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. The maker of such flagship jets as the 787 Dreamliner and top-selling 737 has been building its aftermarket business for years. But as demand for planes has slowed over the last 18 months, Boeing is now turning more aggressively to spare parts and services to help meet its own ambitious targets of doubling overall margins to the mid-teens by 2020. The main reason: a dollar of added aftermarket sales is more valuable than a dollar of new aircraft sales. Boeing’s aftermarket sales have risen over the last three years and are outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters. “That means we’re taking market share,” he said. Boeing’s effort is ratcheting up competition with many of its biggest suppliers, including Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp and Rockwell Collins Inc, and repair operations such as Delta Air Lines Inc Technical Operations and Lufthansa Technik - which are all taking action to defend their lucrative franchises. Aftermarket sales typically offer margins of 20 percent or more - which makes expanding its presence in that market crucial to Boeing’s effort to hit Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg’s overall profitability goal, analysts say. Boeing doesn’t break out aftermarket revenue, and has not publicly discussed its aftermarket strategy in detail. Analysts estimate parts and services generate about $15 billion a year, or nearly 16 percent of Boeing’s $96 billion in annual sales, split roughly evenly between its commercial aircraft and defense businesses. Industry experts say Boeing aims to more than triple aftermarket sales to as much as $50 billion over the next 10 years. Boeing declined to confirm a specific target, but the company’s “leadership has set high aspirations,” Floyd said. “We are investing heavily into these businesses.” Boeing has logged its largest number of orders for its “GoldCare” aircraft maintenance service this year, and now counts 60 customers and 2,200 planes in the program. “We’re seeing the returns on these investments,” Floyd said. Boeing partners with the likes of Honeywell Aerospace to do some repairs. But both are trying to increase their own sales of repairs and parts to airlines. That’s why the two manufacturing heavyweights are “competimates,” said Mike Beazley, vice president of aftermarket sales at Honeywell. “There’s a segment of the market that will pay a premium to deal with one company” through Boeing GoldCare, he said. But many “would still like to have a direct relationship with the biggest suppliers.” At Honeywell Aerospace’s 360,000 square-foot aftermarket center in Phoenix, the largest of its 40 repair stations around the globe, Andrew Newingham recently circled a small auxiliary aircraft engine on his workbench. As a robotic voice called out questions and Newingham answered, a computer logged details about what work the engine needed, reducing to minutes what was formerly an hours-long task involving paper checklists and typing on a computer. Honeywell aims to cut engine repair times to 20 calendar days or less, and offers upgrades and enhancements when engines come in for repairs. “What keeps us competitive and allows us to win new business is being able to offer speed,” said Steve Foust, senior plant director. Repair organizations also are reacting as Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE try to grab business. Boeing partners with Lufthansa Technik on some services. But it also undercuts Lufthansa on others. Low-cost, long-haul airline Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA , for example, considered several service groups, including Lufthansa Technik. In the end it picked GoldCare to maintain its 737 MAX and 787 jets, Asgeir Nyseth, chief operating officer of Norwegian Group, said in an interview. Boeing’s service “was the cheapest one,” he said, adding Norwegian benefited from the increased competition Boeing provided. Boeing and Airbus “have the advantage that they can combine an after-sale service package with the sale of the aircraft,” said Lufthansa Technik’s Frank Berweger, senior vice president of corporate sales for the Americas. In part to counter the aircraft makers, Lufthansa Technik plans to quadruple investment in research and product development to 200 million euros ($219.52 million) to 2018 from 2015, on top of increased spending on tooling and training to service new Boeing and Airbus jetliner types. Engine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as General Electric Co and Pratt & Whitney locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, says Boeing will find it difficult to capture $50 billion in services revenue annually—not to mention making a profit—given the strength of some of the suppliers and specialist service companies. “Boeing has to be agile and cost competitive enough to win business from established players,” Michaels said. “They need to be entrepreneurial. That’s a challenge.”  Back To Top[*] Switch to full browser version © 2016 GPlusMedia

But investors and industry experts voiced skepticism about the deal, sending Rockwell's stock down 6.9 percent to $78.63, while B/E Aerospace shares rose 15.5 percent to $58.44, reflecting the bid premium. Rockwell's acquisition, announced on Sunday, would triple its sales of equipment in new-generation widebody jetliners such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, and "nearly double our position in the narrowbodies," Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said on a conference call with analysts, referring to top-selling jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The companies have little product overlap, with Rockwell best known for avionics, flight controls and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems. But Rockwell's plan to wire digital sensors and electronics into the galleys, lavatories and seats that B/E Aerospace drew some skepticism from industry experts. Lavatories and galleys are not items airlines typically use as selling points to customers. "If you're making a lavatory higher tech, it's got to improve customers experience or reduce cost," said Phil Toy, a managing director at aerospace consulting firm AlixPartners. The combination is expected to produce annual cost savings of $160 million, with 90 percent captured in the first full year, and provide a double-digit percentage boost to per-share earnings in the first full year, the companies said. Rockwell's acquisition - which is expected to be completed next spring - also underscores rising competition for lucrative aftermarket sales, which involves spare parts and services, a business that Boeing and Airbus also are pursuing. Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins could benefit as leases expire on numerous widebody aircraft and the planes need interior upgrades that B/E Aerospace provides. B/E Aerospace earned 40 percent of its 2015 revenue from aftermarket sales and 23 percent from business jet sales. Aftermarket sales also would help offset weakness in other parts of the combined company. Rockwell sees sales to business jet and regional jet makers falling 10 percent to 15 percent in fiscal year 2017.

Posted 24 Oct 2016 22:00 Updated 24 Oct 2016 22:55 Cockpit equipment made by Rockwell Collins and used in a CH-47 Chinook helicopter is pictured at the ILA Berlin Air Show in Schoenefeld, south of Berlin, Germany, June 1, 2016. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Aircraft electronics supplier Rockwell Collins said on Monday its acquisition of B/E Aerospace Inc will triple its sales of equipment in new-generation widebody jetliners such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350. "And it will nearly double our position in the narrowbodies," Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said on a conference call with analysts, referring to top-selling jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The US$6.4 billion deal announced on Sunday would position Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins to benefit from anticipated demand growth in the aftermarket, which involves spare parts and service. For example, as leases expire on numerous widebody aircraft, planes will need the interior upgrades that B/E Aerospace provides. Aftermarket sales would help offset weakness in other parts of the combined company. Rockwell sees sales to business jet and regional jet makers falling 10 percent to 15 percent in fiscal year 2017. Sales to business jet manufacturers will fall 15 percent to 20 percent in fiscal year 2017, Ortberg said. The decline will be greater than the anticipated drop in business jet sales because of aircraft already in the production pipeline, he said. "There's pretty significant amount of inventory in the system," he said. B/E Aerospace earned 40 percent of its 2015 revenue from aftermarket sales, and 23 percent from business jet sales. Rockwell's acquisition - which is expected to be completed next spring - also underscores the rising competition for lucrative aftermarket sales, a business that Boeing and Airbus also are pursuing.

That said, the long lead time before implementation, opportunity for market participants to respond to the proposal, and diversity of aircraft financing sources offer multiple avenues to manage the potential impact. The proposal is part of broad reforms to the risk-weighted asset (RWA) framework, commonly referred to as the "Basel IV" reforms. These proposals would require banks to adopt either a revised standardized approach or supervisory slotting approach for object finance, which includes aircraft/shipping finance and commodities finance. Specialized lending describes forms of financing where the repayment of the bank loan depends on the cash flows generated by specific assets that are financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. Aircraft lessors, unrated/low-rated airlines and other secured borrowers could be more adversely affected than more highly rated unsecured borrowers under the current revised standardized approach proposals. An airline operator without security on an aircraft would get a lower risk weight (100%) than object financing with a first-lien on the aircraft (120%). The revised standardized approach proposals also do not differentiate among aircraft types, even though Fitch has found young/in-demand aircraft tend to remain more liquid and secondary market pricing is more predictable, even during times of economic distress. In response, the Aviation Working Group -- an organization of aircraft manufacturers, lessors and financial institutions -- noted in early 2016 letter that the flat risk weight for aircraft-backed loans is "vastly out of proportion with transactional risk and loss data." Manufacturers are prepared to continue lobbying behalf of banks, according to Airbus. Borrowers currently benefit from healthy access to aircraft financing from multiple sources, including the capital markets (unsecured notes, EETCs and ABS), commercial banks, insurance companies, and certain export credit agencies (ECAs). According to Boeing, bank debt represented 28% of $122 billion of commercial aviation financing in 2015 and is expected to represent 27% of $127 billion of financing in 2016. While Basel has yet to provide a final implementation date, Basel IV compliance is expected by the beginning of 2019. U.S. agencies have not yet signaled whether they will adopt the guidelines but have exhibited generally exhibited a highly conservative approach toward bank regulation post-crisis. Borrowers may use the transition period to further expand relationships with new lending vehicles should banks reduce their aviation lending appetite. Currently, banks do not appear to be materially reducing their specialized lending exposures because of regulatory requirements, but Fitch believes banks may expand their capital markets/syndication capabilities and focus more on rated corporate debt over time. This shift could be more pronounced for U.S. and European banks relative to Asian banks, which already tend to use the standardized approach for object finance. China and Japan are expected to be the two largest country sources of bank debt for commercial aircraft deliveries in 2016, according to Boeing, representing 29% and 15%, respectively. Asian banks have been active in the aviation industry for many years through lending and aircraft ownership. Aircraft finance is also growing business for Gulf Coast banks. One trend that may mitigate the impact of Basel's proposals is the continued ratification of the Cape Town Convention. The treaty has positively affected the aircraft finance industry, with ECAs granting a fee discount to borrowers in countries that have ratified the treaty. Certain ECAs and other non-banks may remain active even if banks reduce their aviation exposures. Additional information is available on www.fitchratings.com.

Yesterday a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Boeing 757 flew 81 scientific and support personnel and about three tonnes of baggage and equipment that are needed to support the New Zealand and United States Antarctic research programmes. It was the NZDF’s first strategic airlift support flight to the continent for the 2016-17 summer season. Lieutenant Commander Ross Hickey, the NZDF’s Senior National Officer on the continent, said two more RNZAF Boeing flights are scheduled before the end of October to take another 100 people to Scott Base and McMurdo Station. Further flights will be made from late November by the C-130 Hercules, the workhorses of the RNZAF. “For the past 51 years the NZDF has been contributing to the lifeline of support for New Zealand and American scientists working in Antarctica,” Major General Tim Gall, the Commander Joint Forces New Zealand, said. “Every year, our aircraft support the Antarctic research programmes by bringing about 330 scientists and other personnel and almost 40 tonnes of equipment needed to carry out vital research on the continent,” MAJGEN Gall said. Antarctica New Zealand Chief Executive Peter Beggs said the significant contribution of the NZDF demonstrated the collaborative nature of Antarctic research and logistics. “NZDF support is an integral part of New Zealand’s strategic leadership both on the Antarctic continent and in the Southern Ocean and we are grateful for the level of professionalism under which these personnel operate,” Mr Beggs said. The NZDF also provides search and rescue support, air transport, terminal operations at Harewood Terminal in Christchurch and McMurdo, and support for the unloading of the annual container ship. Up to 220 NZDF staff - including air crew and ground support, passenger and cargo facilitation, logistics, fuel specialists, Army engineers and heavy plant operators, cargo handlers and communications specialists - are deployed during the summer to support the Scott Base and McMurdo stations. The 2016-17 research season marks the 60th anniversary of New Zealand’s operational presence in Antarctica and the construction of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition Hut.

Boeing told Reuters it has added 35,000 parts to stocks it positions around the world to serve airlines in the last year, after analyzing its vast store of aircraft data to see where the parts will be needed. It has also cut prices on 24,000 parts to be more competitive, and it is expanding training and other services. Boeing is trying to capture more profit from spare parts made under license by suppliers as well. To get there, it is producing some new parts in house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. The maker of such flagship jets as the 787 Dreamliner and top-selling 737 has been building its aftermarket business for years. But as demand for planes has slowed over the last 18 months, Boeing is now turning more aggressively to spare parts and services to help meet its own ambitious targets of doubling overall margins to the mid-teens by 2020. The main reason: a dollar of added aftermarket sales is more valuable than a dollar of new aircraft sales. Boeing’s aftermarket sales have risen over the last three years and are outpacing the 4.5 percent growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters. “That means we’re taking market share,” he said. Boeing’s effort is ratcheting up competition with many of its biggest suppliers, including Honeywell International Inc , United Technologies Corp and Rockwell Collins Inc, and repair operations such as Delta Air Lines Inc Technical Operations and Lufthansa Technik – which are all taking action to defend their lucrative franchises. Aftermarket sales typically offer margins of 20 percent or more – which makes expanding its presence in that market crucial to Boeing’s effort to hit Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg’s overall profitability goal, analysts say. Boeing doesn’t break out aftermarket revenue, and has not publicly discussed its aftermarket strategy in detail. Analysts estimate parts and services generate about $15 billion a year, or nearly 16 percent of Boeing’s $96 billion in annual sales, split roughly evenly between its commercial aircraft and defense businesses. Industry experts say Boeing aims to more than triple aftermarket sales to as much as $50 billion over the next 10 years. Boeing declined to confirm a specific target, but the company’s “leadership has set high aspirations,” Floyd said. “We are investing heavily into these businesses.” Boeing has logged its largest number of orders for its “GoldCare” aircraft maintenance service this year, and now counts 60 customers and 2,200 planes in the program. “We’re seeing the returns on these investments,” Floyd said. “COMPETIMATES” Boeing partners with the likes of Honeywell Aerospace to do some repairs. But both are trying to increase their own sales of repairs and parts to airlines. That’s why the two manufacturing heavyweights are “competimates,” said Mike Beazley, vice president of aftermarket sales at Honeywell. “There’s a segment of the market that will pay a premium to deal with one company” through Boeing GoldCare, he said. But many “would still like to have a direct relationship with the biggest suppliers.” At Honeywell Aerospace’s 360,000 square-foot aftermarket center in Phoenix, the largest of its 40 repair stations around the globe, Andrew Newingham recently circled a small auxiliary aircraft engine on his workbench. As a robotic voice called out questions and Newingham answered, a computer logged details about what work the engine needed, reducing to minutes what was formerly an hours-long task involving paper checklists and typing on a computer. Honeywell aims to cut engine repair times to 20 calendar days or less, and offers upgrades and enhancements when engines come in for repairs. “What keeps us competitive and allows us to win new business is being able to offer speed,” said Steve Foust, senior plant director. WINNING ON PRICE Repair organizations also are reacting as Boeing and its European rival Airbus Group SE try to grab business. Boeing partners with Lufthansa Technik on some services. But it also undercuts Lufthansa on others. Low-cost, long-haul airline Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA , for example, considered several service groups, including Lufthansa Technik. In the end it picked GoldCare to maintain its 737 MAX and 787 jets, Asgeir Nyseth, chief operating officer of Norwegian Group, said in an interview. Boeing’s service “was the cheapest one,” he said, adding Norwegian benefited from the increased competition Boeing provided. Boeing and Airbus “have the advantage that they can combine an after-sale service package with the sale of the aircraft,” said Lufthansa Technik’s Frank Berweger, senior vice president of corporate sales for the Americas. In part to counter the aircraft makers, Lufthansa Technik plans to quadruple investment in research and product development to 200 million euros ($219.52 million) to 2018 from 2015, on top of increased spending on tooling and training to service new Boeing and Airbus jetliner types. Engine repairs make up nearly half of the service market, but those are largely beyond the reach of Boeing or Airbus. Engine makers such as General Electric Co and Pratt & Whitney locked up their aftermarket more than a decade ago. Kevin Michaels, president of consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, says Boeing will find it difficult to capture $50 billion in services revenue annually — not to mention making a profit — given the strength of some of the suppliers and specialist service companies. “Boeing has to be agile and cost competitive enough to win business from established players,” Michaels said. “They need to be entrepreneurial. That’s a challenge.” (Reuters) Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags AeroDynamics Advisory Boeing Boeing Co General Electric Kevin Michaels Previous England secure thrilling first Test victory Next AEK juggernaut in five-star show against AEZ Related Articles Google releases app to digitize boxes of old photo prints November 15, 2016 Electric Jaguar SUV highlights auto industry’s cross currents November 15, 2016 German economic growth slows more than expected in Q3 November 15, 2016 French oil major Total to install solar panels at 5,000 service stations November 15, 2016 Oil prices rise on falling shale output, renewed hopes of OPEC cut November 15, 2016 EasyJet profit falls as currency and security woes take toll November 15, 2016 From planes to trains, Lufthansa chefs cater to broader audience November 14, 2016 Siemens to buy Mentor Graphics in $4.5 billion cash deal November 14, 2016 PM May says to be “unashamedly pro-business” November 14, 2016 Check Also China’s Xi tells Trump cooperation is only choice Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President-elect Donald Trump that cooperation was the only choice for relations between the world's two largest economies, with Trump saying the two had established a "clear sense of mutual respect".

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 24 October 2016 | MYT 1:35 PM Boeing takes on peers, partners in bid for replacement parts business by alwyn scott PHOENIX: In search of higher profits margins, Boeing Co is aiming to win more of the lucrative market for replacement parts and repair services, pitting the plane maker against major suppliers who view that growing US$62 billion a year market as their turf. Boeing told Reuters it has added 35,000 parts to stocks it positions around the world to serve airlines in the last year, after analysing its vast store of aircraft data to see where the parts will be needed. It has also cut prices on 24,000 parts to be more competitive, and it is expanding training and other services. Boeing is trying to capture more profit from spare parts made under licence by suppliers as well. To get there, it is producing some new parts in-house to gain control over repairs, and sifting its databases to help airlines predict when planes will need service. The maker of such flagship jets as the 787 Dreamliner and top-selling 737 has been building its aftermarket business for years. But as demand for planes has slowed over the last 18 months, Boeing is now turning more aggressively to spare parts and services to help meet its own ambitious targets of doubling overall margins to the mid-teens by 2020. The main reason: a dollar of added aftermarket sales is more valuable than a dollar of new aircraft sales. Boeing's aftermarket sales have risen over the last three years and are outpacing the 4.5% growth of the broad aftermarket, Dennis Floyd, vice-president of services strategy and business development at Boeing, told Reuters. "That means we're taking market share," he said. Boeing's effort is ratcheting up competition with many of its biggest suppliers, including Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp and Rockwell Collins Inc, and repair operations such as Delta Air Lines Inc Technical Operations and Lufthansa Technik - which are all taking action to defend their lucrative franchises. Aftermarket sales typically offer margins of 20% or more - which makes expanding its presence in that market crucial to Boeing's effort to hit chief executive Dennis Muilenburg's overall profitability goal, analysts say. Boeing doesn't break out aftermarket revenue, and has not publicly discussed its aftermarket strategy in detail. Analysts estimate parts and services to generate about US$15 billion a year, or nearly 16% of Boeing's US$96 billion in annual sales, split roughly evenly between its commercial aircraft and defense businesses. Industry experts say Boeing aims to more than triple aftermarket sales to as much as US$50 billion over the next 10 years. Boeing declined to confirm a specific target, but the company's "leadership has set high aspirations," Floyd said. "We are investing heavily into these businesses."  Boeing has logged its largest number of orders for its "GoldCare" aircraft maintenance service this year, and now counts 60 customers and 2,200 planes in the program. "We're seeing the returns on these investments," Floyd said. "COMPETIMATES"  Boeing partners with the likes of Honeywell Aerospace to do some repairs. But both are trying to increase their own sales of repairs and parts to airlines.  That's why the two manufacturing heavyweights are "competimates," said Mike Beazley, vice-president of aftermarket sales at Honeywell. "There's a segment of the market that will pay a premium to deal with one company" through Boeing GoldCare, he said. But many "would still like to have a direct relationship with the biggest suppliers."  At Honeywell Aerospace's 360,000-sq-ft aftermarket centre in Phoenix, the largest of its 40 repair stations around the globe, Andrew Newingham recently circled a small auxiliary aircraft engine on his workbench. As a robotic voice called out questions and Newingham answered, a computer logged details about what work the engine needed, reducing to minutes what was formerly an hours-long task involving paper checklists and typing on a computer. Honeywell aims to cut engine repair times to 20 calendar days or less, and offers upgrades and enhancements when engines come in for repairs. "What keeps us competitive and allows us to win new business is being able to offer speed," said Steve Foust, senior plant director.

B/E Aerospace investors will get $34.10 in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, for a total consideration of $62 a share, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That’s a 23% premium over B/E Aerospace’s closing price on Friday. With the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt, the purchase comes to $8.3 billion, according to the statement. The deal, which is slated to close in early 2017, is the latest in a spate of mergers involving suppliers to Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE as the commercial aircraft industry braces for slower growth following a decade-long sales cycle. Shares of Rockwell Collins have fallen 8.5% this year. With the deal, Rockwell Collins vastly broadens a product portfolio that has been centered on aircraft communications and computing equipment since the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company was spun out of Rockwell International in 2001.

On a pro-forma basis, the combined manufacturer would have almost 30,000 employees, $8.1 billion in revenue and $1.9 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, debt and amortization for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2016. “This transformational acquisition is consistent with our strategy to accelerate growth and build value through market-leading positions in cockpit and cabin solutions,” Kelly Ortberg, chief executive officer of Rockwell Collins, said in the statement. “We see tremendous opportunity to better serve our commercial aviation, business jet and military customers through broader offerings.” The boards of both companies have approved the transaction, which will still need to pass muster with shareholders. Although there is little apparent overlap in the two companies’ product portfolios, Rockwell Collins has identified $160 million in potential synergies, the companies said. Werner Lieberherr, B/E Aerospace’s chief executive, will be named executive vice-president and chief operating officer of a newly created aircraft interiors division after the merger closes. Fourth-Quarter Earnings Separately, Rockwell Collins said profit from continuing operations in its fiscal fourth quarter rose to $1.58 a share, up from $1.38 a year earlier. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $1.57, according to the average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the period rose 4.4% from a year earlier to $1.45 billion, trailing the average analyst estimate of $1.48 billion. Equipment sales were hurt by lower planemaker production rates, including Airbus’s A330 widebody jetliner, the company said. For its 2017 fiscal year, the company said it expects revenue between $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion -- that’s on a standalone basis, and doesn’t account for the deal with B/E Aerospace.

Boeing, Coca-Cola and dozens of others report earnings ahead of the opening bell. Apple, which reported after the bell Tuesday, was a negative factor for stock futures in late trading. The stock was down around 3 percent after it reported a decline in profits and revenues. Apple, the biggest U.S. company, can easily impact sentiment. "I think it's psychologically very important," said Don Townswick, director of equities at Conning. "Apple earnings are almost more important for the overall market than they are for Apple." Apple net income slid nearly 20 percent to $9 billion, but earnings per share beat forecasts by a penny at $1.67. The market focused on revenues of $46.9 billion, just below consensus of $46.94 billion. Sales of the company's iPhone were 45.5 million, more than the 44.8 million expected but shipments of Mac computers were below consensus. There is also oil inventory data Wednesday morning at 10:30 a.m. EDT, and if American Petroleum Institute's late Tuesday report is a guide, there could be a bigger-than-expected build in inventories, a bearish trend. The API data showed a 4.8 million barrel increase in crude supply in the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude sank closer to $49, after earlier closing down 1.1 percent at $49.96 per barrel, below $50 for the first time since Oct. 17. "I was expecting 2.4 million. It looks like imports rebounded by a good amount," said John Kilduff of Again Capital. Oil was lower earlier Tuesday on increasing doubt that OPEC and other oil producers will be able to make a deal to curb production and stabilize oil prices. "At some point you had to expect the market to call them out on what they're doing or not doing. Their deeds again just don't match their words, almost to a member. At some point, the rhetoric game gets played out," said Kilduff. He noted there were reports that an unnamed Russian official said that country would not cut production. There is also a $34 billion five-year note auction Wednesday, and it's being watched carefully after a soft two-year auction Tuesday. Strategists said some of the weakness — and rise in rates — had to do with anticipation about the Fed's November meeting next week. "How much do they emphasize a December rate hike? I think it's pretty much priced in and barring a disaster, they're looking for that one rate hike in 2016," said Cantor Fitzgerald rate strategist Justin Lederer. The market expects the Fed to stay on hold at the November meeting but to hike for the second time in 10 years in December, if the economy remains on track. "I don't think you're really going to see rates spike higher on this. It's not like it was a year ago when you had December hike, and the Fed was looking for four this year," he said. "Here we are and the trajectory is very shallow. Before an election, I don't think they want to see anything crazy going on, before the election." Next week's Fed meeting is six days before the presidential election, and that's one reason economists expect the Fed to wait until December. "I think the Fed being where they are now has hurt economic activity. They've sapped confidence," said Townswick. "I hope they start to raise and after the election, they don't have to be accused of politicking or either being accused of causing a recession or causing a candidate to lose." Meanwhile, earnings have been a mixed catalyst with Procter & Gamble, for instance, jumping on its report Tuesday, but fellow Dow stock 3M fell sharply on its earnings. Besides Boeing and P&G, earnings expected Wednesday morning include CNBC parent Comcast, Norfolk Southern, Northrop Grumman, GlaxoSmithKline, Ingersoll-Rand, Nasdaq, State Street, Southwest Air, Nintendo, WR Grace, Bayer and Boston Scientific. Texas Instruments, Tesla, F5 Networks, VMWare, Shutterfly, Rent-A-Center, Ocwen, Raymond James, Buffalo Wild Wings, Groupon, Samsung and dozens of others report after the closing bell. Earnings are expected to grow by 1.7 percent for the third quarter, based on results of S&P 500 companies so far and estimates, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue growth is expected at 2.7 percent. Of the 150 S&P companies reporting as of Tuesday morning, 75 percent beat earnings estimates and 59 percent have beaten revenue estimates. There is also international trade at 8:30 a.m. EDT, Services PMI at 9:45 a.m. and new home sales at 10 a.m. Patti DommCNBC Executive News Editor SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

The world's largest defense contractor also surprised analysts with a forecast for stronger 2016 results following the $4.6 billion spinoff of an information technology unit in August. Profit is expected to be about $12.10 a share, compared with a July forecast ranging from $11.15 to $11.45 a share, the Bethesda, Md.-based company said in a statement Tuesday. Sales will expand about 7 percent next year, Lockheed said. "Their outlook for 7 percent revenue growth next year is pretty impressive," Douglas Rothacker, an aerospace and defense analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said by phone. "Granted, not many have given 2017 outlooks yet, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a defense contractor generating growth like that." VIDEOS TOP JOBS The stock rose 5.6 percent to $245.17 at 11:07 a.m. in New York after surging as much as 5.9 percent, the biggest intraday increase since April 2009. Hewson bolstered Lockheed's holdings over the past year by buying United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky helicopter division and increasing a stake in the U.K.'s nuclear deterrent program by 18 percent. The results set the stage for Lockheed peers General Dynamics Corp., Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Raytheon Co., which are scheduled to report earnings later this week. While the new Lockheed is coming into sharper focus, there are still several key unknown elements that may shape year-end totals, starting with continuing negotiations for the largest low-rate initial production F-35 contracts. If talks wrap up this year as Pentagon officials have suggested, Lockheed's cash from operations for the year would be greater than $5.7 billion, the company said. If collection slips into 2017, the total would be about $700 million less. Production has continued on the contracts initially authorized in 2014 and 2015. The company said it has about $950 million of cash exposure and $2.3 billion in termination liability exposure. Quarterly projections were "muddied by a range of methodologies" that analysts used to model results amid several moving parts, said Jason Gursky, a senior analyst at Citigroup. The largest and most complex: the impact of the $4.6 billion spinoff of Lockheed's IT division to Leidos Holdings through a tax-free transaction, he said in an Oct. 9 report. Accounting rules require Lockheed to update its full-year guidance as if the technology and services business had been "gone all year, partially offset by the share retirement" from the transaction, Gursky wrote. Company executives had suggested that they would lower the 2016 forecast since the former business contributed about $1 a share to earnings. Adjusted third-quarter earnings rose to $3.61 a share, handily exceeding the $2.89-a-share average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales reached $11.6 billion, while analysts expected $11.5 billion. The results reflected a 34 cent non-cash gain as Lockheed increased its ownership stake in AWE Management Ltd. to 51 percent, and about a 19 cent benefit for a lower-than-anticipated income tax rate, Douglas Harned, a defense analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co., said in a report to clients. Sales this year are projected to increase to $46.5 billion, up from an earlier prediction of $46 billion to $46.2 billion.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Audit: Utah athletics can improve financial, hiring and inventory practices Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

Now we start to pretend. First we pretend that the USAF is profoundly concerned with price. That despite half a century of profligacy, cost overruns, lower numbers of planes produced, sub-specification outcomes, and of very cosy relationships - of the fox guarding the fiscal hen house - it is a reformed and repentant organization. Second we have to pretend that the "winning" bid was not submitted and received with an exchange of winks. Third we will pretend everything is going well until, surprise, the program which is now too far along to cancel, is running late and well over budget. Then we have to pretend that the contract renegotiations are not just the legalizing of the fraud sealed with winks when the winner was chosen. Then we will pretend that it really doesn't matter that the cost overruns mean we will not be getting all of the aircraft we thought we would be getting for half what we end up paying. Then we will pretend not to notice when the contractor shells out big "performance" bonuses while the Generals retire to cozy well paid positions in the Defense industry. Lets all practice pretending it isn't so. We might as well pretend it isn't so because it is and there is nothing we can do about it.

But keeping the relevant facts only to those who work on the program (a) encourages speculative assessments, and (b) reduces the likelihood that the B-21 will survive fiscally.

I cannot believe how much whining there is in these comments, nearly every story has whiners, it's annoying. I thought AWST was a forum for those who love aviation. Log In or Register to post comments Rabbit1960 on Oct 26, 2016 The USAF doesn't care about costs? See the ongoing controversy regarding the A-10. The Air Force doesn't have the personnel to maintain the A-10 while ramping up the F-35. If money was no object, they'd do both - as it is, we have Congress ordering them to do both while not providing any additional money to make that possible. The USAF cares very much about costs, because lack of money has real world consequences. We are clearly seeing the effects of a limited budget. Log In or Register to post comments sugerde1@gmail.com on Oct 26, 2016 I'm not quite sure where you get your attitude from, or your opinion of NG's capability, but you're way off base. As a previous 32 year employee of NG who was directly involved at various levels as a Production Manufacturing & Procurement Field Engineer supporting the supplier base on almost every program to include unmanned vehicles, the F5/T38/F20, F17/F18, B2, E2C/D, A6/EA6B, F14, and JSTARS programs (just to name a few) the company's drive was always to Quality 1st, Cost Control and Schedule. Don't even want to hear about the 2-B per copy on the B2 as that was Congress' doing - not NG's, by keeping the production line open for so many years and reducing the production lot to 21 vehicles then dividing the total program cost over them (and letting NG take the heat for the cost). I may no longer be a company employee but I'll stack up NG's performance against those of Boeing (P8, Tanker, 787) & Lockheed's (C5, F22, F35) any day of the week. And before you start, the C17, F15/F18 were McDonnell/NG programs acquired by Boeing and the F16 was General Dynamics acquired by Lockheed. Neither of these company's could have developed these successful programs on their own. Badger 1 Log In or Register to post comments Ubonspecfixr on Oct 26, 2016 VERY well stated ! I am a former employee of both Northrop and Lockheed ( B-2 and SR-71, L-1011 ) so I won't say that Lockheed sucks, but Northrop still has an everyday ethics focus that Lockheed never had, outside the Skunk Works. GD F-16 and Northrop F-18 forever ! Log In or Register to post comments Geronime on Oct 27, 2016 I totally agree with sugarde1@gmail.com's statement: it "was Congress' doing - not NG's [or fill in the blank for any other contractor] by keeping the production line open for so many years and[/or] reducing the production lot to ... [x many] ... vehicles then dividing the total program cost over them (and letting NG [or fill in the blank for any other contractor] take the heat for the cost)." Congress = Irrationally! But, then again, Congress = A Hell of a lot more intelligent than our current POTUS. (I really hate to think what are next POTUS – Hillaby – will be like!) Log In or Register to post comments stephenbar2001 on Oct 28, 2016 Right on the money! I was hoping someone would mention Boeing's track record!!! I have grown to accept the F-22 because it appears to kill the F-15 pretty dramatically and could still be better than the soviet T-50, if the integration of monitoring systems and flight controls are accurate. I don't think the Soviets are very good at that sort of integration.--time will tell. But, if we are going to build "another" high tech bomber, and the U.S. is the ONLY country to still be doing this, then the company that built the last one should have a lot more knowledge and expertise to build the next one. Especially since they both are going to share similar shapes and technology--just a longer range and progressively higher tech!

Log In or Register to post comments jetpilot21@hotm... on Oct 26, 2016 Don't you think that given a long history of program cost overruns and underperformance by contractors, the Air Force should be more concerned about program cost? Congress is notorious for saying that military projects are too expensive and too often do not produce the product promised by contractors. Log In or Register to post comments E99 on Nov 1, 2016 As previously commented, the USAF is very cost focused, been through it for decades. What Congress (and our political appointee leadership) is notorious for is allowing politics to drive constant change in funding profiles and spending activities. This is what drives up costs across the board and lowers operational capabilities at the same time. What is truly needed is less politics, firm 5 year budgets and GOs and political appointee leaders with a backbone and authority to say "no" when bean counters & politicians try to pick apart things they don't understand, and mandate their personal agendas (e.g., forcing USAF to buy C-130Js).

Log In or Register to post comments Geronime on Oct 27, 2016 You forgot all the hundreds of times we pretend that we absolutely need a weapon, or a vehicle, or a ship, or an aircraft, and we spend billions of dollars on the R&D, only to discover that we must now cancel the project because it suddenly now costs too much and we can't afford it! Log In or Register to post comments ed_lewis@earthl... on Oct 27, 2016 Mark, I don't know your background, but I do resent the way you picture AF Procurements. I spent 7.5 years at SMC in LA serving on numerous source selections boards. I also spent 9 mo. at Aeronautical Systems Division, again serving on a couple of major source selections. I must have missed something! Nothing showed up in my bank account, no gifts over $%.00 at my retirement, nor any cushy jobs when I did retire. I did not apply at any contractor who had bid on any of the programs I had help evaluate. I have now retired from industry, and I still have not worked for any of those contracts. Where did I go wrong???? I retired as a LtCol - just not high enough in rank would be your answer i guess. I also did not see any Generals retire to companies they held source selection authority over. Log In or Register to post comments des111168 on Oct 27, 2016 Bingo. These things will be a billion+ apiece, flyaway, and we won't even have a single squadron of them. They may never even get past the prototype stage, but if they do, we'll continue to be in the age of ultra-expensive boutique production airplanes that we buy fewer and fewer of. Log In or Register to post comments Spectre49 on Oct 25, 2016 So lets see, both were too low, NG had 10 serious dings vs 4 for Boeing/Lockheed (and Boeing Bailed out then Northrop on the last one) We have one organization vs two resource wise.

Log In or Register to post comments Richwood7 on Oct 26, 2016 Yes, and Congress will cut the fiscal year buy jacking the unit costs up and the "potential" adversary will be shown to be able to beat the technology that went into the build so modifications need to be made raising costs and sliding the schedule and the whole time everyone will blame Northrop. Log In or Register to post comments CharleyA on Oct 26, 2016 Or they expand production to more than 100, and cut back on shorter range attack jets, like the F-35A. Range and weapons load is key, and if we are to believe USAF prognostication, WVR fighting is a thing of the past. You could mix the loadout in the B-21 and carry AIM-120s and even Meteors, and let a fewer number of stealth fighters select targets... Log In or Register to post comments rabidpeach on Oct 27, 2016 here's where the wonderful rouse comes in... when enterprise rent a car decides to purchase less cars... it means they pay less for cars. when congress cuts a production run (rightly so because they were lied to during development) some how congress still pays the full ammount. the company ALWAYS gets its "due" ... no matter how much they lied during r&d and bidding process. why can't we see lockmart broken up for their insane 10 year plus development of their prototype fighter? let's see some actual accountability! break the suckling PIG company up and give the business units some agility. cut the pork. then you can wave a finger at NG and say... "you all better think twice before raising unit costs beyond $550mils or development costs beyond X" maybe then NG will listen and do business like other companies in existence, not just assured blank check from gubberment. blah blah new tech blah blah only copy in existence blah blah..,. see ex spacex for lesson in fixed price development. Log In or Register to post comments rellim113 on Nov 1, 2016 A "ruse"? When Enterprise buys cars they're buying off-the-shelf items, not paying Ford/GM/Toyota/etc. a bunch of money to design a unique car for their needs alone. An enormous chunk of the cost of military programs is design and development. When you decide to cut the number of airplanes bought in half, you don't get to magically do only half the design work.

NG seems, then, the obvious choice, based on their recent past record. Log In or Register to post comments rabidpeach on Oct 27, 2016 lol 'recent' past record... the 1980s engineers that made the b-2 at northrop are long gone. or have been just thinking about missiles since. i think they just do radar and munitions now. and all the crazy IT stuff. Log In or Register to post comments mlsflys@aol.com on Oct 26, 2016 And now it makes sense why going-forward cost reporting will be classified. Don't for a moment think it's to prevent the bad guys from backwards engineering capabilities from cost. (Although, with the way cost will go, it would be great disinformation for those backwards engineering bad guys.)

Log In or Register to post comments Arizonan on Oct 26, 2016 Massive cost over runs and delays plague most things government does. Boston's big dig, San Francisco Bay bridge retrofit, California high speed train are examples. The occasional project done ahead of time and under budget grabs headlines, for example, CC Meyers after Northridge earthquake. The U.S. used to bring in projects under budget and contractors won bonuses for some of California's dams like Shasta. Litigation drives up costs, but there are many other causes.

Log In or Register to post comments jimbo0117 on Oct 26, 2016 IMHO, I think it's mostly about too many cooks in the kitchen. As in, too many Generals/Admirals changing requirements, too many Congressmen adding pet projects, spreading the contracts around to too many subcontractors in an attempt to forestall cancellation. The programs that have come in on time and under budget were simply well conceived and well articulated requirements up front, that were well adhered to during development. Log In or Register to post comments ddn123@outlook.com on Oct 27, 2016 IN the 70's my father was in charge of the HLH (heavy lift helicopter), which is just a much bigger chinook. All that was left to do was build a test stand to qualify the transmission. But a general, who never liked the program, assumed a position that allowed him to cancel the project. Like all things in the pentagon, it takes years to design and build a modern airframe. Longer than most leaders stay in position to see the program through. Plus add in the changing threat environment and you have problems keeping the project relevant and on schedule. I believe the B2 was hampered by the decision of the air force, given the improvements in Soviet air defense, to add a third pilot (longer mission profile) and changing the wing structure (to allow low altitude flying to avoid radar detection) after the final structure was blueprinted requiring a complete reengineering of the structure. The primary mission profile of the B2 was to enter Russian airspace and use the on board radar to search out and destroy Soviet mobile ICBM vehicles. I could be wrong.

Log In or Register to post comments JimmyD on Oct 26, 2016 Who cares what EMD costs? It's cost-plus! The contractor gets paid. The AF gets the bomber. The taxpayers get to pay ! ! ! Log In or Register to post comments sugerde1@gmail.com on Oct 26, 2016 Jimmy, Just so you understand "EMD" is usually "cost +" because this is the development phase where the "customer (aka USAF) gets to "request" (aka demand) technology enhancements they want in the product going forward to flight test & production. Once thru the EMD phase with the design frozen (incorporating all the added bells and whistles the customer "requested") the contract becomes fixed price thru production until/unless the customer again requests major changes/upgrades. Badger 1 Log In or Register to post comments Skeptical on Oct 26, 2016 Cost is never really a concern when you are selling to the government. Our government loves to spend taxpayer's money with no accountability.

Log In or Register to post comments ddn123@outlook.com on Oct 27, 2016 Let me give a real world example. In the 70's the Army realized the T72 was a superior tank to the M60 the army had deployed in Europe. Plus the Soviets had 4 T72 tanks to each of our M60 tanks. To solve the problem, the Army asked the Missile Command to develop an infrantry deployed anti armor missile. US MICOM developed the missile in house. US MICOM estimated the missile cost was $600. Once it was good to go, the Pentagon had the design given to boeing for design and production. After they made various changes the missile unit cost was $1200. The Pentagon also asked another company to design a competitor which came in at a lower cost $800. Sometimes, the Arsenal concept (government engineers and production employees and facilities) seems like a better solution to some weapons development. But I don't think that works well for modern airframes. Log In or Register to post comments Zack63 on Oct 26, 2016 Can I summarize: No matter what government military program is presented, the reaction by most in this forum is: * It was a bad deal for the taxpayers * Some company paid off government officials * Company XXX should have got the contract instead of YYY * The program will never be successful and should be cancelled * Don't forget about some previous contract which was a debacle. OK, can we move on now? Log In or Register to post comments rabidpeach on Oct 27, 2016 no here's a new twist: you fail your development contract, and produce a 10 year and more delay, we take your airplane factory and sell it to reimburse the taxpayer. nationalize and sell. Once this happens just once I don't think others will be so cavalier with their "cost plus" contracts. Log In or Register to post comments Mark Lincoln on Oct 26, 2016 "Whoa, steady on.

Oil prices fell more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude breaking below $50 per barrel for a second straight day, ahead of weekly data that could show a build in inventories. On Wall Street, nine of the eleven sectors in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed lower, with housing and consumer products companies among those failing to live up to forecasts on third-quarter earnings. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news) of some big names, including Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR - news) , General Motors Co, Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT - news) and 3M , all lost ground. "We had a rally (Monday) and haven't been able to sustain it, due to weaker-than-expected numbers from some names," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. He called the day's earnings report a "mixed bag" for stocks. Another third of the S&P 500 is scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news) , Alphabet , Amazon and Boeing (NYSE: BA - news) . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 53.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,169.27, the S&P 500 lost 8.17 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,143.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.43 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,283.40. The dollar was a hair lower against a basket of major currencies after touching an eight-month high. Growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December had boosted the dollar to its highest level in more than seven months against the euro and about three months against the yen. When BoE policymakers meet next week to consider whether to cut interest rates, they will "undoubtedly" take sterling's weakness into account, BoE Governor Mark Carney told lawmakers on Tuesday. "Carney's comments cast doubt on easing from Europe," said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news) York. Sterling slumped to its lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash" but recovered some of its losses on Carney's remarks. The pound was last down 0.47 percent. In European stocks, mining companies rose 3.2 percent, lifted in part by Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news) , up 4.55 percent after its production update. Anglo is the top-performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index extended gains, closing up 0.45 percent. Germany's DAX turned slightly lower, ending down 0.04 percent, after hitting its highest level of the year. The closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations, a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. Metal prices surged, with zinc up 2.37 percent at $2,366.85, but off an earlier three-week high of $2,376. It is up nearly 60 percent from January lows on worries about shortages. Other commodity prices slipped, though, as many are priced in U.S. dollars. U.S. crude oil futures settled 56 cents lower at $49.96 per barrel, down 1.11 percent.

Oil prices fell more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude breaking below $50 per barrel for a second straight day, ahead of weekly data that could show a build in inventories. On Wall Street, nine of the eleven sectors in the benchmark S&P 500 stock index were negative after poor earnings forecasts from some of the largest companies. Some big names, including General Motors Co, Caterpillar Inc (NYSE: CAT - news) and 3M, all lost ground. "We've had some mixed earnings today and the market right now is digesting earnings and positioning itself ahead of the Fed meeting next week," said Jeff Zipper, managing director for investments at Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Palm Beach, Florida. Another third of the S&P 500 are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news) , Alphabet (Xetra: ABEA.DE - news) , Amazon and Boeing (NYSE: BA - news) . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 41.95 points, or 0.23 percent, to 18,181.08, the S&P 500 lost 6.56 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,144.77 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.15 points, or 0.49 percent, to 5,283.68. The dollar was down 0.1 percent against a basket of major currencies after touching an eight-month high. Growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December had earlier boosted the dollar to its highest level in more than seven months against the euro and about three months against the yen. When BoE policymakers meet next week to consider whether to cut interest rates, they will "undoubtedly" take sterling's weakness into account, BoE Governor Mark Carney told lawmakers on Tuesday. "Carney's comments cast doubt on easing from Europe," said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news) York. Sterling slumped to its lowest level since the Oct. 7 "flash crash" but recovered some of its losses on Carney's remarks. The pound was last down 0.45 percent. In European stocks, mining companies rose 3.2 percent, lifted in part by mining company Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news) , up 4.55 percent after its production update. Anglo is the top performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600 this year. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index extended gains, closing up 0.45 percent. Germany's Dax turned slightly lower, ending down 0.04 percent, after hitting its highest level of the year. The closely-watched Ifo survey beat expectations, a day after purchasing manager numbers had done the same. Metal prices surged, with zinc up 2.1 percent at $2,360.50, from an earlier three-week high of $2,376. It is up nearly 60 percent from January lows on worries about shortages. Other commodity prices slipped, though, as many are priced in U.S. dollars. U.S. crude oil futures settled 56 cents lower at $49.96 per barrel, down 1.11 percent.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Wed, Oct 26, 2016 - Page 9　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Reality, upgraded: Has augmented reality overtaken the virtual world? Augmented reality conjures objects into our real worlds as if by magic and with the success of ‘Pokemon Go,’ research and development departments are competing to enhance its delivery By Simon Parkin  /  The Observer Illustration: Mountain People While Dorothy, blue-skirted and pigtailed, clutching a wicker basket and a bewildered dog under her arm, surveys the weird flowers and pygmy huts around her, she is sure of just one thing: She is not in Kansas anymore. L. Frank Baum ‘s character was, it turns out, born slightly too early. In 1901, a year after the publication of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Baum wrote The Master Key, a novel credited with the invention of augmented reality via a pair of imagined spectacles that could map information on to whatever or whomever its wearer looked at. Had Dorothy owned a pair, she might have learned that she had been whisked to Oz, or that her new friend the Tin Man was in need of a heart, even, perhaps, that a wicked witch is burned not by fire, but by water. It was almost a century until Baum’s invention gained a label. In a 1992 research paper, Boeing engineers Thomas Caudell and David Mizell described a pair of “see-thru virtual reality [VR] goggles,” a device that would enhance the vision of factory workers with the complicated task of piecing together a jumbo jet’s nests of internal wiring with dynamically changing labels and information. Caudell termed this principle of annotating the seen world “augmented reality [AR],” thereby formalizing for Silicon Valley ‘s mavens and investors a fresh and unplundered field of technological opportunity, one that would eventually lead to the invention of Google Glass — a pair of information-spewing spectacles built, unbelievably, to Baum’s century-old definition. Who would not like a natural history program where the dinosaurs roam across your room? If the breathless press releases are to be believed, this year has been the year of virtual reality — a discarded technology that, thanks to the revolution in low-cost components heralded by smartphones, is currently enjoying a lavish revival. HTC, Sony and Facebook have all launched expensive, miraculous visors that transport us into fabricated realities, fooling the brain into believing that, like Dorothy, we have been bodily transported to another place. At its best, VR allows us to visit places too remote, too dangerous or too expensive to otherwise reach. Documentarians are using the nascent medium to allow us to experience life through the eyes of another, but VR technology also has numerous drawbacks. As well as the cost, there is also the sense of vulnerability that wearers experience while sitting blind in front of the television, as well as the perils of bumping into furniture. As one Microsoft spokesperson put it, VR users are “best advised to stay seated or keep still to avoid collisions.” AR, while not having quite the same transporting effects, gets around this issue by layering its simulated elements over the real world. Through a pair of AR glasses, or a smartphone’s camera, you are able to see both the elbow-y chair and teetering lamp in front of you, and the data that overlays it. Microsoft’s apparent skepticism about VR is understandable — the company has instead focused millions of research and development dollars into AR (or, as the company prefers to term it, “mixed reality”) via its HoloLens, a see-through PC-in-a-visor that launches in November for the precise and gargantuan cost of US$3,000. Microsoft believes that HoloLens is the next evolution for AR, technology that we have seen for years whenever, for example, a weather reporter gestures toward a virtual map behind them in a television studio or a pundit offers an assessment of the starting XI in a soccer match, as digital versions of the players magically appear in front of them on the desk. 1 2 3 4 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1646 times.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 25, 2016 11:52am   Comments Share: It’s an epic earnings day on Wall Street, as a collection of massive U.S. companies report results, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and five other Dow components. Fed speakers and housing data help round out the schedule. Earnings just keep rumbling on here as we near the end of October, and so far, there’s been little not to like. To date, more than 75% of companies have beat expectations, and, in a truly positive sign, nearly 80% have beaten Wall Street’s consensus estimates on the revenue side of the coin. Futures trading pointed toward a slightly higher open. Approximately 180 S&P 500 companies report results this week, and it seems like a big portion of them come today. Among the big names are Merck & Co., Inc (NYSE: MRK), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY), 3M Co (NYSE: MMM), and E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD). And waiting in the wings is Apple, which reports after the close (see below). Expect the flavor of the market this week to mostly be shaped by individual company earnings stories, and remember, there’s still a lot to come after today, with names like Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) on tap in the coming days. By the end of the week, investors should have pretty good insight into the health of big U.S. companies. Earlier today, another biggie reported, as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) surpassed earnings per share estimates but didn’t match Wall Street analysts’ estimates on revenue. The company also lowered its full-year guidance, and, in a statement, cited “economic weakness throughout the world.” But MRK shares zoomed up 3% early Tuesday after the company solidly beat on earnings and revenue. 3M, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) and DD also beat estimates. Bond prices remain under pressure, in part from solid U.S. economic data, and the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds is back above 1.75%. It’s also noteworthy that the yield curve is on its way up, meaning the spread between short-term and longer-term yields is increasing. This can be a positive factor for the financial sector, and sure enough, financials are up nearly 2% over the last week, solidly ahead of the broader market. Consumer confidence reached nine-year highs last month, and we’ll find out if that lasted into October when the Conference Board reports at 10 a.m. ET today. Perhaps a better measure of consumer confidence is durable goods data, due Thursday morning. And the Case-Shiller 20-city housing index and the FHFA Housing Index, both out this morning, might also provide more insight into the consumer economy. Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart speaks this afternoon. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans made some dovish remarks on Monday about potentially keeping the federal funds rate lower for longer. M&A Volume Scampering Up: Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is picking up here in Q4, with the biggest recent deal the $85 billion agreement for AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to purchase Time Warner Inc (NYSE: TWX). That was just one of a few recent deals totaling nearly $240 billion that have a chance to make 2016 the second-biggest M&A year on record after 2015 if just a handful of the current deals come to fruition, Bloomberg noted. M&A activity became rather sluggish in the wake of the Great Recession, falling well over 50% on a value basis between 2007 and 2009 before waking up and slowly growing until the record activity of last year. A relatively slow-growing economy that makes it hard for companies to out-perform, combined with low interest rates that provide easy access to financing, often can make M&A seem more attractive. On the other hand, the agreement between T and TWX appears to face a challenging regulatory scrutiny, and politicians from both major parties expressed concern that the deal could concentrate too much power in too few hands. We’ll see what ultimately gets done with this one. Are Samsung’s Struggles Handing AAPL a Bigger Slice of Market? As anyone who’s been on an airplane flight recently probably knows, airlines have banned Samsung’s Galaxy 7 phone because it might be a fire hazard, and the phone has been recalled. Did this steer additional customers to Apple, which reports earnings after the close today? That’s one thing to keep an eye on, and investors might also be curious to see how AAPL’s new iPhone 7 did during its first months on the market. Though the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s struggles could take the headlines, it’s also worth watching to see if AAPL continues to see falling sales overall, as it has the last two quarters. The phone market keeps getting tougher, and in Q2, AAPL’s sales fell 15% from a year earlier, the second quarter in a row of falling sales. For Q3, analysts surveyed by Briefing.com expect earnings per share of $1.65, down from $1.96 a year ago, but the company’s share price remains near its high for the year. Going Opposite Ways? Stocks were tracking crude oil rather closely last week, but the relationship appeared to break down a little on Monday, as the S&P 500 Index (Index: SPX) rose nearly 0.5% while front-month U.S. crude futures fell around the same amount, dipping below $50 a barrel during the session before recovering slightly. Pressure on oil came from the fundamental side, as Iraq said it wouldn’t necessarily abide by an OPEC output freeze. But later in the day, Iran said it would encourage other countries to join. Oil futures have been trading back and forth near the $50 level for several weeks, perhaps a sign of how difficult it is to pierce this mark. Last week saw 11 new oil rigs added to U.S. production, according to the Baker Hughes weekly report, if anyone needed a reminder that higher prices often lead to more U.S. drilling, which can lead to lower prices.   TD Ameritrade and all third parties mentioned are separate and unaffiliated companies, and are not responsible for each other’s policies or services.

A rendering of the proposed Falcon Tech Center, just west of city-owned Falcon Field Airport. (Photo: City of Mesa) Story Highlights A cutting-edge business park focused on medical research and technology could soon occupy 63 acres next to Mesa's Falcon Field Airport Moving forward with the "Falcon Tech Center" will mean wiping out 60-plus-year-old citrus groves The airport will be collecting feedback about the proposal through Nov. 7 60 CONNECTTWEET 18 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE A cutting-edge business park focused on medical research and technology could soon occupy a 63-acre swath of land at Mesa's Falcon Field Airport, bringing new, high-wage jobs to an already prosperous part of town. But pushing forward with the vision for the "Falcon Tech Center" will mean leaving a piece of Mesa's history behind: For more than six decades, citrus groves have covered the city-owned parcel, just west of the airport near Greenfield and McDowell roads. "I know some (area residents) would like to leave it as is, but that’s hard for us to do given the conditions of those orange trees," said Bill Jabjiniak, Mesa economic-development director. "At 60 or 70 years old, they're really past their useful lives." Leasing the property to businesses, rather than selling it, will allow Mesa to "dictate some quality that's really necessary in that area going forward and then target some specific companies that fit here," Jabjiniak said. RELATED: Mesa envisions bigger jobs hub at Falcon Field "We’re trying to position that property for its highest and best use." Creating opportunity Key elements already in place at Mesa's Falcon Field property and in the larger Falcon area would facilitate the development of a tech center, according to the city.  (Photo: David Kadlubowski /The Republic) City officials began honing the concept for the tech center early this year, building on a strategic plan developed for the larger Falcon area in 2014. That plan — essentially a blueprint for future business-attraction, retention and marketing efforts — urged diversification of the Falcon Field economy, long anchored by aerospace giants such as Boeing Co. "Certainly, the aerospace and aviation industry is very dominant in that area, and we know that and support that," said Councilman David Luna, whose district includes the airport. "But we're seeing a surge in medical-device companies as an emerging technology, and we want to be able to provide them space, too." RELATED: Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport pursuing new airlines, industrial park Mesa is home to more than 25 medical-device companies, which manufacture everything from imaging tools and ultrasound equipment to dental products. And Arizona's life-sciences industry, which includes biochemistry and related fields, grew by 45 percent over the past 10 years, compared with 12 percent nationally, Jabjiniak said. MORE: Mesa hopes move, new vision boosts LaunchPoint business accelerator "You can probably can see why we're starting to zoom in (on these specific industries) a little bit," he told the City Council at a study session earlier this year. "I think (a park with this focus) really allows us to go after the smaller companies that are leaving the region and the larger companies that are shipping work out. This will create an opportunity for them to actually stay put." Halfway there Key elements already in place at the property and in the larger Falcon area would facilitate the development of a tech center, according to the city. The site lies minutes from Falcon Field's general-aviation airstrips, for instance, as well as Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's commercial runways and major freeways. It has basic water, sewer and gas infrastructure, plus 2-inch conduits for fiber-optic cables. The proposed development area for the Falcon Tech Center.  (Photo: City of Mesa) Income and education demographics in the Falcon Field Economic Activity Area, which stretches from Gilbert Road to Ellsworth Road north of Brown, are among the city's best. A median household income 30 percent higher than the rest of Maricopa County could attract prospective vendors, according to the city. Nearly half of adults 25 or older have a college degree, indicating a qualified workforce. "Sometimes, we forget really how robust (the Falcon area) really is," Mayor John Giles said at the study session. "Because it's such a big area, and you do drive by some undeveloped pieces of property, you might have the mistaken impression that things aren't hopping out there, when they really are to a large extent." Economic-development officials have designed a webpage, brochures and other promotional materials to aid them in early discussions with developers and businesses. Next steps Despite the site's assets, a handful of roadblocks remain. First, because Mesa purchased the property with the help of aviation-grant funding, the Federal Aviation Administration wants a thorough environmental assessment of the land, according to airport Director Corinne Nystrom. PREVIOUSLY: $2M Falcon Field overhaul to begin this month The airport has hired an environmental consultant to conduct the assessment, which officials expect to see finished by the end of the year and submitted to the FAA in early 2017. "They've indicated they'll be focusing on three things (with that assessment)," Nystrom said. "One is going to be archaeological, to see if there's anything there that needs to be documented. Secondly, they want to make sure that we look at any stormwater detention or retention issues. And third, they want us to look at what impact the removal of some of those trees might have on the wildlife that may be residing or nesting in that area." Citrus trees – some healthy, some decaying – currently occupy the 63-acre parcel being eyed for the Falcon Tech Center.  (Photo: Maria Polletta/The Republic) Economic-development officials also have requested some zoning-condition changes for the property, to allow for different, "more flexible" types of buildings. Most business prospects want to move into existing buildings, according to the Greater Phoenix Economic Council, and ready-to-use office and industrial facilities are scarce in the Falcon district. MORE: Falcon Field hangars get national historic designation Finally, the city must appease the neighbors whom Jabjiniak called "less than enthusiastic" about the idea of a bustling development replacing quiet citrus groves. "We've proposed a good buffer zone (in the tech-center design) … to protect that residential environment," he said. "That was done on purpose, as was the idea of keeping some orange trees throughout the site. "The idea here is not a total wipeout," he said. "We really want to keep that area's history in mind."

Investors were cautious, though, sending the group's shares lower. Rising maintenance revenue helped MTU offset lower-than-expected new engine sales due to delays in deliveries of Airbus's new A320neo jet. But analysts said the shift could affect earnings in 2017 instead as new engine sales typically provide lower margins than maintenance work. Shares in MTU, whose customers include Airbus and Boeing, were down 3.7 percent at 92.68 euros at 0955 GMT, after rising 7 percent this month. The group said it now saw adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) coming to around 500 million euros ($544 million) for 2016, compared with a previous forecast for around 480 million. Its maintenance business for commercial planes reported a 19 percent rise in revenues for the three months through September. CEO Rainer Winkler declined to comment on the outlook for 2017 earnings on Tuesday, saying MTU would provide first guidance during an investor day on Dec 14. Before the third quarter results, analysts in a Reuters poll had expected 2017 adjusted EBIT of 522 million euros. MTU expects its commercial maintenance revenues to rise by around 15-19 percent this year in U.S. dollar terms, compared with a previous forecast for 10 percent. New engine sales are now predicted to remain flat this year, instead of increasing by 3-7 percent. Shares in MTU, which had risen 7 percent this month before Tuesday's update, were down 3.7 percent at 92.68 euros at 0955 GMT. To meet demand for spare parts and repairs for civil jets after a glut of orders for new aircraft in recent years, MTU is exploring setting up a joint maintenance company with Lufthansa Technik, part of the Lufthansa airline group. MTU and Lufthansa are discussing where to set up a facility, with a decision expected by the end of the year. Rival Safran also reported an increase in revenues from spare parts for civil jet engines on Monday. However, competition looks set to increase, with Boeing also aiming to win more of the lucrative market for replacement parts and repair services to boost its margins. MTU reported third quarter adjusted EBIT of 139.7 million euros, beating average analyst expectations for 125 million.

October 25, 2016 by ASSOCIATED PRESS Topics General Industries Aerospace Manufacturing Tags aerospace B/E Aerospace manufacturing Rockwell Collins NEW YORK — The move by Rockwell Collins Inc. to buy B/E Aerospace Inc. will combine two of the biggest suppliers to airplane makers and airlines. Rockwell announced that it will pay $6.4 billion to buy its rival, a 22.5% premium over B/E’s closing stock price on Oct. 21. In afternoon trading Oct. 24, shares of Rockwell fell almost 6% while B/E shares jumped almost 16%. Rockwell said the deal will diversify its offerings to plane manufacturers and airlines. Rockwell sells avionics and electronics systems used in airline, business and military jets. B/E, based in Wellington, Fla., makes aircraft cabin interiors including seating, storage and lavatory systems. Rockwell Collins, which is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said that with B/E, it will nearly double the value of systems it sells for new single-aisle planes by Boeing and Airbus and triple its components in bigger two-aisle planes that are often used on international routes. The stock and cash deal needs approval by shareholders of both companies and by regulators. It is expected to close next spring. Raymond James analyst Harry Breach said the sale added to a slowly rising number of deals in the aerospace industry, including recent Rockwell acquisitions to add expertise in in-flight connectivity and entertainment. Still, Breach said, despite expected cost savings from combining Rockwell and B/E, “we cannot clearly see the strategic synergy here.” Cowen and Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr called the deal “a good fit” but said it was “a bit pricey.” He said B/E’s strong relationships with airline customers would complement Rockwell’s strength with business jet and military customers. Rockwell said the deal will save about $160 million in overlapping spending and boost earnings per share within a year. If the deal is completed, Rockwell will have nearly 30,000 employees about $8 billion in annual revenue. Rockwell will pay $34.10 in cash and $27.90 in its stock for each B/E share. It will also assume $1.9 billion in B/E debt. In afternoon trading Oct. 24, shares of Rockwell fell $5, or 5.9%, to $79.46, while B/E shares jumped $7.94, or 15.7%, to $58.55.

The international sanctions imposed on the country had not only economic effects, but left the travel and aviation sphere of the country depressed. The implementation of the landmark deal with six world powers to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief gave a huge stimulus for revitalizing and developing Iran’s aviation industry. The barriers that the country faced have left it operating one of the oldest fleets in the world, while local airlines had no choice but to make use of outdated and obsolete aircrafts and supplies. Moreover, a number of the leading European airlines halted their flights to Iran due to international sanctions over the past years. The aviation sector of the country, which mainly suffered from underfunding and severe infrastructure deficits, is now considered to be one of the key sectors that may lead to modernization and development. The first airline to announce its comeback was Air France. Other major airlines such as British Airways, Air Astana, KLM Royal Dutch also commenced their routes to Iran. Moreover, the lifting of international sanctions gave a green light for aircraft sales to Iran allowing the world's largest aerospace companies and leading manufacturers to deliver planes to Tehran. Such aviation giants as Boeing and Airbus earlier got licenses to make business with Iran selling commercial aircrafts and spare parts to Iranian airlines with no prohibitions. The license of Boeing covered the sale of some 80 planes to Iran’s national carrier, Iran Air, while Airbus confirmed the initial sale of 17 planes as part of a large deal, which involves the sale of some 118 planes. In addition, Iranian airlines got a possibility to buy fuel in the west without making stops in Central Asia, Ukraine and Turkey for refueling. The secretary of the Society of Iranian Airlines, Maqsoud Asadi Samani told Mehr agency that the country is planning to open up six new local airlines. The permission on the operation of flights has not yet been received. Each airline should have a qualified staff, required amount of financial means, and possess not less than five planes. Some 15 local carriers are currently operating in the country, while the number is planned to be increased up to 23 in the future. -- Nigar Abbasova is AzerNews’ staff journalist, follow her on Twitter: @nigyar_abbasova Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz   #IRAN SANCTIONS REMOVAL #AVIATION INDUSTRY #IRAN Related News Iranian President supports idea of visa-free regime with Russia 15 November 15:08 Iran to abandon gasoline imports 15 November 11:46 FM: Iran interested in purchase of Russian weapons 14 November 16:12 Tehran, Beijing ink defense deal 14 November 15:05 Iran records foreign debts worth $7.91B 14 November 10:42 Iran urges peaceful nuclear cooperation with Hungary 12 November 17:37 Chinese defense minister due in Iran 12 November 16:20 Iran, Hungary eye expansion of trade ties 12 November 15:26 Iran not to cross death penalty redline in EU talks 11 November 23:57 Persian Gulf Petrochemical’s output to hike soon 11 November 14:37 Latest Popular 15 November 18:29 • AmCham proposes to establish agency to work with foreign investors 15 November 18:21 • ADB makes decision on distribution of excess financial means 15 November 18:11 • Bookmate users exceed 11,000 15 November 17:52 • Customs committee transfers 1.8B manat to state budget 15 November 17:50 • Turkey's Erdogan to visit Pakistan, Uzbekistan 15 November 17:37 • Armenian economist warns about catastrophic situation in country 15 November 17:37 • CBA reveals manat rate for November 16 15 November 17:30 • Azerbaijan, ADB eye strenthened cooperation 15 November 17:14 • Azerbaijani Army continue large-scale drills in Nakhchivan [PHOTO] 15 November 17:11 • Mehriban Aliyeva attends "Stars of Absheron.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 08:29 25 Oct 2016 Accendo Markets , October 25 2016 “FTSE 100 Index called to open +20pts at 7005 following yesterday afternoon’s sharp sell-off that took the index back below 7000, breaking 5-week rising lows support. A bounce overnight at 6980 support level sees the FTSE back above 7000 for the opening of the trading session, with Bulls hoping that a morning rally will take the index back into yesterday’s trading channel. Bears, however, will be hoping that another break below 7000 could form a bearish flag pattern, breaking further rising lows support at 6960 on the way to 6930. Watch levels: Bullish 7055, Bearish 6975. A positive opening call comes after a mostly positive Asian trading session, driven by further US Dollar strengthening as the chances of a US Fed hike in December reach their highest since before Brexit. Earnings releases will once again be the focus for markets as four FTSE 100 components report this morning, whilst across the pond the world’s most valuable company Apple reports how it fared in the third quarter. Note, an announcement from the UK Transport secretary at 12:30pm regarding South East England airport expansion could have repercussions for UK Airlines as the Heathrow vs Gatwick debate is settled. For now. Asian equities are mixed this morning, a positive performance from Japan’s Nikkei rising 0.7% as a result of a strong IPO showing and further US Dollar strengthening against the Yen being offset by a slowing of GDP growth in South Korea, with the Kospi index falling 0.5%. Elsewhere, Australia’s ASX index rallied 0.6% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 0.1%. US equity markets closed in the green yesterday although fell away from session highs towards the back end of trading as a strong Dollar and falling oil prices weighed on markets. The Dow Jones closed up 0.4% on the back of strong earnings performances from 3M and Boeing, while the S&P 500 rose 0.45% with the IT sector leading the index. Crude oil prices are holding steady after a strong rally yesterday evening as investors cling to hopes of an OPEC production deal. Despite Iraq’s Oil Minister announcing his country was not willing to cut its output as it continues to battle IS within its borders, his Russian counterpart’s comments to reporters that he has discussed production cut mechanisms with OPEC Secretary General Barkindo helped prices to recover to remain in a steady sideways trading pattern. Gold has been buoyed slightly by increased demand, despite the strong dollar, as it is reported that depreciation in the Chinese Yuan could see investors flock to the precious yellow metal as they look to hedge against further falls. In focus this morning is French Business and Manufacturing Confidence figures, both seen flat for October, before German IFO Business Climate, Current Assessments and Expectations Surveys are released at 9am. With all three figures seen virtually flat, can the data echo PMI figures yesterday and show a surprise expansion? Keep an eye on the European equities and the Euro foreign exchange markets. US macro data this afternoon sees S&P/Corelogic August House Price Index data released alongside the FHFA House Price Index at 2pm, with expectations for a minor increase for the former. Any greater than expected figures (or lesser for that matter) are likely to have a bearing on Fed rate hike expectations. At 3pm, the October Consumer Confidence Index is expected to show a decline from the previous month, although remains above the key expansionary 100 figure, while the Richmond Fed Manufacturing is seen to improve to -4 from -7, and IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism is also seen improving from 46.7 to 47.5. Rounding off the day is French Jobless Claims at 5pm, predicted to produce a negative figure from last month’s 50K showing. Several heavyweight speakers are lined up today, with German Chancellor Merkel taking the stand at 10:10am before BoE Governor Mark Carney is grilled by the House of Lords at 3:35pm. While investors will be hoping for any hint from the Governor regarding the upcoming meeting of the MPC on the 3rd November, it is likely Carney will opt for a ‘wait and see’ strategy with important macro data still in the pipeline. Following last week’s tight lipped post monetary policy meeting presser, ECB President Mario Draghi will once again be speaking at 4:30pm, any indication of tapering will once more be sought after by markets. Finally, the Fed’s Lockheart speaks after European close at 6pm which will no doubt have some bearing on Fed rate hike expectations.” Accendo Markets Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Spreadbetting, CFD trading and Forex are leveraged.

There were also tentative hopes rising prices for steel and some industrial commodities - zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014 - could pick up the pulse of inflation globally. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to levels last seen in April as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan 0.7 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked 0.1 percent firmer, as did EMini futures for the S&P 500. Spread betters tipped moderate opening gains for European bourses. South Korea's main index slipped 0.5 percent after data showed Samsung Electronics' decision to scrap its Galaxy Note 7 dragged on the entire economy in the third quarter, though growth still pipped forecasts. Wall Street had taken encouragement from upbeat corporate results and the Dow ended Monday up 0.46 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.91 percent. Over one third of U.S. companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. Merger and acquisition activity added extra fizz in the wake of AT&T Inc's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner Inc, though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. DOLLAR IN DEMAND Aiding risk sentiment was the Markit survey of U.S. manufacturing which climbed to a one-year top of 53.2. Business activity in the euro zone expanded at the fastest pace this year so far in October and firms raised prices at the sharpest rate in more than five years. The better news led investors to nudge up the probability of a December rate hike from the Federal Reserve to around 74 percent and pressured Treasury prices. It also lifted the U.S. dollar to a nine-month high against a basket of major currencies at 98.846. The dollar firmed on the yen to 104.43, threatening the month's peak at 104.62, while the euro struggled at $1.0878. One mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the U.S. dollar down to C$1.3333 from a peak at C$1.3398. In commodities, oil prices dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 9 cents at $51.37 a barrel, while U.S. crude also lost 2 cents to $50.50. Going the other way was iron ore, with Chinese iron ore futures reaching their highest since August 2014. Coal prices also reached new peaks after weeks of gains, a prop for the Australian dollar as the two commodities are the country's biggest export earners.

Diese Unternehmen könnten Interesse habenAnleger aufgepasst! Was Fonds-Anteilen nach Silvester droht Regulatory News: Statement by the President and CEO Håkan Buskhe: Market development Growing turmoil around the world continues to impact the defence market and the civil security market. We are closely following market developments and the global trend toward increased investment in defence and security. Demand is clearly growing for cost-efficient systems and solutions that quickly increase operational capabilities. At the same time, technological development continues, with evermore digitalisation and automation within the defence industry. For Saab, with a large part of its operations in software development, this creates opportunities to work even more innovatively and effectively. Order bookings and sales Order bookings in the first nine months were in line with 2015, excluding: the Gripen contract with Brazil, the order of type A26 submarines and a mid-life upgrade for two Gotland-class submarines to Sweden, which were received then. Order bookings for the third quarter were mainly driven by important small and medium-sized deals. Two examples are the orders for the latest version of the RBS 70 air defence system and the airport group Swedavias continued use of SAFE as its command and control platform for the control centre at its Swedish airports. Order bookings amounted to MSEK 14,960 (62,599). The order backlog at the end of the period amounted to MSEK 109,521 (105,486). Sales in the first nine months increased by 15 percent (16 per cent organic growth) to MSEK 19,615 (17,116). The increase was again mainly due to: the Gripen programme, an order in 2015 for GlobalEye, a higher level of orders in Dynamics and the development of the A26 submarine. Operating income Operating income amounted to MSEK 837 (553) and the operating margin was 4.3 per cent (3.2). The operating margin strengthened in line with our expectations. Operating income was again adversely affected by investments in the development of a new jet trainer together with Boeing (T-X program), as well as by several major projects in early stages where they normally generate lower profit. Much of our focus is on execution of the major projects in the order backlog. In September, Boeing and Saab revealed the first two production aircraft for the U.S. Air Forces T-X programme. Operational cash flow amounted to MSEK 1,922 (-1,153). Cash flow was affected in the third quarter by project activity related to advances and milestone payments. Unchanged outlook for 2016 The outlook for 2016 remains unchanged. The interest in Saabs cost-efficient products and solutions means increased business opportunities for Saab. At the same time, defence procurements are preceded by processes, which are difficult to assess, both in terms of timing and outcome. Unchanged outlook statement 2016: In 2016, we estimate sales to be in line with Saabs long-term financial goal: annual organic sales growth of 5 per cent . The operating margin 2016, excluding material non-recurring items, is expected to be in line with 2015.

Safran's Sigma 40 integrates with Harpoon missile system by Geoff Ziezulewicz Paris (UPI) Oct 21, 2016 disclaimer: image is for illustration purposes only Safran Electronics and Defense has successfully carried out integration tests of its Sigma 40 ship navigation system with the alignment system of the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-missile system. The test was carried out within the scope of a contract signed with Korean naval shipyard DSME, Safran said in a statement. The company also worked with Harpoon manufacturer Boeing on the tests. The systems are intended for Krabi corvettes and KDX-class frigates deployed by the Royal Thai Navy. After the successful tests, Safran's inertial navigation systems can now be used in all of Thailand's warships. The Sigma 40 system is also used for conventional navigation and stabilization functions on ship sensors and weapons. Sigma 40 navigation systems are built around a ring laser gyro inertial core, offering sustained precision and a high degree of operational flexibility. Sigma inertial navigation systems are now fitted to combat systems on more than 500 warships, including the latest front-line ships such as the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier, Europe's Freem and Horizon frigates and helicopter carriers.

The Colombian Defence Ministry said the plane, which was flying from Madrid to Bogota, was briefly approached by a Venezuelan military plane resulting in diplomatic conversations and Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro ordering an investigation. There was no official word from Avianca, but a source at the carrier told Reuters it had suspended flights to and over Venezuela after two warplanes had approached its plane on Friday evening, forcing it out of Venezuelan airspace. Data from the online tracker FlightRadar24 confirmed Avianca’s flights were avoiding Venezuela on Saturday. They also showed Avianca’s Boeing Dreamliner taking a sharp turn when flying over west Venezuela around 8:00pm local time, in line with a statement by Colombian authorities. The South American neighbours have for years had a volatile relationship, with Venezuela’s socialist government sometimes accusing Colombia of provocation and claims in the other direction that Caracas has supported Colombian guerrillas. The lengthy border is a constant source of tension. Both nations’ Defence and Foreign Ministers have discussed the plane incident, Colombia said. It said Maduro had “personally ordered the investigation into the case.” Venezuelan authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Colombian statement cited Venezuelan authorities as saying its warplane was on a “navigation mission.” ~ Curaçao Chronicle ~ Previous Article At least 800,000 Haitians in dire need of immediate help, says UN Next Article UWI lecturer says time to end religious studies in schools Home                             The Daily Herald Newspaper St. Maarten Copyright © 2015 Joomla!.

Advertising Contact Us About November 15, 2016 Menu News Arts Sports Opinion About Contribute to The Omega Staff Advertising Contact Us We’re hiring Kickstart Speaker Series intrigues and inspires Richard Game presented to a crowd of almost 100 students and staff News Oct. 24, 2016 Jared MacArthur Richard Game, COO of Evans Consoles, speaking at the Barber Center last week as part of the Kickstart speaker series. (Jared MacArthur/The Omega) The Irving K. Barber Centre was packed with students, faculty and staff last week to hear former resident of Kamloops and a TRU alumni Richard Game speak about his career and discuss the success of Evans Consoles Corporation (ECC). Game is the chief operating officer for ECC, a Calgary-based company that now does business around the world. ECC designs and installs computer console systems for major information and communications centers. The consoles are very specialized and unique to each customer, Game explains, because the systems they are housing are usually critical to sensitive material, or the safety of others, like an airport control room. The company’s revenue has grown from $20 million in 2004 to $80 million in 2016, according to Game, and it has secured clients in North America such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, NASA, Boeing as well other high-profile international clients. After outlining the structure and function of the company, Game went on to speak more directly to the students in the room about his own personal journey in the business world and how he had gone through many directional shifts before ending up at his current position. “How much [Game] changed his discipline is impressive, going from sporting goods to software is a big switch,” a third-year bachelor of technology student Garret Hunter said. “Richard, having started in engineering and then making the move into business is kind of similar to what I’m trying to do right now,” Hunter said. When discussing his own business experience, Game said, “it’s really about building personal relationships,” and if any student is going to start a business Game’s advice would be to know your customer. He emphasized that this along with keeping your personal knowledge base up-to-date is quickly becoming a matter of survival in the business world. Another main point he touched on was the importance of travel experience and how much that has helped him. Game talked extensively about what he had learnt from his experiences in India, China and the Middle East. “It’s a great insight into the path that students can take, that you don’t really plan the path, but you have to be receptive to it and be open to the challenges and risks involved,” said Kim Annis, a fourth-year student. When asked what he thinks about having such a high-profile speaker come to TRU, Annis said, “there is a plus and a negative side.” The plus side is that him being from Kamloops shows that you can really go anywhere in the world with your education, and “the downside, a lot of it, is we see these multi-millionaires come in, who are in charge of these huge companies, and very few of us are going to be there.” Game’s talk was part of the Business Kickstart Speakers Series and was hosted by TRU’s School of Business and Economics.

In commodities, oil prices dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 30 cents at $51.48 a barrel while U.S. crude lost 9 cents to $50.43.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Japan shares hit 6-mth top, US dlr in demand By Reuters Published: 01:38 EST, 25 October 2016 | Updated: 01:38 EST, 25 October 2016 e-mail By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Japanese shares hit a six-month top on Tuesday as the dollar advanced on the yen, while risk sentiment got a lift after factory surveys in the United States and Europe boasted the best readings of the year so far. There were also tentative hopes rising prices for steel and some industrial commodities - zinc surged to a five-year peak and iron ore reached its highest since mid-2014 - could pick up the pulse of inflation globally. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent to levels last seen in April as a softening yen burnished the outlook for the country's exporters. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and Taiwan 0.7 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked 0.1 percent firmer, as did EMini futures for the S&P 500. Spread betters tipped moderate opening gains for European bourses. South Korea's main index slipped 0.5 percent after data showed Samsung Electronics' decision to scrap its Galaxy Note 7 dragged on the entire economy in the third quarter, though growth still pipped forecasts. Wall Street had taken encouragement from upbeat corporate results and the Dow ended Monday up 0.46 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.91 percent. Over one third of U.S. companies have now reported and 80 percent have beaten market expectations. Another third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Boeing. Merger and acquisition activity added extra fizz in the wake of AT&T Inc's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner Inc , though the deal seemed destined to face stringent scrutiny from regulators. DOLLAR IN DEMAND Aiding risk sentiment was the Markit survey of U.S. manufacturing which climbed to a one-year top of 53.2. Business activity in the euro zone expanded at the fastest pace this year so far in October and firms raised prices at the sharpest rate in more than five years. The better news led investors to nudge up the probability of a December rate hike from the Federal Reserve to around 74 percent <_0FF:_> and pressured Treasury prices. It also lifted the U.S. dollar to a nine-month high against a basket of major currencies at 98.846. The dollar firmed on the yen to 104.43, threatening the month's peak at 104.62, while the euro struggled at $1.0878. One mover was the Canadian dollar which rebounded from a seven-month low after Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the decision on whether to cut interest rates again was not one to take lightly. The comments countered recent speculation about an imminent easing and nudged the U.S. dollar down to C$1.3333 from a peak at C$1.3398. In commodities, oil prices dipped on news of the impending restart of Britain's Buzzard oilfield and Iraq's wish to be exempted from OPEC production cuts. Brent was down 9 cents at $51.37 a barrel, while U.S. crude also lost 2 cents to $50.50. Going the other way was iron ore, with Chinese iron ore futures reaching their highest since August 2014. Coal prices also reached new peaks after weeks of gains, a prop for the Australian dollar as the two commodities are the country's biggest export earners.

Pound trims drop as Carney signals odds of BOE cut diminishing Oil falls as Russian comments add to production accord doubts Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp U.S. stocks declined from a two-week high as mixed forecasts from industry giants and a slump in consumer confidence spurred concern over the outlook for the world’s largest economy. Oil retreated. Blue chips Caterpillar Inc. and 3M Co. dropped after cutting their estimates, outweighing optimism with United Technologies Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co.’s earnings. Apple Inc. fell in after-hours trading as it reported sliding prices for its smartphones and forecast lower-than-expected profitability over the holiday period. The pound pared losses as Bank of England Governor Mark Carney signaled that the chances of another interest-rate cut this year are diminishing. Oil sank on bets Russia won’t join OPEC to curb supply. Traders have been assessing the strength of corporate profits and the economy amid bets on a Federal Reserve hike by December. U.S. consumer confidence fell more than forecast in October as households became less upbeat about the labor market, the Conference Board said Tuesday. More than a third of S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report earnings this week, including Alphabet Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Boeing Co.  "Given that we’re now in the thick of earnings season, there are going to be acute reactions nearly every day,” said Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet LLC in New York. "Other than that, the price action is not materially different than what we’ve seen over the last two months. There have been multiple false starts where budding momentum has gotten cut short." Global markets have actually seen declines in volatility -- with a cross-asset gauge of price swings in equities, rates, currency and commodities down to the lowest since 2014. While risks exist, the drop in anxiety has coincided with a reduction in uncertainty when it comes to U.S. politics and policy. Hillary Clinton’s odds of victory are close to the highest on record at 86.5 percent, according to forecaster FiveThirtyEight. Likewise, investors appear to be coming to terms with the inevitability of a Federal Reserve hike in December. “Until we get something that really surprises the market, we’re going to continue in this low volatility,” said Hank Smith, who helps manage more than $6 billion as chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. in Radnor, Pennsylvania “Neither the election nor the Fed’s rate decision have people particularly worried right now.” Stocks The S&P 500 dropped 0.4 percent to 2,143.16 at 4 p.m. in New York. The gauge has been stuck in a 64-point trading range after reaching a record in August and hasn’t climbed for three consecutive sessions in more than a month. Apple shares fell 2.3 percent to $115.55 in extended hours on Tuesday. The stock closed at $118.25 in New York regular trading. It had rallied 22 percent in the last three months. The company, which gets two thirds of revenue from the iPhone, experienced its first annual sales decline since 2001, amid waning smartphone demand. Among stocks moving on corporate news: 3M slumped after cutting the top end of its 2016 profit forecast. Caterpillar slipped after reducing its sales estimate for this year. Sherwin-Williams Co.’s disappointing results weighed on shares of Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos. Whirlpool Corp. tumbled after lowering its profit outlook. Under Armour Inc. sank as its forecast renewed slowdown concern. JetBlue Airways Corp. fell after reporting profit that missed estimates. Procter & Gamble and United Technologies climbed after their results beat forecasts. A two-day lull for European equities ended as Novartis AG led drugmakers down after saying its profit fell for a seventh straight quarter while Italian lenders slumped. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.4 percent, erasing an earlier advance. Miners jumped to their highest level since August 2015, tracking a rally in metal prices. Most emerging-market stocks retreated as Brazilian consumer companies fell on prospects for a slower-than-expected reduction in borrowing costs, outweighing gains in commodity producers from South Africa to China. Commodities Oil fell 1.1 percent in New York. Output cuts aren’t “an option for us,” said Russia’s envoy at OPEC, Vladimir Voronkov, according to Interfax. U.S. crude supplies probably rose 2 million barrels last week, a Bloomberg survey showed before Energy Information Administration data Wednesday. “The nonsense around the production agreement comes in and out of the market,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “It’s coming out of oil today because of the Russian statements, which come after Iraq made it clear that they weren’t going to make a cut.” West Texas Intermediate for December delivery slipped 56 cents to $49.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for December settlement dropped 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.79 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Arabica coffee, the mild-tasting bean type favored by Starbucks Corp., surged to the highest since February 2015 after Brazil’s largest producer cut its export estimate for 2016 amid rising domestic consumption and the effects of drought. Gold rallied on speculation that demand will accelerate before the Diwali religious festival in India, the world’s second-biggest buyer of the metal. Industrial metals surged as increasing profits at Chinese steelmakers and gains in global manufacturing boosted speculation that demand will improve. Currencies The pound rebounded from its lowest level since the flash crash earlier this month after Carney said there were limits to officials’ willingness to look beyond an overshoot of their inflation target. Sterling fell 0.4 percent at $1.2186, after earlier slumping 1.3 percent. “The comments by Carney do highlight that the latest sterling selloff is starting to worry policy makers as it brings closer the risk of stagflation,” said Valentin Marinov, head of Group-of-10 currency strategy at Credit Agricole SA’s corporate- and investment-banking unit in London. Bloomberg’s Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, fell 0.1 percent after rising to the highest in seven months. South Africa’s rand led gains in emerging markets amid a rally in metals. Russia’s ruble rose as companies lined up to make payments before a tax deadline. Chile’s peso rallied amid speculation of a change of government next year and as copper prices surged. Bonds A gauge of expected price swings in Treasuries fell to the lowest since December 2014 before the Fed meets next week as traders see a clearer outlook for monetary policy in the U.S. and abroad. "No one’s expecting anything from the Fed’s meeting next week," said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. "People are looking for a December rate hike. Even with the presidential election, people are comfortable with rates." The benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield was little changed at 1.76 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. A $26 billion two-year Treasury auction drew the weakest demand since July. Austria sold 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of bonds due in November 2086 via banks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The sale follows this year’s century bond offerings from Belgium and Ireland, as well as 50-year deals from France, Italy and Spain, as countries take advantage of historically low interest rates to issue ultra-long debt.

Last week, the first piece of equipment arrived and officials say they'll begin using it in just a few weeks.  "Every commercial airliner has a skeleton or a backbone made up of titanium 'legos' for lack of more technical description, and this is one of them. So, we've engaged Boeing, Airbus, aerospace companies like General Electric," said Warren Boley, Norsk Titanium CEO. Norsk produces aerospace technology using titanium printing. Officials say Governor Andrew Cuomo, D-New York, encouraged the company to expand to Plattsburgh and included over $100 million dollars in the state budget to help with the project.  The company plans to hire over 400 people in the next two years for various positions.  "So, basically when you look at our machines, you get the printed part out, and it still has to run through a whole supply chain, being from heat treated, to machined and tested, so that is my responsibility. Doing it in Europe as well as in the U.S.," said Andrea Clark, Norsk supply chain manager. Norsk has already begun the hiring process and has several employees training in Norway. Officials say they also plan to do training on-site in Plattsburgh.  "I get phone calls every day. I get emails every day. Everybody's very excited about any kind of positions that are available for certain roles in the company," said Shannon Birkett, Norsk human resources generalist.  Officials say one building will serve as their temporary facility until they can finalize plans and construct a new one at the former Clinton County Airport. For now, they've got one working machine here, and they plan to bring many more. Boley says he has no doubt that the facility will be a success. They've already got interest from companies waiting to purchase their products.  "In this application, structural titanium, we really stand alone. We're the leader. So we have large, aerospace, OEMs, very interested in when this facility is going to exist and when that facility down the street is going to exist," said Boley. Boley says the main facility at the former Clinton County Airport is expected to begin construction in April and should be up and running by mid-2018.

First images emerge of radical electric vehicle that can take off and land vertically - and even hover Zee.Aero is testing its craft in Hollister at a secret base Small, all-electric plane can take off and land vertically One of two private investments Page believed to have made in flying cars By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 14:19 EST, 24 October 2016 | Updated: 14:37 EST, 24 October 2016 e-mail 192 shares 6 View comments While he may be better known as a self driving car enthusiast, a new video has given a glimpse of Google co-founder Larry Page's secretive self flying car project. Earlier this year it was revealed Page appeared to be privately investing in two separate flying car firms, providing them with $100m. Now, of of the prototype craft has been spotted at a remote airfield in California - and locals say they have even seen it hovering above the ground.   Scroll down for video  The zee.aero prototype has been spotted at the firm's secretive test lab in Hollister, and was spotted because of its strange shape and ability to hover. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, he has personally provided £70 million ($100 million) to two startups developing the technology, and now one of the first prototypes has been spotted. He has reportedly been funding Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk, two rival companies based in California's Silicon Valley. Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car.

Share this article Share 192 shares A patent from 2011 emerged earlier this year showing its designs for a flying car, and Bloomberg reported it is now pursuing a 'simpler, more conventional-looking design.' Now, it has relocated to Hollister - and its new design has been spotted by locals. The attention grabbing plane has a high pitched, electric whine, they say. Video courtesy: Mercury News  'It sounded like an electric motor running, just a high-pitched whine,' Steve Eggleston, assistant manager at an airplane-parts company with offices bordering the Hollister Municipal Airport tarmac, told Bay Area News. It has also been spotted hovering by saleswoman Brittany Rodriguez thought to herself.  During both Zee.Aero flights witnessed by DK Turbines staff from several hundred yards away in September and October, the aircraft hovered about 25 feet off the ground, and landed rapidly, straight down, according to the witnesses. Google's company's co-founder, Larry Page appears to be secretly investing in flying cars. According to Bloomberg Businessweek , Page has personally provided £70 million ($100 million) to two startups developing the technology. In May, the cityapproved a 34-year lease with Zee.Aero for just under an acre of land near the intersection of the municipal airport's two landing strips.  It plans  to build a 14,000-square-foot hangar and office building, plus nearly 10,000 square feet of employee parking and 16,000 square feet of paved area for aircraft parking and movement. Zee.Aero have kept their designs very much under wraps, with the only information on their website stating: 'We're designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.'  However, it has been reported that Zee.Aero has hired aerospace designers and engineers from Nasa, Boeing, and SpaceX, and has been testing two single-seater prototype designs - one that looks like a 'small conventional plane' and another with propellers along the sides. Zee.Aero have kept their designs very much under wraps, with the only information on their website stating: 'We're designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.' One of the patents depicts a car-sized aircraft, wings at the nose and tail, and along the top eight propellers, driven by eight motors, for vertical lift.  Two other propellers on the rear wing would provide forward thrust.  Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car. Pictured is a Zee.Aero patent from 2011 THE FLYING CAR COMPANIES Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car.  While there was much speculation that the company was affiliated to Google, as their headquarters were next door, Zee.Aero fiercely denied the claims. However, it has since been revealed that Zee.Aero belongs to Larry Page, Google's co-founder.  Zee.Aero now employs close to 150 people. Its operations have expanded to an airport hangar in Hollister, where a pair of prototype aircraft takes regular test flights. In 2015 a second competing flying-car startup called Kitty Hawk, also began operations in its headquarters very near Google's.  Despite the apparent rivalry, Bloomburg have reported that Mr Page, has in fact been putting money into both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Last week, an aircraft was spotted being towed down the runway on two consecutive days, although no hovering or flying was observed by witnesses. Dual propellers in the rear fit with the description and drawings from the patent, but the aircraft appeared to have a single main wing, with pod-like structures beneath it, rather than the smaller wings at the front and rear shown in the drawings.   Job ads on the firm's sight also confirm it is sticking with propellors, saying 'The aerodynamics group is responsible for supporting airframe design, propeller design, performance and stability analysis, handling qualities analysis and flight testing.'  In a May letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the firm said it was building 'an entirely new aircraft that will change personal aviation.' A Zee.Aero spokeswoman said the firm is 'currently not discussing (its) plans publicly.'  In May, the city of Hollister approved a 34-year lease with Zee.Aero for just under an acre of land near the intersection of the municipal airport's two landing strips. According to city documents, the company plans to build a 14,000-square-foot hangar and office building, plus nearly 10,000 square feet of employee parking and 16,000 square feet of paved area for aircraft parking and movement. Page has reportedly been funding Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk, two rival companies based in California's Silicon Valley. Mr Page has demanded that his involvement stay hidden from the public, according to 10 people with intimate knowledge of the company.  According to Bloomberg Businessweek , Google co-founder, Larry Page, has been personally funding two startup companies who are developing flying cars In 2015 a second competing flying-car startup called Kitty Hawk, also began operations in its headquarters close to Google's. According to business filings, Kitty Hawk's president is Sebastian Thrun, th­e head of Google's self-driving car programme and the founder of research division, Google X. Despite the apparent rivalry between the companies, Bloomberg has reported that Page, has in fact been putting money into both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Mr Page and Google declined to speak about Zee.Aero or Kitty Hawk, as did Mr Thrun.  Other companies working on flying cars include Terrafugia. Their TF-X concept car (illustrated) has fold-out wings with twin electric motors attached to each end Bloomberg say that Mr Page's interest in the companies is a personal ambition and he even retained a 'man-cave' at one of the company's headquarters, where he was only referred to as 'GUS' - standing for 'the guy upstairs'. While it is known that both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk have been working on designs for flying cars, the details of their designs are unclear.   Other companies, such as Aeromobil have also been trying to build a flying car Fans of Harry Potter will remember the blue flying car which Harry and Ron use to reach Hogwarts - which was of course, fueled by magic. But flying cars that run in our real world could be closer than you think Other companies, such as Terrafugia have also been trying to build a flying car, but have given suggested launch dates of 10 years from now in 2026.  However, technology is ever improving, and with access to better materials and autonomous navigation systems, it is thought that within the next few years we will have a self-flying car that takes off and lands vertically.  Speaking to Bloomberg, Mark Moore, an aeronautical engineer from Nasa, said: 'Over the past five years, there have been these tremendous advances in the underlying technology.  'What appears in the next 5 to 10 years will be incredible.'   Read more: Welcome to Larry Page’s Secret Flying Car Factories - Bloomberg Google co-founder’s reported ‘flying car’ spotted hovering in Hollister Google co-founder's reported 'flying car' spotted hovering in Hollister Share or comment on this article e-mail 192 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

(AP) — Raytheon Co . says that if it gets an Air Force contract to build 350 training jets, its assembly plant will be in Mississippi. The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company announced Monday that it has a shovel-ready site in Meridian. "We anticipate the Meridian facility will create hundreds of new jobs," spokesman B.J. Boling said in an email. A Raytheon radar factory in Forest, Mississippi, has about 800 employees, according to a news release from Mississippi's congressional delegation. Three other international partnerships are competing: Northrop Grumman Corp. and BAE Systems; Boeing and Saab AB; and Lockheed Martin and Korean Aerospace Industries Ltd. Raytheon's principal partners are Leonardo-Finmeccanica, CAE USA and Honeywell Aerospace. The Air Force has said it expects to award contracts next fall. It is expected to formally ask for proposals in December, Boling wrote. Boeing and Northrop Grumman say they have built all-new planes for the competition. Lockheed Martin and Raytheon say their entries are upgrades of existing planes. The Air Force released requirements for what it calls the T-X trainer project in March. The current trainer, Northrop Grumman's T-38, was first built in 1961. It can be used to teach only six of 18 advanced pilot training tasks, and fewer than 75 percent of the 431 planes are usable, the Air Force said. "New, cutting-edge training aircraft are critical to our national security, and I am confident that Mississippi workers can help provide those planes," U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and its defense subcommittee, said in the delegation's news release. "I look forward to this competition and I am excited that Meridian may play an expanded role in defense of our nation." Other members of Mississippi's delegation were equally enthusiastic. "Mississippi's talent base is as skilled and prepared for high-tech manufacturing jobs as any in the nation and this is further proof of that," said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, a Democrat.

In 2.26pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.9 percent. In 2.11pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.4 percent. “It's been a pretty good quarter for earnings so far and we might finally see the end of earnings recession," Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas, told Reuters. “If you look at the companies that have reported so far, most of them have outperformed the long-term average in profit and revenue,” Frederick noted. The Dow rose as gains in shares of Microsoft and those of Boeing, recently trading 2 percent and 1.6 percent higher respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Chevron and those of Merck, recently down 1 percent and 0.7 percent respectively. Shares of AT&T traded 1.8 percent lower after the company said it agreed to Time Warner in a deal worth US$85.4 billion. Shares of Time Warner last traded 2.5 percent lower at US$87.27, compared with AT&T’s US$107.50 a share’s offer. Investors “expect bad things to happen in Washington,” Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics, told Bloomberg. “Investors are sceptical of the deal being consummated.” Shares of Restaurant Brands International dropped after the owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons posted disappointing quarterly results, underpinning signs of weakness in the fast-food industry. Burger King’s same-store sales rose 1.7 percent in the quarter, while Tim Hortons’ comparable sales increased 2 percent, the company said in a statement. Both were short of analysts’ expectations and a slowdown from the year-earlier quarter. Shares of Restaurant Brands International traded 4.2 percent lower as of 1.18pm in New York. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day at 344.26, a little lower from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.5 percent. France’s CAC 40 Index gained 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.5 percent. Syngenta shares slid on concern that China National Chemical Corp’s US$43 billion takeover of the Swiss company risks regulatory delays in the European Union, Bloomberg reported. ChemChina didn’t submit so-called remedies in the EU’s early-stage review of the deal by the October 21 deadline, leaving the bloc until October 28 to decide whether to approve the deal without any strings attached or open an extended "phase two" probe that could add at least another four months to a decision, according to Bloomberg Syngenta shares closed 5.8 percent lower in Zurich.

Rockwell Collins to buy B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion Associated Press Twitter Facebook Email Reddit NEW YORK – The move by Rockwell Collins Inc. to buy B/E Aerospace Inc. will combine two of the biggest suppliers to airplane makers and airlines. Rockwell announced Sunday that it will pay $6.4 billion to buy its rival, a 22.5 percent premium over B/E’s closing stock price on Friday. In afternoon trading Monday, shares of Rockwell fell almost 6 percent while B/E shares jumped almost 16 percent. Rockwell said the deal will diversify its offerings to plane manufacturers and airlines. Rockwell sells avionics and electronics systems used in airline, business and military jets. B/E, based in Wellington, Florida, makes aircraft cabin interiors including seating, storage and lavatory systems. Rockwell Collins, which is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said that with B/E, it will nearly double the value of systems it sells for new single-aisle planes by Boeing and Airbus and triple its components in bigger two-aisle planes that are often used on international routes. The stock and cash deal needs approval by shareholders of both companies and by regulators. It is expected to close next spring. Raymond James analyst Harry Breach said the sale added to a slowly rising number of deals in the aerospace industry, including recent Rockwell acquisitions to add expertise in in-flight connectivity and entertainment. Still, Breach said, despite expected cost savings from combining Rockwell and B/E, “we cannot clearly see the strategic synergy here.” Cowen and Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr called the deal “a good fit” but said it was “a bit pricey.” He said B/E’s strong relationships with airline customers would complement Rockwell’s strength with business jet and military customers. Rockwell said the deal will save about $160 million in overlapping spending and boost earnings per share within a year. If the deal is completed, Rockwell will have nearly 30,000 employees about $8 billion in annual revenue. Rockwell will pay $34.10 in cash and $27.90 in its stock for each B/E share. It will also assume $1.9 billion in B/E debt.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad U.S. stocks, dollar rise; oil briefly slips below $50 By Reuters Published: 17:14 EST, 24 October 2016 | Updated: 17:14 EST, 24 October 2016 e-mail By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Monday, with the S&P 500 hitting a two-week high on the back of strong earnings and a flurry of deal activity, while the U.S. dollar hovered near a nine-month peak against other world currencies. However, Canada's main stock index unofficially closed 0.11 percent lower as oil and gold prices weighed on shares of energy and mining companies, offsetting gains by financial firms. Merger and acquisition activity spurred Wall Street, headed by Saturday's announcement by telecommunications company AT&T Inc that it plans to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion in what would be the world's biggest deal this year. Strong quarterly earnings also boosted investor confidence. Third-quarter earnings are expected to increase 1.1 percent after four consecutive quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters data. More than a third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights such as Apple and Boeing. "Consensus is earnings are going to continue to improve in part due to favorable energy prices and to strong consumption patterns here in the U.S.," said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel Nicolaus in Florham Park, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 77.32 points, or 0.43 percent, to 18,223.03, the S&P 500 gained 10.17 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,151.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.43 points, or 1 percent, to 5,309.83. The greenback rose on expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase in December. Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar was up slightly at 98.775, just off a roughly nine-month high of 98.846 touched earlier on Monday. The dollar also briefly hit a one-week high against the yen. Gold prices slipped 0.16 percent to $1,264.27 an ounce by 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on the stronger dollar and interest rate hike speculation. Oil started lower after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries deal to cut production. Prices fell as much as 2 percent on news that Britain's Buzzard oilfield will restart on Tuesday or Wednesday, but later recovered slightly. U.S. crude slid below $50 per barrel for the first time since Oct. 18, which triggered technical selling. Brent, the international benchmark for crude, settled down 32 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $51.46 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 33 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $50.52. AT&T and Time Warner closed sharply lower, down 1.68 percent and 3.06 percent, respectively. Wall Street signaled skepticism that AT&T would secure the government approvals needed to carry out its acquisition. Spain's IBEX index led gains in Europe on signs that 10 months of political deadlock could end. The impasse has paralyzed government in one of the countries worst-hit by the euro zone's debt crisis. U.S. Treasury yields lurched higher, in line with a rise in global bond yields, with traders seeing little action ahead of next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.

Sir: A couple of days back, a Pakistani airline, Serene Air, started its operations with three Boeing aircrafts. I applaud it as a great initiative by a private company to serve the nation. It has been granted a license only for domestic purposes for the next two years by the PCAA and would, hopefully, soon develop to serve international airs. To operate internationally, the airline requires at least five aircrafts. At present, however, Serene would start its flights between Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar and Multan. I hope that this marvellous opportunity would help lessen the menace of unemployment while also increasing our revenue and boosting our economy. Pakistan should launch more airlines on domestic routes to ensure that these air carriers would benefit passengers with lower fares and an improved quality of service.

GovCon Index gainers outnumbered laggers at a 5-to-1 ratio and nine of its 11 S&P 500 companies advanced with co-listed stocks Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) as the GCI’s top two net performers in Monday trade. Lockheed starts third quarter financial reporting season for large GovCon primes before markets open Tuesday and Wall Street analysts expect the world’s largest defense contractor to post $2.86 earnings per share at $11.45 billion in revenue. Wednesday’s batch of third quarter reports includes Boeing, General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC); with Thursday’s slate to come from Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) and L-3 Communications (NYSE: LLL). Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed’s full-year guidance issued in July expects earnings of $12.15-$12.45 per share with $50 billion-$51.5 billion but the company will likely revise its expectations in light of the Aug. 16 spinoff and subsequent merger of its former estimated $5.6 billion government information technology and technical services segment to Leidos Holdings (NYSE: LDOS). The consensus full-year analyst forecast for Lockheed has earnings at $11.75 per share and $46.36 billion in revenue, while shares in the F-35 manufacturer have declined 12.88 percent since the deal’s closure. Defense platform and government services primes Science Applications International Corp. (NYSE: SAIC), General Dynamics and CACI International (NYSE: CACI) led GCI net advancers after Boeing and Lockheed. SAIC ended as the GovCon Index’s second-best percentage mover after Vectrus (NYSE: VEC) and third-highest ICF (NYSE: ICFI) closed at a new 52-week high. Shares in Rockwell Collins tumbled as the GCI’s worst net performer after the avionics company issued fiscal year 2017 guidance that indicated little organic growth for the 12 month-period from Oct. 1 as it also agreed to purchase cabin electronics maker B/E Aerospace (Nasdaq: BEAV) for nearly $6.4 billion. Rockwell Collins expects the acquisition to add approximately $2.8 billion in revenue, while B/E Aerospace’s stock closed 16.36 percent higher to a 52-week high of $58.89 with volume of 20.2 million shares traded at 23 times the three-month average. Eight S&P 500 sectors advanced with information technology the top performer and telecommunications the largest decliner on news of AT&T’s agreement to purchase Time Warner for at least $85 billion. CNBC reported a strengthening dollar and oil price declines limited gains by U.S. equities that were also spurred by earnings reports from T-Mobile, VF Corp, Restaurant Brands and Kimberly Clark.

Certification testing for the GE9X program will begin in 2017, followed by flight-testing on a flying test bed. Engine certification is expected in 2018. Advertisement GE Aviation (General Electric IW500/6) is forming a joint venture with Praxair Surface Technologies Inc. to develop and produce specialty coatings for current and future turbofan jet engines developed by GE and its joint-venture subsidiary, CFM International. Pierre Lüthi, president of Praxair, promised that PG Technologies LLC (as the joint venture is named) would “take the leadership role in the next generation of coating technology applications, and will invest in new coating production capacity to meet the needs of the burgeoning aviation sector.” The coatings will be custom-developed for the current and future LEAP engines, a CFM International engine produced by GE Aviation for the Airbus A320neo and 737 MAX aircraft; and the GE9X engine, which recently completed its first ground tests. It is destined to power the Boeing 777 wide-body jets.

While you were sleeping: Sentiment lifts Wall St Margreet Dietz Tuesday October 25, 2016 Share Play NBR radio on Wall Street gained on optimism about the outlook for corporate earnings, and a fresh wave of merger activity including AT&T's agreement to buy Time Warner also bolstered sentiment. In 2.26pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.9%. In 2.11pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 0.4%. "It's been a pretty good quarter for earnings so far and we might finally see the end of earnings recession," Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas, told Reuters. "If you look at the companies that have reported so far, most of them have outperformed the long-term average in profit and revenue," MrFrederick noted. The Dow rose as gains in shares of Microsoft and those of Boeing, recently trading 2% and 1.6% higher respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Chevron and those of Merck, recently down 1% and 0.7% respectively. Shares of AT&T traded 1.8% lower after the company said it agreed to Time Warner in a deal worth US$85.4 billion. Shares of Time Warner last traded 2.5% lower at $US87.27, compared with AT&T's $US107.50 a share's offer. Investors "expect bad things to happen in Washington," Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics, told Bloomberg. "Investors are sceptical of the deal being consummated." Shares of Restaurant Brands International dropped after the owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons posted disappointing quarterly results, underpinning signs of weakness in the fast-food industry. Burger King's same-store sales rose 1.7% in the quarter while Tim Hortons' comparable sales increased 2%, the company said in a statement. Both were short of analysts' expectations and a slowdown from the year-earlier quarter. Shares of Restaurant Brands International traded 4.2% lower as of 1.18pm in New York. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day at 344.26, a little lower from the previous close. The UK's FTSE 100 Index fell 0.5%. France's CAC 40 Index gained 0.4%, while Germany's DAX Index rose 0.5%. Syngenta shares slid on concern that China National Chemical Corp's $US43 billion takeover of the Swiss company risks regulatory delays in the European Union, Bloomberg reported. ChemChina didn't submit so-called remedies in the EU's early-stage review of the deal by the October 21 deadline, leaving the bloc until October 28 to decide whether to approve the deal without any strings attached or open an extended "phase two" probe that could add at least another four months to a decision, according to Bloomberg. Syngenta shares closed 5.8% lower in Zurich. (BusinessDesk) Got a question about this story? Leave it in Comments & Questions below. This article is tagged with the following keywords.

Merger and acquisition activity spurred Wall Street, headed by Saturday's announcement by telecommunications company AT&T Inc that it plans to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion in what would be the biggest deal in the world this year if approved by regulators. "The deal activity suggests that companies are feeling positive about the prospects of the economy and that is encouraging," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Strong quarterly earnings also boosted investor confidence. Third-quarter earnings are expected to increase 1.1 percent after four consecutive quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters data. More than a third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights such as Apple and Boeing. Oil started lower after Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries deal to cut production. Prices fell further, as much as 2 percent, before recovering slightly on news that the North Sea field will restart on Tuesday or Wednesday. U.S. crude had slid below $50 per barrel, which triggered technical selling. Brent was down 23 cents, or 0.44 percent, at $51.55 a barrel by 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude settled 33 cents lower at $50.52 after hitting a session low at $49.62 - the first time since Oct. 18 that WTI had traded below $50. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.13 points, or 0.46 percent, to 18,229.84, the S&P 500 gained 10.05 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,151.21 and the Nasdaq Composite added 47.84 points, or 0.91 percent, to 5,305.24. AT&T and Time Warner extended losses, down 1.85 percent and 2.64 percent, respectively. Wall Street signaled skepticism that AT&T would secure the government approvals needed to carry out its acquisition. TD Ameritrade said it would buy privately held Scottrade Financial Services in a deal valued at $4 billion. And little-known China Oceanwide Holdings Group pledged $3.8 billion in a deal to take control of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial. Spain's IBEX index led gains in Europe on signs that 10 months of political deadlock could end. The impasse has paralyzed government in one of the countries worst-hit by the euro zone's debt crisis. Conservative leader Mariano Rajoy was on course to secure a second term in power for his People's Party after the Socialists agreed to abstain in a confidence vote this week. "In the very short term, the formation of a government is good news for Spanish spreads," Rabobank analysts said in a morning note. "However, in the medium term Spain will still be left with a minority government that is likely to face an uphill struggle to pass any legislation." The IBEX was up 1.27 percent, outstripping its German and French equivalents, which closed 0.47 percent and 0.36 percent higher, respectively. U.S. Treasury yields lurched higher, in line with a rise in global bond yields, with traders seeing little action ahead of next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Yields on benchmark German Bunds rallied from three-week lows, while UK bonds rose from one-week troughs. The U.S. dollar hovered near a roughly nine-month high against a basket of major currencies and touched a one-week high against the yen on growing expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase in December.

First images emerge of radical electric vehicle that can take off and land vertically - and even hover Zee.Aero is testing its craft in Hollister at a secret base Small, all-electric plane can take off and land vertically One of two private investments Page believed to have made in flying cars By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 14:19 EST, 24 October 2016 | Updated: 14:37 EST, 24 October 2016 e-mail 192 shares 6 View comments While he may be better known as a self driving car enthusiast, a new video has given a glimpse of Google co-founder Larry Page's secretive self flying car project. Earlier this year it was revealed Page appeared to be privately investing in two separate flying car firms, providing them with $100m. Now, of of the prototype craft has been spotted at a remote airfield in California - and locals say they have even seen it hovering above the ground.   Scroll down for video  The zee.aero prototype has been spotted at the firm's secretive test lab in Hollister, and was spotted because of its strange shape and ability to hover. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, he has personally provided £70 million ($100 million) to two startups developing the technology, and now one of the first prototypes has been spotted. He has reportedly been funding Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk, two rival companies based in California's Silicon Valley.

Video courtesy: Mercury News  'It sounded like an electric motor running, just a high-pitched whine,' Steve Eggleston, assistant manager at an airplane-parts company with offices bordering the Hollister Municipal Airport tarmac, told Bay Area News. It has also been spotted hovering by saleswoman Brittany Rodriguez thought to herself.  During both Zee.Aero flights witnessed by DK Turbines staff from several hundred yards away in September and October, the aircraft hovered about 25 feet off the ground, and landed rapidly, straight down, according to the witnesses. Google's company's co-founder, Larry Page appears to be secretly investing in flying cars. According to Bloomberg Businessweek , Page has personally provided £70 million ($100 million) to two startups developing the technology. In May, the cityapproved a 34-year lease with Zee.Aero for just under an acre of land near the intersection of the municipal airport's two landing strips.  It plans  to build a 14,000-square-foot hangar and office building, plus nearly 10,000 square feet of employee parking and 16,000 square feet of paved area for aircraft parking and movement. Zee.Aero have kept their designs very much under wraps, with the only information on their website stating: 'We're designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.'  However, it has been reported that Zee.Aero has hired aerospace designers and engineers from Nasa, Boeing, and SpaceX, and has been testing two single-seater prototype designs - one that looks like a 'small conventional plane' and another with propellers along the sides. Zee.Aero have kept their designs very much under wraps, with the only information on their website stating: 'We're designing, building, and testing better ways to get from A to B.' One of the patents depicts a car-sized aircraft, wings at the nose and tail, and along the top eight propellers, driven by eight motors, for vertical lift.  Two other propellers on the rear wing would provide forward thrust.  Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car. Pictured is a Zee.Aero patent from 2011 THE FLYING CAR COMPANIES Zee.Aero was set up in 2010, working on a small, all-electric plane that could take off and land vertically – essentially a flying car.  While there was much speculation that the company was affiliated to Google, as their headquarters were next door, Zee.Aero fiercely denied the claims. However, it has since been revealed that Zee.Aero belongs to Larry Page, Google's co-founder.  Zee.Aero now employs close to 150 people. Its operations have expanded to an airport hangar in Hollister, where a pair of prototype aircraft takes regular test flights. In 2015 a second competing flying-car startup called Kitty Hawk, also began operations in its headquarters very near Google's.  Despite the apparent rivalry, Bloomburg have reported that Mr Page, has in fact been putting money into both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Last week, an aircraft was spotted being towed down the runway on two consecutive days, although no hovering or flying was observed by witnesses. Dual propellers in the rear fit with the description and drawings from the patent, but the aircraft appeared to have a single main wing, with pod-like structures beneath it, rather than the smaller wings at the front and rear shown in the drawings.   Job ads on the firm's sight also confirm it is sticking with propellors, saying 'The aerodynamics group is responsible for supporting airframe design, propeller design, performance and stability analysis, handling qualities analysis and flight testing.'  In a May letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the firm said it was building 'an entirely new aircraft that will change personal aviation.' A Zee.Aero spokeswoman said the firm is 'currently not discussing (its) plans publicly.'  In May, the city of Hollister approved a 34-year lease with Zee.Aero for just under an acre of land near the intersection of the municipal airport's two landing strips. According to city documents, the company plans to build a 14,000-square-foot hangar and office building, plus nearly 10,000 square feet of employee parking and 16,000 square feet of paved area for aircraft parking and movement. Page has reportedly been funding Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk, two rival companies based in California's Silicon Valley. Mr Page has demanded that his involvement stay hidden from the public, according to 10 people with intimate knowledge of the company.  According to Bloomberg Businessweek , Google co-founder, Larry Page, has been personally funding two startup companies who are developing flying cars In 2015 a second competing flying-car startup called Kitty Hawk, also began operations in its headquarters close to Google's. According to business filings, Kitty Hawk's president is Sebastian Thrun, th­e head of Google's self-driving car programme and the founder of research division, Google X. Despite the apparent rivalry between the companies, Bloomberg has reported that Page, has in fact been putting money into both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk. Mr Page and Google declined to speak about Zee.Aero or Kitty Hawk, as did Mr Thrun.  Other companies working on flying cars include Terrafugia. Their TF-X concept car (illustrated) has fold-out wings with twin electric motors attached to each end Bloomberg say that Mr Page's interest in the companies is a personal ambition and he even retained a 'man-cave' at one of the company's headquarters, where he was only referred to as 'GUS' - standing for 'the guy upstairs'. While it is known that both Zee.Aero and Kitty Hawk have been working on designs for flying cars, the details of their designs are unclear.   Other companies, such as Aeromobil have also been trying to build a flying car Fans of Harry Potter will remember the blue flying car which Harry and Ron use to reach Hogwarts - which was of course, fueled by magic. But flying cars that run in our real world could be closer than you think Other companies, such as Terrafugia have also been trying to build a flying car, but have given suggested launch dates of 10 years from now in 2026.  However, technology is ever improving, and with access to better materials and autonomous navigation systems, it is thought that within the next few years we will have a self-flying car that takes off and lands vertically.  Speaking to Bloomberg, Mark Moore, an aeronautical engineer from Nasa, said: 'Over the past five years, there have been these tremendous advances in the underlying technology.  'What appears in the next 5 to 10 years will be incredible.'   Read more: Welcome to Larry Page’s Secret Flying Car Factories - Bloomberg Google co-founder’s reported ‘flying car’ spotted hovering in Hollister Google co-founder's reported 'flying car' spotted hovering in Hollister Share or comment on this article e-mail 192 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

Nasa engineers are working to develop a plane whose wings can change shape during flight, boosting their efficiency. Their adaptive design includes a hinge that enables the wings to fold by as much as 75 degrees during flight, which could reduce drag and improve how it handles in the air. Scroll down for video  Nasa engineers are working to develop a prototype folding wing concept. By tweaking the shape of the wing a few degrees in flight, pilots could find the optimal position - which could prove key to stability in hypersonic flight. Pictured is prototype for testing the concept SPANWISE ADAPTIVE WINGS Nasa engineers are working with Boeing and Area-I to develop a prototype of its folding wing concept. Folding wings have been used for decades as a means of reducing the space aircraft take up on aircraft carriers and in hangers. The approach was also incorporated into a US nuclear bomber in the 1960s, the XB-70 Valkyrie, but only the tips folded during flight. Engineers hope that their spanwise adaptive wing (SAW) concept will bring folding wings into the 21st century with new technology and materials. They believe that by tweaking the shape of the wing by a few degrees in flight, pilots could find the optimal position to cut through the air with less drag and generate more lift - which could prove key to stability in hypersonic flight. Folding wings have been around since the 1940s, used as a means of reducing the space aircraft take up when they are on the ground, crucial when space is at a premium, such as on aircraft carriers. Engineers from Nasa’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California are working with teams from the Langley Research Center in Virginia, and Glenn Research Center in Ohio to develop the concept for aircraft in flight, called the spanwise adaptive wing (SAW). By tweaking the shape of the wing by a few degrees, pilots could find the optimal position to cut through the air with less drag and generate more lift. Just as the flaps on a commercial aircraft switch between take-off and landing, the wings on the Saw concept would use a hinge to tilt and improve performance. ‘Ideally, we would be able to take that portion of the wing and articulate it up or down to the optimal flight condition that you’re in,’ said Nasa’s Matt Moholt, principal investigator for Saw. ‘So let’s say you’re a condition that requires a climb-out. The optimal position might be up 15 degrees or down 15 degrees, and you would be able to get that.’ The folding wing approach was incorporated onto a US nuclear bomber in the 1960s, the XB-70 Valkyrie, but only the tips folded during flight.

Share this article Share 99 shares Nasa’s vision would look to bring the approach into the 21st Century using modern technology and materials. ‘We are revisiting folding-wing aircraft because new technologies that did not exist in the 1960s allow actuation to be put in tighter wings, in smaller volumes,’ added Moholt. Folding wings have been used for decades, mainly to reduce space on the ground. But thr technology was also incorporated into a US nuclear bomber in the 1960s, the XB-70 Valkyrie (pictured), but only the tips folded during flight ‘Now you can articulate a very small, thin [aerofoil], whereas before the actuator technology didn’t exist.’ Advanced actuation could potentially provide a compact, lightweight design which minimises stress experienced by the wings. Beyond standard aircraft, the team believes the adjustable wing design could help planes travelling at supersonic and hypersonic speeds to fly more efficiently. Once through the sound barrier, aircraft experience more lift but also more yaw – the twisting motion where the tail swings from side to side. Engineers hope that their spanwise adaptive wing (SAW) concept (illustrated) will bring folding wings into the 21st century with new technology and materials By adjusting the shape during flight the Saw concept could reduce this wobble, providing greater stability at higher speeds. Nasa has not provided hard details on how the folding system would work, but that it would be an extension of previous solid state systems, driven by electric motors. The aerospace agency is working with Boeing and Area-I to develop a prototype. Once developed, the technology will be tested on a scale model called Ptera, fitted with a full suite of instruments to measure the effect of inflight folding.  NASA'S SHAPE-SHIFTING WINGS  Last year Nasa revealed a number of test flights had taken place for craft using a shape-shifting wing technology called Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE). The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys from Ann Arbor Michigan. The wing is able to ‘bend’ through angles from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. Test pilots have described it as being ‘very smooth’, while it can also deal with hard banking manoeuvres and extreme temperatures. For all the flights so far, the wing has flown in a fixed position on a Gulfstream III jet between these two extremes, to ensure risk is minimal. At the time, engineers said that future flights would enable the wings to change angles while in the air. The breakthrough could also increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent, and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent.

AT&T was down 1.2 per cent at US$37.03 after the telecommunications company said it would buy Time Warner Inc for US$85.4 billion (RM357.1 billion). If approved by regulators, this would be the biggest deal in the world this year. Time Warner Inc was down 1.8 per cent at US$87.84. Investors are also parsing quarterly earnings reports from companies. More than a third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights such as Apple and Boeing. “M&A activity is generally seen as a bullish trend for the market,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “It’s also been a pretty good quarter for earnings so far and we might finally see the end of earnings recession. If you look at the companies that have reported so far, most of them have outperformed the long-term average in profit and revenue.” Third-quarter earnings are expected to increase 1.1 per cent after four consecutive quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 120 S&P companies that have reported earnings, 77.5 per cent have beat analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 per cent. At 10:56am ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 85.19 points, or 0.47 per cent, at 18,230.9, the S&P 500 was up 10.32 points, or 0.48 per cent, at 2,151.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 46.63 points, or 0.89 per cent, at 5,304.04. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology index’s 0.87 per cent rise leading the advancers. The dollar index was little changed at 98.72 against a basket of major currencies, after touching its highest level since early February, last week. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Genworth Financial was down 9.9 per cent at US$4.69 after little-known China Oceanwide Holdings Group pledged US$3.8 billion in a deal to take control of the US insurer. TD Ameritrade fell 2.4 per cent to US$36.20 after it said it would buy privately held Scottrade Financial Services in a deal valued at US$4 billion. B/E Aerospace jumped 15.4 per cent to US$58.43 after aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins said it would buy the company in a deal valued at US$6.4 billion plus the assumption of US$1.9 billion in debt. Rockwell was down 5.7 per cent at US$79.64. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,893 to 920. On the Nasdaq, 1,808 issues rose and 768 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 92 new highs and 25 new lows. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal (VIDEO) Analysts say Trump stocks rally could persist All bullish in the end as US stocks post best week since 2014 US stocks halt rally spurred by election as Trump win assessed Dow hits record high as markets ride on Trump win Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK NEW YORK Aircraft electronics supplier Rockwell Collins (COL.N) said on Monday its $6.4 billion acquisition of interiors maker B/E Aerospace Inc (BEAV.O) will boost sales and spur new products, helping offset sluggish demand for equipment in new business and commercial jets. But investors and industry experts voiced skepticism about the deal, sending Rockwell's stock down 6.9 percent to $78.63, while B/E Aerospace shares rose 15.5 percent to $58.44, reflecting the bid premium. Rockwell's acquisition, announced on Sunday, would triple its sales of equipment in new-generation widebody jetliners such as the Boeing (BA.N) 787 and Airbus (AIR.PA) A350, and "nearly double our position in the narrowbodies," Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said on a conference call with analysts, referring to top-selling jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The companies have little product overlap, with Rockwell best known for avionics, flight controls and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems. But Rockwell's plan to wire digital sensors and electronics into the galleys, lavatories and seats that B/E Aerospace drew some skepticism from industry experts. Lavatories and galleys are not items airlines typically use as selling points to customers. "If you're making a lavatory higher tech, it's got to improve customers experience or reduce cost," said Phil Toy, a managing director at aerospace consulting firm AlixPartners. The combination is expected to produce annual cost savings of $160 million, with 90 percent captured in the first full year, and provide a double-digit percentage boost to per-share earnings in the first full year, the companies said. Rockwell's acquisition - which is expected to be completed next spring - also underscores rising competition for lucrative aftermarket sales, which involves spare parts and services, a business that Boeing and Airbus also are pursuing. Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell Collins could benefit as leases expire on numerous widebody aircraft and the planes need interior upgrades that B/E Aerospace provides. B/E Aerospace earned 40 percent of its 2015 revenue from aftermarket sales and 23 percent from business jet sales. Aftermarket sales also would help offset weakness in other parts of the combined company. Rockwell sees sales to business jet and regional jet makers falling 10 percent to 15 percent in fiscal year 2017.

Daniel Acker Bloomberg i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A supplier of avionics to some Wichita-built business jets and turboprops is about to get much bigger in an $8.3 billion deal announced Sunday. Rockwell Collins – whose avionics can be found in some Bombardier and Cessna Citation business jets as well as Beechcraft King Airs – has entered a definitive agreement to acquire B/E Aerospace, whose products can be found throughout the passenger cabins of Boeing and Airbus jetliners. Rockwell and B/E also have local operations. Rockwell, at 2051 S. Airport Road, operates a service center that employs 155 people and works on Rockwell systems used in business jets and by regional airlines, a company spokeswoman said. B/E Aerospace operates an engineering center at 8110 E. 32nd St. North. Company officials could not be reached Monday for more details on the center that was opened in 2013 and that at one time employed 60 people. The deal includes $6.4 billion in cash and stock and the assumption of $1.9 billion in net debt, Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based Rockwell said in a news release. It also would expand Rockwell’s markets and, Rockwell officials hope, ease the company’s exposure to general aviation and business jet manufacturers’ production rate cycles. Florida-based B/E Aerospace’s products include aircraft seating, food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, lighting and oxygen systems, and modular galley and lavatory systems for commercial airliners and business jets. “B/E Aerospace has a leading position in nearly all the segments it serves and a highly visible, long-cycle backlog,” Rockwell CEO Kelly Ortberg said in the release. “Beyond new aircraft deliveries, its $12 billion installed base provides a strong flow of aftermarket retrofit opportunities that balances our current cyclical exposure to OEM production rates.” Rockwell expects the acquisition would result in a company with nearly 30,000 employees and $8.1 billion in annual revenue, based on information as of Sept. 30. The deal is expected to be completed in spring 2017.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St touches two-week high on deals, strong earnings By Reuters Published: 11:18 EST, 24 October 2016 | Updated: 11:18 EST, 24 October 2016 e-mail By Tanya Agrawal Oct 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks touched their highest levels in two weeks as a flurry of deal activity and strong quarterly earnings boosted investor confidence. AT&T was down 1.2 percent at $37.03 after the telecommunications company said it would buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion. If approved by regulators, this would be the biggest deal in the world this year. Time Warner Inc was down 1.8 percent at $87.84. Investors are also parsing quarterly earnings reports from companies. More than a third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights such as Apple and Boeing. "M&A activity is generally seen as a bullish trend for the market," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. "It's also been a pretty good quarter for earnings so far and we might finally see the end of earnings recession. If you look at the companies that have reported so far, most of them have outperformed the long-term average in profit and revenue." Third-quarter earnings are expected to increase 1.1 percent after four consecutive quarters of contraction, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 120 S&P companies that have reported earnings, 77.5 percent have beat analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 63.5 percent. At 10:56 a.m. ET (1456 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 85.19 points, or 0.47 percent, at 18,230.9, the S&P 500 was up 10.32 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,151.48 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 46.63 points, or 0.89 percent, at 5,304.04. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with technology index's 0.87 percent rise leading the advancers. The dollar index was little changed at 98.72 against a basket of major currencies, after touching its highest level since early February, last week. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Genworth Financial was down 9.9 percent at $4.69 after little-known China Oceanwide Holdings Group pledged $3.8 billion in a deal to take control of the U.S. insurer. TD Ameritrade fell 2.4 percent to $36.20 after it said it would buy privately held Scottrade Financial Services in a deal valued at $4 billion. B/E Aerospace jumped 15.4 percent to $58.43 after aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins said it would buy the company in a deal valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. Rockwell was down 5.7 percent at $79.64. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,893 to 920. On the Nasdaq, 1,808 issues rose and 768 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 92 new highs and 25 new lows.

AT&T was down 1.7 percent at $36.84 in premarket trading after the telecommunications company said it would buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion. If approved by regulators, this would be the biggest deal in the world this year. Time Warner Inc was down 0.94 percent at $88.64. "We're looking at a higher opening today with the M&A activity helping the market," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "The deal activity suggests that companies are feeling positive about the prospects of the economy and that is encouraging. A softer dollar is also helping things a little bit this morning." Investors will also be parsing through quarterly earnings reports from companies. More than a third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights such as Apple and Boeing. Third-quarter earnings are expected to increase 1.1 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 116 S&P companies that have reported earnings so far, 79 percent have beat analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 64 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 9.5 points, or 0.45 percent, with 123,145 contracts traded at 8:24 a.m. ET (1224 GMT). Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 29.25 points, or 0.6 percent, on volume of 22,036 contracts. Dow e-minis were up 80 points, or 0.44 percent, with 23,063 contracts changing hands. The dollar index was slightly lower at 98.62 against a basket of major currencies, after touching its highest level since early February last week. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. The S&P 500 and the Dow closed little changed and the Nasdaq advanced on Friday as a record day for Microsoft and earnings from McDonald's helped offset a fall in energy and healthcare shares. Genworth Financial was up 1.7 percent at $5.3 in heavy premarket trading on Monday after little-known China Oceanwide Holdings Group pledged $3.8 billion in a deal to take control of the U.S. insurer. TD Ameritrade rose 0.3 percent to $37.21 after it said it would buy privately held Scottrade Financial Services in a deal valued at $4 billion. B/E Aerospace jumped 16.6 percent to $59.01 after aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins said it would buy the company in a deal valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. Rockwell was down 1.3 percent at $83.50. Oil prices fell on Monday as Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from an OPEC deal to cut production, though losses were capped by Iran saying it would encourage other members to join an output freeze. [O/R] A host of Federal Reserve members are scheduled to speak on Monday, including New York Fed President William Dudley, Fed Governor Jerome Powell, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.

Now, ISIS has turned the tables and scored success by using booby-trapped drones as its own weapons. The terror group's ability to innovate and use small aircraft for nefarious purposes underscores how the off-the-shelf drone technology could supply extremists with a potent platform on our own soil to deliver explosives. Moreover, there is evidence that international terrorists have looked at other ways to weaponize drones and "have been attracted to the high-lethality potential associated with the use of chemical and biological weapons," according to a report released Thursday by the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point "It's an ongoing game of cat and mouse between the offense and defense like you see in a lot of military areas" -Andrew Hunter, Center for Strategic and International Studies "We have to be poised and ready on the U.S. side to innovate whenever a new threat appears, and this is definitely a new threat," said Andrew Hunter, director of the defense-industrial initiatives group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a defense think tank. Islamic State has increasingly been using drones for surveillance and for attempted attacks on the battlefield, particularly against Iraqi forces, according to experts. Earlier this month, a small drone killed two Kurdish soldiers fighting the terror group when an explosive-laden craft unexpectedly detonated after being downed. "It's an ongoing game of cat and mouse between the offense and defense like you see in a lot of military areas," said Hunter. "People have seen this coming. It's sort of a natural extension of the whole IED [or improvised explosive device] threat." Enemy drone swarms In July, the U.S. Army issued a new handbook to raise troop awareness of the threat of multiple swarming drones. "They can be preprogrammed or remotely piloted as an expendable asset at relatively low cost," it stated. "The swarm itself can be used to disrupt our own reconnaissance efforts or overwhelm an entry control point." The military is taking the threat seriously and expects the use of hostile drones to continue. "Coalition forces understand that ISIL is a determined, adaptive and unscrupulous adversary," said a Department of Defense spokesman in a statement. "There is a wide array of technology angles we are looking into — from blocking the electromagnetic spectrum and disrupting control of the device, to physically capturing or disabling the device." Taking 'appropriate precautions' Additionally, the DoD spokesman said they are taking "appropriate precautions to protect Coalition forces and our partners on the ground from the full spectrum of threats in the operating environment so that they can carry out their mission of training, advising and assisting indigenous forces in Iraq and Syria as they work to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat." Closer to home, the threat of a domestic terrorist using an inexpensive hobby drone in an urban area remains real. It's not just for the use of deadly payloads but the Combating Terrorism Center report also discusses how drones could be used "as a diversionary device to channel a crowd to another location where attackers could be lying in wait." "The Department of Homeland Security has ongoing research and development efforts focused on the detection, tracking and interdiction of small Unmanned Aerial Systems," Patrick Carrick, the director of the federal government's Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency within the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement. Experts suggest that the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pose a nuisance threat, too. Rogue drones have been detected around stadiums, nuclear plants, prisons and even interfered with fire emergencies. There also have been drone intrusions in sensitive government locations in the nation's capital, including on the White House lawn. We have ways to deal with the UAV threat, and major U.S. defense companies already known for big-ticket defense systems are active participants in selling the newest anti-drone technology. "There is a need to roll things out here in the U.S. while we're also protecting our soldiers internationally," said Doug Booth, Lockheed Martin's director of business development for cyber and electronic warfare. Lockheed Martin has two anti-drone systems. One, a Star Wars-like laser weapon technology has not been field tested yet. Another is what's known as Icarus, a non-kinetic system that has been fielded and designed to detect, recognize and intercept drones. Source: Boeing Boeing’s anti-drone Compact Laser Weapons System. According to Booth, Lockheed has "a classified customer" for the Icarus system and has conducted several other field exercises for additional customers who are "getting ready to obtain the system." Meanwhile, Boeing shot down its first UAV during a 2007 test aboard a combat vehicle. The company has since made its new drone-killing technology — known as Compact Laser Weapons System — more portable and has demonstrated how it can track and disable UAVs. "We've tried to reduce the size, weight and the footprint of these laser weapons to try to get them down into a size that is more applicable to a modern battlefield," said Rich Choppa, Boeing's director of global sales and marketing for strategic missiles and defense systems. In April, Boeing mounted the anti-drone device on a Stryker armored vehicle made by General Dynamics and shot down over 20 UAVs. Choppa said the test included other targets, and pointed out that it was done at the request of the U.S. Army. "We're on the cusp of the first purchase by the military of these types of systems," said Choppa. "I believe we'll see them on the battlefield." Elsewhere, Raytheon demonstrated a laser weapon system in 2010 that destroyed four drones; it has shown missiles can do the job, too. In addition, there's a Phalanx rapid-fire weapon system capable of countering UAVs. The defense contractor declined comment for this story. Source: Battelle Battelle’s DroneDefender, an anti-drone weapon that can bring down UAVs. There also are several international companies at the forefront of new anti-drone tech. SkyWall, from U.K.-based OpenWorks Engineering, uses a shoulder-mounted weapon that fires a projectile with a net to capture drones. Then there's a "kamikaze" solution known as the Hero-30 from UVision, an Israeli company that uses a suicide drone to find UAV targets and rams into them. Yet another anti-drone system is the Battelle DroneDefender, which uses a radio-jamming "rifle" that severs the link between the drone and controller. DroneDefender could be useful to local and state public safety agencies but the defense contractor said current U.S. law makes electronic jamming illegal to those groups, and only certain federal departments can purchase or use the system. "We have a lot of interest from others, but currently we're not allowed to sell to those folks," said Dan Stamm, one of the inventors of the DroneDefender and manager of counter UAS programs for Battelle. About 100 of the jammer units have been sold to the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security, according to the Ohio-based contractor. A newcomer in the anti-drone market is SkySafe, which is developing its own disruptive technology for taking down drones. In April, the startup raised $3 million in funding from an investor group led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. SkySafe's website says the California-based company is currently seeking testing partners.

AT&T was down 2.5 percent at $36.51 after the telecommunications company said it would buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion. If approved by regulators, this would be the biggest deal in the world this year. Time Warner Inc was down 2.1 percent at $87.53. "The deal activity suggests that companies are feeling positive about the prospects of the economy and that is encouraging," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Investors will also parse quarterly earnings reports from companies. More than a third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights such as Apple and Boeing. Third-quarter earnings are expected to increase 1.1 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 116 S&P companies that have reported earnings so far, 79 percent have beat analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 64 percent. At 9:34 a.m. ET (1334 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 119.09 points, or 0.66 percent, at 18,264.8, the S&P 500 was up 11.65 points, or 0.54 percent, at 2,152.81 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 35.32 points, or 0.67 percent, at 5,292.72. Nine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with industrials index's 0.78 percent rise leading the advancers. The dollar index was slightly lower at 98.60 against a basket of major currencies, after touching its highest level since early February, last week. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. Genworth Financial was down 5.4 percent at $4.93 after little-known China Oceanwide Holdings Group pledged $3.8 billion in a deal to take control of the U.S. insurer. TD Ameritrade fell 1.9 percent to $36.42 after it said it would buy privately held Scottrade Financial Services in a deal valued at $4 billion. B/E Aerospace jumped 16.2 percent to $58.80 after aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins said it would buy the company in a deal valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. Rockwell was down 3 percent at $81.90. Oil prices fell as Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from an OPEC deal to cut production, though losses were capped by Iran saying it would encourage other members to join an output freeze. A host of Federal Reserve members are scheduled to speak on Monday, including Fed Governor Jerome Powell, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,090 to 563. On the Nasdaq, 1,654 issues rose and 533 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and 14 new lows.

Alaska Air said its third-quarter profit fell because of costs related to its planned merger with Virgin. (Mike Siegel/The Seattle Times) Alaska Air Group’s profit fell in the third quarter as it was hit with costs related to its planned purchase of Virgin America. CEO Brad Tilden said he’s “very confident” the $2.6 billion deal will go through, despite a last-minute extension of a regulatory review. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Alaska Air Group CEO Brad Tilden said Thursday he remains “very confident” the company’s proposed $2.6 billion purchase of Virgin America will go through, despite a last-minute extension of an antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice. “We were hoping to get this done a couple of weeks ago. We’re not there quite yet,” Tilden said. “Our hope is we’ll have antitrust clearance soon.” The merger was announced in April. If the Justice Department grants approval, Tilden said the financing is in place and the deal can close quickly. He said he looks forward to the combination making Alaska “an airline with a national footprint and an unmatched ability to serve West Coast travelers.” Most Read Stories ‘Deadliest Catch’ cast member Jake Harris hospitalized; police investigating attack What the national media are saying about Seahawks' 'magnificent' win over Patriots Patriots' Rob Gronkowski has punctured lung according to one report 5,000 Seattle-area students walk out of class to protest election of Trump  WATCH Should California, Oregon and Washington join Canada? #Calexit talk envelops West CoastUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Tilden spoke as Alaska announced third-quarter earnings, which showed net profit down due to costs related to the planned merger. He also noted that due to activity around the Virgin transaction, Alaska has agreed with Boeing to postpone the introduction of its first 737 MAX model from next fall to early 2018. “With so much going on, we wanted more time to bring it into service,” Tilden said. Still, Alaska’s fleet continues to modernize and to grow rapidly as it replaces its older 737-400 jets with larger 737-900ERs. This year, Alaska is adding 19 of those new jets while retiring 10 older models. Next year, it will take a dozen more of the new 737s and retire the last 16 of the older models. The new jets bring the airline much greater fuel efficiency. On a teleconference about the quarter’s results, Chief Financial Officer Brandon Pedersen said that though the 737-900ER has 37 more seats than the 737-400, it burns 910 gallons of fuel per flight hour compared with 940 gallons per flight hour on the older jet. The -900ER “sips fuel like a Prius with wings,” Pedersen said. Andrew Harrison, Alaska’s chief commercial officer, said the airline turned in a solid financial performance in the third quarter. Revenue rose 3.4 percent to $1.6 billion during the quarter, which Harrison contrasted with a revenue contraction in the rest of the airline industry. He said Alaska was able to keep its planes as full as ever despite growing its seat capacity and ever-increasing competition in its markets, not only from Delta — its main rival at Sea-Tac International Airport — but also from American Airlines and low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines. However, competition has lowered fares, so Alaska like other carriers is seeing a reduction in a key financial-performance metric — unit revenue, or the revenue collected per mile for each seat. Unit revenue is down more than 4 percent to 13.97 cents per available seat mile, compared with 14.61 cents a year ago. Alaska’s net profit in the quarter was $256 million, or $2.07 a share, down from $274 million, or $2.14 per share, last year. Excluding $22 million in merger-related costs and smaller fuel-hedge adjustments, net profit was $272 million, or $2.20 per diluted share. The total was slightly down from an adjusted net profit a year ago of $277 million. However, due to a buyback of 5 million shares in the quarter, the adjusted per-share profit was up just shy of 2 percent from $2.16 a year ago. Adjusted net earnings per share beat the consensus estimate among Wall Street analysts, which according to data from First Call was $2.09 per share. Alaska’s shares rose $1.83, or 2.49 percent, Thursday, closing at $75.29. Harrison also gave an update on the plan to introduce a premium class on some Alaska routes — offering extra leg room and other benefits at an additional cost. He said 61 jets will be converted by year-end and Alaska will start selling premium-class tickets in early November for travel starting Jan. 5.

AT&T was down 1.7 percent at $36.84 in premarket trading after the telecommunications company said it would buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion. If approved by regulators, this would be the biggest deal in the world this year. Time Warner Inc was down 0.94 percent at $88.64. "We're looking at a higher opening today with the M&A activity helping the market," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "The deal activity suggests that companies are feeling positive about the prospects of the economy and that is encouraging. A softer dollar is also helping things a little bit this morning." Investors will also be parsing through quarterly earnings reports from companies. More than a third of the S&P 500 components are scheduled to report earnings this week, including heavyweights such as Apple and Boeing. Third-quarter earnings are expected to increase 1.1 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 116 S&P companies that have reported earnings so far, 79 percent have beat analyst expectations, above the long-term average of 64 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 9.5 points, or 0.45 percent, with 123,145 contracts traded at 8:24 a.m. ET (1224 GMT). Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 29.25 points, or 0.6 percent, on volume of 22,036 contracts. Dow e-minis were up 80 points, or 0.44 percent, with 23,063 contracts changing hands. The dollar index was slightly lower at 98.62 against a basket of major currencies, after touching its highest level since early February last week. A strong dollar could dent the earnings of large multinationals. The S&P 500 and the Dow closed little changed and the Nasdaq advanced on Friday as a record day for Microsoft and earnings from McDonald's helped offset a fall in energy and healthcare shares. Genworth Financial was up 1.7 percent at $5.3 in heavy premarket trading on Monday after little-known China Oceanwide Holdings Group pledged $3.8 billion in a deal to take control of the U.S. insurer. TD Ameritrade rose 0.3 percent to $37.21 after it said it would buy privately held Scottrade Financial Services in a deal valued at $4 billion. B/E Aerospace jumped 16.6 percent to $59.01 after aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins said it would buy the company in a deal valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt. Rockwell was down 1.3 percent at $83.50. Oil prices fell on Monday as Iraq said it wanted to be exempt from an OPEC deal to cut production, though losses were capped by Iran saying it would encourage other members to join an output freeze. A host of Federal Reserve members are scheduled to speak on Monday, including New York Fed President William Dudley, Fed Governor Jerome Powell, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans.

Published: 15:47 October 24, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Chicago: Rockwell Collins Inc., with its $6.4 billion (Dh23.51 billion) takeover of B/E Aerospace Inc., is betting big that airplanes will get smarter as everything from lie-flat seats to toilet valves flash data in real time to airline crews and maintenance workers on the ground. The acquisition is the largest in the avionics company’s 83-year history, eclipsing its $1.39 billion takeover of Arinc Inc. in 2013. That deal, just 11 days after Kelly Ortberg was named chief executive officer, gave Rockwell Collins new ways to pipe data into airplanes. With B/E Aerospace, Ortberg gains the largest equipment supplier for aircraft cabins — and the chance to provide reams of new information to airline operators. “It sets us up for the future,” Ortberg said in an interview Sunday. “We’ve made major investments in next-generation airplanes. That trend is going to translate into the interiors of aircraft.” The transaction vastly broadens a product portfolio that has been centred on aircraft communications and computing equipment since Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company was spun out of Rockwell International in 2001. The deal, which is slated to close in early 2017, is the latest in a spate of mergers involving suppliers to Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE, which are squeezing suppliers as they brace for slower growth following a decade-long sales cycle. “It’s an opportunity to build a smarter plane,” Richard Aboulafia, an aerospaceanalyst at Teal Group, said by telephone. “Given the pricing pressure you’ll probably see more deals like this.” B/E Aerospace investors will get $34.10 in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins common stock, for a total consideration of $62 a share, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That’s a 23 per cent premium over B/E Aerospace’s closing price on Friday. With the assumption of $1.9 billion of debt, the purchase comes to $8.3 billion, according to the statement. Shares of Rockwell Collins have fallen 8.5 per cent this year, while B/E Aerospace gained almost 20 per cent.   Luxurious seats: B/E Aerospace is the largest supplier of aircraft cabin equipment, ranging from modular lavatories to luxurious seats as expensive as a Ferrari. On a pro-forma basis, the combined manufacturer would have had almost 30,000 employees, $8.1 billion in revenue and $1.9 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, debt and amortisation for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2016, according to the statement. There is virtually no overlap in the two companies’ product portfolios. “For the most part they are pretty complementary,” Aboulafia said. “Rockwell tends to be on the small planes. B/E on the bigger ones, particularly wide-bodies.” The savings flowing from the merger, pegged at about $160 million, would mostly come from combining suppliers and eliminating overlapping headquarters functions, Ortberg said. Those so-called synergies don’t include the potential boost to sales that would open up when the companies are combined, Ortberg said.   Smart cabin: Rockwell Collins has a base of business-aviation dealers that could offer to retrofit private jets with B/E Aerospace’s interiors. The Wellington, Florida-based company has very strong ties with airline customers that Rockwell Collins may be able to leverage to sell more of its avionics equipment and in-flight entertainment systems. The end result may translate to better in-flight service. For example, sensors in luxury seats in first- and business-class cabins, could notify flight attendants when a passenger is waking up on a long-haul flight and ready for a hot towel or glass of orange juice. “The smart cabin is here,” Amin Khoury, co-founder and chairman of B/E Aerospace, said in an interview Sunday. “It’s not something that may happen in the future. It’s happening now.”   Fourth-quarter earnings: Separately, Rockwell Collins said profit from continuing operations in its fiscal fourth quarter rose to $1.58 a share, up from $1.38 a year earlier, according to a statement on Sunday. Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $1.57, according to the average of 17 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the period rose 4.4 per cent from a year earlier to $1.45 billion, trailing the average analyst estimate of $1.48 billion. Equipment sales were hurt by lower plane maker production rates, including Airbus’s A330 widebody jetliner, the company said. For its 2017 fiscal year, the company said it expects revenue between $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion — that’s on a stand-alone basis, and doesn’t account for the deal with B/E Aerospace. — Bloomberg More from Aviation EasyJet profit falls as currency woes take toll Berkshire bet on the biggest US airlines Etihad starts hiring additional crew Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac Passenger traffic at DWC up 161% Etihad Airways Engineering and Airbus sign MoU Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Air Arabia third quarter net profit rises 26% filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation Also In AviationEasyJet profit falls as currency woes take toll Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Etihad starts hiring additional crew 02Berkshire bet on the biggest US airlines 03Emirates retires last Airbus A330, A340 04Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac 05Etihad Airways Engineering and Airbus sign MoU 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Affordable housing under review in Dubai Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Emiratis in US warned of rising harrasment Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns New Rs500, Rs2,000 notes not in UAE Close Recommended For You UAE: 'We don't want to see any discrimination'PUBLISHED ON Nov 15, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

Carter visited Baghdad and Irbil and met with Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani. The Associated Press has more here: “Carter visited Irbil on Sunday for a closer assessment of the fight against the Islamic State group in northern Iraq and to hear from Kurdish leaders whose forces launched a new offensive in the operation to wrest Mosul from the militants. Story Continued Below “The Pentagon chief said Barzani reported some good news about peshmerga gains against IS in Bashiqa, about 15 miles northeast of Mosul. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, told reporters that the information he has gathered suggests Barzani was correct and that there has been ‘considerable success’ in the town. … Carter said he wants to see military operations to isolate IS fighters in Raqqa, Syria, to begin ‘as soon as possible.’ He said there will be simultaneous operations in Mosul and Raqqa, and that the United States would coordinate in Raqqa with its partners. The U.S. has been working with Syrian rebel fighters.” — KURDS CAPTURE ANOTHER TOWN NEAR MOSUL, reports Reuters’ Saif Hameed and Babak Dehghanpisheh: “Kurdish fighters said they had taken the town of Bashiqa near Mosul from Islamic State on Sunday as coalition forces pressed their offensive against the jihadists' last stronghold in Iraq. Masoud Barzani, President of the Iraqi Kurdish region, told Carter that the Kurds had succeeded in liberating Bashiqa from Islamic State. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters told reporters at the scene that they had entered Bashiqa. Journalists were not being allowed into the town, which lies 8 miles northeast of Mosul.” — TENSIONS RISING BETWEEN IRAQ, TURKEY, writes The New York Times’ Tim Arango and Michael R. Gordon: “A dispute between Iraq and Turkey has emerged as a dramatic geopolitical sideshow to the complicated military campaign to retake Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, from the Islamic State. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has insisted on a role in the battle for Mosul, trying to ramp up an involvement in Iraq that has already alarmed the Iraqi government.” — ISIL’S NEW TACTIC: SULFUR FIRES, The Washington Post’s Kareem Farhim and Thomas Gibbons-Neff have more here: “A fire set by Islamic State militants at a sulfur mine near the city of Mosul in recent days sent plumes of noxious gases over the battlefield, sickening hundreds of civilians and forcing Iraqi and U.S. troops to wear protective masks, health and military officials said on Saturday. Firefighters were still struggling Saturday to put out the blaze at the Mishraq sulfur mine, about 25 miles southeast of Mosul, according to Col. Abdulrahman Al-Khazali, a spokesman for Iraqi Federal Police who visited the mine.” — CARTER’S NEXT STOP ... PARIS: The defense secretary flies to Paris today, where he’ll meet with defense ministers from countries in the coalition fighting the Islamic State and have a press conference with French Defense Minister Jean Yves Le Drian. Carter wraps up his trip later this week in Brussels for a NATO ministerial. KENDALL SAYS COST GROWTH DOWN, PUSHING BACK IN HILL FIGHT OVER ACQUISITION: The Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer says cost growth to weapons programs is at a “30-year low,” citing a new acquisition report out today to fight back against proposed Senate acquisition changes, writes our colleague Ellen Mitchell: “The Senate Armed Services Committee's push to dismantle the position of the Pentagon's top acquisition official would be a ‘mistake’ that could also risk hard-won improvements in the cumbersome and costly process for buying new weapons, according to Frank Kendall, the undersecretary of Defense whose role is in the cross hairs of top lawmakers this year. “Kendall, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics, says the Pentagon's system for buying weapons, vehicles and services is much improved, and the cost growth on major programs is ‘at a 30-year low,’ citing the new 2016 Performance of the Defense Acquisition System report he shared with reporters on Friday in advance of its release Monday. ‘The last six years of work that we’ve put into this while I’ve been back at the Pentagon has paid off,’ Kendall told reporters at a media roundtable to discuss the annual report, part of the Better Buying Power initiative. ‘During the last several years we’ve made, what I think, is pretty dramatic progress in controlling cost growth.’” The full report is here, for Pros. HAPPY MONDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we’re always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback.

MORNING D TRIVIA: Benjamin Braun was the first to correctly answer that the first female officers were commissioned in the Navy on Oct. 15, 1948, thanks to the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act passed several months earlier. Check back Friday for our next trivia question. HAPPENING TODAY — CSIS LAUNCHES SPACE PROJECT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies hosts the first event of its Aerospace Security Project this afternoon. The panel discussion with Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for Space Policy Douglas Loverro and several industry executives will examine how the military can leverage commercial space capabilities and support the space industry. ALSO TODAY: The National Defense Industrial Association kicks off its four-day Systems Engineering Conference in Springfield, Va. The full schedule is here. And the Middle East Institute holds a panel discussion this afternoon on the landscape in next president will face with terrorism and regional turmoil. INDUSTRY INTEL — DEFENSE LOBBYING STAYS FLAT: Lobbying spending for 20 of the largest defense firms was effectively flat in the third quarter, down $230,000 compared to the same three months las year. But it’s shaping up to be a down year on lobbying spending for the industry, as there was no big issue — like the Export-Import Bank reauthorization for Boeing last year — driving the lobbying dollars. Boeing spent the most on lobbying this past quarter at $3.6 million, a $100,000 increase compared with 2015, according to the newly lobbying filings. Lockheed Martin was second at $3.2 million, a $280,000 drop compared with 2015. General Dynamics was third at $2.6 million, followed by Northrop Grumman at $2.5 million and United Technologies at $2 million. — ROCKWELL COLLINS TO ACQUIRE B/E AEROSPACE FOR $6.4 BILLION: Rockwell Collins announced Sunday it will acquire B/E Aerospace, which manufactures aircraft cabin interiors. The deal was struck for $6.4 billion, along with the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt, at $62 billion per share. Rockwell CEO Kelly Ortberg told Reuters that the acquisition will broaden the company’s reach. “B/E is very strong in relationships with airlines,” he said. “We're stronger with aircraft makers as well as business aviation operators and the military. We’ll be able to sell our respective products into a much broader market base than either of us could do independently.” WAR REPORT — CEASE-FIRE EXPIRES IN SYRIA AND FIGHTING RESUMES, writes The Washington Post’s Hugh Naylor and Zakaria Zakaria: “A burst of fighting in the flashpoint Syrian city of Aleppo on Sunday appeared to shatter a unilateral Russian cease-fire, signaling a resumption of the government’s offensive to seize rebel-held areas there. Warplanes — either operated by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government or by Russia, an ally — targeted the opposition neighborhoods of eastern Aleppo on Saturday evening, residents and rebels said. And, they said, pro-government fighters resumed shelling and ground attacks on rebel positions overnight Saturday that continued until Sunday afternoon.” — WHITE HOUSE SKEPTICAL OF PLANS TO SEND MORE WEAPONS TO CIA-BACKED REBELS, reports The Post’s Greg Miller and Adam Entous: “As rebel-held sections of Aleppo crumbled under Russian bombing this month, the Obama administration was secretly weighing plans to rush more firepower to CIA-backed units in ­Syria. The proposal, which involved weapons that might help those forces defend themselves against Russian aircraft and artillery, made its way onto the agenda of a recent meeting President Obama held with his national security team. “And that’s as far as it got. Neither approved nor rejected, the plan was left in a state of ambiguity that U.S. officials said reflects growing administration skepticism about escalating a covert CIA program that has trained and armed thousands of Syrian fighters over the past three years.” TOP TALKER — THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA TROOPS FORCED TO REPAY ENLISTMENT BONUSES, reports the Los Angeles Times' David S. Cloud: “Short of troops to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade ago, the California National Guard enticed thousands of soldiers with bonuses of $15,000 or more to reenlist and go to war. Now the Pentagon is demanding the money back. Nearly 10,000 soldiers, many of whom served multiple combat tours, have been ordered to repay large enlistment bonuses — and slapped with interest charges, wage garnishments and tax liens if they refuse — after audits revealed widespread overpayments by the California Guard at the height of the wars last decade.” WIKILEAKS EMAILS — FLOURNOY WAS ON DECK TO BE NO. 2 AT DoD UNDER GATES: Michele Flournoy, often bandied about as Hillary Clinton’s potential first defense secretary, was the Pentagon’s No. 3 civilian for the first several years of the Obama administration. But she was in the running to be the deputy defense secretary, at least according to a batch of John Podesta’s emails released by WikiLeaks over the weekend. “Michele Flournoy is sole Deputy because [William] Lynn dropped out,” reads an email dated Thursday, Nov. 6, 2008, from Sarah Sewall to Podesta, Denis McDonough, Susan Rice and others. “Are we ok with that as the full complement of leadership for DOD? Seems like a lot for one person day to day.” Lynn ultimately wound up being tapped as the deputy defense secretary, but only after he was granted a waiver from Obama’s ethics rules because he had been a lobbyist. In another email, aides were setting up a meeting between Obama and then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates a week after the election, where they emphasized “ensuring discretion.” Gates remained at the Pentagon into the first two-plus years of the Obama administration. THE FIRST MOSUL CASUALTY — NAVY TECH DIED DIRECTING SEALS, IRAQIS AWAY FROM ROADSIDE BOMB, writes Stars and Stripes’ Tara Copp: “Chief Petty Officer Jason Finan, the Navy explosives ordinance disposal technician who was the first American killed in the battle to retake Mosul from the Islamic State group, died while warning the forces he was supporting about a roadside bomb, the top commander for U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria said Sunday. Finan, 34, died on Oct. 20 from injuries sustained when his own vehicle hit a roadside bomb.” SPEED READ — The Pentagon expects a windfall of intelligence documents from the Islamic State in Mosul: NYT — Turkey’s military strikes both Islamic State and Kurdish targets in Syria: Reuters — The Islamic State’s chemical weapons arsenal is weak but instills fear: Military Times — Airstrikes resume in Yemen as the cease-fire there expires: Reuters — WikiLeaks backers claim credit for a massive cyberattack in the U.S. Friday, but researchers are skeptical: POLITICO — A grand jury indicts a Russian man suspected of hacking LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring: NYT — Russia keeps inching into Georgia on a shifting border: NYT — Palestinians who attended a Jewish holiday celebration are arrested by Palestinian security forces: The Washington Post — Service members doubt the next president can fix the military’s top issues, according to a poll: Military Times — A suicide bomb hits the Somali capital: Reuters — Eighty-three Nigerian soldiers are missing after Boko Haram attacked a remote military base: AP — Russian scientists discover a secret Nazi military base in the Arctic: The Independent — The Defense Department cements its cyber “bug bounty” program: C4isrnet — Rep.

پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Wed 16 November 2016 × Economy Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion 'Aircraft purchase talks reach final stages' News ID: 3804319 - Mon 24 October 2016 - 10:23 Economy TEHRAN, Oct. 24 (MNA) – Iran’s Roads and Urban Development Minister Akhoundi said negotiations on buying Boeing and Airbus aircraft are in final stages and will soon become implemented. On the sidelines of inking six cooperation agreements between Iran and Germany, Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Ahmad Akhoundi said “given that necessary permits from Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have been received, the lucrative deal with Airbus and Boeing companies to buy brand new planes will soon yield fruitful outcomes.” “Several foreign companies have made proposals to establish airliners inside the country,” noted the official underling that tough conditions have been set for presence of foreign investors. He went on to clarify that an airliner capable of offering all services is required to have an initial fund of more than 110 million dollars; “moreover, applicants need to possess skilled and experienced staff while its fleet should not be older than the year 2000.” Akhundi pointed to high willingness of foreign firms saying “several of them have voiced readiness and a number of them, having taken primary licenses, are following up further procedures.” “Capable companies with good financial base and good technical ability are stepping forward to improve the level of Iran’s aviation fleet,” Iran’s road minister concluded.

So this year, the Department of the Interior tried something a little more direct. The agency gave real-time access to data on all active wildfires to two airspace mapping companies as part of a pilot programme. One of those firms, AirMap, worked with drone manufacturer DJI, which created 'geofences' around wildfires. When drones hit the virtual boundary, the geofencing software overrides the flight controller and forces them to hover in place. Any drone deployed inside the barrier won't be able to lift off. "We really want to have this new community of pilots be as responsible as the manned aircraft pilots that came before them," said Mark Bathrick, director of the office of aviation services at the Department of the Interior.   THE PROBLEMS INCREASE   As private drone use has soared, so has concern about keeping the remote-controlled aircraft away from sensitive and high-risk areas such as airports, nuclear power plants and prisons. Those concerns are heightened by high-profile incidents such as the near collision in March of a drone and a Lufthansa jet approaching Los Angeles International Airport. In 2013, a drone crash landed in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a campaign event, and a quadcopter crashed on the White House lawn in 2015. Defence giants Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, as well as a handful of startups, have jumped into the fray, developing technology ranging from detection systems to more disruptive solutions such as software that forces unauthorised drones to go home or land safely, and laser cannons that shoot unwanted drones out of the sky.   BLACK DART   The technology is of interest to commercial users as well as the government. The Department of Defense hosts an annual counterdrone demonstration called Black Dart in which the military, its allies and industry partners can assess current technology and techniques. Earlier this year, the Federal Aviation Administration tested FBI drone-detection technology at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey for a few weeks. Last year, Boeing unveiled its compact laser weapons system, which ignites targeted drones. At a demonstration in California, Boeing said it took only about 15 seconds for its 2-kilowatt laser to disable the drone. Though the counterdrone industry is still nascent, the global market - including both civilian and military uses - could be worth at least several hundreds of millions of dollars, said Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defence at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan. «Tech Times | This is Nintendo's next video game console Women in computing to decline to 22% by 2025, study warns» View the discussion thread.
