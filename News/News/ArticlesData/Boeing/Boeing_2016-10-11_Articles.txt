Boeing/Gail Hanusa Courtesy photo i By Anand Krishnamoorthy and Julie Johnsson Bloomberg LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Boeing landed a deal to sell a dozen 787 Dreamliners to China Southern Airlines, bolstering support for its marquee carbon-fiber jetliner in an otherwise tough market for twin-aisle aircraft. The order by Asia's biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion according to list prices, although carriers typically negotiate discounts. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliner The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing's 787 order tally for the year. The China Southern order also comes a day after Wichita-based Spirit AeroSystems celebrated delivery of its 500th 787 shipset, including the airplane’s forward fuselage that is sent to Boeing with a fully working cockpit. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement Wednesday. The planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2020 and funded using cash and loans from commercial banks, the airline said in the statement. The carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group in the past year as more people fly in the world's most populous nation. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an order for 300 jets valued at $38 billion on a state visit to the U.S. as Chinese carriers expand their fleet in a nation set to become the biggest travel market in two decades. China Southern, the country's first Boeing 787 customer, already flies 16 Dreamliners, according to data the airline released in August. The carrier had a fleet of 684 planes, the largest in Asia, as it caters to a nation that is expected to surpass North America as the world's largest aviation market. Boeing had netted 19 orders for the Dreamliner this year prior to Qatar's announcement, bringing sales for the plane to 1,161. “We’re very proud to be on this program. We’re proud to be Boeing’s partner. We’re proud to be part of the 787 team,” Spirit CEO Tom Gentile said at Spirit’s 500th delivery ceremony Tuesday in Wichita. In addition to the forward fuselage, Spirit makes the 787’s engine pylons, and its fixed and moveable wing leading edges. Airbus’ 787 competitor, the A350, netted 25 sales through the end of September. Both planemakers have contended with slowing demand for widebody aircraft as moderating fuel prices and a glut of used Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 models tempers demand.

Defense One reported that the late September decision to sell $7 billion worth of F-15 fighter jets to Qatar and Kuwait, which had been delayed for over two years by Israeli fears that the weapons would be turned against Jerusalem, was finally allowed to pave the way for a purchase by Qatar Airways of the Boeing jetliners. © AFP 2016/ JIM BOURG / POOL Hillary Clinton's Leaked Emails Show US Aware of Qatar, Saudi Arabia Supporting Daesh The fighter jet sale was widely reported as approved September 28, and the Qatar Airways deal, announced October 7, followed it by just over a week. When asked during a Washington DC news conference the day the purchase was announced whether the sales were connected, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said, “We don’t relate anything to anything. Qatar Airways has an independent policy of ordering airplanes. So nothing is attached to anything.” Qatar had requested 36 F-15 fighter jets, a roughly $4 billion sale, with an option to buy up to an additional 36. The Kuwait sale of 28 Boeing F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets, with an option for up to 40 total, is valued at about $3 billion, Flight Global reports. The airliner deal, for the purchase of 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-ER passenger jets, both long-haul aircraft, is valued at $11.7 billion, according to Boeing. An additional letter of intent to purchase 60 737 MAX 8 aircraft, would add another $6.9 billion to the total. US Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken, former deputy national security adviser to US President Barack Obama, was present at the DC news conference.   © AFP 2016/ FADI AL-HALABI Gulf Arming Syrian Rebels: 'Weapons Will Come From Qatar, Saudi Arabia & UAE' Defense One reported that the Qatar deal had been put on hold while the US negotiated a 10-year, $38 billion security package with Israel for 2018-2028. Defense News reported in February that Israel opposed the Qatar sale, unless the new aid deal included a few billion dollars more to allow Israel to upgrade its own fleet. The new Washington deal for Jerusalem – $3.8 billion a year for 10 years – is a record for defense aid to a country. Defense News reported that Israel was hoping for a deal closer to $50 billion over the same time frame. The sale comes just in time to save Boeing’s 40-year-old F-15 production line, which, it has been reported since 2014, was running out of the orders it needed to keep production going. Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said at the October 7 press conference that the deal would affect more than 100,000 jobs across the US.   US, Israeli, and other officials have accused Qatar of supporting anti-Israel and terrorist groups.  ...

Boeing briefed Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar about KC-46 Pegasus' capabilities during his visit to the US in August. Aditya Bhat   October 12, 2016 22:49 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares Boeing's KC-46 refueling US Air Force's C-17 aircraft.Boeing Boeing has offered military aerial refueling and strategic military transport aircraft, KC-46 Pegasus, amidst growing uncertainty over India's tender for six multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft. The Narendra Modi government had withdrawn a tender for the MRTT aircraft in July. Earlier, another tender won by Airbus for A330 MRTT was also scrapped. Nevertheless, Boeing's representatives were in New Delhi to brief IAF on the aircraft, IAF sources told StratPost. Why advertise with us?

He had visited Boeing's Philadelphia facility. The KC-46 is developed from Boeing 767 commercial jet airliner. The aircraft has multi-role capability, which means it also has the ability to carry passengers, cargo and patients along with its tanker role. US Air Force had awarded its tanker contract to Boeing KC-46 in 2011, in which it is expected to make 179 aircraft units by 2027. Boeing had not participated in both the IAF tenders for MRTT aircraft, but had said that it was willing to offer it to India if selected for the US tanker program. There is no clarity if India would go in for government-to-government contract for the MRTT or if it would reissue the tender. KC-46 has a fuel capacity of 96,265kg and maximum air speed of 650mph. It features two Pratt & Whitney PW 4062 with 289.13 kN thrust. The aircraft features wing air refuelling pods, advanced fly-by-wire refuelling boom, defensive systems like infrared countermeasures, radio frequency warning and night vision lighting, among others.

Because ‘six seconds is more than enough’ Update: DDoS attack on Dyn DNS leaves internet crippled Trends / Space Technology / We can beat SpaceX to Mars – Boeing By Hadlee Simons on 10 October, 2016 HadleeSimons Share SpaceX has made a few big Mars-related announcements, but at least one firm believes it can beat Elon Musk’s company to the Red Planet. Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of Boeing, told a conference (h/t: ScienceAlert) that he believes the first humans on Mars will get there using Boeing’s spaceships. “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg was quoted as saying. Boeing thinks it can beat SpaceX to the Mars punch It wouldn’t be the first time that the aerospace colossus got involved in space matters either, building key parts for the Saturn V rocket that took astronauts to the moon. Boeing is also working on the Space Launch System and CST-100 manned space capsule, both of which are slated for Martian and deep space missions. The SLS is scheduled to undergo its first test flight in 2018. Boeing will have stiff competition from SpaceX though, as the private firm recently revealed its radical Interplanetary Transport System. This was in addition to its manned Dragon V2 space capsule. The SpaceX system is extremely ambitious compared to Boeing’s seemingly brute-force approach. The private firm will make heavy use of reusable designs, as well as in-orbit refuelling. Additionally, SpaceX expects astronauts to create their own fuel from Martian resources for the return journey.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Boeing properly accounted for the costs and expected sales of the 787 Dreamliner and the 747 jumbo aircraft, sources say. (Bloomberg photo by Brendon O'Hagan) Boeing landed a deal to sell a dozen 787 Dreamliners to China Southern Airlines, bolstering support for its marquee carbon-fiber jetliner in an otherwise tough market for twin-aisle aircraft. The order by Asia's biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion according to list prices, although carriers typically negotiate discounts. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliners. The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing's 787 order tally for the year. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement Wednesday. The planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2020 and funded using cash and loans from commercial banks, the Guangzhou, China-based airline said in the statement. The carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group in the past year as more people fly in the world's most populous nation. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an order for 300 jets valued at $38 billion on a state visit to the U.S. as Chinese carriers expand their fleet in a nation set to become the biggest travel market in two decades. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis China Southern, the country's first Boeing 787 customer, already flies 16 Dreamliners on operating and financial lease, according to data the airline released in August. The carrier had a total fleet of 684 planes, the largest in Asia, as it caters to a nation that is expected to surpass North America as the world's largest aviation market. Boeing had netted 19 orders for the Dreamliner this year prior to Qatar's announcement, bringing total sales for the plane to 1,161. Airbus netted 25 sales of the A350, its most advanced jetliner, through the end of September. Both planemakers have contended with slowing demand for widebody aircraft as moderating fuel prices and a glut of used Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 models tempers demand.

NASA is building space habitats in partnership with various private companies to accomplish this. This space habitat by Ixion wants to repurpose a propellant tank into a habitat for humans. Image: Ixion. The article comes two weeks after Elon Musk outlined his plans for making human life interplanetary. Musk had said during his presentation, that his ambitious plans that did not just stop at Mars, was an effort to get more people talking about establishing permanent human settlements on other planets and moons. People are talking about it. A week after Musk outlined his plans, the chief executive officer of Boeing, Dennis Muilenburg revealed his intentions to carry out the first manned mission to Mars. The mission is planned not for research or establishing colonies, but as tourists, as reported by Yahoo. Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Image: Reuters NASA plans to have a manned mission to Mars by 2030. The SpaceX Dragon II is planned to go on a pathfinding mission to Mars to scout out for suitable locations for humans in 2018 and 2020. The cheapest and fastest way to get to Mars is to send spacecraft when Mars and Earth are in particular positions called launch windows. There are launch windows roughly every two years, which could mean that there could be a lot of traffic between Earth and Mars every two years during the launch windows if all the current plans of NASA, SpaceX and Boeing are carried out. The Dragon II will find out on ground conditions. Image: NASA The technical developments to support these missions have moved beyond just spacecraft and rockets. The pioneers on Mars will have to be supported with food, shelter, fuel and waste disposal. NASA plans to provide this support using the resources available locally on Mars. The missions on Mars will have to use a technique called in-situ resource utilization or ISRU. A small propellant plant is planned to be on the first SpaceX colonial ship to Mars. The plant is expected to be expanded over time, over the course of subsequent missions. The idea is to mine the water and carbon dioxide that is abundantly available on Mars, to make cryogenic methane based fuel with superior technical characteristics. NASA also has plans for using locally available resources, and it goes beyond just fuel. The plans for the SpaceX Mars fuel plant. Image: SpaceX The ISRU research is mostly being conducted at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, directed by the former space shuttle astronaut Robert D Cabana. “It was an incredible accomplishment when we went to the moon. We stayed for a couple of days and took some rocks home. We explored,” said Cabana “But, now we want to be pioneers. As pioneers, we will create a sustained human presence in an ever more extreme environment. We now want to go to Mars.” Bob Cabana, Director of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Image: NASA Astronauts going to Mars will take a year to a year and a half to reach the planet and come back, not counting the time spent on the surface. Because of the distance and the few launch windows, there cannot be resupply missions like the ones that regularly go up to the International Space Station. Equipment is being manufactured and tested to harvest resources to make fuel, as well as consumables for the life support systems. The equipment will have to work in extreme and alien conditions. At the poles, the temperature is minus one twenty six degrees Celsius and twenty degrees Celsius at the equator. The machines will have to operate in an atmosphere made up of ninety five per cent carbon dioxide. The Curiosity Rover analysed Martian regolith. Image: NASA The air and soil will be used by Astronauts, even though they are so different from Earth. NASA plans multiple pathfinding missions to identify suitable sites, and make sure that the necessary resources are available when the astronauts need them. The first is an orbiter with instruments on board that will scan Mars for potential landing sites from space. After potential locations are identified, rovers will be sent on the surface to verify the presence of the necessary resources. An image of a carbon dioxide ice cap on Mars captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Similar orbiters may be used to scout the Martian surface for resources. Image: NASA NASA has used the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) have scanned the moon for resource rich sites. NASA is sending a Resource Prospector to the Moon, the first attempt at mining on another celesital body. The Resource Prospector is headed to the poles of the moon, where LCROSS spectacularly crashed into the surface and showed that there was water on the Moon. The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite. Image: NASA Jackie Quinn, project manager for LCROSS said “Our objective is to go to the moon’s poles where the LCROSS and LRO missions told us that what we previously thought was a dry moon is actually a quite moist moon.” The Resource Prospector mission is scheduled for 2020, and will extract hydrogen, oxygen and water. NASA plans to learn more about how to extract resources for fuel, and water from the ice on Mars. A Resource Prospector prototype. Image: NASA Gravity on Mars is sixty two percent lower than that on Earth. This means that excavators do not need to be as bulky as they are on Earth. It also means designing new kinds of excavators for low gravity environments, technology that can potentially be used to mine asteroids as well. The mining on Mars can be done by a NASA robot called Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR). Martian regolith, which is crushed rock devoid of any organic matter, can potentially be used to construct 3D printed shelters for the astronauts as well. The Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot. Image: NASA Growing crops in space is another area of focus for the research. It is not easy to grow crops out of regolith, so NASA is figuring out the nutrients that need to be added to the soil, how to water the crops and lighting them with LEDs. Student citizen scientists are contributing to the effort by identifying the best plants that can be grown in space. While transporting entire crops may take up too much space, and prove uneconomical, seeds are small and can be transported easily. NASA plans to use robots to take care of the crops, which leaves the astronauts free for more critical tasks. Crops in space will be grown under artificial lighting made up of red, blue and white LED lights. Image: NASA. Apart from local extraction, fuel can also be obtained from waste. A Trash Reactor can be used on Mars to convert garbage generated by the astronauts into valuable elements. The trash reactor at the Kennedy Space Center burns garbage at a temperature of 537 degrees Celsius to convert garbage into fuel, with oxygen and water as by products. The current reactor can covert four and a half kg of garbage into a little over three kg of fuel. Annie Meier, a chemical engineer at the Kennedy Space Center said “There is food waste, there is biological waste, there is packaging waste. Here at Kennedy, we’re working on how to make this waste into useful products, such as methane for fuel.” Annie Meier with the Trash Reactor in the Background. Image: NASA NASA’s plans and efforts for using local resources on Mars are extensive and detailed. Similar to SpaceX, NASA wants to go beyond just Mars. “We don’t just want to go explore,” Bob Cabana said, “we want to pioneer; we want to establish a presence in the solar system.” Image: SpaceX Tags: Barack Obama, Human Colonisation, Mars, Mars Mission, NASA, SpaceX Also read Elon Musk test fires the Raptor engine meant for exploration of Mars and beyond Scientists unveil first prototype of Mars rover made in Mexico X Recommended For You Mars habitation for humans goes on display in London Researchers find that surface of Mars is so dry that it is inhabitable Schiaparelli probe destroyed on impact, says European Space Agency The ESA Schiaparelli Mars lander tracked by the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope near Pune Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

After selecting the infrared search and track (IRST) sensor supplier, Boeing will be tasked with integrating the pod with the F-15’s other systems, including the Raytheon-supplied active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. By delegating such work, the USAF avoids giving losing bidders a chance to protest Boeing’s decision to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). General Dynamics Information Technology reports they are to provide a range of mission support services to the US Special Operations Command. The multiple-award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity USSOCOM contract has a maximum ceiling value of $900 million over a five-year period. Under the deal, USSOCOM forces and their staffs will be provided with technical and management functions across the globe, including engineering and technical services for major weapon systems, program technical assistance, support systems requirements, production decision-making, and program controls assistance. Middle East & North Africa Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) has increased the endurance of their BirdEye 650D UAV to over 15 hours. Regarded as the most sophisticated of IAI’s family of small tactical UAVs, the newest version has been designed for use by tactical-level infantry units, but with a “stretched envelope” for increased performance. This increased endurance coupled with the variety of plug-and-play payloads, makes it suitable for civil, as well as military applications. Africa Two AugustaWestland AW101 VIP helicopters have been handed over by the Nigerian government to their air force. The move comes during a round of cost cutting measures in an effort to reduce expenditures which has also seen two VIP jets put up for sale. Nigeria’s AW101s were originally two of 12 destined for the Indian Air Force, but diverted to Nigeria after the contract with India was cancelled over bribery and corruption allegations. Europe Airbus struck back at the Polish government yesterday following the dropping of a multi-billion Caracel helicopter deal. In an open letter to the Prime Minister, the Aerospace giant accused the government of shifting the goalposts as Airbus competed with US and Italian rivals, and attempting to contravene European Union regulations. Speaking in a separate email, Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said “never have we been treated by any government customer the way this government has treated us.” Industry sources estimate Airbus’ cost of running the helicopter sales campaign at several tens of millions of euros. An initial batch of twelve CV9035 infantry fighting vehicles have been delivered to Estonia from the Netherlands. In late 2014, Estonia signed a $125 million deal for the provision of of 44 used Dutch CV9035NL IFVs and six Leopard 1 tank-based support vehicles. All the vehicles, which will be delivered by 2018, are to undergo maintenance and repairs before arriving in Estonia, the Estonian Ministry of Defense said. Norway will also supply 37 IFV CV90, which will be rebuilt as armored support vehicles, to Estonia next year. Asia Pacific Dassault Mirage F1 fighters operated by the Iranian Air Force have successfully had their on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS) refurbished for the first time. The work was carried out by the Overhaul Center of the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF). In 2014, Tehran announced that its defense ministry had domestically produced a cruise missile system for its Mirage fleet. Japan’s military and aerospace industry will use this week’s Japan International Aerospace Exhibition to push the case to develop a highly advanced, and costly, stealth fighter jet. Dubbed the F-3, the program could cost Tokyo as much $40 billion to develop depending on specifications. Options open to the government include developing the costly fighter or opting for a more cost effective conventional fighter. In March, Japan’s Ministry of Defence issued a request for information (RFI) to gauge interest among foreign aerospace companies for jointly developing the F-3, which would operate alongside Lockheed Martin’s new F-35s and older F-15s.

Andersen October 11, 2016 Kenneth Scott Sheets Kenneth Scott Sheets, age 95, died in Tooele, Utah on Oct. 4, 2016. He was born in Tooele on May 20, 1921, to Don M. Sheets and Mary Sheets. He graduated from Tooele High School, spent a year working at the local copper smelter, and in order to satisfy his love of airplanes, he attended Curtiss Wright Technical Institute in Glendale, California. Upon graduation he was hired by Boeing Airplane Company in Seattle, Washington on Aug. 11, 1941. Ken married Frances Tyler in 1942. They had one adopted son, Robert. Frances passed away in 1986 after a long debilitating bout with osteoporosis. Robert passed away in 1988. After 41 years at Boeing, 37 years in management, Ken retired in 1982 to care for his ailing wife. During his tenure at Boeing he worked on all of the Boeing airplanes of that time — A20, B17, 377, C97, B47, B52, 707, 727, 737, and 747. In addition, he was involved in the development of the Minuteman and Bomarc missiles and the Dynasoar X-20 space vehicle, which was a precursor to today’s space shuttle. Most of his time at Boeing was with the quality assurance organization. He also put in time in the engineering and manufacturing aspects of the business. Ken’s dream of working on airplanes was fulfilled. Ken’s interests were many. He spent many happy hours fishing with his son and hunting with his good friend Bert Petersen in Washington State. He loved to hike and climb mountains including the scaling of Mt. Rainier three times. He took particular pleasure in cutting large walnut trees, curing the wood and designing and producing an end product. He was a skilled woodworker, spending much of his available time on cabinetry and beautiful gun stocks. In later years, pretty much confined to the “flatlands” because of his two hip replacements, he added rock hounding to his list of interests. This fit in with his lifelong interest in early man in North America. His most recent focus was searching for the source of a rare type of agate utilized by Clovis people 12,000 years ago, and he succeeded. Ken married Vivian Elizabeth Carman, his high school sweetheart in 1987. They established a home in Tooele, Utah and had 20 beautiful years together until Vivian’s death on March 27, 2008. Vivian and Ken spent many happy times RVing the western states, enjoying the scenery and each others company.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio October 11, 2016 Officials deny linking the military and commercial deals, but insiders say otherwise. The White House’s recent decision to allow the sale of F-15 fighter jets to Qatar helped to seal the $18.6 billion purchase of 100 Boeing jetliners announced Friday by Qatar Airways, according to people with knowledge of the deal. Executives with Boeing and state-owned Qatar Airways denied links between the military and commercial sales. “The Qatar Airways has its independent policy of ordering airplanes,” CEO Akbar Al Baker said when asked whether the two sales were connected. “So nothing is attached to anything.” But the jetliner deal — which has been under negotiation for months — was finalized less than two weeks after the Obama administration approved the 36 F-15 fighter jets for Qatar on Sept. 28, people close to the agreement say.

The up-to-$4 billion fighter jet deal has been in the works for years, but has reportedly been on hold while the U.S. negotiated a 10-year, $38 billion security package with Israel. Israel has reportedly raised objections to Qatar buying F-15s. Last week, White House officials informally told members of Congress that the F-15 sale would get approval, but the State Department and Pentagon have yet to formally announce the deal, which reportedly has options for up to 72 fighters. Boeing builds the F-15 in St. Louis. Meanwhile, Qatar Airways and Boeing executives called the commercial airliner deal historic. “Today’s announcement really exemplifies the benefits of a global partnership and how trade and innovation go hand-in-hand in an increasingly interconnected world to make it a better and a safer place,” said Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The airliner deal includes the purchase of 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-ER aircraft, valued at $11.7 billion, according to Boeing. The twin-engine planes are used on long-haul, intercontinental routes. Qatar also signed a “letter of intent” for 60 737 MAX 8 aircraft, which are used for shorter regional flights, worth $6.9 billion. Finalizing that deal would be a huge score for Boeing; currently, Qatar Airways flies only European-made Airbus single-aisle planes on these regional routes. Conner said the deal would affect 104,000 jobs across America, not just in the Seattle area where Boeing builds commercial aircraft. Boeing and Qatar Airways consummated the sale Friday at a lavish signing ceremony at the Four Seasons hotel in Washington. VIPs in attendance included Anthony Blinken, the deputy secretary of state and former deputy national security adviser to President Obama; and Qatar Finance Minister Ali Shareef Al Emadi. Blinken and Al Emadi sat on the dais with Conner and Al Baker, but left before a question-and-answer session with journalists. “A critical and steadfast partner to the United States, Qatar has always played an outside diplomatic and strategic role in its own region, but also increasingly beyond,” Blinken said. “It’s an influential contributor to political, security and economic progress in the Middle East and we are proud of our deepening cooperation on a very diverse range of issues.” Blinken also touted Qatar’s participation in the U.S.-led coalition of nations fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The deal “will bring us even closer together,” he said. Al Baker noted that Qatar is home to Al Udeid Air Base, the location of U.S. Air Forces Central Command’s combined air and space operations center, which oversees the airstrike campaign against ISIS. “Qatar is a very strong ally of the United States,” he said. “This relationship will only get stronger, but has no relation to Boeing or Qatar Airways or Qatar’s aircraft orders that we placed today.” Marcus Weisgerber is the global business editor for Defense One, where he writes about the intersection of business and national security.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration Boeing delays Starliner again, casting doubt on commercial flights in 2018 SpaceX likely to see schedule slips, too, but hasn't formally announced delays. by Eric Berger - Oct 11, 2016 4:28 pm UTC Login to bookmark 69 Boeing's Starliner spacecraft is facing more delays. Boeing After an initial delay from late 2017 into early 2018, Boeing has acknowledged a second slippage of its schedule for the first commercial crew flights of its Starliner spacecraft. According to a report in Aviation Week, the company now says it will not be ready to begin operational flights until December 2018, a full year after NASA had originally hoped its commercial crew providers would be ready. The admission by Boeing confirms a report by NASA's Inspector General, which found significant delays with both the Boeing and SpaceX efforts to develop private spacecraft to ferry US astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The delay also explains why, as Ars has previously reported, senior managers with the International Space Station program are likely to press ahead with the politically painful decision to purchase Soyuz seats for the calendar year 2019. Boeing's second delay appears to have been caused by supply chain issues and other factors, which Boeing Program Manager for Commercial Crew John Mulholland said have been largely resolved. "When we were faced with these issues it was time for us to step back and say: ‘Hey listen, we have to readdress [this] and say what’s real and lay in where we are going forward,'” he told Aviation Week. With the revised schedule, Boeing now anticipates completing an initial test crew flight in August 2018. Under this plan, the company could still receive certification from NASA in late 2018 and fly its first operational mission to the station by the end of the year. NASA's other commercial crew provider, SpaceX, has had two issues with its Falcon 9 rocket, which will launch its crewed Dragon spacecraft into orbit. Despite this the company said flights in 2017 remain possible. “We continue to review and analyze data from the anomaly," a spokesman told Ars. "We expect to stay on track with our commercial crew milestones with NASA, but we'll better know how our schedule will be impacted once the investigation is complete and we get back to flying." Nevertheless, the inspector general's report said SpaceX, too, had experienced issues with its spacecraft, particularly adjusting to water-based landings upon returning to Earth. Sources familiar with the commercial crew program have indicated to Ars that the race between SpaceX and Boeing to launch the first NASA astronauts from US soil remains too close to call.

The US government will work with entrepreneurs “to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space,” Obama said in an opinion piece posted on the CNN website.  “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. Read more Boeing harbors grand ambition to reach Mars before SpaceX rocket “The next step is to reach beyond the bounds of Earth’s orbit. I’m excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth – something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars.” Obama will be in Pittsburgh on Thursday for the White House-organized Frontiers Conference, which has been arranged to highlight the latest scientific and technological advances. One session, Interplanetary Frontiers, will examine the next stage of space exploration. Billed speakers include NASA Chief Scientist Ellen Stofan, the chief executive officer of Virgin Galactic, and officials from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Carnegie Mellon. US companies are already battling it out to be the first to offer commercially viable space travel and tourism. Earlier in October, Boeing said it plans to beat Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the race to send humans to Mars. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s CEO, said at a Chicago conference on innovation, Bloomberg reported. Boeing has already made a name for itself in space technology, building the first stage for the most powerful US launch vehicle ever flown, the Saturn V – which took astronauts to the Moon. Read more EU-Russia ExoMars mission all set to enter planetary orbit in October – Roscosmos head Tesla won’t be easy to beat, however. Musk told participants of the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, in September his SpaceX program will allow humans to become “a multi-planetary species.” “What I want to do here is to make Mars seem possible, to make it seem that is something we can do in our lifetime, and that you can go,” the SpaceX CEO and lead designer said. “Is there a way for anyone to go if they wanted to?” Musk wondered. He said trips to Mars could occur every two years, with spaceships returned to Earth powered by methane mined on Mars and rockets refueling in orbit from rocket boosters. A million people would be required to start a colony on Mars, according to Musk, who added that it would be a real challenge to fund the endeavour. He said some financing could come from servicing the space station and launching satellites, as well as from the government and private investment. The race to launch a manned mission to Mars comes as a joint EU-Russia project designed to search for signs of past and present life on the red planet is due to enter the Martian orbit on October 19 to begin mapping sources of methane gas. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter launched on March 14 is set to take the Schiaparelli lander to Mars. It will then proceed to look for sources of methane and other gases on the planet while the lander will work on landing techniques for another mission.

But who will get there first? By Ben Rosen, Staff October 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Mars is seen 54 million miles from Earth as captured in 1999 by the Hubble telescope. Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has vowed to beat SpaceX and Elon Musk to Mars. NASA/Reuters View Caption About video ads View Caption of The space race that first brought humans to the moon was propelled by a tense international rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. A half-century later, Boeing’s chief executive envisions a competition between the aeronautics manufacturer and SpaceX having the same result, minus the cold war. Except, this time, the destination is the Red Planet. “I’m convinced the first person to step on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Dennis Muilenburg said at an event hosted by The Atlantic Magazine in Chicago on Oct. 4. Recommended: How much do you know about the space race? Take our quiz The Boeing Company is already in partnership with NASA to develop the Space Launch System, a heavy-lift rocket for deep space exploration. But Mr. Muilenburg’s comments indicate an increasing rivalry between Boeing and SpaceX to be the first to reach Mars and, perhaps, colonize it. This competition could push progress, as SpaceX founder and chief Elon Musk welcomed challengers when he laid out his plans just a week before for a  Mars colony.

Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend “The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system.  It’s like building the Union Pacific railroads,” Mr. Musk told the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Sept. 27. Muilenburg indicated a growing competition between Boeing and SpaceX when he spoke of his vision for a commercial space-travel market, according to Bloomberg. He imagined hotels in orbit, hypersonic jets traveling between continents in two minutes, and a Boeing rocket bringing the first human to Mars. Boeing has been working with NASA to make that a reality. The public-private partners have been developing a Space Launch System rocket, which NASA hopes will  bring the first humans to Mars by 2030. The aerospace company has long partnered with NASA. It built the first stage for the Saturn V, the most powerful US rocket built to date, which took men to the moon. SpaceX’s Mars timeline is a bit more ambitious. Musk has said his company plans to bring the first humans to the Red Planet five years sooner, in 2025, with the eventual goal of human colonization of Mars. The two companies have been in competition ever since SpaceX started developing technology to reach space. In 2012, NASA chose Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corp. to taxi astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting Earth. NASA had the three companies share $1.1 billion in funding, with Boeing receiving the most money at the time. But SpaceX was the first of the three companies to deliver cargo to the ISS. Just like Russia charges NASA a fee to shuttle astronauts to the ISS now, the companies will have NASA pay them per seat. But corporate ventures to Mars and deep space has some scientists, lawyers, philosophers, and science fiction writers worried. “I personally would hate that: turning the cosmos into a kind of billionaires’ playground,” Kim Stanley Robinson, an acclaimed science fiction writer, told The Christian Science Monitor’s Lonnie Shekhtman last month. Others have raised concerns about the reign a corporation or extra-planetary power could hold over resources on the Red Planet.   “If somebody gets control of oxygen, they could very well have control over the whole population and could threaten dire consequences in return for extraordinary levels of power,” Charles Cockell, an astrobiologist at the University of Edinburgh, pointed out to the BBC in 2014. But other countries are also aiming for Mars. The space programs that have already sent uncrewed missions to the fourth planet include the US, Russia, the European Space Agency, and India, with China having plans to follow. With the price of putting an astronaut on Mars in the billions of dollars, Musk envisions funding the project through some type of public-private partnership, writes Ms. Shekhtman. SpaceX, for instance, would generate income from launching satellites and doing work on ISS.  This report contains material from the Associated Press.

Thryft, Senior Technical Editor, Materials & Assembly 10/11/2016   Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet The number of techniques for making large-scale parts with 3D printing and additive manufacturing (AM) is growing along with part size. We've reported on several, including Sciaky's, the Stratasys Infinite Build demonstrator, and the Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) machine developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), used to 3D print the composite Strati car at IMTS 2014. The biggest of all, according to Guinness World Records, is a 3D-printed trim and drill tool that measures 17.5 ft x 5.5 ft x 1.5 ft. It now holds the world record for the largest solid 3D-printed item. Researchers at ORNL built the tool to be evaluated by Boeing for use in constructing the aircraft leader's 777X passenger jet. Boeing's flagship 777X twin-engine passenger jet builds on the success of the company's 777 and 787 Dreamliner, but it will be even bigger. Its newly designed longer composite wings will maximize fuel efficiency. (Source: Boeing) Boeing's flagship 777X builds on the success of the company's 777 and 787 Dreamliner, but it will be even bigger than either of those. Boeing says this aircraft will be the biggest and most efficient twin-engine jet in the world, as well as one of the most comfortable. Compared to the interior of the Dreamliner, the cabin of the 777X will be wider, with bigger windows and newly designed lighting. It will also feature touchscreens in the flight deck for pilots, a first in air transportation. The 777X jet will have newly designed, completely optimized, longer wings. The design of the plane's high-efficiency, high-span composite wing enables a 23 ft (7m) greater span for maximizing fuel efficiency. In flight, the plane's wingspan will measure 235 ft, 5 inch (71.8m), and on the ground, 212 ft, 8 inch (64.8m). Production of the plane is scheduled to begin in 2017 and first delivery is targeted for 2020. Guinness World Records judge measures the 3D-printed trim tool, co-developed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Boeing to be evaluated for use in constructing the wingskin of Boeing's new 777X passenger jet. (Source: Oak Ridge National Laboratory) The Guinness World Record-winning trim and drill tool will be used to secure the composite wing skin of the 777X during drilling and machining, before it is assembled. The tool itself was 3D printed at ORNL of carbon fiber and ABS thermoplastic composite materials. The research team at ORNL says the tool's length is similar to that of a large sport utility vehicle, and that it weighs 1,650 lb (748.43 kg).

ORNL printed the lower-cost trim tool in only 30 hours. "The existing, more expensive metallic tooling option we currently use comes from a supplier and typically takes three months to manufacture using conventional techniques," said Boeing's director of structures and materials, Leo Christodoulou. "Additively manufactured tools, such as the 777X wing trim tool, will save energy, time, labor, and production cost and are part of our overall strategy to apply 3D-printing technology in key production areas." A 3D-printed trim and drill tool developed by ORNL and Boeing to be used in building Boeings 777X passenger jet has received the title of largest solid 3D-printed item by Guinness World Records. In the background is the Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) machine researchers used to build the tool. (Source: Oak Ridge National Laboratory) Guinness World Records judge Michael Empric measured the trim and drill tool to prove it exceeded the minimum dimensions of 0.3 cubic meters, or about 10.6 cubic feet, to qualify for the record title. The measurement was performed at an awards ceremony held at ORNL's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, which houses the BAAM machine used to 3D print the tool. After verification testing is completed by ORNL, Boeing plans to use the additively manufactured tool in the companys new production facility in St. Louis. It will then be able to give the lab feedback on the tools performance. Ann R. Thryft is senior technical editor, materials & assembly, for Design News.

Offering revolutionary technologies Two new technologies, 3D printing and ceramic matrix composites,  have revolutionized the aviation industry in the past year. Starting in 2015, the fist-sized piece of silver metal – which houses the compressor inlet temperature sensor inside a jet engine – became a symbol of one of the biggest changes in modern jet engine design. The housing for the sensor, known as T25, became the first 3D-printed part certified by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to fly inside GE commercial jet engines. GE Aviation then worked with Boeing to retrofit more than 400 GE90-94B jet engines – some of the world’s largest and most powerful engines used in aviation – with the 3D-printed part. The GE90 family of engines powers 777 Boeing planes. GE also started test flights with the next-generation LEAP jet engine, which holds 19 3D-printed fuel nozzles. The engine, which powers new narrow-body planes like the Boeing 737MAX and the Airbus A320neo, was developed by CFM International, a 50/50 joint venture between GE Aviation and French Safran (Snecma). GE is also developing 3D-printed fuel nozzles and other parts for the GE9X engine for Boeing’s new 777X aircraft, the largest jet engine ever built. Besides innovations in 3D printing, which have enabled the company to design and print parts that could not be made otherwise, GE is also pioneering the use of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) in airplane parts production. These “super ceramics” are as tough as metals, but only one-third as heavy. They can operate at 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit (1,315.5 degrees Celsius) – 500 degrees Fahrenheit (295.5 degrees Celsius) higher than the most advanced alloys. This combination allows engineers to design lighter components for engines that don’t need as much cooling, generating more power and burning less fuel. GE Aviation first used CMC shrouds in the hot section of its F136 fighter jet engine, but their application quickly spread. Static CMC parts are already flying inside the LEAP on Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320neo, and Airbus A321neo jets. The LEAP’s manufacturer, CFM International, has received more than 10,800 orders for the engines – which, according to list price, amount to more than $150 billion. 3D-printed parts and components made from advanced ceramics help make the LEAP engine quieter, easier to maintain, and 15 per cent more fuel-efficient than CFM’s current engines. Flying in tandem with Vietnam LEAP-1B jet engines, which use 3D-printed components and CMC parts, are now used in the fleet of Vietnam’s only private airline, VietJet Air. During US President Barack Obama’s first visit to the country in May of this year, GE signed a $3 billion order for 215 LEAP-1B jet engines, which will power a brand-new fleet of 100 next-generation Boeing 737 MAX aircrafts operated by VietJet Air. The airplanes will be delivered to VietJet Air from 2019 until 2023, supporting the company as it extends its domestic and international networks. According to VietJet Air, the investment in a fleet of Boeing 737 MAXs will help it to grow its planned international route network, which will include long-haul flights.  GE, the world’s leading airline engine manufacturer, has also been co-operating with state-owned carrier Vietnam Airlines for a long time. Much of Vietnam Airlines’ fleet runs on GE’s CFM56-5B, GE90, and GEnx jet engines. The CFM56-5B is the engine of choice for the Airbus A320 family, having been selected to power the Airbus Corporate Jet (ACJ) and nearly 60 per cent of the A318/A319/A320/A321 aircrafts ordered. Vietnam Airlines, as one of GE’s earliest customers in the region, has used the CFM56-5B engine since the mid-1990s to power 10 of its Airbus A320 aircrafts. The engines have logged over 129,000 flight hours with no in-flight shutdowns, and have a 99.9 per cent dispatch reliability rate. The GE90, originally certified in 1995 at 84,700 pounds of thrust (38,419 kilogrammes-force), today powers five different types of Boeing 777 aircraft. At 127,000 pounds of thrust (57,606 kilogrammes-force), the GE90-115B is one of the world’s most powerful jet engines. Most recently, 14 GE90 engines were selected by Vietnam Airlines for regional use. The GE90-94B-powered Boeing 777 aircraft is the first long-range aircraft utilised by Vietnam Airlines. The engines’ unmatched flexibility and reliability allows for non-stop flights from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City straight to Paris, France. Meanwhile, the GEnx aircraft engine uses the latest generation materials and design processes to reduce weight, improve fuel efficiency, and lower maintenance costs for mid-size, long-range aircrafts, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In October 2013, GE provided 40 GEnx jet engines for Vietnam Airlines’ Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet. The new engines brought a 15 per cent reduction in the fleet’s fuel usage.  In addition to providing equipment, GE offers its customers flexible, customised services and solutions that can meet unique needs. Along with a global network of technical resources to support their operations at the local level, GE offers its customers the means to implement goals associated with flight operations’ quality assurance, including significant fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and lower noise, as well as improved access to airports. “GE’s engines have been ensuring that flying in Vietnam is safe and comfortable for passengers, but just as importantly, its technology ensures that air travel remains gentle on the environment. That is how we are working with Vietnam’s airlines to meet the increasing demand for domestic air travel,” said Pham Hong Son, CEO of GE Vietnam. Clear skies ahead As Vietnam finds its voice as a prominent global actor, the demand for air travel is rising. According to data published by Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, in the first half of this year, Vietnamese airlines transported 25 million passengers, up 30 per cent on-year, and the number of domestic passengers grew by 33 per cent. This is phenomenal growth compared to the previous years’ 15-20 per cent. The International Air Transport Association has named Vietnam as one of the seven fastest growing air travel markets in the world from 2014 to 2017, both in terms of the number of international passengers and cargo. Meanwhile, the number of domestic passengers is expected to grow at an annual average of 15 per cent in the next few years. Currently, ASEAN Open Sky – established on January 1, 2016 – is creating a level playing field for all airlines in the region, providing opportunities for Vietnamese airlines to soar. In this context, GE Aviation is looking to make significant investments in Vietnam, betting on its coming role as a hub in the open skies. The key, as the company sees it, lies in helping its airline partners serve the growing population of business and leisure travelers, primarily relying on the company’s advanced jet engines, which are both easy to maintain and cost-effective. “GE hopes to foster a strong alliance with Vietnam’s growing airlines as the nation grows into one of the Pacific region’s leading business and tourism destinations,” added Son.

The order is valued at $3.2 billion based on list prices for the Dreamliners, but discounts are typically negotiated. “The 787 Dreamliners have helped us to achieve initial success in implementing our internationalization strategy in the past few years and enabled us to make our operation and services more appealing to passengers,” China Southern CEO Tan Wangeng said in a news release. “The additional new 787-9s will further increase our capacity and services for our long-haul routes.” China Southern already operates 10 787-8 Dreamliners among its fleet of 700 aircraft. “China Southern has been a long-standing Boeing customer and we truly appreciate their confidence in the 787,” said Ihssane Mounir, a Boeing senior vice president. “The 787-9 will help the airline achieve a new level of efficiency and profitability.” # airplane manufacturing boeing co.

China Southern, the country’s largest airline by fleet size with 700 aircraft, currently operates 10 787-8s. Those planes have allowed the Guangzhou-based carrier to launch six nonstop global routes, connecting Guangzhou to London and Rome in Europe, Vancouver in North America as well as destinations in Australia and New Zealand. “The Dreamliners have helped us to achieve initial success in implementing our internationalization strategy in the past few years and enabled us to make our operation and services more appealing to passengers,” Tan Wangeng, China Southern’s CEO, said in a statement. “The additional 787-9s will further increase our capacity and services for our long-haul routes.” Wednesday’s order is valued at $3.2 billion at current list prices, but China Southern said in a regulatory filing that its cost will be “significantly lower than the catalog price ... because of the substantial price concessions granted by Boeing.” China Southern did not say how much it will pay for the Dreamliners, citing a confidentiality demand by Boeing. The disclosure of such costs are usually required by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and China Southern will have to get a waiver from the exchange to proceed. The purchase also must receive shareholder and government approval. China Southern said it will provide more information about the purchase next month. Deliveries of the aircraft are expected to occur between 2018 and 2020, according to the regulatory filing. “China Southern has been a longstanding Boeing customer and we truly appreciate their confidence in the 787,” Ihssane Mounir, Boeing’s senior vice president of Northeast Asia Sales, said in a statement. “The 787-9 will help the airline achieve a new level of efficiency and profitability.” The 787-9 is a stretched version of the earlier 787-8 Dreamliner, with 20 additional feet to fly up to 335 passengers. Built of composite materials, the Dreamliner uses 20 percent less fuel than similar-sized commercial planes. Boeing’s official tally of Dreamliner orders stood at 19 for the year as of Oct. 4. However, that number doesn’t include last week’s order by Qatar Airways for 30 787-9s and Wednesday’s China Southern order. With those deals, Boeing unofficially has 71 Dreamliner orders in 2016 — including 33 from Chinese carriers — compared to 52 for the same period a year ago. “This is another shot in the arm for the 787, which has been selling slowly this year,” Uresh Sheth, an investment banker and Dreamliner analyst, said on his “All Things 787” website. Boeing builds the 787 at its North Charleston campus and at a West Coast plant in Everett, Wash.

Boeing currently has more than a dozen states in competition from coast to coast offering property, billions of dollars of tax breaks, favorable labor deals and customized employee training hoping that Boeing will choose them to assemble its new 777X jetliner. (AP Photo/The Boeing Co.) Updated at 1 p.m.  Boeing marked the completion of its first commercial aircraft facility in the St. Louis area with a grand-opening ceremony Thursday.  Employees at the new 424,000-square foot Boeing Composite Center of Excellence at 8900 Frost Avenue in Berkeley will build composite parts for the 777X, the company’s newest commercial jetliner. Maplewood-based MC Industrial, a subsidiary of McCarthy Holdings, built the facility, which was expanded from an earlier design to include the addition of a paint facility on the south side of the building. Production of the aircraft’s wing edge and tail parts will begin early next year, and the aircraft is targeted for delivery in 2020. The 777X wing will be assembled in Everett, Wash. Parts production in St. Louis is scheduled to start in early 2017. The 777X work is generating 700 jobs locally over the next few years, Chicago-based Boeing said Wednesday. Boeing has spent $200 million so far to construct the facility, a spokeswoman said Wednesday, and plans to spend an additional $100 million to outfit it with final tooling and equipment. That construction met the requirements for Boeing to qualify for subsidies from the state of Missouri that could reach $229 million over 18 years. Boeing would have to increase its St. Louis workforce by 2,000 jobs to qualify for the full subsidy. The unusual agreement allows Boeing to reap smaller payments if it simply keeps employment over 12,500. The 777X is a long-haul, double-aisle airliner designed to carry up to 400 passengers while using less fuel than the competition. Production of 777X wing edge and tail parts is expected to begin at the plant in early 2017, the company said. Boeing had 306 orders for the 777X through September. The 777X replaces the highly successful 777, introduced in 1995. Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Who's hired?

Jay Nixon, a Democrat, who helped push for incentives for the plant expansion.  Boeing Defense, Space & Security division is based in Hazelwood and the company currently has about 15,000 workers in the St. Louis area.  "This has been Boeing defense, obviously, and to get commercial work here, to broaden that portfolio, especially with these composites which are going to be used in defense and commercial both, gives an asset here," Nixon said, adding Boeing's two autoclaves at the facility that weigh more than 200,000 pounds are unlikely to be moved.   "When they make this level of capital investment, it means not only these 700 jobs but more to come in the future," Nixon said.  Jim Gallagher and Kevin McDermott of the Post-Dispatch and Reuters contributed to this report.  Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Obama: Getting humans to Mars will require NASA, private companies to team up Los Angeles Times Oct 12, 2016 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS President Barack Obama speaks Tuesday at a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the White Oak Amphitheatre in Greensboro, N.C. WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama hammered home his goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, while acknowledging that accomplishing it would require public and private collaboration. Obama first said in 2010 he wanted to send astronauts “to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth” by the mid-2030s with “a landing on Mars” to follow. In an opinion article Tuesday on CNN.com, Obama said the ultimate ambition was not only to send humans to Mars and bring them back, but to “remain there for an extended time.” “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we’re already well on our way,” he said. Obama’s article comes two weeks after SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk laid out an ambitious plan to eventually send 1 million people to colonize the Red Planet and turn humans into a multiplanetary species within 40 to 100 years. In a speech at the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico, Musk similarly called for a public/private partnership. NASA is working with Hawthorne, Calif.-based SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing Co. to develop crew capsules to take astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA relies on SpaceX and aerospace firm Orbital ATK to deliver supplies and cargo to the space station. This week, Obama will speak at the White House Frontiers conference in Pittsburgh, an event that will focus on innovations in science and technology, including a future Mars mission. Executives from companies such as SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and moon mining firm Moon Express are also set to speak at the conference. “It just underlines the theme that’s run through the Obama administration, which is encouraging partnerships with the private sector, providing additional opportunities for work and, when appropriate, doing business in a slightly different way,” said John Logsdon, professor emeritus of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. “It’s mainly about leaving a legacy,” he said. Analysts said a public/private partnership recognizes the reality of the space business today, as well as financial limitations. “On the commercial side, there are a lot of innovative ideas,” said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International. “But they need that backing from the government both in the know-how . (and) the government’s financial resources.” Smaller space start-ups that don’t usually work with the government could benefit most from Obama’s goal, said Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation trade group. “I think it gives a level of excitement to a variety of different players,” he said. “You don’t know who the next SpaceX could be, or the next Blue Origin,” referring to the space tourism company started by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. SpaceX, whose full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has said its first test flight of an interplanetary vehicle could come in four years. A crewed mission could launch in late 2024 and arrive on Mars in 2025. Developing the interplanetary transport system could cost SpaceX $10 billion. In an email, SpaceX spokesman Phil Larson said it was “exciting to see President Obama advocate for the next frontier in human space flight,” and that the company was looking forward to “participating in the journey.” The company’s plan to send an unmanned Dragon spacecraft to the Red Planet as early as 2018 will provide an early chance to demonstrate how private space companies and NASA can work together, said Charles Lurio, publisher of the Lurio Report newsletter on entrepreneurial spaceflight. SpaceX will use the flight to test landing capabilities, interplanetary navigation and other systems. NASA will provide some technical support for the mission because it is interested in the entry, descent and landing data. Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at the Teal Group, estimated that a mission to Mars done the “traditional way” by NASA could cost at least $1 trillion. Oftentimes, large space programs can get delayed if Congress does not grant the requested funding amount, or if there are technical problems along the way. A public/private partnership may speed up the timeline and could lower that cost below $1 trillion, Caceres said. But one of the biggest questions is whether such a program could get funding from Congress, said Ostrove of Forecast International. “There is some desire to do the actual exploration,” he said. “I think that there’s maybe not necessarily the political will to spend the money on these types of programs when there’s so many other things we’re facing now.” One question still to be answered is who will build the massive rockets needed to get to Mars. NASA plans to send its Space Launch System rocket to an asteroid in the mid-2020s and to Mars in the 2030s. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has said he thinks the first person to land on Mars will “arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” a reference to the company’s role on the SLS project. That is a challenge to Musk, who described a rocket booster measuring 39 feet in diameter. When stacked with the SpaceX Mars spaceship, the interplanetary transport system would be 400 feet tall. In a statement Tuesday, John Elbon, vice president and general manager of Boeing Space Exploration, said that sending humans to Mars is “an achievable and inspiration goal for this country.” “This isn’t science fiction,” he said. “We’re building real hardware right now and NASA has a solid plan to get there.” Tags Barack Obama Mars Nasa Human Spacex Mars Featured Businesses Roof Brigade 3335 N 107th St, Omaha, NE 68164 402-213-3240 Currently Open Bella Vita Ristorante 2620 N Main St, Elkhorn, NE 68022 402-289-1804 Hayes & Associates LLC 1015 N 98th St, Omaha, NE 68114 402-390-2480 Coupons Play It Again Sports | New | Used | Sporting Goods | Sports Equipment | Omaha 8453 W Center Rd, Omaha, NE 68124 402-934-8100 Patty's Pub | Bar and Grill | Lincoln NE 311 N Cotner Blvd, Lincoln, NE 68505 402-467-4471 Sideline Sports & Tees Located in Mall of the Bluffs 1751 Madison Ave, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 712-322-8833 Popular on Omaha.com Ben Sasse: Everyone’s duty is to hope for Trump, work for America Shatel: Stats aside, we’ll remember Tommy for his toughness Recruiting: Talented players from in and out of Nebraska visit Huskers for Minnesota game Tom's Takes: Playoff chaos, not-so-special teams, bright future at I-back Chatelain: Blackshirt brashness is a welcome sight They said it: Gophers coach praises Tommy Armstrong, credits NU's second-half play Nebraska-Minnesota: Five things we learned, still don't know Goodwill refocuses on mission as more high-paid executives depart, other sweeping changes occur Husker veterans carry the load in fending off Minnesota, getting NU back on track Postgame: Armstrong vows to be ready for final game at Memorial Stadium loading...

The £165m lifeline has convinced the regulator to renew its Air Travel Operators’ Licence (Atol) until next September after granting a last-minute extension to Monarch’s existing licence just four hours before it was due to expire at the end of last month. Central to Monarch’s rescue bid is a restructuring of a $3.2bn (£2.6bn) deal with Boeing for up to 45 aircraft, which is expected to release significant cash back into the business and delay an increase in costs for two years. Monarch boss Andrew Swaffield confirmed that the rejigged deal would include a “sale-and-leaseback agreement” that could see Boeing buy Monarch's order on the condition that the airline agrees to lease the aircraft from 2018 when the first planes are set to be delivered. The company said that the Boeing agreement had “facilitated” the £165m cash injection from Greybull, which holds a 90pc stake in the company after agreeing to pump £125m of capital into Monarch in 2014. Greybull’s latest bailout is the fourth for the airline in the space of five years. The airline had flirted with the loss of its licence Credit: alamy Mr Swaffield declined to comment on the details of the Boeing deal, which includes 30 aircraft and the potential for 15 more, but it is understood each plane will cost about $50m. The heavy cost of the new aircraft is offset by lower maintenance bills and a 20pc energy efficiency advantage over its existing fleet of older Airbus planes, which could bring substantial savings on its £120m annual fuel costs over the lifetime of the aircraft. Mr Swaffield said the deal had given the airline confidence that it can face the ongoing pressures in the industry, which has taken a hit in recent years due to economic jitters and concerns over terrorism in regions previously popular with holidaymakers. Mr Swaffield said that the company expected the market to remain highly competitive, with low ticket prices and rising costs due to the declining value of sterling. The 12-day licence extension came as a relief to thousands of passengers concerned that their flights and holidays would be cancelled if the airline were unable to clinch a deal. Mr Swaffield admitted that its holiday bookings in recent weeks had been dampened as financial talks rumbled on, but added that sales were now returning to normal. He added that the recent collapse of the pound against the dollar and euro had done little to deter UK holidaymakers, many of whom travel with Monarch to visit their holiday homes abroad or are turning to all-inclusive deals to lock in holiday costs.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion In our opinion: Space travel may be closer than you think Deseret News editorial Published: Oct. 12, 2016 12:20 a.m. Updated: Oct. 11, 2016 6:32 p.m. 6 Comments Given the current political environment, some may feel it is a good time to go to Mars. This week, President Obama announced that by the 2030s the United States will send humans to Mars and back. As President Obama wrote in an op-ed published Tuesday by CNN, the nation’s long-term goal is “to one day remain (on Mars) for an extended time.” Those following the newly competitive space race, may see the announcement as little more than a yawn. Before Obama made his statement, space-hungry billionaire Elon Musk announced that his company, SpaceX, would put humans on the Red Planet in the mid-2020s. Moreover, Bas Lansdorp, CEO of the Dutch-based Mars One, said: "We're going to live on Mars in 2027." Not to be outdone, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg declared that whoever gets to Mars first will do so using a Boeing rocket. And then there’s Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic space vacation initiative. For a small fortune, Galactic plans to send non-astronaut citizens up to space and bring them back, we hope in one piece. The increased competition and crop of private enterprises engaged in space exploration is a positive development and a credit to NASA's new model of studying and encountering the final frontier. NASA no longer appears to be frittering funds, but is using its budget to spur innovative and financially efficient space exploration corporations. To understand how different the collaborative Mars endeavor is from the original NASA-based moon shot, it's helpful to go back to some early space and aeronautics history. There were initially two very different approaches to the technology of space travel. One was a "flyable" capsule and the other was a "rideable" capsule. There was neither the time nor the money available to pursue both paths simultaneously so they chose the latter, which became the "rideable" Apollo capsule design. Once the moon race was successfully won, attention turned to reducing the cost of space launches. This revived the original concept of the reusable and flyable design. Rather than focus on a far-away target, the goal was to create, support and supply a space station in low Earth orbit. Increasing pressure on both safety and financial stability of NASA opened the modern era of space exploration. For the first time it is now possible for private entities, with government incentives and subsidies, to create multiple competing designs of spacecraft. These designs hold the very real prospect of lowering the cost of space travel such that interplanetary exploration is possible within the next couple of decades. Instead of being the exclusive innovator in space technology, NASA has become the primary funding source and technical clearinghouse for private innovations and investments in space enterprises. The race to Mars is heating up precisely because multiple entities are convinced they can get there first. With that said, some have expressed legitimate concerns about using federal funds to fuel private space exploration. After all, if Blue Origin or SpaceX arrives on Mars first and discovers valuable mineral resources, do they have the right to claim or exploit them? Still others wonder if the nation should spend money in space when there are enough problems worth solving here on Earth. Those who support these investments contend that many of the solutions to pressing earthly problems may yet be found through pushing and exploring extra-earthly boundaries. These queries are worthy of further debate and discussion. However, in the interim, the emerging model for NASA seems to be driving results in a positive direction. Many voters frustrated with this election season may welcome some optimistic news regarding the nation’s progress into space, yet after Nov. 8, some will undoubtedly be disappointed that they can't get there faster. 6 Comments Like that?

The current model, the CH-47F is the latest in a line stretching back to the 1960s. The next model would be the Block II, which is intended to fly faster and farther, while carrying more. The F-model would be modified to have the Max TakeOff Weight (MTOW) of 54,000 lbs that the special operations model MH-47G has. It would also have composite rotor blades, which could save weight and fuel costs, with the possibility of increased speed.   "The plan is for this aircraft to fly into the 2060s " said Richard Sneed with Boeing's Huntsville office.  He went on to add "a hundred gears that's 5 generations of pilots".   A decision by the Army is expected next year on whether or not the Block II program will be done a full fledged program or just a series of upgrades.  Jeff Martin Follow Jeff Martin Close Get email notifications on Jeff Martin daily!

Six of the GovCon Index’s 10 lowest net performers came from the S&P 500 as the latter U.S. bellwether index registered its biggest loss in one month with healthcare and financial stocks the largest laggers. Eighteen GovCon Index companies shed at least $1.00 with three down by at least $2.00. General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) contributed the biggest loss to the GovCon Index and Boeing (NYSE: BA) tumbled after the airplane maker said it could take a charge on its commercial space transportation program for NASA as early as the third quarter. Boeing has delayed the first flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule by six months to mid-2018 due to cost-related issues, according to the Wall Street Journal. NASA awarded a pair of contracts to Boeing and Elon Musk’s SpaceX in September 2014 for the program. KBR (NYSE: KBR) ended as the GCI’s worst percentage performer after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to a “Sell” rating from “Neutral” with a $15 price target on concerns about earnings growth prospects due to “outsized exposure” in the core liquified natural gas and greenfield ammonia sectors. Goldman Sach issued its new rating on KBR nearly a week after the Houston-based engineering services provider received dual upgrades from Johnson & Rice and Deutsche Bank on moves to diversify the business mix through two acquisitions of two government services contractors this year. Non-GovCon Index company DigitalGlobe (NYSE: DGI) declined 17 cents to $26.69 on a day when the satellite imagery provider said it agreed to purchase geospatial intelligence services contractor The Radiant Group for $140 million. Third quarter earnings reports from Alcoa and Illumina missed Wall Street’s expectations and the U.S. dollar rose as traders heightened their expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December. Futures markets have the odds of a December move at 68 percent versus 50 percent two weeks ago, Bloomberg reported.

Photograph: Jack Sullivan/Alamy Rob Davies Tuesday 11 October 2016 13.04 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 11 October 2016 17.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger This article is 1 month old Monarch Airlines’ future will go down to the wire, as the carrier looks to seal a £165m funding package designed to secure its licence to operate. The airline will lose its Air Travel Organiser’s Licence (Atol) – which allows it to fly package holiday passengers – at midnight on Wednesday if it does not secure a deal. The UK airline industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, has already granted Monarch a 12-day extension from the original deadline of 30 September to show it had the money to stay afloat. Losing the licence would make it far harder for Monarch to recover its finances because it would lose passengers on Atol-protected package deals, though it could still carry passengers who had booked a flight only. But an agreement between Monarch, its majority owner, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the airline’s banks is expected to be tied up on Wednesday. The package is expected to involve a revision of the terms of Monarch’s 2014 order for 45 new planes from Boeing. Under the agreement, which has yet to be finalised, Boeing would convert the order into lease deals, meaning Monarch could still use the planes but would have more cash to prove to the CAA that it can fund itself. It is not clear whether all 45 plane orders would be converted into leases. Greybull would also inject fresh money as part of a package worth a combined £165m, which it has said would be the largest investment in the company’s 48-year history if it goes ahead. The rescue deal is designed to help Monarch survive difficult trading conditions due to ongoing international security concerns and the weakness of sterling. Monarch has suffered particularly badly from a downturn in package holidays to Turkey and Egypt, amid terrorism fears, while air traffic control strikes in France have exacerbated its woes.

It will slow assembly to one aircraft per month from 2018, saying that was to allow it to “smooth deliveries pending new orders”. Currently it turns out five of the giant aircraft every two months. The European planemaker is struggling to revive sales of the world’s largest passenger jet. Singapore Airlines recently said it will not extend the lease on its first A380 when it expires next year. It has 19 of them and five more on order. And Australia’s Qantas – which has eight – does not want the eight more it has ordered. But Alain Flourens, who heads the A380 programme, told French newspaper Le Figaro: “The A380 still has a place in the Airbus product portfolio.” Airbus has said the double-decker is still attractive because it believes it helps to solve airport congestion and growing air traffic. But sales of large four-engine airliners like the 544-seat A380 have been hit hard by improvements in the range and efficiency of smaller two-engined models, which can be easier to fill. Flourens added that Airbus has plans to improve the plane’s efficiency.

The non-profit news organization puts it spotlight on the American-US Airways merger that closed in 2013, taking a closer look at the Justice Department’s role in the deal. Justice originally sued to halt the deal, though it eventually allowed the merger to proceed after winning concessions from the merging airlines. ProPublica takes a look at the politics that it contends were going on behind the scenes as pro- and anti-merger forces each tried to rally support to their own sides. ProPublica writes: “The Justice Department’s abrupt reversal came after the airlines tapped former Obama administration officials and other well-connected Democrats to launch an intense lobbying campaign, the full extent of which has never been reported.” “They used their pull in the administration, including at the White House, and with a high-level friend at the Justice Department, going over the heads of staff prosecutors. And just days after the suit was announced, the airlines turned to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s first White House chief of staff, to help push back against the Justice Department.”  FULL REPORT: See the full ProPublica story USA TODAY Era of airline merger mania comes to a close with last US Airways flight ProPublica goes on with an in-depth look about the political wrangling it says happened behind the scenes. The outlet suggests opponents of the merger faced great pressure in trying to block the deal. With the merger now settled, four airlines have taken control of about 80% of the U.S. market. All four of those carriers – American, Delta, Southwest and United – have been strengthened by large mergers during the past decade. The American-US Airways merger was somewhat unique in that it followed three other mega-mergers. Those deals produced two very large global carriers – Delta (merged with Northwest) and United (merged with Continental) – whose sizes then greatly outpaced American and the even-smaller US Airways. US Airways and American officials argued that their own merger was needed to effectively compete, saying United and Delta had become so big that they could muscle out American and US Airways and effectively dominate the market for “traditional" hub-and-spoke airline service. Plus, many argued, how could Justice now block the American-US Airways deal after recently approving three other large airline mergers? The most-compelling argument against the merger, those critics contended, was not that the American-US Airways merger raised different antitrust concerns, but rather that it was simply "one merger too many."

All have invested in new planes and airport facilities and have become stronger players against their global rivals. Just a decade ago, the threat of bankruptcy -- possibly even liquidation -- had become an ongoing concern for a number of carriers. Low-cost giant Southwest – emboldened by its takeover of AirTran – has also become a true national airline and has expanded internationally for the first time in its history, bringing new competition to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. At American itself, ProPublica notes “the combined company has 10% more employees than it had at the time of the merger.” USA TODAY Debut of Southwest's international flying goes smoothly USA TODAY Virgin America earnings: CEO surprised at length of Dallas fare war Further, the divestitures made by American and US Airways – most notably a combination of slots and gate space at Washington Reagan National, New York LaGuardia and Dallas Love Field – have led to new competition from low-cost carriers in those markets. But those who say the merger should’ve been blocked will point to increasing add-on fees and fares that have not dropped along with fuel prices. The now-consolidated U.S. airline industry, those critics will contend, has tipped the scales away from consumers and toward the companies’ interests. “It was a gross miscarriage of justice that that case was dropped and an outrage and an example of how our system should not work,” Tom Horne, the former state attorney general of Arizona, one of seven states that were co-plaintiffs with the federal government, told ProPublica for its piece. Not everyone agrees with that sentiment, of course. But, for those interested in one take on the political process that played out behind the scenes, the ProPublica piece is an interesting read.

The company's UK operation, Spirit AeroSystems (Europe) Limited, is one of the largest airframe suppliers to Airbus and is a key supplier of major wing structures. Spirit Europe also produces wing structures for Boeing programs. Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Keith Brown, said: “Aerospace is one of our highest value sectors, playing a vital role in Scotland’s economy. “That is why I am delighted to welcome Spirit’s latest £5 million investment in the facility, underlining the achievements of the team and showing real commitment to developing the workforce and operations in Prestwick. “I am sure this will see the company continue to go from strength to strength, increasing efficiency and competitiveness and opening up new markets. “I wish the Spirit team every success moving forward.” Spirit AeroSystems vice president for UK and Malaysia, Scott McLarty, said: “This new finishing centre allows us to better meet the needs of our customers as production rates increase for single aisle aircraft. “We are grateful for the investment by Scottish Enterprise and their partnership with us. “This finishing centre improves our competitiveness as a world-class manufacturer and presents us with new opportunities to continually improve the quality products we deliver for our customers.” In most recent accounts, covering the 2014 year to December, Spirit Europe reported pre-tax profits of £33.6 million on sales totalling £414.1 million, down from profits of £47.2 million and sales of £443.6 million the prior year. The company said the drop in profit was largely down to foreign exchange losses and an increase in interest payments on inter-company loans.

Chuck Edwards are running to represent the 48th N.C. Senate District, which takes in all of Henderson and Transylvania counties and several Buncombe County communities just north of the Buncombe-Henderson line, including Arden, Avery's Creek, Bent Creek and Upper Hominy. Norm Bossert Party: Democrat Home: Pisgah Forest Current job: Principal, Black Mountain Elementary School Experience: Is in his 44th year as a professional educator with 27 of those years spent as a classroom teacher Education: B.S. in elementary education, Old Dominion University; masters in school administration, Western Carolina University Age: 65 What would be your top priorities over the next two years? My top priorities will be to restore the public school budget and stop the downward spiral of our public education system. ... Protect our environment: Encouraging alternative energy sources, ending the notion of offshore drilling and fracking. Holding corporations (such as Duke Power) accountable for the cleanup of their coal ash mess. … Jobs in Transylvania County, and working with local officials to create affordable housing options throughout the 48th District. Require a living wage to be phased in so that people need not be beholden to public services.  Create 23,000 jobs statewide by expanding Medicaid. What, if anything, do you think the state should do next on House Bill 2? Repeal, repeal, repeal!  All citizens are entitled to equal protection under the law. Writing discrimination into the law is unacceptable!  … The intrusion of state government into a local governing body’s ability to pass lawful ordinances is unacceptable. What steps should state government take to grow the North Carolina economy? Let’s start by repealing HB2! After that, incentivize manufacturers (for a period of time and with cooperative agreements with local government) to come here. Let’s get back to economic growth zones that seek out businesses to come to our community. For example … a team of people could visit with Boeing, or BMW, to find niche industries that could help them and us. We should work, too, to be certain that our infrastructure is up to date and available for industry. Over the last four years, the state has reduced some taxes and shifted more of the tax burden from income to sales taxes. What is your view of this trend and should it continue? Everyone should pay their fair share. Every corporation should pay its fair share. Right now, the fees and service taxes (and sales taxes) our state is using to raise the revenue they need for their $22 Billion budget falls unfairly (in terms of percentage of income) on the backs of our middle income and lower income families. Not fair! The state will do whatever it needs to reach its revenue goals. I think corporations and the uber rich need to share fairly in raising these funds. What are the next steps you think the state should take regarding education? We need to empower our school board to make more local decisions on such matters as the school calendar. We need to reinstate pay for teachers completing advanced degree work. We need to restore due process protections by reinstating career status. We need to increase per pupil expenditures to 2010 numbers. We need to reinstate our teacher scholarship program. … We need to get up to date textbooks in our classrooms and build a requirement to study civics back into the curriculum. We need to do away with vouchers. We need, too, to put all charter schools under the aegis of our school boards. ... Chuck Edwards Party: Republican Home: Flat Rock Current job: Appointed as state senator in August, owner of McDonald's franchises and other businesses, bank director Experience: Edwards said he has "extensive business experience from starting my own business and growing it by a multiple of 10 to a strong reputation of business, economic, and community involvement." Education: West Henderson High School graduate, studied business curriculum at Blue Ridge Community College Age: 56 What would be your top priorities over the next two years? Growing our state’s economy in a way that good paying jobs are available for our citizens, our children, and future generations should be among our top priorities. We must have a strong economy to fuel our inevitable population growth, and to afford us the ability to provide key government services -- such as to provide raises to teachers and ensure we have adequate transportation funding. My real world experiences are as a business owner and by working alongside organizations whose top priorities are to drive our economy. I have learned the skills needed to help build a strong economy. What, if anything, do you think the state should do next on House Bill 2? HB2 was in response to the Charlotte city ordinance that effectively makes it illegal to distinguish women’s bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms from those of men. The situation created by Charlotte lacks common sense and decency. The leaders of that city should be called upon to rescind their action that created such division among our citizens. What steps should state government take to grow the North Carolina economy? “Get out of the way, and we’ll figure it out” was the response a local farmer recently replied when I asked him that exact question while touring his greenhouses. N.C. has created a bureaucracy of over 21,000 burdensome regulations on businesses and many of them prevent jobs from being created. Additionally, we must keep the costs of doing business and our taxes lower than our neighboring states. We must be sure our education system is adequately preparing our youth for skilled jobs that employers today require. We must be known as the friendliest state to small businesses. Over the last four years, the state has reduced some taxes and shifted more of the tax burden from income to sales taxes. What is your view of this trend and should it continue? We know broadening the tax base while reducing rates on working families and small businesses will put more money in our citizens’ pockets, provide relief for job creators, and create a more stable revenue source to fund key state priorities like infrastructure and public schools. We need to do whatever is necessary to continue creating a business-friendly tax climate that is conducive to investment and unshackles the entrepreneurial spirit of private sector job creators. What are the next steps you think the state should take regarding education? Our children deserve an education system that is designed to serve their needs, not that of a state-run bureaucracy. I don’t believe the existing administrative structure in our state is properly serving that purpose and my fresh perspective will be essential. We should not spend valuable tax dollars trying to make the system what we wish it would have been in the past. More autonomy should be granted to local school boards and parents. More monies spent should make it into the classrooms where they are most needed, and we must ask where the lottery money is going.

(Image from SpaceX presentation) SoCal Aerospace Companies Could Power Obama’s Mars Vision Times of San Diego Southern California aerospace companies are poised to be major beneficiaries of President Obama’s vision for public-private colonization of Mars in the next decades. In an op-ed published on CNN.com Tuesday, Obama outlined a vision for what he called the “Mars generation.” “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth,” he wrote, “with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.” Companies like General Atomics in San Diego, which makes compact nuclear reactors that could power settlements, and SpaceX in Los Angeles, which builds rocket boosters, would be among the key private companies involved. Obama said his administration’s encouragement of private investment in space technology is paying off with significant new business for American companies “Just five years ago, U.S. companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it,” he wrote. “More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.” He noted that within the next two years, both SpaceX and Boeing will begin flying astronauts to the International Space Station on private rockets. __________________________ Freedoms Park, New York, a memorial to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. (Credit: San Diego Museum of Art) Louis Kahn: The Power of Architecture A retrospective of the world-renowned architect’s work The San Diego Museum of Art welcomes “Louis Kahn: The Power of Architecture,” the first retrospective of the American architect’s work in two decades. On view Nov. 5 through Jan. 31, 2017, the exhibition presents over 200 objects related to Louis Kahn’s selected buildings and projects in the form of architectural models, plans, original drawings, photographs, films and more. The late Louis Kahn is regarded as one of the leading architects of the 20th century. With complex spatial compositions and a mastery of light, Kahn created buildings of dignified beauty and powerful universal symbolism, believing buildings should be monumental and spiritually inspiring. Among his most famous architectural works are the Salk Institute in La Jolla; the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas; and the National Assembly Building in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Kahn was an esteemed lecturer and professor at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania for many years; however, he did not experience his international breakthrough as an architect until he was nearly 60 years old, as his early work in the 1940s and ’50s was devoted to residential building and urban planning.

Homes on the tour range from a historic 1930s bungalow in Kensington to a Downtown San Diego condo given a “modern glam” aesthetic to a Carlsbad home updated and transformed for aging in place. The tour will also include the personal residence of the new ASID San Diego Chapter President Lena Brion, who created a timeless look for her 1980s tract home in Vista. “This tour shows how designers can create beautiful interiors while working within the budgets, lifestyles, and tastes of homeowners,” said Lu Costigan, industry partner and co-chair of the event. Tour sites are located in the San Diego communities of  Downtown and Kensington and the North County communities of Carlsbad, Oceanside and Vista. Tickets, priced at $25, are available at ASIDSanDiego.org.  Tickets will also be available at all tour sites the day of the tour and addresses will be posted on the ASID San Diego website the day of the tour.  Information is available at (858) 566-3345. __________________________ Election Officials Mail 1 Million Ballots for Nov. 8 General Election By City News Service County elections officials sent out around 1 million mail ballots, which could begin arriving at the homes of registered voters around the San Diego region as soon as Tuesday. Considering the length of the ballot — which fills the front and back of two cards — voters are asked to return them as soon as they can. “If you know how you want to vote, grab that mail ballot when you get it, vote it and send it back in right away,” said Registrar of Voters Michael Vu. “The sooner we get the ballot back, the sooner we can start processing it so it will be counted right when the polls close at 8 p.m. on Nov. 8.” Because it’s so big this year, the postage to mail each ballot is 67 cents, according to Vu. Registered voters have until Nov. 1 to request a mail ballot. Those who don’t want to wait until election day or vote by mail can cast ballots in person at the Registrar of Voters Office, 5600 Overland Ave., from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. Weekend voting will take place Nov. 5-6. Elections officials are hoping that voters take advantage of the alternative methods in order to cut back on lines at polling places on Nov. 8. __________________________ Personnel Announcements Sundt Construction Promotes John Messick John Messick Sundt Construction Inc., has promoted longtime employee John Messick to vice president and San Diego regional director, replacing former Sundt executive Jon Wald, who retired earlier this month after 26 years with the company.

We’d like to throw open the door for suggestions for topics. What do you want to know? What do you think you know, but aren’t sure? What are you certain you know, but want to prove it beyond doubt? Ideally, we’d like to see questions that have to do with public policy. Some areas may include Mayor Filner’s first 100 days job performance, should the city be responsible for economic growth and the creation of new jobs, how important are infrastructure improvements to our daily lives (streets and bridges, etc.), how important is water independence, how satisfied are residents with public transit or how do city residents value Balboa Park and other open spaces?

Structural material in aircraft such as paneling interiors are made using CFRP products. Excellent mechanical properties such as high tensile strength, fuel efficiency, impact resistance, and reliability make them ideal for use in the aerospace & defense industry. CFRP, being the lightweight material, would improve fuel consumption. Furthermore, the increase in number of electric vehicles fuels the need for CFRP products in the automotive industry. CFRP products are employed in the manufacture of hoods, wheels, front gearing, spars, wings, root, fairings, nacelle, flight controls, and engines in different industries such as automotive & defense and wind turbines. However, high costs of CFRP and long production cycles is expected to restrain the market growth. The thermosetting segment accounted for more than two-thirds of the market revenue in 2015 and would continue to lead the market until 2022. This was attributed to its mechanical properties such as tensile strength, compressive strength, hardness, and temperature independence. Thermosetting resins are mostly applicable in high-temperature applications, such as encapsulations, as they retain their mechanical properties over a wide range of temperature. The epoxy resin segment accounted for more than 60% share in global thermosetting CFRP market, in terms of both market volume and revenue, in 2015. The polyester resin and Vinyl resin thermosetting CFRP market segments exhibit potential growth opportunities during the forecast period. The consumption of vinyl resin thermosetting CFRP was about 7,708 tons in 2015 and would reach 15,010 tons by 2022, growing at CAGR of 10%. Pultrusion & winding is the most commonly adopted manufacturing process as the process generates high production volumes in minimal time; approximately 23,565 tons CFRP was manufactured using this process in 2015. The aerospace & defense industry generates the highest revenue, which generated about $5,576 million revenue in 2014. Eswara Prasad, Team Lead Chemical Research at Allied Market Research states that, "CFRP material would substitute metals in various automotive applications, primarily to reduce fuel consumption. This rise in demand for lightweight CFRP products in automotive industry to set new trends in the market". Key findings of the study North America is expected to continue to lead the market throughout 2014-2022 in terms of revenue, followed by Asia-Pacific. Thermosetting CFRP market volume is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.3%. Wet lamination & infusion is the fastest growing manufacturing process used for CFRP production, in terms of revenue, with a CAGR of 9.2%. Polyacylonitrile (PAN) raw material segment accounted for the largest share in the CFRP market by raw material, both in terms of volume and revenue, in 2015. Polyester resin is projected to grow at the highest CAGR of 8.5%, in terms of revenue. PEEK segment accounted for the largest share in thermoplastic CFRP market, both in terms of volume and revenue, in 2015. North America and Asia-Pacific collectively contributed more than two-thirds share to the market revenue in 2015. In the same year, Asia-Pacific dominated the market, in terms of volume, owing to increased demand for CFRP products in the automotive and sports industry. Japan and China dominated the Asia-Pacific CFRP market as the leading manufacturers of low tow carbon are headquartered in these countries. The emerging markets of the developing countries such as South Korea, India, and Taiwan are expected to grow at the highest rates due to increasing demand for CFRP products in numerous industries.

Hemal Vora First Posted: Oct 12, 2016 05:54 AM EDT Elon Musk and SpaceX are not the only ones planning such an expedition, Boeing, and NASA are in the race too. But what is the real cost of a trip to mars? (Photo : Brendan Smialowski / Getty Images) At the 67th International Astronautical Congress, and Elon Musk had revealed the SpaceX's indentations of colonization of mars and build a city on mars. Elon Musk and SpaceX are not the only ones planning such an expedition, Boeing, and NASA are in the race too. Advertisement But what is the cost of a trip to mars? Not financially but healthwise. There are millions of volunteers who are ready for a one way trip to mars. There are people who don't mind dying on or on the way to mars. But it is still worth knowing what will a trip to mars cost. Scientists at the University of California-Irvine have conducted a study to research a condition they call as "space brain." Astronauts will be exposed to high energy cosmic rays with charged particles that represent a GCR. Since the particles are high energy they would easily penetrate the spacecraft and enter the tissues of the human body. The real cost of a trip to mars could be a long term cognitive dysfunction if the results of recent experiments on the rodents are to be believed. Rodents exposed to cosmic radiation exhibit performance decrements pertaining to persistent hippocampal and cortical functions. "Exposure to these particles can lead to a range of potential central nervous system complications that can occur during and persist long after actual space travel," said UCI professor of radiation oncology, Charles Limoli, as reported in Cnet. The irradiation also caused significant reductions in spine density, dendritic complexity, and altered spine morphology. Cosmic radiation also disrupted synaptic integrity and increased neuroinflammation that persisted more than 6 months after exposure. Advertisement The real cost of a trip to mars would also be a decreased "fear extinction." The Astronauts who return from mars would not be able to overcome simple fears arising out of an untoward incident. Although amid all these rising fears about irradiations, Elon Musk,said, The radiation thing is often brought up, but I think it's not too big of a deal." With a long way to go before a trip to mars becomes a reality it would be in best interests of mankind to figure out the real cost of a trip to mars.

Each of the 12 mid-size jets comes at a catalogue price of $271 million, the Guangzhou-based airline said on Wednesday, adding that the aircraft will be delivered in stages from 2018 to 2020. "The acquisition will strengthen the construction of Guangzhou hub, thus maximizing the operational efficiency and enhancing the competitiveness of the group," China Southern said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. China is the world's fastest-growing aviation market, having expanded rapidly as rising incomes resulting from years of healthy economic growth have boosted demand for internal flights as well as travel abroad for business and leisure. China Southern's deal follows similar fleet expansion moves by rivals such as Air China <601111.SS><0753.HK> and China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS><0670.HK><CEA.N>.

Tech entrepreneur and founder of a private space-exploration firm, Elon Musk announced in September he intended to send people to Mars. He also outlined a philosophy that would see humans become a multi-planet species. Not content to just have people visit the Red Planet, Musk envisions sending a million people to live there by the end of the century. His technical ambitions are impressive: he plans to start sending transports carrying 100 people per trip to Mars within the next decade, using and reusing a transportation system including a rocket 3½ times as powerful as NASA’s biggest, the Saturn V. Far from scoffing at the prospect, observers are taking Musk seriously — and so they should. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has already announced his company will get a human to Mars before Musk’s does. Underlying the scope of such an undertaking is a bigger question, though: why go? Humans have a long history of colonizing, in many waves, whether it’s through Africa, Eurasia, Australia, the Pacific or the Americas — in fact, settling everywhere on this planet except possibly Antarctica. But the prospect of not just going to Mars, but staying there, raises the question: do we need another planet? Based on the way we’ve been treating this one, it’s a question worth considering. Greenhouse gas emissions have led to a troubling milestone for our atmosphere: this year, for the first time on record, carbon did not drop below 400 parts per million. All evidence points to the fact that not only is our climate changing, but the seven billion humans on this planet have something to do with it. Mars, from what we know, is inhospitable to human life. A colony could thrive there as long as people are protected from the environment and would require the best in technology to achieve it. Why then shouldn’t the Earth, currently the only planet we have, get the same kind of respect? Should the climate change drastically — and it could, to a sort not seen since before humans walked the Earth — we may find things pretty inhospitable here, too. Science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson predicted this 20 years ago in his landmark novel "Red Mars." As settlement on the Red Planet turned to efforts to manipulate its climate to become more Earth-like so people could live on the surface without spacesuits, runaway climate change on Earth caused problems there. In describing the irony, one of the characters remarked the best and brightest had to turn their efforts to making Earth inhabitable as well. Thankfully, we’re not at that point yet. And with inventors like Musk still actively believing that change is possible, perhaps there is still hope. While Musk has set his sights on the Red Planet, he has not ignored this one. The South African-born Canadian-American is not only the founder and CEO of SpaceX, but also the co-founder, CEO and product architect of automaker Tesla Motors — which is famous for its mass production of electric cars —and the co-founder of SolarCity, a California company that designs and installs solar power systems. Certainly the road to saving Earth’s environment will not be easy, and we need our politicians and our citizenry to be on board, just as much as our scientists and engineers. We need more men like Musk who have the ability to dream and think big and understand that change in our lifestyles and economies as a necessity. The effort to settle on Mars will be a feat of human ingenuity, engineering and creativity — the same rigour that will be required to save this planet as well. After all, it’s home. » Winnipeg Free Press & The Brandon Sun Republished from the Brandon Sun print edition October 12, 2016 Print E–mail Tweet Report Error Rate this This article has not yet been rated.

Jordan Jaffe, Spectre's CEO and co-founder, commented "Demand for express freighters is at an all-time high, with hundreds more required in the coming years to meet the demand created by rapid growth in e-commerce and expansion of the global middle class. The classic freighter feedstock is becoming increasingly scarce and overly expensive for their age. We intend to leverage our ability to purchase in fleet-sized transactions to offer next-generation freighters with attractive economics. Spectre's order means that 737-700 and 737-800 freighters will be available on a turnkey basis for lease and purchase to forward-thinking customers beginning from Q1 2017 (-700F) and Q3 2017 (-800F), with Spectre taking the attendant technical, financial and schedule risks inherent with aircraft acquisition and PTF modification programs such as these." Photo- http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161011/427558 Spectre's large 737NG freighter commitment follows its 20-aircraft Boeing 767-300ER program collaboration earlier this year with aircraft trading partner Jetran, LLC, the majority of which will become freighters and be operated in support of e-commerce giants such as Amazon's Prime Air and China-based Alibaba. Spectre Cargo Solutions (SCS) is the freighter aircraft focused arm of Spectre Air Capital, a Texas-based aircraft trading and leasing company whose principals have bought, sold and leased 500+ passenger, freighter and special mission aircraft. SCS' leadership, including president Kevin Casey and Asia-based Sam Goh, is well regarded and among the most experienced freighter conversion team in the business, with hundreds of cargo conversions sold, performed and supported spanning Boeing 737 F/C/QC, 757 F/C, 767F and 747F. Together, the SCS team provides bespoke freighter aircraft and engine solutions to customers across the globe ranging from conversion feedstock sourcing through turnkey freighter aircraft leasing programs tailored to each customer's unique requirements. In addition to serving as IAI's 737-800 launch customer and second major 737-700F customer (after Alaska Airlines), Spectre is actively supporting 737 Classic, 757 and 767 freighter customers with aircraft modified by most major STC brands. Spectre has current availability on 737-300F & 737-400F, 757-200F, 767-300F, and is offering advance positions on 737-700F (from Q1 2017) and 737-800F (Q4 2017).

Trading activity is likely to be somewhat subdued, however, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The minutes of the meeting may attract more attention than usual, as last month's decision to leave interest rates unchanged was far from unanimous. Reflecting division within the central bank, Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren voted to raise rates by a quarter point. U.S. stocks fell sharply on Tuesday amid a pullback in oil prices and a rough start to the third quarter earnings season following Alcoa's (AA) weaker than expected results. The major averages opened lower and declined steadily until late trading before moving sideways around the lower levels. The Dow Industrials lost 200.38 points or 1.09 percent before ending at a 2-week low of 18,129, the S&P 500 Index ended down 26.93 points or 1.24 percent at a 3-week low of 2,137 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,247, down 81.89 points to 1.54 percent. Twenty-six of the thirty Dow components ended the session lower and one stock ended unchanged, while the remaining three stocks advanced. Merck (MRK), UnitedHealth (UNH), Intel (INTC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP) and Boeing (BA) were among the biggest decliners among the Dow components. The market witnessed broad based weakness, with gold, housing, semiconductor and biotechnology stocks spearheading the losses. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are inching up $0.02 to $50.81 a barrel after sliding $0.56 to $50.79 a barrel in the previous session. The previous session's pullback came amid the release of the IEA's monthly oil market report, which showed an increase in OPEC production in September. Some price drag also came from profit taking following Monday's rally.

By Weston Williams, Staff October 11, 2016 Save for later Saved An evenly layered rock, photographed by NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover, suggests bodies of liquid water on Mars. NASA released the image on Dec. 9, 2014. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of The Martian rover Opportunity is making another historic first on the surface of Mars. The highly successful probe will spend the next two years exploring a Martian gully that scientists suspect may have been carved out by an ancient water source. The mission is the latest challenge for the aging rover, which was originally intended to function for three months and is now in its 13th year. Data gathered by Opportunity and similar rovers have shaped an ever-greater understanding of Mars. As NASA, Boeing, and SpaceX all set their sights on human missions to Mars in coming decades, they will depend on this data to help them know what to expect when they touch down on an alien planet for the first time. Recommended:In Pictures Exploring Mars with rovers Curiosity and Opportunity When Opportunity and its companion rover, Spirit, landed on Mars in 2004, their missions were expected to last only 90 Martian days (about 92.4 Earth days). Both probes far surpassed these estimates, with Spirit finally dying in 2010, and Opportunity still going strong. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! In Pictures Exploring Mars with rovers Curiosity and Opportunity Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend With Opportunity's newest mission, NASA hopes to find evidence that liquid water created the gully, located in in the "Bitterroot Valley" portion of the western rim of the Endeavour Crater. "Fluid-carved gullies on Mars have been seen from orbit since the 1970s, but none had been examined up close on the surface before," said Opportunity principal investigator Steve Squyres of Cornell University in a statement. "One of the three main objectives of our new mission extension is to investigate this gully. We hope to learn whether the fluid was a debris flow, with lots of rubble lubricated by water, or a flow with mostly water and less other material," he explained. The mission faces a few hurdles. Opportunity is an old rover, and its now-outdated flash memory for holding data overnight no longer functions properly, meaning that scientists have to beam information to Earth immediately or risk losing it forever. That could be complicated by a threatened  global dust storm on the planet as soon as October 29th. Recommended:In Pictures Mars Spirit rover: What a long-range trip it's been "Once in awhile, several storms will start up at once and they will blow up larger and larger until they basically cover the entire planet," James Shirley, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Pasadena Star-News. "They’re probably the most spectacular weather event that we can see in the solar system. I don’t think there’s really anything like it anywhere else." The last storm, in 2007, was one of the first major threats to Spirit and Opportunity. "We had to take special measures to enable their survival for several weeks with little sunlight to keep them powered," recalled John Callas, project manager for Spirit and Opportunity, in a statement. "Each rover powered up only a few minutes each day, enough to warm them up, then shut down to the next day without even communicating with Earth. For many days during the worst of the storm, the rovers were completely on their own." If the global dust storm does occur, the aging Opportunity might have trouble continuing its mission. But NASA is confident enough in the probe to approve the mission extension that will take the rover all the way to the bottom of the 14-mile-wide Endeavor Crater. "We have now exceeded the prime-mission duration [of Opportunity] by a factor of 50," said Opportunity project manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in a statement. "Milestones like this are reminders of the historic achievements made possible by the dedicated people entrusted to build and operate this national asset for exploring Mars."

The order by Asia’s biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion according to list prices, although carriers typically negotiate discounts. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliners. The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing’s 787 order tally for the year. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange statement Wednesday. The planes will be delivered between 2018 and 2020 and funded using cash and loans from commercial banks, the Guangzhou, China-based airline said in the statement. The carrier and its subsidiaries have ordered more than $15 billion of new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus Group SE in the past year as more people fly in the world’s most populous nation. Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an order for 300 jets valued at $38 billion on a state visit to the U.S. as Chinese carriers expand their fleet in a nation set to become the biggest travel market in two decades. China Southern, the country’s first Boeing 787 customer, already flies 16 Dreamliners on operating and financial lease, according to data the airline released in August. The carrier had a total fleet of 684 planes, the largest in Asia, as it caters to a nation that is expected to surpass North America as the world’s largest aviation market. Boeing had netted 19 orders for the Dreamliner this year prior to Qatar’s announcement, bringing total sales for the plane to 1,161. Airbus netted 25 sales of the A350, its most advanced jetliner, through the end of September. Both planemakers have contended with slowing demand for widebody aircraft as moderating fuel prices and a glut of used Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 models tempers demand.

The White House was calling attention to government contracts awarded to six companies to build prototypes for “habitats” that could sustain human life in deep space. One such privately developed habitat — an inflatable room — is already attached to the International Space Station. Obama also said that within two years, private companies like SpaceX and Boeing will taxi astronauts to the space station with NASA as a customer. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth, something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars,” Obama wrote in an op-ed on CNN’s website. He said the ultimate goal is for humans eventually to stay on the red planet “for an extended time”. NASA officials and outside space experts said there is little new in what’s coming out of the White House on Mars, something NASA has taken to calling its “Journey To Mars”. “There’s nothing big here at all, unless you haven’t been paying attention,” said former George Washington University Space Policy Chief John Logsdon. “It’s a refocusing of the fact that he set these goals and NASA has been pursuing them.” Alan Ladwig, a former top NASA official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, said he likes the intent, “but it’s a bit late in the term to shine a light on the humans to Mars exploration”. The president planned to discuss the initiative further when he meets with scientists, engineers and academics at an innovation summit Thursday in Pittsburgh. Obama first set a goal in 2010 to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, but the initiative has attracted little attention since then. Numerous Government Accountability Office reports have warned of the challenges in meeting that goal, most notable a lack of substantial US government funding. Obama did not elaborate on what a Mars mission would cost or how the US would pay for it. But he said it will require years of patience, testing and education. “The question is why and how does this support US national interests,” said Scott Pace, a NASA associate administrator during the George W Bush administration and space policy chief at George Washington University. He said returning to the moon instead of going to Mars makes more sense for both commerce and international cooperation. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1.

President Barack Obama sought Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2016, to reinvigorate his six-year-old call for the U.S. to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, a mission NASA has been slowly and quietly trudging away at. (NASA via AP) By JOSH LEDERMAN and SETH BORENSTEIN, Associated Press Published: October 11, 2016, 11:06 PM A   A WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama sought Tuesday to reinvigorate his six-year-old call for the U.S. to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, a mission NASA has been slowly trudging away at. The White House was calling attention to government contracts awarded to six companies to build prototypes for “habitats” that could sustain human life in deep space. One such privately developed habitat — an inflatable room — is already attached to the International Space Station. Obama also said that within two years, private companies like SpaceX and Boeing will taxi astronauts to the space station with NASA as a customer. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth, something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars,” Obama wrote in an op-ed on CNN’s website. He said the ultimate goal is for humans eventually to stay on the red planet “for an extended time.” NASA officials and outside space experts said there is little new in what’s coming out of the White House on Mars, something NASA now calls its “Journey To Mars.” “There’s nothing big here at all, unless you haven’t been paying attention,” said former George Washington University space policy chief John Logsdon. “It’s a re-focusing of the fact that he set these goals and NASA has been pursuing them.” The president planned to discuss the initiative further when he meets with scientists, engineers and academics at an innovation summit Thursday in Pittsburgh. Obama first set a goal in 2010 to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, but the initiative has attracted little attention since then. Numerous Government Accountability Office reports have warned of the challenges in meeting that goal, most notable a lack of substantial U.S. government funding Obama did not elaborate on what a Mars mission would cost or how the U.S. would pay for it. But he said it will require years of patience, testing and education. “The question is why and how does this support U.S. national interests,” said Scott Pace, a NASA associate administrator during the George W. Bush administration and space policy chief at George Washington University. He said returning to the moon instead of going to Mars makes more sense for both commerce and international cooperation.

NASA Takes Next Step in Green Aviation X-planes Plans by Jim Banke for NASA Aeronautics News Washington DC (SPX) Oct 12, 2016 Lockheed Martin's hybrid wing body concept. Image courtesy Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company. For a larger version of this image please go here. At the 39th meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization, 191 countries reached a global climate deal to reduce carbon emissions from aviation. At the same time, NASA is working to create new experimental aircraft that will demonstrate new "green aviation" technology intended to dramatically reduce fuel use, emissions and noise - with the goal of cutting emissions from the nation's commercial aircraft fleet by more than 50 percent, while also reducing perceived noise levels near airports to one-half the level of the quietest aircraft flying today. To that end, NASA recently awarded six-month contracts to four companies, who will each define the technical approach, schedule, and cost for one or more large-scale, subsonic X-plane concepts. These concepts are in support of NASA's ultra-efficient subsonic transport research goals. The companies are Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation of Manassas, VA; Dzyne Technologies Incorporated of Fairfax, VA; Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company of Ft. Worth, TX; and The Boeing Company of Hazelwood, MO. "Engaging these contractors now to gather this information will help us move forward efficiently and expeditiously when we're ready to commit to building the X-planes themselves," said Ed Waggoner, NASA's Integrated Aviation Systems Program director. Each company is to detail their specific X-plane system requirements for a piloted experimental aircraft capable of sustained, two to three hours of powered high subsonic flight, as well as conducting at least two research flight sorties per week over the course of a year-long program. The requested information is to be built around a plan that would see the selected experimental aircraft eventually flying no later than 2021. NASA's return to flying large-scale X-plane technology demonstrators - a staple of its aeronautical research heritage - is part of New Aviation Horizons, an ambitious 10-year accelerated research plan developed and announced by NASA earlier this year. The five X-plane concepts envisioned for possible further development and the contractor responsible for providing NASA with the required information include: + Aurora Flight Services for the D8 "Double Bubble," a twin-aisle, largely composite airliner in which the fuselage is shaped to provide lift - enabling smaller wings - and the jet engines are mounted atop the rear tail area, which takes advantage of the air flow over the aircraft to both improve engine efficiency and reduce noise in the cabin and on the ground below. + Dzyne Technologies for a smaller regional jet-sized aircraft that features a blended wing body (BWB) design in which the lines of a traditional tube and wing airliner are shaped to become one continuous line in which the seam between the wing and fuselage is nearly indistinguishable. As an aerodynamic shape, this configuration increases lift and reduces drag. + Lockheed Martin for its Hybrid Wing Body, which includes features of the BWB on the forward part of the fuselage but has a more conventional looking T-shaped tail, with its jet engines mounted on the side of the hull but above the blended wing. Increased lift, reduced drag and quieter operations are all potential benefits. + Boeing for both its BWB concept - versions of which the company has flight tested with its subscale X-48 program in partnership with NASA - and a Truss-Braced Wing concept, which features a very long, aerodynamically efficient wing that is held up on each side by a set of trusses connecting the fuselage to the wing. Otherwise the aircraft appears more conventional than the other X-plane concepts under consideration. Preliminary design work already has begun on a half-scale X-plane called the Quiet Supersonic Technology, or QueSST, a piloted supersonic aircraft that generates a soft thump, rather than the disruptive boom currently associated with supersonic flight. Work also is underway on the X-57 Maxwell, a general aviation-sized electric research airplane. Maxwell will fly for the first time in early 2018 and demonstrate battery powered, distributed electric propulsion. Transport-sized electric aircraft could reduce energy use by more than 60 percent and harmful emissions by more than 90 percent. This was the first project to get an X-plane number designation in a decade. NASA's other green aviation initiatives include reducing airline emissions and flight delays. Working in partnership with airlines and air traffic controllers at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, NASA is beginning the first-of-a-kind demonstration of new technologies that coordinate operational schedules for aircraft arrivals, departures, and taxiing.

Obama: Getting humans to Mars will require NASA, private companies to team up By SAMANTHA MASUNAGA and JIM PUZZANGHERA Los Angeles Times Oct 11, 2016 0 wx104 Image by NASA WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama hammered home his goal to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, while acknowledging that accomplishing it would require public and private collaboration. Obama first said in 2010 he wanted to send astronauts “to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth” by the mid-2030s with “a landing on Mars” to follow. In an opinion article Tuesday on CNN.com, Obama said the ultimate ambition was not only to send humans to Mars and bring them back, but to “remain there for an extended time.” “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we’re already well on our way,” he said. Obama’s article comes two weeks after SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk laid out an ambitious plan to eventually send 1 million people to colonize the Red Planet and turn humans into a multiplanetary species within 40 to 100 years. In a speech at the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico, Musk similarly called for a public/private partnership. NASA is working with Hawthorne, Calif.-based SpaceX and aerospace giant Boeing Co. to develop crew capsules to take astronauts to the International Space Station. NASA relies on SpaceX and aerospace firm Orbital ATK to deliver supplies and cargo to the space station. This week, Obama will speak at the White House Frontiers conference in Pittsburgh, an event that will focus on innovations in science and technology, including a future Mars mission. Executives from companies such as SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and moon mining firm Moon Express are also set to speak at the conference. “It just underlines the theme that’s run through the Obama administration, which is encouraging partnerships with the private sector, providing additional opportunities for work and, when appropriate, doing business in a slightly different way,” said John Logsdon, professor emeritus of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. “It’s mainly about leaving a legacy,” he said. Analysts said a public/private partnership recognizes the reality of the space business today, as well as financial limitations. “On the commercial side, there are a lot of innovative ideas,” said Bill Ostrove, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International. “But they need that backing from the government both in the know-how … (and) the government’s financial resources.” Smaller space startups that don’t usually work with the government could benefit most from Obama’s goal, said Eric Stallmer, president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation trade group. “I think it gives a level of excitement to a variety of different players,” he said. “You don’t know who the next SpaceX could be, or the next Blue Origin,” referring to the space tourism company started by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. SpaceX, whose full name is Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has said its first test flight of an interplanetary vehicle could come in four years. A crewed mission could launch in late 2024 and arrive on Mars in 2025. Developing the transport system could cost SpaceX $10 billion. In an email, SpaceX spokesman Phil Larson said it was “exciting to see President Obama advocate for the next frontier in human space flight,” and that the company was looking forward to “participating in the journey.” The company’s plan to send an unmanned Dragon spacecraft to the Red Planet as early as 2018 will provide an early chance to demonstrate how private space companies and NASA can work together, said Charles Lurio, publisher of the Lurio Report newsletter on entrepreneurial spaceflight. SpaceX will use the flight to test landing capabilities, interplanetary navigation and other systems. NASA will provide some technical support for the mission because it is interested in the entry, descent and landing data. Marco Caceres, of the Teal Group, estimated that a mission to Mars done the “traditional way” by NASA could cost at least $1 trillion. Oftentimes, large space programs can get delayed if Congress does not grant the requested funding amount, or if there are technical problems along the way. A public/private partnership may speed up the timeline and could lower that cost below $1 trillion, Caceres said. But one of the biggest questions is whether such a program could get funding from Congress, said Ostrove of Forecast International. “There is some desire to do the actual exploration,” he said. “I think that there’s maybe not necessarily the political will to spend the money on these types of programs when there’s so many other things we’re facing now.” One question still to be answered is who will build the massive rockets needed to get to Mars. NASA plans to send its Space Launch System rocket to an asteroid in the mid-2020s and to Mars in the 2030s. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has said he thinks the first person to land on Mars will “arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” a reference to the company’s role on the SLS project. That is a challenge to Musk, who described a rocket booster measuring 39 feet in diameter. When stacked with the SpaceX Mars spaceship, the interplanetary transport system would be 400 feet tall. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

The nonprofit was formed in 2011 to better coordinate land, incentives and economic tools that make Oklahoma City even more attractive to companies and developers. In traditional anniversary gift protocol, the five-year gift is wood. While that doesn’t seem romantic in terms of lasting love, it does seem appropriate for the alliance’s work – enabling companies and developers to build and invest in our city. Before the alliance was formed, Oklahoma City was already on the transformative path with development projects like Devon Energy’s headquarters downtown. We have all enjoyed the positive ripple effects of that investment, which included the renovation of the Myriad Gardens and the surrounding area. What the public did not experience was the magnitude of coordinating four agencies’ resources and paperwork to make possible incentives and support from the city. Today that process is streamlined with the alliance’s leadership, making it more effective in time, decision-making and selection for the best types and levels of support necessary. In addition to managing several economic entities, such as the Oklahoma City Urban Renewal Authority and Oklahoma City Redevelopment Authority, the alliance works in collaboration with public and private entities to begin or invigorate development projects. The 10 tax increment financing districts in Oklahoma City, covering more than 4,000 acres, are excellent examples of public-private investment with transformative impact. The recent openings of the GE Global Research Center, 21c Hotel and Boeing also highlight public-private investments coordinated by the alliance. Through the Strategic Investment Program, the organization helped encourage Boeing to expand its operations and relocate employees to Oklahoma City. Following Oklahoma City’s $6 million Strategic Investment Program package, Boeing has nearly doubled its new jobs, invested $80 million in a new facility and is expected to have a $640 million economic impact on our state. Those stories are possible because five years ago our city leaders had the vision to maximize the development process by forming the alliance. In that short time, it has been proven to work. I look forward to our 10-year report. There are several exciting projects underway that will be completed, or near completion, that will further highlight the economic transformation of our great city.

JESSICA BAL Miami Herald archive i By David Ovalle dovalle@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Known for her encyclopedic command of the law, Florida senior assistant attorney general Sandra Jaggard helped keep some of Miami’s most notorious killers on Death Row. Jaggard was a unique person with a unique job. A one-time engineer who worked on the Space Station, Jaggard forged a niche as the prosecutorial authority on capital litigation in South Florida, writing complex briefs, making concise arguments before judges and earning the trust of people whose loved ones had been murdered, sometimes decades before. Jaggard died unexpectedly Tuesday of a suspected heart attack. She was 51. Her death stunned colleagues at Miami’s criminal courthouse, where Jaggard was a fixture not only in arguing appeals but helping prosecutors. “I always marveled at her legal talents. Sandy was the go-to person if you needed a case on point or wanted a sounding board to explore legal arguments,” said Associate Deputy Attorney General Carolyn Snurkowski, a colleague of more than two decades. “She was a brilliant lawyer,” said Miami-Dade Assistant State Attorney Penny Brill, the head of her office’s legal bureau who worked alongside her on appeals. “It’s such a loss to both offices. She meant so much to us.” Jaggard was born May 2, 1965, in Woodbury, New Jersey. Along with her family, she moved to Huntsville, Alabama, and later attended Vanderbilt University, earning a degree in biomedical engineering in the early 1980s. Her father, a physician, died at age 52, also of a heart attack. After college, Jaggard worked at Boeing, focused on the life-support module for the Space Station, according to her family and friends. Jaggard later moved to South Florida, where she enrolled at the University of Miami’s law school. She graduated in 1994 and was soon hired at the Florida Attorney General’s Office. It was here that she built her reputation working in the complex field of capital litigation, working to keep intact convictions and death sentences. She could recite minute details from transcripts of a decades-old trial, every sort of criminal-court rule and arcane and complex case law. “She had a phenomenal memory,” said Miami-Dade prosecutor Fleur Lobree, her best friend and longtime roommate. “She was really an intellectual person. She liked the intellectual challenges of the most significant cases.” Jaggard wrote the briefs and did oral arguments in the notorious 1994 torture murders of Frank Griga and Krisztina Furton, committed by a crew of Miami bodybuilders. The convictions and death sentences for the killers, Daniel Lugo and Adrian Noel Doorbal remain intact. Her work remains the authority on racketeering murder cases, said Miami-Dade prosecutor Gail Levine, who tried the case and worked often with Jaggard. “She really felt the pain of Frank and Krisztina,” Levine said. “She had a passion for what she did. She understood the difference between good and evil.” Jaggard spearheaded the appeals virtually every major death-penalty case in Miami-Dade, including Thomas Knight, who murdered a husband-and-wife and a prison guard; Manuel Pardo, the ex-Sweetwater cop who became a serial killer, and Marshall Lee Gore, a serial rapist and killer. Each man was executed in recent years. “Sandra Jaggard was a tenacious and passionate lawyer who spent her career protecting victims and Florida’s citizens from the most violent criminals,” Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said. “She will be greatly missed.” Before she died, Jaggard was handling 27 capital cases. For the scope of her work, she was honored for “outstanding appellate advocacy” by the Association of Government Attorneys in Capital Litigation in 2010. In court, Jaggard had a tough exterior with a wry sense of humor, her colleagues remembered — but she never failed to mentor young lawyers. “Her heart of gold was always just below the surface,” Snurkowski said. “She prided herself as being tough but in fact was a very warm and caring person.” Outside of court, Jaggard loved cooking and baking, marking every holiday season by passing out fudge and other treats to fellow lawyers. She also loved to travel. Despite an often-punishing work schedule, Jaggard rarely missed a holiday gathering with her siblings and eight nieces and nephews. “She was a pretty doting aunt, exceptionally so,” said her brother, John Jaggard. Jaggard is survived by her siblings: Susan Jaggard-Ottemiller, Cindy Jaggard-Everett, Clarence Jaggard Jr. and John Jaggard. Services are pending.

Picture: Jim Watson. AFP Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend US PRESIDENT Barack Obama said this week the nation is relying on private industry to find ways to make the “giant leap” to Mars, with human missions on the horizon by the 2030s. The US president’s announcement confirmed a longstanding agreement to partner with commercial companies on future missions to deep space, and gave some new details on how such collaborations will play out in the coming years, particularly aboard the International Space Station. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama wrote in an essay posted by CNN. “I’m excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth — something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars.” Obama also touted an upcoming conference of top scientists, engineers, innovators and students later this week in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as a chance “to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers.” In August, NASA announced that six companies had been selected to work on deep space habitats, and would receive a combined total of $US65 million over the next two years. These companies include Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and NanoRacks. President Barack Obama walks to greet people waiting on the tarmac as he arrives on Air Force One. Picture: Carolyn KasterSource:AP Habitats, or expandable living quarters, may be erected on a planet’s surface or used to shelter astronauts travelling on a spaceship. The issue of getting enough food and water into space to feed astronauts on a months or years-long mission to deep space has also been a key logistic problem, and little research has been done to show how this might work. “Getting there will take a giant leap,” Obama wrote, alluding to words spoken July 21, 1969 by astronaut Neil Armstrong as he walked on the Moon. (“That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”) “But the first, small steps happen when our students — the Mars generation — walk into their classrooms each day,” Obama said. COMMERCIAL USE OF SPACE STATION A second element of Obama’s plan involves encouraging commercial companies to use the International Space Station, which circles the planet in low-Earth orbit, about 400km high. A recently installed docking adaptor will allow more companies to park their spaceships at the orbiting outpost, a global collaboration that includes the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. Once the ISS’s mission ends in 2020, it could be used as a base to help set up other commercial space stations, said NASA administrator Charles Bolden.

Picture: Stephane CorvajaSource:AFP The US space agency asked companies for input and “the private sector responded enthusiastically, and those responses indicated a strong desire by US companies to attach a commercial module to the ISS that could meet the needs of NASA as well as those of private entrepreneurs,” said Bolden. “As a result of the responses, this fall, NASA will start the process of providing companies with a potential opportunity to add their own modules and other capabilities to the International Space Station.” DEEP SPACE VISION Obama has long pushed for sending Americans to new frontiers, including an asteroid and Mars. He angered some Republicans in his first term when he cancelled a program, called Constellation, aimed at returning astronauts to the Moon, in favour of pursuing deep space exploration instead. In April 2010, Obama outlined his vision for sending people to the Red Planet, Earth’s neighbour, by the 2030s. Bolden described Obama’s plan as “pushing the bounds of human discovery, while also revitalising the space industry and creating jobs here at home.” NASA is currently developing a powerful rocket known as the Space Launch System and a deep space capsule, Orion. The first launch of the SLS — with no people on board — is planned for 2018. A US mission to send humans into the area of space beyond the Moon, but not as far is Mars, is planned for the 2020s.

EMAIL BY Josh Lederman and Seth Borenstein, Associated Press  October 11, 2016 at 5:34 PM EST President Obama pens an oped that calls for a manned mission to Mars. Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama sought Tuesday to reinvigorate his six-year-old call for the U.S. to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, a mission NASA has been slowly and quietly trudging away at. The White House was calling attention to government contracts awarded to six companies to build prototypes for “habitats” that could sustain human life in deep space. One such privately developed habitat — an inflatable room —is already attached to the International Space Station. Obama also said that within two years, private companies like SpaceX and Boeing will taxi astronauts to the space station with NASA as a customer. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth, something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars,” Obama wrote in an op-ed on CNN’s website. He said the ultimate goal is for humans eventually to stay on the red planet “for an extended time.” NASA officials and outside space experts said there is little new in what’s coming out of the White House on Mars, something NASA has taken to calling its “Journey To Mars.” “There’s nothing big here at all, unless you haven’t been paying attention,” said former George Washington University space policy chief John Logsdon. “It’s a re-focusing of the fact that he set these goals and NASA has been pursuing them.” Alan Ladwig, a former top NASA official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, said he likes the intent, “but it’s a bit late in the term to shine a light on the humans to Mars exploration.” The president planned to discuss the initiative further when he meets with scientists, engineers and academics at an innovation summit Thursday in Pittsburgh. Obama first set a goal in 2010 to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, but the initiative has attracted little attention since then. Numerous Government Accountability Office reports have warned of the challenges in meeting that goal, most notable a lack of substantial U.S. government funding Obama did not elaborate on what a Mars mission would cost or how the U.S. would pay for it. But he said it will require years of patience, testing and education. “The question is why and how does this support U.S. national interests,” said Scott Pace, a NASA associate administrator during the George W. Bush administration and space policy chief at George Washington University. He said returning to the moon instead of going to Mars makes more sense for both commerce and international cooperation.

The RQ-21A Blackjack, an American unmanned air vehicle, got its operational capability for the Marine Corps in January, thus meeting a United States Navy requirement for a small tactical unmanned air system (STUAS). The drone, made by Boeing subsidiary Insitu, weighs about 80 pounds unloaded, can fly for 16 hours at a stretch, and "uniquely, the Blackjack uses a tail hook recovery system that makes it capable of operating from a ship," according to Military.com. © Photo: US Air Force / Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson US Marines Want Tech That Can Crush Enemy Spy, Killer DronesThis unmanned aircraft system will be used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and to identify potential targets, providing crucial information to troops on the ground. Lt. Gen. Robert Walsh, commander of Marine Corps Combat Development Command, told Military.com in a September interview, "We can benefit from what [U.S. Special Operations Command] does, from what we're doing, bring that back and go, 'OK, this is what we need to do with equipping the RQ-21,' or concepts of employment that they will use in real-world operations, and not just training. We'll be able to get them out there with their [Marine Special Operations Teams] in Iraq, operating with Iraqis as part of their special ops forces." The Blackjack system has been tested on five aerial vehicles. It was launched from the amphibious assault ship USS Wasp for airstrikes on Daesh (ISIS) targets in Libya. Fleet Marines and MARSOC employ the drone, testing payloads, including some developed for United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). As Walsh stated, using MARSOC as a test force allows the corps to leverage the resources and insights of SOCOM for the benefit of Marines. "We're working with them, partnering with MARSOC. Give them the platform, RQ-21, now they can put their own stuff on there. We can learn from that, we can buy off their contract, we can learn from it, develop our own. There's a lot of opportunities here from working with SOCOM in that area," he said, according to Military.com. ...

MUST CREDIT: NASA, Bill Ingalls. HANDOUT, HANDOUT .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........In 2010, nearly 50 years after John Kennedy called for the United States to send a man to the moon, President Barack Obama went to the Kennedy Space Center, to set a new course. Under George W. Bush, the agency had been working on another lunar mission. But now, with Buzz Aldrin sitting in the audience, Obama had a blunt message about those plans: “We’ve been there before. Buzz has been there. There’s a lot more space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.” Instead of going to the moon, he declared, the U.S. would go to Mars. Now, six years after that speech, as he nears the end of his presidency, Obama is bookending his charge by doubling down on NASA’s plan to get to Mars. In an op-ed published by CNN Tuesday morning ahead of the White House frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh, he reiterated his administration’s goal of “sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.” But while Mars remains years, if not decades away, Obama’s true legacy may be something altogether different: the standing up of a commercial space industry that has ended the government’s monopoly on space. Advertisement Continue reading When the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA looked to the commercial sector to fly its astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, fertilizing the industry with billions of dollars in contracts. And in the past few years, the industry has begun to blossom, reinvigorating interest in space with dramatic landings of rockets on ships with other, unprecedented feats. “Just five years ago, U.S. companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market,” Obama wrote. “Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it..” Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeffrey P. Bezos’ Blue Origin promise suborbital tourist flights within a couple of years. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) SpaceX and Boeing are working toward flying astronauts to the space station. Bigelow Aerospace is building inflatable habitats that could ultimately succeed the station. In fact, one of the habitats is currently attached to the station. “It will become one of the great ironies in the history of exploration into space that someone many politicians called a socialist was a champion for the possibilities of capitalism in space,” said James Muncy, a space policy analyst at PolySpace, a consulting firm. While the high-profile billionaires get the most attention, there are many companies pushing the frontiers. Sierra Nevada Corp., another of NASA’s beneficiaries, just announced that it had signed a deal with the United Nations to fly its first-ever space mission. Earlier this year, Moon Express, which is vying for the $20 million Lunar XPrize, received permission to send a robotic lander on the moon, the first commercial company to get such approval from the U.S. government. There is still no self-sustaining economy to keep commercial space companies alive, many of which would wither without the support of NASA or the billionaires that are funding them with their own money. And the two companies that have the contracts to restore human space travel from U.S. soil both have suffered setbacks and delays. Boeing recently confirmed an Aviation Week report that because of technical issues with its Starliner spacecraft it was pushing back flights six months and hopes to fly by the end of 2018. SpaceX, the other company NASA is relying on to fly its astronauts, had its Falcon 9 rocket blow up last month and still doesn’t know exactly why. NASA’s own vehicles, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, have had their own troubles. The Government Accountability Office recently warned that the $23 billion program faces additional potential cost overruns and schedule delays. NASA has always relied on its contractors, and Obama conceded that government cannot do it alone: “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators,” he wrote. obama-mars Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: NASA launching new Orion spacecraft on test flight – Dec 2, 2014 Buzz Aldrin joins university, forming 'master plan' for Mars – Aug 27, 2015 Elon Musk on mariachi bands, zero-G games, and why his Mars plan is like 'Battlestar Galactica.' – Sep 28, 2016 Why President Obama may have selected the wrong planet for a major expedition – Oct 11, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

The White House was calling attention to government contracts awarded to six companies to build prototypes for “habitats” that could sustain human life in deep space. One such privately developed habitat – an inflatable room – is already attached to the International Space Station. Obama also said that within two years, private companies like SpaceX and Boeing will taxi astronauts to the space station with NASA as a customer. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth, something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars,” Obama wrote in an op-ed on CNN’s website . He said the ultimate goal is for humans eventually to stay on the red planet “for an extended time.” NASA officials and outside space experts said there is little new in what’s coming out of the White House on Mars, something NASA has taken to calling its “Journey To Mars .” “There’s nothing big here at all, unless you haven’t been paying attention,” said former George Washington University space policy chief John Logsdon. “It’s a re-focusing of the fact that he set these goals and NASA has been pursuing them.” Alan Ladwig, a former top NASA official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, said he likes the intent, “but it’s a bit late in the term to shine a light on the humans to Mars exploration.” The president planned to discuss the initiative further when he meets with scientists, engineers and academics at an innovation summit Thursday in Pittsburgh. Obama first set a goal in 2010 to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, but the initiative has attracted little attention since then. Numerous Government Accountability Office reports have warned of the challenges in meeting that goal, most notable a lack of substantial U.S. government funding Obama did not elaborate on what a Mars mission would cost or how the U.S. would pay for it. But he said it will require years of patience, testing and education. “The question is why and how does this support U.S. national interests,” said Scott Pace, a NASA associate administrator during the George W. Bush administration and space policy chief at George Washington University. He said returning to the moon instead of going to Mars makes more sense for both commerce and international cooperation.

(KWCH) Spirit Aerosystems celebrated a milestone Tuesday - the delivery of it's 500th 787 fuselage to Boeing. "It's awesome to be able to stand here today to represent all the employees of Spirit on our 500th delivery. It's an amazing feet," said Tom Gentile, President and CEO of Spirit Aerosystems. The section of plane being celebrated is the forward fuselage of a 787 Dreamliner. Spirit delivered it in September, but gathered its employees and elected officials together Tuesday morning to celebrate. Senator Pat Roberts, Congressman Mike Pompeo and Governor Sam Brownback were all there. "500 in that short of period of time of that big of a plane. This is just a huge accomplishment," said Governor Sam Brownback. The program started in 2007. There are currently 500 people in Wichita working on the 787. "We're a proud member of the community. We love being in Wichita and we look forward to a bright futures, said Kevin Matthies, Spirit VP over 787 programs. Matthies says they'll continue to build this section as long as Boeing keeps this plane alive. The plane is built to remain in service much longer than the 30 to 40 year life of most aircraft.

Trump's tweetstorm​ Photo: Daniel Acker And now to just one of the many reasons humans may want to consider decamping to Mars by the 2030s. (Can it be any sooner many might ask?!)  Donald Trump took to his Twitter to to rip into Paul Ryan in a string of tweets as "weak and ineffective" after the House Speaker said he could no longer support his party's nominee.  [BBC] Advertisement Then, he followed up with a tweet saying "It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to." [Donald Trump/Twitter] Three things. Trump is successfully diverting from the tapes with his tirade against the Republican party and the schism confirms he hijacked the party for the nomination.  "We now essentially have…an independent candidate" for President, and his name is Trump, writes Gerald F.

Its been my favourite game ever since Mum first let us loose on her beautiful old wooden board edition, which came complete with all the tokens and well-used, sometimes torn money bills packed up into an old tin - the sort you used to be able to buy biscuits in. It was one of the upsides of being one of eight children - most of the time, and I say most, you could find someone to play with you.  As I've grown older, my stock of monopoly playing friends has dwindled to about…zero. Everyone refuses to play with me and I don't understand why. I think its healthy to be competitive, even when it comes to board games.  Anyway, I loved this story by Natasha Rudra about Hasbro is renovating its Australia edition. This year there are five Canberra nominations for a spot on the board, including…Canberra itself.  The others are Lake Burley Griffin, the Australian War Memorial, Floriade and Questacon! [Canberra Times]  I'm a bit of traditionalist when it comes to Monopoly and have always been a bit sceptical about these country-specific editions.  If its a choice between Pentonville and Floriade, I'm afraid I'm all for the former.  If only I could find someone to play with me!

If Only It Were That Easy Jeffrey Kluger @jeffreykluger Oct. 11, 2016 SHARE Jeffrey Kluger is Editor at Large for TIME. Let's see if the U.S. is up to the challenge + READ ARTICLE As far as historians know, John Quincy Adams never promised to get Americans to Mars. That hardly made him uncommon among U.S. Presidents—at least the first 32 of them. But all that changed with President Eisenhower, who pushed for the creation of NASA and got the country’s great space bender going. Ever since then, Mars has been squarely in America’s sights, with most Presidents calling it out explicitly as a sort of 21st (and before that 20th) century extension of Manifest Destiny. On Tuesday, President Obama full-throatedly joined that chorus. In an opinion piece he penned on CNN.com, the President promised a public-private partnership to get astronauts on the Red Planet at last. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama wrote. That’s undeniably stirring stuff—provided there’s anything to it. Which there may well be. Or not. Start with the public-private part. It’s true that, as the President says, “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators. … Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station.” But private companies have always been the space program’s manufacturing backbone. NASA didn’t build the Apollo spacecraft, North American Aviation did. It didn’t build the lunar module either, that was Grumman Aerospace. McDonnell Aircraft built the Mercury and Gemini spacecraft, Boeing was the principle contractor for the space station, and on and on. What was different then was that those contracts were essentially work made to order—like planning precisely the house you want and hiring an architect to build it for you. Now it’s more like buying into a development: private companies like SpaceX and Orbital Sciences do the research and development and building on their own and then compete to sell their products to NASA. That does cut costs dramatically, though even here there’s a little sleight of hand. A portion of the multi-billion dollar contract NASA signed with SpaceX and Orbital Sciences for their unmanned cargo runs to the space station included money for research and development, blurring the public-private divide considerably. Then there’s the deadline: “by the 2030s.” Across industry and government, 15 years away is often the go-to target for any ambitious program that may or may not happen. It’s close enough that it suggests a certain accountability but far enough away that it gives you a lot of time to get the job done. And if you don’t, people might just have forgotten about it by then. Notice, too, the built-in buffer of an additional decade. “The 2030s” can mean January 1, 2030 or December 31, 2039—or any date in between. NASA has already begun quietly hedging on even that generous goal. Astronauts may only orbit Mars in the 2030s, go the current whispers; it could take until the 2040s before they actually land. Contrast this with President John F. Kennedy’s lunar challenge: The U.S. would have boots on the moon “before the end of this decade.” That was a marker he threw down in 1961 when the U.S. had a total of 17 minutes of manned space flight experience. But there was no mistaking what he meant: get there before midnight on December 31, 1969 or we fail. We didn’t fail. Nobody has ever mistaken Obama for much of a space cowboy. His support for the space program was only lukewarm during his first presidential run, until he wised up and realized that Florida, the ultimate space state, is also the ultimate swing state. Industries in swing districts across the country also rely on a robust space program. Even then, the Administration’s signature initiative for human exploration has been the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), which involves ignoring Mars, ignoring the moon and instead sending an unmanned spacecraft out to tow a small asteroid to the lunar vicinity. Astronauts could then go visit it. Why? Because… um… we’ll get back to you on that. ARM is now dying a death by indifference and almost no one expects it to survive in the next Administration. That does clear the decks for Mars, which is an unalloyed good. But it’s not all Obama’s call to get the nation there and it won’t be the next President’s call either. It will be up to the whole brawling, partisan, dysfunctional lot in Washington to see the idea through. The moon program spanned four Presidential Administrations—two Democratic and two Republican—and seven Congresses. They argued about funding and deadlines and they soldiered through the deaths of the Apollo 1 astronauts in a launchpad fire and the near-death of the Apollo 13 astronauts on the way to the moon. And yet the rockets kept flying, the lunar modules kept landing and the job got done. You want to go to Mars? Fine, then decide to go to Mars. It’s really as simple as that. Now let’s see if the nation is up to the challenge. TIME Ideas hosts the world's leading voices, providing commentary on events in news, society, and culture. We welcome outside contributions.

The US president’s announcement confirmed a long-standing agreement to partner with commercial companies on future missions to deep space, and gave some new details on how such collaborations will play out in the coming years, particularly aboard the International Space Station. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: Sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama wrote in an essay posted by CNN.  “I’m excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space,” he added. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth — something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars.” Obama also touted an upcoming conference of top scientists, engineers, innovators and students later this week in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as a chance “to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers.” In August, Nasa announced that six companies had been selected to work on deep space habitats, and would receive a combined total of US$65 million (RM272 million) over the next two years. These companies include Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and NanoRacks. Habitats, or expandable living quarters, may be erected on a planet’s surface or used to shelter astronauts travelling on a spaceship. The issue of getting enough food and water into space to feed astronauts on a months or years-long mission to deep space has also been a key logistical problem, and little research has been done to show how this might work. “Getting there will take a giant leap,” Obama wrote, alluding to words spoken July 21, 1969 by astronaut Neil Armstrong as he walked on the Moon. (“That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”) “But the first, small steps happen when our students — the Mars generation — walk into their classrooms each day,” Obama said. Commercial use of space station A second element of Obama’s plan involves encouraging commercial companies to use the International Space Station, which circles the planet in low-Earth orbit, about 400 kilometres high. A recently installed docking adaptor will allow more companies to park their spaceships at the orbiting outpost, a global collaboration that includes the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. Once the ISS’s mission ends in 2020, it could be used as a base to help set up other commercial space stations, said Nasa administrator Charles Bolden. The US space agency asked companies for input and “the private sector responded enthusiastically, and those responses indicated a strong desire by US companies to attach a commercial module to the ISS that could meet the needs of Nasa as well as those of private entrepreneurs,” said Bolden.  “As a result of the responses, this fall, Nasa will start the process of providing companies with a potential opportunity to add their own modules and other capabilities to the International Space Station.” Deep space vision Obama has long pushed for sending Americans to new frontiers, including an asteroid and Mars. He angered some Republicans in his first term when he cancelled a programme, called Constellation, aimed at returning astronauts to the Moon, in favour of pursuing deep space exploration instead. In April 2010, Obama outlined his vision for sending people to the Red Planet, Earth’s neighbour, by the 2030s. Bolden described Obama’s plan as “pushing the bounds of human discovery, while also revitalising the space industry and creating jobs here at home.” Nasa is currently developing a powerful rocket known as the Space Launch System and a deep space capsule, Orion. The first launch of the SLS — with no people on board — is planned for 2018. A US mission to send humans into the area of space beyond the Moon, but not as far is Mars, is planned for the 2020s. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump to lay out White House goals in prime-time interview Tsunami hits New Zealand after series of strong quakes Trump names media firebrand, top Republican to key posts (VIDEO) Two dead as huge quake rocks New Zealand (VIDEO) Obama on farewell tour to Europe fearful of ‘Trump effect’ After more than 50 years, Singapore to have second Malay president in 2017 Trump and his aides plan next moves as protests spread (VIDEO) Tsunami hits New Zealand after series of strong quakes Trump considers seeking Bill Clinton’s advice Trump to lay out White House goals in prime-time interview Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Two killed as powerful earthquake hits New Zealand Reuters Video: F1 fans watch as Hamilton wins for first time in Brazil Reuters Video: Supermoon rises in Spain Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Related Articles Obama fights obliteration by Trump — Maureen Dowd Trump weighs cabinet picks and ‘amended’ Obamacare Obama administration suspends Pacific trade deal vote effort Trump talks politics with Obama in ‘swamp’ he will soon call home Mars show home for would-be colonisers goes on display (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

NASA released the image on Dec. 9, 2014. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of The Martian rover Opportunity is making another historic first on the surface of Mars. The highly successful probe will spend the next two years exploring a Martian gully that scientists suspect may have been carved out by an ancient water source. The mission is the latest challenge for the aging rover, which was originally intended to function for three months and is now in its 13th year. Data gathered by Opportunity and similar rovers have shaped an ever-greater understanding of Mars. As NASA, Boeing, and SpaceX all set their sights on human missions to Mars in coming decades, they will depend on this data to help them know what to expect when they touch down on an alien planet for the first time. Recommended:In Pictures Exploring Mars with rovers Curiosity and Opportunity When Opportunity and its companion rover, Spirit, landed on Mars in 2004, their missions were expected to last only 90 Martian days (about 92.4 Earth days). Both probes far surpassed these estimates, with Spirit finally dying in 2010, and Opportunity still going strong. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! In Pictures Exploring Mars with rovers Curiosity and Opportunity Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend With Opportunity's newest mission, NASA hopes to find evidence that liquid water created the gully, located in in the "Bitterroot Valley" portion of the western rim of the Endeavour Crater. "Fluid-carved gullies on Mars have been seen from orbit since the 1970s, but none had been examined up close on the surface before," said Opportunity principal investigator Steve Squyres of Cornell University in a statement. "One of the three main objectives of our new mission extension is to investigate this gully. We hope to learn whether the fluid was a debris flow, with lots of rubble lubricated by water, or a flow with mostly water and less other material," he explained. The mission faces a few hurdles. Opportunity is an old rover, and its now-outdated flash memory for holding data overnight no longer functions properly, meaning that scientists have to beam information to Earth immediately or risk losing it forever. That could be complicated by a threatened  global dust storm on the planet as soon as October 29th. Recommended:In Pictures Mars Spirit rover: What a long-range trip it's been "Once in awhile, several storms will start up at once and they will blow up larger and larger until they basically cover the entire planet," James Shirley, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Pasadena Star-News. "They’re probably the most spectacular weather event that we can see in the solar system. I don’t think there’s really anything like it anywhere else." The last storm, in 2007, was one of the first major threats to Spirit and Opportunity. "We had to take special measures to enable their survival for several weeks with little sunlight to keep them powered," recalled John Callas, project manager for Spirit and Opportunity, in a statement. "Each rover powered up only a few minutes each day, enough to warm them up, then shut down to the next day without even communicating with Earth. For many days during the worst of the storm, the rovers were completely on their own." If the global dust storm does occur, the aging Opportunity might have trouble continuing its mission. But NASA is confident enough in the probe to approve the mission extension that will take the rover all the way to the bottom of the 14-mile-wide Endeavor Crater. "We have now exceeded the prime-mission duration [of Opportunity] by a factor of 50," said Opportunity project manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in a statement. "Milestones like this are reminders of the historic achievements made possible by the dedicated people entrusted to build and operate this national asset for exploring Mars."

The release of quarterly results from Alcoa is seen as the unofficial start of earnings season, with financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) due to report their results later this week. Overall trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, as some traders may stay on the sidelines amid a lack of major U.S. economic data. The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting and reports on retail sales and producer prices are likely to attract attention in the coming days. U.S. stocks closed Monday's session higher amid a rally in crude oil prices. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways until early afternoon trading. After giving back some of their gains over the remainder of the session, the averages ended moderately higher. The Dow Industrials added 88.55 points or 0.49 percent before ending at 18,329, the S&P 500 Index ended up 9.92 points or 0.46 percent at 2,164 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,329, up 36.27 points or 0.69 percent. Eighteen of the thirty Dow components ended the session higher and four stocks were little changed, while the remaining eight stocks retreated. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Boeing (BA), Merck (MRK) and Apple (AAPL) were among the biggest gainers of the session, but Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart (WMT) fell sharply. Among the sectors, energy, banking, airline and telecom stocks turned in some of the best performances on the day. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are slipping $0.34 to $51.01 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $1.54 at $51.35 a barrel, the highest closing level since July 15th, 2015. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,258, down $2.40 from the previous session's close of $1,260.40. On Monday, gold rose $8.90, snapping a 6-session losing streak. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.64 yen compared to the 103.61 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1090 compared to yesterday's $1.1139. Asia The Asian markets closed mixed, with the Singapore, South Korean, Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets declining, while the rest of the markets advanced. The Indian market was closed for a public holiday. The Japanese market, which opened after Monday's public holiday, advanced as the yen remained weak. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and rose steadily in the morning. Although there was a slight loss of momentum by the mid-session, the index consolidated in the afternoon, closing up 164.67 points or 0.98 percent at a more than 1-month high of 17,025. Food, chemical, pharma, export, utility, telecom and most resource stocks gained ground, while some housing, real estate, steel, financial and retail stocks came under selling pressure. Australia's All Ordinaries Index ended modestly higher, although well off its best levels. The index ended at 5,562, up 6.70 points or 0.12 percent. Energy and material stocks rallied strongly and consumer and utility stocks saw moderate strength, but most other sectors lost ground. China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 17.11 points or 0.56 percent higher at 3,065, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surrendered all its morning gains by early afternoon trading and languished below the unchanged line thereafter. The index ended down 302.30 points or 1.27 percent at 23,550. On the economic front, the results of a survey by National Australia Bank showed that confidence among businesses in Australia was unchanged in September. The corresponding index was static at 6, although above the expected reading of 5. The business conditions index rose 1 point to 8. A report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the total number of home loans issued in Australia fell 3 percent month-over-month in August. This was steeper than the 1.5 percent drop expected by economists. This follows a 4.5 percent drop in July. Investment lending edged up 0.1 percent. Data released by the Ministry of Finance showed that Japan's current account surplus came in at 2.0 trillion yen in August, more than the 1.5 trillion yen expected by economists and the 1.94 trillion-yen surplus in July. The trade surplus was also wider than expected at 243.2 billion yen, as exports fell 9.6 percent and imports declined a steeper 18.3 percent. Europe European stocks are holding up despite a volatile morning session. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index are both up by 0.2 percent. On the economic front, German investor sentiment climbed at a faster-than-expected pace in October to its highest level in four months, the results of a survey by the Centre for European Economic Research/ZEW showed. The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment rose to 6.2 from 0.5 in each of the previous two months. Economists had expected a score of 4. The latest reading was the strongest since June's 19.2. Data released by the British Retail Consortium showed that like-for-like sales in the U.K. rose 0.4 percent year-over-year in September, belying expectations for a 0.3 percent drop. U.S. Economic Reports There are no market moving economic reports due for the day. Stocks in Focus Shares of Alcoa are moving lower in pre-market trading after the aluminum giant reported third quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. Rent-A-Center- (RCII) may also come under pressure after warning of much weaker than expected third quarter earnings. Illumina (ILMN) pre-announced third quarter revenues of about $607 million, a 10 percent increase year-over-year but below the company's guidance of $625 million to $630 million. The company attributed the shortfall to a larger than expected decline in high throughput sequencing instruments. Coca-Cola (KO) announced that it intends to buy Anheuser-Busch Inbev's (BUD) stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa following the closing of the ABI combination with SABMiller. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 11, 2016 8:24am   Comments Share: Related These 11 Stocks Could Drop 70% 4 Out Of 7 Firms Initiate Bullish Coverage On Apptio Just 3 Weeks After Its IPO Digital Fuel is an IT Business Management SaaS provider that services more than 250 clients, including several Fortune 500 companies and Dow Jones Components. The company is a close competitor/peer of recently IPOed Apptio Inc (NASDAQ: APTI). After the latter went public, Benzinga had a chance to chat with Digital Fuel Chief Operating Officer Rick Bigelow and Senior Vice President of Operations Matt Thompson. The IT Financial Management Sector Benzinga opened the conversation by asking about what attracted the company to the IT financial management sector. “Just the growth… We see it as a burgeoning industry itself,” Thompson stated, pointing out that, according to their forecasts, this is a global market of $2 to $5 billion. Related Link: Integrating Staples, Technology ETFs Into Portfolios Recent Years Benzinga then moved on to inquire on Apptio, which was founded in 2007, seven years after Digital Fuel, and how the industry had changed since. “In the past five years we’ve seen a lot more interest in IT combination solutions,” Thompson continued. “The biggest change in five years has been the shift towards SaaS and cloud based delivery… Also just the increase in data. We all recognize, whether it’s what’s on a smartphone, what’s on computers in general, how much data being pushed back and forth and analytics. That’s where the growth comes in and people recognize how important IT is and how much IT gets involved with all its data being spread amongst all of the industries.” The SVP then went into Apptio’s IPO. “We’re pretty excited about it, because it validates the space,” he declared. “Apptio specifically mentioned us as one [of] their competitors and we have employees that previously worked at Apptio and we’re excited because our solution is in many ways a complement to Apptio, because ours is much more detailed, granular and accurate.” Going Forward When we inquired about the future, Thompson said they see growth of 20 percent over the next five years. “We really think this is about to expand going from larger Fortune 1000 companies down to the more mid-size businesses,” he added. However, the company faces a few challenges, COO Bigelow supplemented. “Our biggest challenge [is] to have the marketplace understand that Digital Fuel, as a standalone, is going to be much more successful than they were in the last two or three years.” Finally, Thompson discussed potential acquisitions. “This industry, ITBM is actually quite fragmented and there are a number of smaller players out there that we’re aggressively in discussions with to potentially acquire,” he commented. “So we’re on the prowl for some of these smaller players to add some complementary technologies.” Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

-- United Airlines (UAL) today reported September 2016 operational results. UAL's September 2016 consolidated traffic (revenue passenger miles) increased 3.9 percent and consolidated capacity (available seat miles) increased 3.6 percent versus September 2015. UAL's September 2016 consolidated load factor increased 0.3 points compared to September 2015. The company now expects third-quarter 2016 consolidated passenger unit revenue to decline 5.5 to 6.0 percent compared to the third quarter of 2015. The year-over-year performance was primarily impacted by a strong U.S. dollar, lower surcharges, travel reductions from customers impacted by lower oil prices, competitive actions and passenger demand not growing at the same pace as industry capacity. The company's consolidated passenger unit revenue result was near the top end of the initial guidance range largely due to better than expected September close-in bookings driven by the timing of certain holidays. About United United Airlines and United Express operate more than 4,500 flights a day to 339 airports across five continents. In 2015, United and United Express operated more than 1.5 million flights carrying more than 140 million customers. United is proud to have the world's most comprehensive route network, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York/Newark, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. United operates more than 720 mainline aircraft, and this year, the airline anticipates taking delivery of 21 new Boeing aircraft, including 737 NGs, 787s and 777s. The airline is a founding member of Star Alliance, which provides service to 192 countries via 28 member airlines.

Aimed at increasing its power efficiency by 25%, work has begun on developing a new improved compressor that would increase the T55’s engine power – from 4,700shp (3,500kW) to 6,000shp – and reduce fuel usage by 8%. The research coincides with Boeing’s Block 2 upgrade on the helicopter, which aims to increase its lost pay-load capability. Middle East & North Africa The USS Mason, a US Navy guided missile destroyer, was targeted and attacked by missiles launched from Houthi rebel-controlled territory off the coast of Yemen. Both missiles launched during a one hour attack failed to reach the vessel instead falling short into the Red Sea. The incident comes just a week after a UAE vessel was hit by a Houthi anti-ship missile and the weekend bombing of a funeral by Saudi warplanes. Six German Tornado fighters, grounded last week over safety concerns, have returned to combating militants from the Islamic State. Issues with the planes were discovered last Thursday which involved loose screws that could not be properly tightened in some key cockpit equipment. The six jets are being used for surveillance flights out of Incirlik air base in Turkey near the Syrian border Africa The Dutch government has said it will continue their peace mission in Mali in 2017 but will withdraw their helicopter contingent at the start of the year. As a result, the UN will be left struggling to find replacement aircraft. Potential supplier Canada has yet to commit and Germany, who has 570 soldiers stationed in Mali, are concerned that they may have to fill the gap. Europe For those wanting a glimpse into the production of the Yak-152 then look no further. Russian journalist Felix Kondyor was given access to a small corner at Irkutsk where the trainer is being assembled. France has reacted angrily to Poland dropping a multi-billion helicopter deal with Airbus, warning that it would review defense cooperation with its NATO ally and cancelling a presidential visit to Warsaw. Winning support as a populist, right-wing, eurosceptics, the ruling Law & Justice party (PiS) said they would rather see the deal awarded to a company that could build the helicopters locally. Polish media reports that Warsaw has already begun negotiations with Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky, manufacturer of locally-produced Black Hawk helicopters that could be purchased by the Polish army as soon as this year. Asia Pacific South Korea is looking to add two more Boeing 737 AEW&C aircraft to their current fleet of four in order to boost operational capabilities. The increased number will also allow Seoul to use the aircraft as a deterrent against North Korea. However any acquisition will take time with a ministry source saying it could take up to five years for the necessary budget needed to start the project. Sources within the Philippine Foreign Affairs Department told reporters that the government is set to buy two military helicopters from Russia. Valued between $12 and $17 million, likely models being sought are the Mi-17 or the Mi-24. The same source added that Russia is willing to give deep discounts for the rotor-craft and offer extended payment schemes.

Polish Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz accused Egypt of reselling French-built Mistral amphibious assault ships initially intended for Russia to the Russian Navy for the princely sum of €1. Yes, one Euro. The comments, made during a parliamentary session, outraged France, who abandoned the Russian sale under pressure from NATO allies. However Macierewicz’s remarks pale in comparison to his deputy who dismissively said that the Poles had taught the French “to eat with a fork a couple of centuries ago” after France revoked Poland’s invitation to the Euronaval 2016 defense expo in Paris. Keep reading for the whole story with recent events put in context Polish Mi-24 (click to view full) Recent Russian aggression in the Ukraine has sharpened Poland’s awareness of its status as NATO’s new linchpin state, and an ambitious 10-year military Technical Modernization Program (TMP) is underway. The country’s open, rolling terrain from East to West is very friendly to cavalry warfare, which makes good attack helicopters a necessity. Poland’s current fleet of 29 late Soviet-era Mi-24D/Vs has served them well, but they need more and better machines. Unsurprisingly, the planned Kruk (“Raven”) attack helicopter replacement competition was one of the TMP projects targeted for acceleration in the wake of recent events. Contracts and Key Events FY 2017 T-129 ATAK (click to view full) November 8/16: Egypt and Russia have been dragged into the ongoing war of words surrounding Poland’s dropped Caracel helicopter deal with Airbus and France. Polish Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz accused Egypt of reselling French-built Mistral amphibious assault ships initially intended for Russia to the Russian Navy for the princely sum of €1. Yes, one Euro. The comments, made during a parliamentary session, outraged France, who abandoned the Russian sale under pressure from NATO allies. However Macierewicz’s remarks pale in comparison to his deputy who dismissively said that the Poles had taught the French “to eat with a fork a couple of centuries ago” after France revoked Poland’s invitation to the Euronaval 2016 defense expo in Paris. November 1/16: Polish prosecutors are to investigate the recently scrapped Caracel military helicopter deal with Airbus to see if the move circumvented Polish law or was linked to corruption. Speaking to local media, prosecutor Michal Dziekanski said “this will be a complicated, comprehensive investigation, encompassing a very large set of evidence.” Tomasz Siemoniak, the defense minister responsible for originally brokering the deal during the previous administration, called the Airbus tender “fair and transparent” and said it was canceled by his rivals for political reasons. FY 2015 – 2016 October 27/16: Airbus will seek compensation from Poland following the government’s shooting down of the previous administration’s 50-unit order for H225M multirole helicopters. Following four years of work on the tender, the company’s chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm said the group “had spent years trusting that it was in a fair competition” and that it would now “seek remedies” from Warsaw. Wilhelm added that the deal “would have committed us to build a competitive aerospace industry in Poland.” October 20/16: Negotiations are underway between Poland and Ukraine to launch a joint production effort of helicopters that could be used by the militaries of Central and Eastern European allies. But while Poland is currently in the midst of two increasingly complicated helicopter tenders, Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz said any joint effort would most likely be on a new model “based on the industrial potential of both countries. We know that the Ukrainians make excellent engines, produced by Motor Sich.” Based in southeastern Ukraine, Motor Sich has supplied engines for a variety of Ukrainian and Russian aircraft including the Antonov An-8 and An-10, the Yakovlev Yak-40 and Yak-42, and the Mil Mi-8MT, Mi-14 and Mi-171. October 12/16: Airbus struck back at the Polish government yesterday following the dropping of a multi-billion Caracel helicopter deal. In an open letter to the Prime Minister, the Aerospace giant accused the government of shifting the goalposts as Airbus competed with US and Italian rivals, and attempting to contravene European Union regulations. Speaking in a separate email, Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said “never have we been treated by any government customer the way this government has treated us.” Industry sources estimate Airbus’ cost of running the helicopter sales campaign at several tens of millions of euros. October 11/16: France has reacted angrily to Poland dropping a multi-billion helicopter deal with Airbus, warning that it would review defense cooperation with its NATO ally and cancelling a presidential visit to Warsaw. Winning support as a populist, right-wing, eurosceptics, the ruling Law & Justice party (PiS) said they would rather see the deal awarded to a company that could build the helicopters locally. Polish media reports that Warsaw has already begun negotiations with Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky, manufacturer of locally-produced Black Hawk helicopters that could be purchased by the Polish army as soon as this year. October 8/15: Poland has progressed its competition to replace the country’s fleet of Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters, with talks scheduled to soon begin with the four bidders. The ‘Kruk’ (‘Raven’) competition has attracted bids from Airbus with the EC665 Tiger; Bell Helicopters with the AH-1Z Cobra; Boeing with the AH-64 Apache and Turkish Aerospace Industries with the T129 ATAK. Despite the Polish Defence Ministry announcing in April that a winner is due for selection by the end of the year, these talks are scheduled to last one week per company, concluding by the end of November and a contract is now expected in the latter half of 2017. April 22/15: In addition to the Patriot announcement, Poland has selected the Airbus H225M to fulfill its tri-service helicopter requirement. 50 of the Airbus helicopters will replace the current 40-strong fleet of Mil Mi-17s; a figure revised down from the original requirement for 70 units. The H225M beat out AgustaWestland’s AW149 and Sikorsky’s S-70i Black Hawk and S-70B Seahawk, with the winning helicopter set to undergo checks this May and June to verify its capabilities against Poland’s requirement set. The Eastern European state is also looking to upgrade its attack helicopter fleet. Combined with the Patriot program, the helicopter procurement will account for approximately a quarter of Poland’s eight-year defense modernization budget. Aug 5/14: The Polish defence ministry has said that it is considering bids from 10 manufacturers under the Kruk competition. They wouldn’t name names, saying only that it involved “foreign and domestic companies offering both ready-made helicopters and components for assembly.” The difference between ready-made and assembly kits is a bidder’s choice, and the kits option is often used to comply with local industrial offset rules. The harder question is how to get to 10 manufacturers, given the limited number of attack helicopter options out there. Obvious leaders include Airbus (EC665 Tiger HAD), AW/TAI (T129 ATAK), Bell Helicopter (AH-1Z) and Boeing (AH-64E). South Africa’s Denel offers the Rooivalk, which hasn’t been exported but has competed elsewhere. Sikorsky is working very hard to win Poland’s utility helicopter competition with the S-70i, which is the focus of that company’s 2nd largest helicopter plant. Their Battlehawk add-on kit could offer Poland a single-type force that’s able to perform both utility and attack roles. That’s 6 possible competitors; beyond this list, one must either stretch the boundaries of the term “attack helicopter” to incorporate armed scouts, or entertain far less likely options. Russian Helicopters’ Ka-52 and Mi-28 are absolute non-starters, but there are rumors that Poland’s MRO and upgrade shop WZL-2 S.A. has bid, and that Israel’s IAI and RAFAEL also responded. Sources: Polskie Radio, “10 bidders to modernize Poland’s combat helicopter fleet”. July 8/14: Kruk program launched, deadline to respond to the RFI is Aug 1/14. The program was originally supposed to launch a tender in 2018, with deliveries beginning in 2020, but the tender has now been moved up to 2015. Quantities may also be changing: the program’s original goal was 32 helicopters, but current reports indicate that Poland may increase that to 40. In the mean time, Phase 1 involves setting technical and operational requirements, following market research. Hence the RFI. Next comes a more detailed feasibility study and staffing requirements based on the responses, followed by the formal RFP in 2015.

(Georges Gobet/AFP via Getty Images) October 12 CREDIT Rate of subprime car loan defaults is rising Subprime borrowers are falling behind on their car loan payments at the highest rate in more than six years, according to S&P Global Ratings. Competition has spurred lenders to loosen standards and resulted in more delinquencies and default by people with weak credit, the ratings firm said. Subprime borrowers were behind by more than 60 days on about 4.85 percent of auto loans in August, the highest level since January 2010. For prime loans, delinquencies in August rose to 0.5 percent, up from 0.41 percent in the same month in 2015. The figures apply to loans that have been bundled into bonds. The ratings firm said it may have to downgrade some subprime auto loan securities that have high-yield grades because of the increased delinquencies and loan losses, a statement it first made last month. After the financial crisis, mortgage lenders have been required by law to verify that applicants can repay their debt, but car lenders do not have that obligation.  — Bloomberg News AUTO SAFETY NHTSA threatens fine in air bag parts probe The federal government has accused a small air bag parts maker of stonewalling an investigation into a fatal car crash and threatened a large fine over the lack of cooperation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said ARC Automotive of Knoxville, Tenn., has missed deadlines and failed to report crash information and test results as required by law. The allegations are contained in documents made available on the agency’s website late Tuesday. The failures “raise serious questions regarding the quality and integrity of ARC’s air bag inflaters,” the agency wrote in an Oct. 4 letter to the company. The agency threatened to hold a public hearing and fine the company up to $21,000 per day, up to a maximum of $105 million. NHTSA began asking for detailed information in August after an ARC air bag inflater ruptured and killed a woman in Canada. As many as 8 million ARC inflaters are under scrutiny. The investigation is separate from one that resulted in the recall of 69 million inflaters in the United States made by Takata Corp. of Japan. Authorities say the Canadian woman was killed July 8 when the ARC inflater ruptured and sent metal shrapnel into the passenger compartment of the 2009 Hyundai Elantra she was driving. Without the shrapnel injuries, she likely would have survived the low-speed crash, Canadian officials said. Now, U.S. and Canadian investigators are trying to figure out what caused the inflater to blow apart. — Associated Press Also in Business ● Hundreds of cabdrivers blocked a central Mexico City boulevard with their taxis Wednesday to protest Uber and other mobile ride-hailing services. Tensions boiled over at times as cabdrivers pushed and rocked suspected Uber drivers’ cars. The taxicabs surrounded the Independence Monument for hours. By early afternoon, authorities had reopened one side of the boulevard. Led by taxi unions, the protesters say Uber is hurting them financially and is unconstitutional. ● Deutsche Bank will pay $9.5 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allegations that the bank failed to properly safeguard nonpublic information generated by its research analysts. The bank also encouraged equity analysts to communicate often with its trading desks and clients, and didn’t have policies and procedures in place to prevent disclosure of market-moving information, the SEC said in a statement. ● CSX Corp. reported third-quarter net income of $455 million, beating Wall Street expectations. The Jacksonville, Fla.-based company said it had profit of 48 cents per share. The freight railroad posted revenue of $2.71 billion in the period. CSX shares have risen 16 percent since the beginning of the year. ● Boeing Co. landed a deal to sell a dozen 787 Dreamliners to China Southern Airlines, bolstering support for its marquee carbon-fiber jetliner. The order by Asia’s biggest carrier by passenger volume is valued at $3.2 billion, according to list prices. It comes less than a week after Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 Dreamliners. The two deals combined more than doubled Boeing’s 787 order tally for the year. China Southern chose the 787-9 model, with a list price of $271 million each, according to a Hong Kong Stock Exchange statement.● — From news services Coming Today ● 10 a.m.: Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, releases weekly mortgage rates. ● Earnings: Delta Air Lines. — From news services business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

GovCon Index gainers slightly outnumbered laggers and six of its 11 S&P 500 stocks closed green with Honeywell the best net performer for co-listed companies and Huntington Ingalls the top gainer in the overall GCI. Honeywell ended a three-day skid that started Friday after the industrial conglomerate released third quarter earnings forecasts below Wall Street’s expectations, while military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls has alternated gains and losses for five straight sessions including Wednesday after a five-day streak of advances. Wednesday volume for Honeywell exceeded the three-month average for a third consecutive day with 7.212 million shares versus the 3.12 million mean over 90 days. Huntington Ingalls, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) and Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) all added at least $1.00 and Leidos Holdings (NYSE: LDOS) rounded out the GovCon Index’s top five gainers. S&P 500 stock McKesson Corp. (NYSE: MCK) was the GCI’s largest lagger on a half-percent healthcare index shed to close as the S&P’s lowest performing sector, while co-listed Boeing (NYSE: BA) and L-3 Communications (NYSE: LLL) respectively ended second- and third-worst for net decliners. KBR (NYSE: KBR) slid for a second straight day and is down 8.67 percent over two sessions on a downgrade to the stock issued Tuesday by Goldman Sachs. Real estate led eight S&P sectors higher after the Fed’s September minutes indicated a worry among policymakers that the U.S. could enter a recession if the central bank waited too long to raise interest rates but also indicated a desire to move on an increase soon. The GovCon Index and S&P 500 both lost 1 percent Tuesday in part on concerns about the pace of inflation, while CNBC reported reports futures markets have the odds of a December rate hike at 65 percent.

Brazil and Russia have seen a decline. What's more, domestic air traffic is poised to grow around 15 per cent in 2017, on the back of low fares, improved regional connectivity and economic growth, say executives and experts. Low fares have led to a rise in discretionary travel and higher demand for airlines. Sector-wide passenger load factors rose to 83.7 per cent in the eight months of calendar year 2016 from 82.6 per cent in the corresponding period in 2015, and too on increased capacity. The domestic jet fuel price is 10 per cent lower year-on-year, giving airlines the cushion to decrease fares. On an average, fares are 10 per cent lower over last year and in July-September airlines took to last-minute discounting matching Rajdhani air-conditioned 2-tier train ticket fares. "The healthy growth underlines relatively strong demand from both business as well leisure travellers. Competitive pressures and lower fuel prices have been a facilitator through low fares," said Subrata Ray, group vice-president, corporate sector ratings, ICRA. With induction of new aircraft, airlines are opening direct routes and this, too, is pushing passenger growth. "We expect 15 per cent traffic growth per annum for the next three years. Domestic traffic will exceed 100 million in 2017 and airlines will continue to increase capacity to keep market share," said Boeing's senior vice-president (Asia-Pacific), Dinesh Keskar. He said the regional connectivity scheme (first flight expected in January 2017) will further boost growth. "We expect growth will continue to be robust, as there are large capacity additions planned by various airlines. However, fares are likely to remain under pressure, as the capacity addition in the near term is greater than intrinsic demand growth," said Vistara's chief strategy and commercial officer, Sanjiv Kapoor. Vistara, which inducted its 13th aircraft in October, will be adding four more in 2017. GoAir, which has 20 aircraft, plans to increase its fleet size to 27 by March 2017. IndiGo is making the highest capacity addition among all domestic airlines and plans to add 24 Airbus A320neos by March 2017. It has 118 A320 aircraft at present, including eight A320neos. Air India, too, plans to expand its capacity and regional network. But the rapid growth of the industry has thrown up its own set of challenges. "Continued enhancement of infrastructure is critical to keep pace with growth," said Keskar. "Shortage of slots in key metro airports such as Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru and other infrastructural constraints are the biggest risks to growth. If oil prices rise sharply we will expect air fares to rise and demand growth will moderate," said Kapoor. Rising fuel prices could impact growth plans of the industry and could also lead to deterioration in service quality, say experts, even as availability of skilled manpower, remains a concern.

With induction of new aircraft, airlines are opening direct routes and this, too, is pushing passenger growth. "We expect 15 per cent traffic growth per annum for the next three years. Domestic traffic will exceed 100 million in 2017 and airlines will continue to increase capacity to keep market share," said Boeing's senior vice-president (Asia-Pacific), Dinesh Keskar. He said the regional connectivity scheme (first flight expected in January 2017) will further boost growth. "We expect growth will continue to be robust, as there are large capacity additions planned by various airlines. However, fares are likely to remain under pressure, as the capacity addition in the near term is greater than intrinsic demand growth," said Vistara's chief strategy and commercial officer, Sanjiv Kapoor. Vistara, which inducted its 13th aircraft in October, will be adding four more in 2017. GoAir, which has 20 aircraft, plans to increase its fleet size to 27 by March 2017. IndiGo is making the highest capacity addition among all domestic airlines and plans to add 24 Airbus A320neos by March 2017. It has 118 A320 aircraft at present, including eight A320neos. Air India, too, plans to expand its capacity and regional network. But the rapid growth of the industry has thrown up its own set of challenges. "Continued enhancement of infrastructure is critical to keep pace with growth," said Keskar. "Shortage of slots in key metro airports such as Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru and other infrastructural constraints are the biggest risks to growth. If oil prices rise sharply we will expect air fares to rise and demand growth will moderate," said Kapoor. Rising fuel prices could impact growth plans of the industry and could also lead to deterioration in service quality, say experts, even as availability of skilled manpower, remains a concern.

Last week, the government wrote to some of the aviation majors seeking their opinion about relocating their assembly lines to India, sources told DH. The exact nature of the communication, however, remains unknown. An indication came from Indian Air Force chief Arup Raha about a week ago when he said that the government and the IAF were talking about having a fighter aircraft production line in India with technology transfer. “The offers are on the table. We will have to see who gives us the best deal,” Raha stated in his annual media interaction ahead of the Air Force Day. In August, Lockheed Martin proposed to shift its F-16 production line to India in partnership with a local company. Its competitor Boeing, too, offered moving its F/A-18 Super Hornet production line whereas Swedish firm Saab proposed to bring its Gripen-E for production in India. A fighter jet assembly line on the Indian soil is being thought of because of the IAF’s depleting squadron strength as most of MiG-21 and MiG-27 aircraft would be phased out within a few years. Though the government has inked an agreement with French major Dassault Aviation to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets, the squadron numbers are far too low for the comfort of the IAF.   Go to Top Tweet Videos France marks first anniversary of Paris attacks...

Subscribe Home News How Obama brought capitalism to outer space Story Comments Print Create a hardcopy of this page Font Size: Default font size Larger font size Posted: Wednesday, October 12, 2016 12:00 pm How Obama brought capitalism to outer space By Christian Davenport The Washington Post SentinelSource.com Posted on Oct 12, 2016 by Stephen Gilbert In 2010, nearly 50 years after John Kennedy called for the United States to send a man to the moon, President Barack Obama went to the Kennedy Space Center, to set a new course. Under George W. Bush, the agency had been working on another lunar mission. But now, with Buzz Aldrin sitting in the audience, Obama had a blunt message about those plans: “We’ve been there before. Buzz has been there. There’s a lot more space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.” Instead of going to the moon, he declared, the U.S. would go to Mars. Now, six years after that speech, as he nears the end of his presidency, Obama is bookending his charge by doubling down on NASA’s plan to get to Mars. In an op-ed published by CNN Tuesday morning ahead of the White House frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh, he reiterated his administration’s goal of “sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.” But while Mars remains years, if not decades away, Obama’s true legacy may be something altogether different: the standing up of a commercial space industry that has ended the government’s monopoly on space. When the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA looked to the commercial sector to fly its astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, fertilizing the industry with billions of dollars in contracts. And in the past few years, the industry has begun to blossom, reinvigorating interest in space with dramatic landings of rockets on ships with other, unprecedented feats. “Just five years ago, U.S. companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market,” Obama wrote. “Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it..” Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeffrey P. Bezos’ Blue Origin promise suborbital tourist flights within a couple of years. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) SpaceX and Boeing are working toward flying astronauts to the space station. Bigelow Aerospace is building inflatable habitats that could ultimately succeed the station. In fact, one of the habitats is currently attached to the station. “It will become one of the great ironies in the history of exploration into space that someone many politicians called a socialist was a champion for the possibilities of capitalism in space,” said James Muncy, a space policy analyst at PolySpace, a consulting firm. While the high-profile billionaires get the most attention, there are many companies pushing the frontiers. Sierra Nevada Corp., another of NASA’s beneficiaries, just announced that it had signed a deal with the United Nations to fly its first-ever space mission. Earlier this year, Moon Express, which is vying for the $20 million Lunar XPrize, received permission to send a robotic lander on the moon, the first commercial company to get such approval from the U.S. government. There is still no self-sustaining economy to keep commercial space companies alive, many of which would wither without the support of NASA or the billionaires that are funding them with their own money. And the two companies that have the contracts to restore human space travel from U.S. soil both have suffered setbacks and delays. Boeing recently confirmed an Aviation Week report that because of technical issues with its Starliner spacecraft it was pushing back flights six months and hopes to fly by the end of 2018. SpaceX, the other company NASA is relying on to fly its astronauts, had its Falcon 9 rocket blow up last month and still doesn’t know exactly why. NASA’s own vehicles, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, have had their own troubles. The Government Accountability Office recently warned that the $23 billion program faces additional potential cost overruns and schedule delays. NASA has always relied on its contractors, and Obama conceded that government cannot do it alone: “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators,” he wrote.

All the more reason to stay here and fix Earth Arwa Mahdawi We have many more pressing concerns here at home than a contest about who has the biggest rocket ‘Heading to Mars might further fry the planet as well as your brain.’ Photograph: ESA/PA Wednesday 12 October 2016 11.26 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 12 October 2016 15.07 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Bad news if you were planning a winter vacation to Mars: new research has shown that the 225m km trip to the Red Planet won’t just give you bad jet lag – it’ll probably fry your brain. The study, published in Scientific Reports, has found that the levels of cosmic radiation travellers to Mars would be exposed to could lead to brain damage, anxiety and chronic dementia. This is somewhat unfortunate as the US is currently fixated on getting to Mars in the next two decades. Last year, Nasa released its three-step plan for the Journey to Mars, which anticipated that America would be sending humans to Mars by the 2030s. Barack Obama reiterated this timeline in an op-ed for CNN on Tuesday, explaining that getting to Mars is a cooperative effort between the government and private corporations: “More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.” Barack Obama revives call to put humans on Mars by the 2030s Read more While the idea of a trip to space or landing on the Mars is all very exciting – though it’s -90F and covered with dust – I can’t help think that perhaps we’d all do better if we kept our feet on the ground. In September, the world passed the symbolic 400ppm carbon threshold; scientists say carbon dioxide levels are unlikely to return below this during our lifetimes. The last time there was this much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 3m years ago when modern humans didn’t exist. We’re living in a new and unpredictable world. Heading to Mars might further fry the planet as well as your brain. Nobody really knows the environmental cost of space travel, but some scientists have raised concerns of a serious black carbon problem. A 2010 study found that black carbon emissions from space travel would cause warming at the poles, which is not good news for the Arctic or Antarctica. Or the world. However, this study is not conclusive, and the industry repeatedly stresses that space travel poses little threat to the environment. Virgin Galactic has even said that a suborbital space trip is more environmentally friendly than a flight from New York to London. The bottom line, though, is that no one really knows how space travel will affect the earth at the moment. But if refrigerators pose an environmental threat, it doesn’t seem to be such a great leap to think that enormous rockets might also. It could be that with all this doom and gloom I’m missing the pros of getting to Mars. It’s one of the more slimming planets; if you weigh 150lb on Earth, you’d be a mere 57lb on Mars. So you’d be skinny, but you’d also have dementia and probably severe red dust allergies. The real point of space travel, however, is Progress! Taking science to the final frontier, expanding our horizons, etc. However, I can’t help but think that all of this is just ego dressed up as starry-eyed romanticism. In his op-ed, Obama writes: “We’ve flown by every planet in the solar system – something no other nation can say.” OK, cool. But people in Flint, Michigan, don’t have clean water to drink. Can we just calm down for a second about super galactic fly-bys and reassess our priorities? It’s not just national ego that’s playing a part in the amazing race to Mars. Billionaire tech founders are competing against each other to get to Mars first, and they’re literally comparing the size of each other’s rockets. Jeff Bezos’s latest rocket is apparently taller than Elon Musk’s. However, Musk’s rocket is reportedly more powerful, “generating 5.1m pounds of thrust”. Meanwhile, Boeing reckons its rocket is best of all. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said recently. Then you’ve got the 1% who aren’t making rockets and simply want to be the first in their group of friends to post an Instagram of themselves relaxing on Mars – #redplanetbeachday – or taking a day trip to space. Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Katy Perry are just some of the celebrities who have already paid a $250,000 deposit and signed up for a suborbital space trip on Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. The world is facing a very real climate crisis, and yet some of the best minds of our generation our focusing their efforts on getting to Mars. When we do eventually get there, who knows what the state of our planet will be? Our efforts to explore the universe may no longer be a giant leap for mankind, but a step back for Earth.

The France-based multinational company is to reduce its annual production of the large-bodied, double-decker A380 down to 12 units in 2018, in contrast to the 27 units slated for delivery this year. An Airbus spokesperson said the drop in the A380 production-line output had not happened yet, contrary to information published by French newspaper Le Figaro Tuesday morning. The companys source said the aircrafts 2018 production target is set to be officially announced next January. In an interview with the French daily, A380 Program Director Alain Fluorens said that the drop in the aircrafts assembly rate enables us to stagger deliveries while awaiting new orders. He also insisted on his belief that the aircraft had a commercial future, regardless of the current situation. Fluorens added that the A380 continues having a place within Airbus order books. It fits perfectly within the overall increase in airline traffic and airport saturation. Last July, the aircraft manufacturer had already announced a drop in the production rate of the airliner  which is capable of transporting 500 passengers, making it the largest aircraft in commercial aviation  after nearly two years with hardly any new orders. Once this announcement was made public, Airbus CEO Tom Enders said he was confident that the production rate would make a future comeback. In its forecast for the next 20 years, Airbus estimated that the global demand for large, wide-bodied aircraft with a capacity in excess of 400 seats (such as the A380 or Boeings 747-8) will reach 1,500 units. This forecast was based on the notion that global air traffic doubles every 15 years and the fact that major city airports are going to face saturation issues independently of the progress made in improved Landing and Take-Off (LTO) cycles that enable a higher number of hourly flight operations. In all, Airbus has 124 A380 units, pending delivery of the 319 units it has sold since the production program began in 2000. The company has used this reasoning to justify going ahead with the one-unit-a-month assembly rate, even though Airbus hopes to sell a dozen A380s to Iran once an export certificate issue has been cleared. Until the foreseeable recovery of this market niche, Fluorens said that Airbus plans to work on optimizing the current aircraft to improve its productivity with finishing options that enable higher flexibility and freedom in passenger cabin layout, according to the companys needs. A new version of the A380 has been discarded, as it would involve an investment of hundreds of millions or even billions of euros, with no guarantee of recouping said outlay within a foreseeable future.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

By Kedar Grandhi October 12, 2016 10:18 BST Monarch Airlines said the investment was the biggest in its 48-year historyReuters Monarch Airlines has secured an investment of £165m ($202.73m) from its majority shareholder Greybull Capital. This was revealed by the British low-cost airline on Wednesday (12 October). The Luton, UK based company said the investment was the biggest in its 48-year history. It added that the funding had allowed it to renew its Air Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL) from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for the next 12 months and to also fund its future growth plans. This follows rumours last month that the airline was going to go bust. The British company had however then denied the same and had said that its flights and holidays were operating as normal. The development comes after the airline managed recently to get its ATOL licence extended for a temporary period of 12 days. The CAA had then said that this would expire on 12 October by which time it required the airline's shareholders to provide additional funding. Commenting on this investment, Andrew Swaffield, CEO of The Monarch Group told in a statement, "It is testament to the extensive effort by all parties, over the past weeks and months, that we are able to announce the largest investment in our 48-year history, as well as the renewal of our ATOL licences. "I'd like to thank the CAA, our shareholders, partners, loyal customers and the team at Monarch for helping us to achieve this successful outcome. We are now firmly focused on the future as a stronger Monarch." The British company also revealed that aircraft manufacturer Boeing would be delivering the first of its October 2014 ordered airplanes in 2018. Monarch had then placed an order for 30 Boeing 737 MAX-8 aircrafts with an option to increase it by another 15 planes. Monarch said these planes were state-of-the-art and fuel efficient and would help save on operational costs. It added that these would also allow it to provide its customers with a best in class inflight experience.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Obama bringing capitalism to space, and Mars print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2822794 false Bill Ingalls / NASA via The Washington Post file President Obama tours the commercial rocket processing facility of SpaceX along with chief executive Elon Musk at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in 2010. "Just five years ago, U.S. companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market," Obama wrote in an op-ed this week. "Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it." Click here to enlarge image Smart Start Obama bringing capitalism to space, and Mars By Christian Davenport / The Washington Post Published Oct 12, 2016 at 12:18AM In 2010, nearly 50 years after John Kennedy called for the United States to send a man to the moon, President Barack Obama went to the Kennedy Space Center, to set a new course. Under George W. Bush, the agency had been working on another lunar mission. But now, with Buzz Aldrin sitting in the audience, Obama had a blunt message about those plans: “We’ve been there before. Buzz has been there. There’s a lot more space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do.” Instead of going to the moon, he declared, the U.S. would go to Mars. Now, six years after that speech, as he nears the end of his presidency, Obama is bookending his charge by doubling down on NASA’s plan to get to Mars. In an op-ed published by CNN Tuesday morning ahead of the White House frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh, he reiterated his administration’s goal of “sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.” But while Mars remains years, if not decades away, Obama’s true legacy may be something altogether different: the standing up of a commercial space industry that has ended the government’s monopoly on space. When the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA looked to the commercial sector to fly its astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, fertilizing the industry with billions of dollars in contracts. And in the past few years, the industry has begun to blossom, reinvigorating interest in space with dramatic landings of rockets on ships with other, unprecedented feats. “Just five years ago, U.S. companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market,” Obama wrote. “Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it.” Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeffrey Bezos’ Blue Origin promise suborbital tourist flights within a couple of years. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) SpaceX and Boeing are working toward flying astronauts to the space station. Bigelow Aerospace is building inflatable habitats that could ultimately succeed the station. In fact, one of the habitats is currently attached to the station. “It will become one of the great ironies in the history of exploration into space that someone many politicians called a socialist was a champion for the possibilities of capitalism in space,” said James Muncy, a space policy analyst at PolySpace, a consulting firm. While the high-profile billionaires get the most attention, there are many companies pushing the frontiers. Sierra Nevada Corp., another of NASA’s beneficiaries, just announced that it had signed a deal with the United Nations to fly its first-ever space mission. Earlier this year, Moon Express, which is vying for the $20 million Lunar XPrize, received permission to send a robotic lander on the moon, the first commercial company to get such approval from the U.S. government. There is still no self-sustaining economy to keep commercial space companies alive, many of which would wither without the support of NASA or the billionaires who are funding them with their own money. And the two companies that have the contracts to restore human space travel from U.S. soil both have suffered setbacks and delays. Boeing recently confirmed an Aviation Week report that because of technical issues with its Starliner spacecraft it was pushing back flights six months and hopes to fly by the end of 2018. SpaceX, the other company NASA is relying on to fly its astronauts, had its Falcon 9 rocket blow up last month and still doesn’t know exactly why. NASA’s own vehicles, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, have had their own troubles. The Government Accountability Office recently warned that the $23 billion program faces additional potential cost overruns and schedule delays. NASA has always relied on its contractors, and Obama conceded that government cannot do it alone: “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators,” he wrote. 15306243 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

The US president’s announcement confirmed a long-standing agreement to partner with commercial companies on future missions to deep space, and gave some new details on how such collaborations will play out in the coming years, particularly aboard the International Space Station. “We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama wrote in an essay posted by CNN. “I’m excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space,” he added. “These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth — something we’ll need for the long journey to Mars.” Obama also touted an upcoming conference of top scientists, engineers, innovators and students later this week in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as a chance “to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers.” In August, NASA announced that six companies had been selected to work on deep-space habitats, and would receive a combined total of US$65 million over the next two years. These companies include Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation, and NanoRacks. Habitats, or expandable living quarters, may be erected on a planet’s surface or used to shelter astronauts travelling on a spaceship. The issue of getting enough food and water into space to feed astronauts on a months or years-long mission to deep space has also been a key logistical problem, and little research has been done to show how this might work. “Getting there will take a giant leap,” Obama wrote, alluding to words spoken July 21, 1969 by astronaut Neil Armstrong as he walked on the Moon. (“That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”) “But the first, small steps happen when our students — the Mars generation — walk into their classrooms each day,” Obama said.

However, PR experts say, Samsung bungled in not just misdiagnosing the fault afflicting its top-end phones, but also appearing uncommunicative with an aloof bedside manner. As a result, the South Korean company has its work cut out as it embarks on a vast and costly exercise to win back trust and prove that it is still a byword for quality at a time when its rivals are going full tilt in the smartphone wars. “The basis of crisis management is to make sure that when you give a solution, it’s the right solution and it is going to enable you to move forward,” Mr Andy Holdsworth, a crisis management specialist at the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, told AFP. That has not been the case with Samsung. Perhaps reluctant to lose too much ground to rivals such as Apple and Google, who were busy launching their own new models, the company rushed out replacements for its Galaxy Note 7 ‘phablet’ series when some in the first global batch spontaneously caught fire. The incendiary problem persisted, however, and now Samsung has been forced to scrap the entire line in an embarrassing setback for a brand image that took years to build up. Some airplanes had banned passengers from boarding with the phones. Social media is rife with anger and ridicule. One video, of a Burger King employee in South Korea gingerly handling a smoking Note 7 with oven gloves, has gone viral. DISJOINTED RESPONSE Mr Holdsworth said Samsung’s response throughout had been “disjointed”. “I would question the investigation and I would question why Samsung said last night the product is safe if this morning (Tuesday, Oct 11) they then decide to recall all units and stop production. There seems to be a slight miscommunication somewhere. “You kind of lose faith in it because your remedy (suffered) the same problem and this problem is quite a dangerous one.” The family-run corporations, or “chaebol”, which dominate the South Korean economy are used to running their businesses their own way. As companies like Samsung and LG have become global brands, their corporate governance and PR cultures have improved as they have adapted to the rigours of international markets, but analysts say the old family-run structure, with its rigid top-down decision-making, leaves them vulnerable to a crisis. WHO’S IN CHARGE? In Samsung’s case a generational leadership transfer, with family patriarch and group chairman Lee Kun-Hee bedridden since suffering a heart attack in 2014, may have contributed to the company’s failure to deal efficiently with the Note 7 crisis. “In chaebol like Samsung, the all-powerful chairman makes key decisions and these are swiftly translated into actions by his underlings,” said Mr Chung Sun-sup, head of corporate analysis group Chaebul.com. “But if such a patriarchal leader is somehow absent, such a decision-making structure may fall into limbo. The current crisis at Samsung is related with this corporate structure. If Lee was in charge, he might have sorted it out, bringing in every available expert from both inside and outside the company. But Samsung just tried to tinker with the problem and failed,” Mr Chung said. It could be worse. There has been no loss of life, unlike other PR disasters such as the 2010 explosion at BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil rig which now features in a Hollywood movie. And other companies have also struggled with the challenge of extracting more power and faster charge times from the lithium-ion technology used in smartphones today. Boeing suffered electrical fires from the lithium-ion batteries aboard its new 787 jet, and Dell with self-combusting laptops, noted Prof ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of operations management and supply chain at Cass Business School in London. But Samsung erred in striving to “fix the problem too quickly”, he said. Now, with the total shutdown of Note 7 production, “it sends a bad signal to the market that there is panic in the boardroom”. There may be no quick fix to undo the past few weeks, during which it appeared that Samsung’s official response appeared to lag that of national regulators, airlines and mobile phone carriers.

However, PR experts say, Samsung Electronics bungled in not just misdiagnosing the fault afflicting its top-end phones but appearing uncommunicative with an aloof bedside manner. As a result, the South Korean company has its work cut out as it embarks on a vast and costly exercise to win back trust and prove that it is still a byword for quality at a time when its rivals are going full tilt in the smartphone wars. "The basis of crisis management is to make sure that when you give a solution, it's the right solution and it is going to enable you to move forward," Andy Holdsworth, a crisis management specialist at the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, told AFP. That has not been the case with Samsung. Perhaps reluctant to lose too much ground to rivals such as Apple and Google, who were busy launching their own new models, the company rushed out replacements for its Galaxy Note 7 'phablet' series when some in the first global batch spontaneously caught fire. The incendiary problem persisted, however, and now Samsung has been forced to scrap the entire line in an embarrassing setback for a brand image that took years to build up. Some airplanes had banned passengers from boarding with the phones. Social media is rife with anger and ridicule. One video, of a Burger King employee in South Korea gingerly handling a smoking Note 7 with oven gloves, has gone viral. Disjointed response Holdsworth said Samsung's response throughout had been "disjointed". "I would question the investigation and I would question why Samsung said last night the product is safe if this morning (Tuesday) they then decide to recall all units and stop production. There seems to be a slight miscommunication somewhere. "You kind of lose faith in it because your remedy (suffered) the same problem and this problem is quite a dangerous one." The family-run corporations, or "chaebol", which dominate the South Korean economy are used to running their businesses their own way. As companies like Samsung and LG have become global brands, their corporate governance and PR cultures have improved as they have adapted to the rigours of international markets, but analysts say the old family-run structure, with its rigid top-down decision-making, leaves them vulnerable to a crisis. Who's in charge? In Samsung's case a generational leadership transfer, with family patriarch and group chairman Lee Kun-Hee bedridden since suffering a heart attack in 2014, may have contributed to the company's failure to deal efficiently with the Note 7 crisis. "In chaebol like Samsung, the all-powerful chairman makes key decisions and these are swiftly translated into actions by his underlings," said Chung Sun-sup, head of corporate analysis group Chaebul.com. "But if such a patriarchal leader is somehow absent, such a decision-making structure may fall into limbo. The current crisis at Samsung is related with this corporate structure. If Lee was in charge, he might have sorted it out, bringing in every available expert from both inside and outside the company. But Samsung just tried to tinker with the problem and failed," Chung said. It could be worse. There has been no loss of life, unlike other PR disasters such as the 2010 explosion at BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig which now features in a Hollywood movie. And other companies have also struggled with the challenge of extracting more power and faster charge times from the lithium-ion technology used in smartphones today. Boeing suffered electrical fires from the lithium-ion batteries aboard its new 787 jet, and Dell with self-combusting laptops, noted ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of operations management and supply chain at Cass Business School in London. But Samsung erred in striving to "fix the problem too quickly", he said. Now, with the total shutdown of Note 7 production, "it sends a bad signal to the market that there is panic in the boardroom". There may be no quick fix to undo the past few weeks, during which it appeared that Samsung's official response appeared to lag that of national regulators, airlines and mobile phone carriers. But Samsung should at least shed any inhibitions it may feel about being more forthright with its customers, said Yves Robert-Paul, who heads crisis communications for French advertising group Havas. Since Samsung started recalling the phablets last month, he said, it has offered only "a pragmatic response, devoid of all emotion".

Obama called Tuesday for the U.S. to send humans to Mars by the 2030s, showcasing budding partnerships between the U.S. government and commercial companies. Bill Ingalls NASA i By Christian Davenport The Washington Post LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story In 2010, nearly 50 years after President John Kennedy called for the United States to send a man to the moon, President Barack Obama went to the Kennedy Space Center, to set a new course. Under President George W. Bush, the agency had been working on another lunar mission. But now, with Buzz Aldrin sitting in the audience, Obama had a blunt message about those plans: “We’ve been there before. Buzz has been there. There’s a lot more space to explore and a lot more to learn when we do.” Instead of going to the moon, he declared, the United States. would go to Mars. Now, six years after that speech, as he nears the end of his presidency, Obama is bookending his charge by doubling down on NASA’s plan to get to Mars. In an op-ed published by CNN’s website Tuesday ahead of the White House frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh, he reiterated his administration’s goal of “sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time.” Although Mars remains years, if not decades away, Obama’s true legacy may be something altogether different: the standing up of a commercial space industry that has ended the government’s monopoly on space. When the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA looked to the commercial sector to fly its astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, fertilizing the industry with billions of dollars in contracts. And in the past few years, the industry has begun to blossom, reinvigorating interest in space with dramatic landings of rockets on ships with other unprecedented feats. “Just five years ago, U.S. companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market,” Obama wrote. “Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it..” Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and Jeffrey Bezos’ Blue Origin promise suborbital tourist flights within a couple of years. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) SpaceX and Boeing are working toward flying astronauts to the space station. Bigelow Aerospace is building inflatable habitats that could ultimately succeed the station. In fact, one of the habitats is currently attached to the station. “It will become one of the great ironies in the history of exploration into space that someone many politicians called a socialist was a champion for the possibilities of capitalism in space,” said James Muncy, a space policy analyst at PolySpace, a consulting firm. Although the high-profile billionaires get the most attention, there are many companies pushing the frontiers. Sierra Nevada Corp., another of NASA’s beneficiaries, just announced that it had signed a deal with the United Nations to fly its first-ever space mission. Earlier this year, Moon Express, which is vying for the $20 million Lunar XPrize, received permission to send a robotic lander on the moon, the first commercial company to get such approval from the U.S. government. There is still no self-sustaining economy to keep commercial space companies alive, many of which would wither without the support of NASA or the billionaires that are funding them with their own money. And the two companies that have the contracts to restore human space travel from U.S. soil both have suffered setbacks and delays. Boeing recently confirmed an Aviation Week report that because of technical issues with its Starliner spacecraft it was pushing back flights six months and hopes to fly by the end of 2018. SpaceX, the other company NASA is relying on to fly its astronauts, had its Falcon 9 rocket blow up last month and still doesn’t know exactly why. NASA’s own vehicles, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, have had their own troubles. The Government Accountability Office recently warned that the $23 billion program faces additional potential cost overruns and schedule delays. NASA has always relied on its contractors, and Obama conceded that government cannot do it alone. “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators,” he wrote.

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | October 12, 2016 -- 03:03 GMT (20:03 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Will humans be on Mars by 2030? (Image: File photo) President Barack Obama wants NASA to send humans to Mars by 2030, he wrote in an opinion piece in CNN on Tuesday, after several private companies have detailed their future plans to travel to the red planet. Read this Exploring Mars with a 2-megapixel camera: The tech behind Curiosity The Mars rover is trying to find out if the Red Planet was ever habitable. Here's the tech it is using to carry out its mission. Read More Obama's op-ed comes before he is set to host top scientists, engineers, and students at the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh on Thursday. The conference aims to find ways to improve science, technology, and innovation in the United States and to "find the next frontiers," the president wrote. SpaceX, one of the most followed private space travel companies, announced plans in late-September to colonize Mars in the next decade. Led by billionaire Elon Musk, SpaceX wants to provide travel to Mars for roughly $200,000. Obama wrote that to reach the 2030 goal, it must utilize private companies and innovators. "We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time," President Obama wrote. "Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we're already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station." Further, NASA administrator Charlie Bolden detailed its "NextSTEP" on Tuesday, a program laying the basis for missions to Mars by awarding private companies contracts to design space habitats. Experts said travel to Mars could take eight months. Blue Origin, another private space company from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is in the planning stages of a "New Shepard" rocket that is destined for Mars. Boeing, also planning travel to Mars, thinks it can beat SpaceX to the red planet. "I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket," Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at a recent Chicago event on innovation, according to Bloomberg. Obama had previously discussed his deep space travel vision in a 2010 speech at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The Galaxy Note 7 was supposed to be the crown jewel of the smartphone lineup for Samsung, which once garnered little respect in the clubby world of Silicon Valley but is now the primary rival to Apple. Samsung's ascendancy has been celebrated by those who wanted a high-quality alternative to the iPhone and held up in Korea as evidence of the country's arrival as tech power. But Samsung's failure to manufacture phones that do not explode in purses or catch on fire on flights may be catastrophic for the company's brand, many technology analysts said. Samsung's shares fell 7.5 percent in Tuesday trading in Seoul, wiping out $17 billion of the company's value. Some analysts said the company, in its race to release a new phone ahead of Apple, simply rushed. The Note 7's battery was one of its best selling points - more powerful than that of the iPhone 7 Plus and capable of charging the phone nearly to full power in 30 minutes. Apple had endured criticism for not bringing such innovations to the iPhone. But its caution now looks wise, said John Cui, an assistant professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business. "Had this just stopped at replacement units, Samsung would have walked out of this," added Ramon Llamas, an analyst at the tech market research firm IDC. "The fact that it didn't work out again? Now we'll be suspicious." The damage isn't likely to be contained to the Galaxy Note model, which had a large 5.7-inch screen and cost $800. The government has also issued a warning about exploding Samsung washing machines, though the problems with those appliances are not related to a battery. A recent survey from the brand-analysis firm Branding Brand found that 34 percent of current Samsung customers said they wouldn't buy another smartphone from the company - in a poll taken before news surfaced of the replacement phones also catching on fire. The Note 7 fires also call to mind other incidents involving lithium-ion batteries, which increasingly power most personal devices and cutting-edge technologies, such as electric cars, mobile gadgets and children's toys. Unexpected explosions forced U.S. retailers to pull popular children's scooters called hoverboards this year. Boeing had to ground its super-advanced 787 Dreamliner jets because of lithium-ion battery fires in 2013. The supply chains that build the batteries in smartphones and other electronics are notoriously complex and opaque. Companies such as Samsung and Apple buy batteries from several makers, which source the battery parts from different firms across the globe. Samsung, the largest battery-maker in the world, last year bought smartphone batteries from its own Samsung SDI division as well as from Maxwell, Amperex Technology Limited, Panasonic and Lishen, according to Avicenne Energy, a consulting firm. But Samsung was unusually dependent on Samsung SDI for about 75 percent of its batteries. By contrast, Apple has bought iPhone batteries from five companies, none of which supply more than a third of its batteries. That enables Apple to nimbly switch manufacturers if a problem surfaces. Samsung's missteps are likely to help Apple, which offers the only other premium large-screen smartphone that is well-recognized by consumers. The new iPhone 7 Plus sold out within a day, just as reports of exploding Note 7s emerged. In general, large-screen phones generate more profits for manufacturers than smaller ones. Other analysts said Samsung's problems might be an even more important development for Android makers, many of which have struggled to make a dent against Apple and Samsung. Google, in particular, stands to gain, analysts said. The tech giant recently introduced its own line of high-end phones, called the Pixel, which could appeal to the anti-iPhone crowd. "The Pixel phone could be a beneficiary here" since it shares many traits with the Note 7, said Brian Blau, vice president of technology research firm Gartner. Samsung's crisis may be cushioned because carriers already have agreed to promote its other phones for the crucial holiday season. But over the long term, the debacle may set back its relationship with its customers, who had to wade through shifting warnings from the company. At first Samsung was slow to offer replacements. Only after U.S. officials, as well as airlines and subway systems, began to warn passengers to turn off their Galaxy Note 7s did the company offer an official recall. And as of Tuesday, Samsung had not extended that recall to include the replacement Note 7 phones sold after Sept. 15, even though several of those devices have reportedly caught fire. The company has only asked owners of the replacements to stop using those models. The mixed messages have frustrated U.S. officials. In a speech last month, Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman Elliot Kaye criticized Samsung for trying to handle the problem without coordinating with his agency and for putting customers at risk. "I would say that's uncommon," said Kaitlin Wowak, an assistant professor of business at Notre Dame. "It's important for companies dealing with recalls to have whatever relevant organization - the FDA, NHTSA, the CPSC - get behind them." <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 연합뉴스 다른기사 보기 이메일 기사 수정 :   2016-10-12 09:29   김동균 기자 웹출판 :   2016-10-12 09:29   관리자 입력.편집 :   2016-10-12 09:28   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 2017년 부동산시장이 궁금하다 플랜트건설노조 울산지부, 임단협 잠정합의…조합원 시큰둥 투쟁 강도 대비 임금인상폭 적어…집행부 불신임 고조 현대청운고, ‘現重 임직원 자녀 전형’ 폐지 [제728회 로또 당첨번호] 3 6 10 30 34 37 + 36 양산시의회, 집행부에 중학생 학교급식비 증액 촉구 2017년 부동산시장이 궁금하다 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

Under George W. Bush, the agency had been working on another lunar mission. But now, with Buzz Aldrin sitting in the audience, Obama had a blunt message about those plans: "We've been there before. Buzz has been there. There's a lot more space to explore, and a lot more to learn when we do." Instead of going to the moon, he declared, the U.S. would go to Mars. Now, six years after that speech, as he nears the end of his presidency, Obama is bookending his charge by doubling down on NASA's plan to get to Mars. In an op-ed published by CNN Tuesday morning ahead of the White House frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh, he reiterated his administration's goal of "sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time." But while Mars remains years, if not decades away, Obama's true legacy may be something altogether different: the standing up of a commercial space industry that has ended the government's monopoly on space. When the space shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA looked to the commercial sector to fly its astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, fertilizing the industry with billions of dollars in contracts. And in the past few years, the industry has begun to blossom, reinvigorating interest in space with dramatic landings of rockets on ships with other, unprecedented feats. "Just five years ago, U.S. companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market," Obama wrote. "Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it." Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Jeffrey P. Bezos' Blue Origin promise suborbital tourist flights within a couple of years. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) SpaceX and Boeing are working toward flying astronauts to the space station. Bigelow Aerospace is building inflatable habitats that could ultimately succeed the station. In fact, one of the habitats is currently attached to the station. "It will become one of the great ironies in the history of exploration into space that someone many politicians called a socialist was a champion for the possibilities of capitalism in space," said James Muncy, a space policy analyst at PolySpace, a consulting firm. While the high-profile billionaires get the most attention, there are many companies pushing the frontiers. Sierra Nevada Corp., another of NASA's beneficiaries, just announced that it had signed a deal with the United Nations to fly its first-ever space mission. Earlier this year, Moon Express, which is vying for the $20 million Lunar XPrize, received permission to send a robotic lander on the moon, the first commercial company to get such approval from the U.S. government. There is still no self-sustaining economy to keep commercial space companies alive, many of which would wither without the support of NASA or the billionaires that are funding them with their own money. And the two companies that have the contracts to restore human space travel from U.S. soil both have suffered setbacks and delays. Boeing recently confirmed an Aviation Week report that because of technical issues with its Starliner spacecraft it was pushing back flights six months and hopes to fly by the end of 2018. SpaceX, the other company NASA is relying on to fly its astronauts, had its Falcon 9 rocket blow up last month and still doesn't know exactly why. NASA's own vehicles, the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, have had their own troubles. The Government Accountability Office recently warned that the $23 billion program faces additional potential cost overruns and schedule delays. NASA has always relied on its contractors, and Obama conceded that government cannot do it alone: "Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators," he wrote.
