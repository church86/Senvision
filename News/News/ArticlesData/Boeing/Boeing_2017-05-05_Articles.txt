Delivery of the first of the new aircraft is due to begin in June. Meantime, FAA and European inspectors were flying the simulator as part of the certification process. CAROL ROSENBERG crosenberg@miamiherald.com Business May 04, 2017 4:02 PM What’s it like to fly Boeing’s new jetliner? Pilots will soon find out in Miami simulator By Carol Rosenberg crosenberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When U.S. pilots start flying into Miami soon for training on Boeing’s new jetliner, they’ll get a full-body experience. A 737 MAX simulator shown to media and airline representatives on Thursday offers an opportunity to sit in an exact replica of a cockpit of the new aircraft — to be delivered to the first airline customers in June — for training before delivery. From the cockpit, trainees see video reproductions that let them practice taking off, landing and flying, and experience the tilt, turbulence and climb of an actual aircraft. On Thursday, Miami’s Boeing Campus training site gave airline representatives and reporters a look at its new simulation suites and full-flight simulator, a pod-like unit containing the cockpit. It is Boeing’s only U.S. site where pilots can train on the new aircraft. Delivery to airlines begins in June. The media day visit also showed the 16-student classroom where mechanics are training specifically on the new aircraft, distinguishable from other 737s by its split-tipped winglet. Seattle-based Jayson Remfert, Boeing’s maintenance training product manager, said the program teaches already seasoned airline mechanics how to maintain and monitor a 737 MAX, even before they get hands-on experience with the real thing. Miami is the first campus to offer “MAX training” for the plane, also called the 737-8, said Martin Schaaf, campus manager. Boeing will later set up simulation classes in Singapore, Gatwick and Shanghai to train pilots for the 3,700-plus MAX aircraft already ordered by 87 airlines around the world. Miami is the first to have the 737 MAX classroom, Schaaf said, because “it’s a great aviation community” with proximity to “many of our customers.” More than a dozen airlines have already signed up to do their 737 MAX training in Miami, Schaaf said, including Aer Lingus, Air Mexico, American, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, COPA and Southwest. Some of them also toured the training sites on Thursday. The MAX version caused a mini-stir earlier this week when CNN disclosed American Airlines’ plan to shrink the legroom in economy class in the new model. Simulation has come a long way since pilots underwent rote memorization and learning from manuals with classroom lectures, said Seattle-based Scott Anderson of the 737 MAX training development team, as he demonstrated Miami’s simulation suite capable of teaching four pilots at a time. Today, they learn with hands-on training. Rather than sit at a desk, the pilots sit side by side at a flat-panel, interactive flight deck computerized cockpit before graduating to a full-flight simulators. Today’s generation “don’t want to read about it. They want to do it,” Anderson said. “The students of the future, they’re not afraid of technology.” Old school overlaps with new school at a 737 MAX simulation training room at Boeing’s Miami Campus, where the aircraft manufacturer unveiled its training suites for the new 737 due to begin service in June with delivery of the first of 3,700 aircraft to some 87 airlines. CAROL ROSENBERG crosenberg@miamiherald.com Thursday, the campus team showed the 737 MAX full cockpit simulator. Its computerized program was frozen in flight over foggy Washington state during a break in checks by inspectors from the FAA and European aviation agencies. Boeing has about 1,600 employees in Florida, with 100 of those at the Miami training center. Others are at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and in Jacksonville, where the firm supports Navy P-8 training.

China's home-grown C919 passenger jet completed its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major first step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home. Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus." At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric , France's Safran , Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. Hardship, Struggle Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won't be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometers from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and "struggle" to meet the firm's goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

The work will include High Flight Hour (HFH) inspections, modifications and liaison engineering and is due to be completed in December 2017, the Defense Department added. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a comparison of the hugely expensive and controversial Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter and the F/A-18 not long after President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. Around the same time, Boeing, the manufacturer of the F/A-18, circulated a document suggesting that the Navy had a "significant capability gaps against emerging threats" with the F-35, according to the Navy Times, and that updating the F/A-18 was more efficient that buying new F-35 jets. ...

Credit: Andy Wong/Reuters Thousands of workers, government officials and aviation enthusiasts gathered to cheer as China's C919 passenger plane touched down at Shanghai's international airport Friday after its maiden trip to the sky. Player utilities Popout Share download This story is based on a radio interview. Listen to the full interview. PRI.org <iframe frameborder="0"  src="https://www.pri.org/node/162051/embedded" height="75" width="100%"></iframe> State media broadcast the test flight all across the country, and Chinese officials heralded it as the start of a new era. Chairman Mao Zedong tried and failed to build a commercially viable passenger plane in the 1970s, but the dream persisted. The government created the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) in 2008 with this specific goal in mind. Isaac Stone Fish, a journalist and a senior fellow at the Asia Society, said China considers the C919 a sign of its growing role in the global economy. “To be able to say ‘we're not just at the bottom of the barrel making very basic plastic parts for iPhones, but we're actually making very complicated technology,’” he said, is a narrative that resonates with the Chinese people. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng told Reuters after witnessing the flight of the 168-passenger plane. "I believe that in the not-too-distant future, we will be neck and neck with Boeing and Airbus." Seating 168 passengers, depending on configuration, makes the C919 a direct competitor for the lucrative and ubiquitous Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 series of jets. And COMAC is indeed setting its sights on disrupting those industry giants in the future. It makes sense. China buys most of its planes from Boeing and Airbus, and last year, Boeing predicted that Chinese airlines would spend about $1 trillion on more than 6,800 new planes over the next 20 years. Those numbers will likely grow — China’s expected to overtake the US as the world’s largest aviation market by 2024. It’s not necessarily a bad thing that COMAC is pushing into this space, Stone Fish said. Seattle-based Boeing may take a hit, but “a lot of the high-tech manufacturing parts used in this jet come from American companies.” They’re likely to see an increase in demand. Still, Stone Fish says, COMAC has 20 to 40 years to go before they can realistically shake up the aviation market. The first changes are going to be domestic, as Chinese companies begin buying from COMAC instead of (or in addition to) foreign companies. “They've already said that they've gotten more than 500 orders for planes.” Almost all, save two orders for a total of 30 planes, are from Chinese airlines and lessors. The next step is likely to be in African and Central Asian markets. Those countries have more lax regulations than the United States and Europe, where certification for a new type of plane can take several years. But Beijing has high hopes for its fledgling aerospace industry — plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia are already in the works.

The Toulouse-based manufacturer delivered 46 aircraft to 30 customers during the month (compared to Boeing’s April deliveries of 51 aircraft to 32 customers). As of April 30, Airbus has a gross total of 51 commercial aircraft on its books for the year, valued at approximately $8 billion. Subtracting 24 cancellations and four conversions so far this year, Airbus’ net total of new orders for 2017 to-date comes to 23 new aircraft. Airbus has delivered 182 aircraft during the first four months of 2017. An April 28 order from an undisclosed customer for 10 A350-900s proved to be Airbus’ most significant order for the month, valued at $3.1 billion. Airbus did not identify the customer as China Southern Airlines in its monthly tally released May 5, although on April 26, the Shanghai Stock Exchange indicated the airline had placed an order for 20 of the type, an order Airbus reportedly confirmed. Hong Kong-based China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings (CALC) ordered five aircraft during the month (three A320ceos and two A320neos), valued at $513.8 million. Airbus’ other April orders included four A319ceos from an unidentified customer (valued at $362 million); three A320ceos from Malaysia-based AirAsia (valued at $297 million); one A330-200 from Iberia (valued at $233.8 million); and two A321neos from Egyptian carrier Nile Air, a conversion from two A321ceos. Airbus’ major April deliveries included three aircraft each to lessor Aerospace Trading Holding Ltd. (all A320ceos bound for Aeroflot); American Airlines (all A321ceos); China Eastern Airlines (two A321ceos and one A320ceo); and UK-based LCC easyJet (all A320ceos). Four A350-900 XWBs were delivered during the month, with one each of the model going to Ethiopian Airlines, Finnair, Thai Airways International and South Korea’s Asiana Airlines. *Note: ATW does not count military, government or private customer orders or deliveries in its commercial aircraft tallies.

Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus." At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France's Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won't be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometres from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and"struggle" to meet the firm's goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers. © (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

They will have their successes, but they are coming in at number 5 or 6, not number 3. Let's see how things go. Something that should be disappointing everyone here is that it does not appear that anything is being innovated. Same aircraft, same scale, same old thing. Cookie cutter commodity aircraft are not going to be taking humanity forward. They are making heavy investments in technology that might be obsolete already.

These new Boeing jetliners will shrink that down to 30 inches for most of the economy class. Three rows will shrink down even more to 29 inches.  An airline spokesman, who  confirmed the news  to Skift, is remaining optimistic that some passengers might not even notice the change in space. "The seats we'll use on the Max are designed to maximize personal living space, while allowing more comfort, even in arrangement like this where the pitch is a little tighter," the spokesman said.  This legroom change would allow American to add at least 10 more seats than it has on its current set of Boeing 737 planes.  That 29 inches of pitch puts American more on par with low-cost carriers like Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. Both offer as little as 28 inches of pitch on their planes.  SEE MORE: Southwest Is Abandoning A Common Airline Practice CNN says American Airlines customers who are seated in the rows with the least amount of legroom won't get any extra discount.  That doesn't sound too good for customer service. Airline industry executives — including one from American —  were just grilled  by federal lawmakers about the way they treat customers.  Members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee even threatened federal regulation of the airline industry in the future if carriers don't improve their customer service.  American has  ordered 100  Boeing 737 Max airplanes. It's scheduled to receive the first of the planes later this year.  Recent related news American Airlines cutting legroom in economy classAmerican Airlines' newest Boeing 737s will have less legroom in most of the economy cabin than...

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool) By Dominic Gates, The Seattle Times Published: May 5, 2017, 10:41 AM A   A The first large airliner designed and built in China successfully completed its maiden flight in Shanghai Friday, a significant milestone in the country’s ambitions to become a power in commercial aviation and to begin to challenge the longstanding duopoly of Airbus and Boeing. The jet took off from at 11:00 p.m. PST Thursday from Shanghai Pudong International Airport with a five-person crew aboard and landed an hour and 19 minutes later. In a first for a test flight, a large audience in China and worldwide was able to follow the first flight live on TV and the internet, broadcast from the flight deck of the plane. The audience could listen to the pilot’s radio communications with the control center while watching a video broadcast that showed on a split screen the view over the pilot’s right shoulder and another outside view of the jet shot through a window of a chase plane. Both Airbus and Boeing tweeted congratulations to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), which built the C919. Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, also posted a message on Chinese microblogging website Weibo, which had carried the live feed of the flight, calling the event “an important milestone for Chinese aviation.” The C919 is roughly the size of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and the Airbus A320neo. Yet western experts believe it won’t put much of a dent in the market share of the dominant U.S. and European players. Launched nine years ago and now running three years late, the C919 jet won’t enter service until 2019 or 2020. The Airbus neo is already in service and has won more than 5,000 orders. And the Boeing MAX, which is due to enter service later this month with Malaysian carrier Malindo Air, has just over 3,700 orders. Boeing leaders have said for years that it’s the next generation of Chinese commercial jets after the C919 that will offer real competition, likely around 2030. Bainbridge Island-based aviation consulting firm Leeham.net said this week that COMAC is targeting a top production rate of no more than seven jets per month well into the next decade. Boeing plans to churn out 57 of its 737s per month by 2019 and Airbus plans to go to 60 of its A320s per month. So the C919 “isn’t going to be much of a threat to Airbus or Boeing,” Leeham’s analysts concluded. Still, the C919 will inevitably sell in China under government fiat, and it may also find buyers among small southeast Asian and African nations dependent on China. Every one that sells means one less 737 or A320 sale, Leeham said. Apples to apples The C919 will seat 180 passengers in a single-class layout, according to a normalized cabin layout used by Leeham.net for apples-to-apples comparisons. That compares to 177 passengers for the A320neo and 186 passengers for the 737 MAX 8. The C919 is remarkably similar to the A320. The Chinese even chose to give the flight deck the same Airbus-style side-stick pilot controls rather than the steering column or yoke favored by Boeing. Since 2008, Airbus has been building A320s in a final assembly plant in Tianjin, China, a joint venture with a Chinese manufacturing consortium that must have helped lay the groundwork for the homegrown airplane. Leeham analyst Bjorn Fehrm said the C919 is about 4 percent heavier than the two Western jets in the same configuration, which will make it less efficient. However, the Chinese jet does feature modern avionics and other aircraft systems supplied by major Western suppliers, including GE, Honeywell, United Technologies and Rockwell Collins. And it has new generation LEAP engines from CFM International, the same family of engines that power the rival MAX and neo jets. CFM won that engine contract in 2009, and at the time it seemed like the C919 could be the first to market with the new fuel-efficient engines. But then Airbus and Boeing launched their neo and MAX models to wild sales success while the C919 was delayed, and that potential advantage disappeared. The development problems that have caused the C919 delays are hardly surprising. Even Boeing, with its long and storied history of airplane making, hit a wall with the 787 Dreamliner. Yet Richard Aboulafia, industry analyst with the Teal Group, believes that the central planning element and lack of any competition in the Chinese aerospace manufacturing economy inevitably will doom the C919 to mediocrity and unprofitability. Writing in his monthly newsletter last year, Aboulafia pointed out that “government-managed, funded, and supported jetliners, historically, are not stellar performers.” “Every single civil aircraft produced by an authoritarian country (or by a socialist economic system) has been a miserable failure on the market,” he wrote. COMAC reaching the milestone of first flight hasn’t made Aboulafia any more optimistic about the C919. “They still need to make the plane perform as well as the 737MAX and A320neo. Then they need to establish a massive product support infrastructure and a finance arm. Then they need to produce and sell at prices that allow them to match the two very high volume producers, without losing their shirts,” Aboulafia said Thursday. “The expense and risk has only just begun.” The Chinese government will likely lose money on the C919. The big question for Airbus and Boeing is how quickly it can follow up with another jet that’s more of a threat.

The 158-seater C919 aircraft painted white, green and blue, took to the skies from Shanghai Pudong International Airport in eastern China. The 80-minute flight was greeted with applause by more than 1,000 spectators on the tarmac, including Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai and Shanghai Communist Party chief Han Zheng. The twin-engine plane departed with five crew members on board but without any passengers. "The maiden flight was exciting," said Wu Guanghui, C919's chief designer, adding that it was a major breakthrough in China's civil aviation history, as well as the start of a new era of advanced manufacturing in the country. The successful flight of the indigenously-made aircraft made China the world's fourth jumbo jet producer after the US, Europe and Russia, the state media reported. The "C" in the aircraft's name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolises "forever" in Chinese culture and 19 represents the maximum 190 seats capacity. With a standard range of 4,075 kilometres, the narrow- body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737, signalling the country's entry into the global aviation market, Xinhua news agency commented. It also marks a milestone for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, it said. China in recent times has been making big breakthroughs in aviation with new fighter aircraft, including a stealth aircraft, but this is the first time it came out with a passenger plane. China's first amphibious aircraft, stated to be the largest in the world,successfully conducted its first glide test on April 29 in Chinese city of Zhuhai and braced for its maiden flight. China began to develop its own jumbo passenger jets in the 1970s and the first one, the Y-10, had a successful test flight in 1980. But the project was abandoned later. In 2007, the State Council, China's Cabinet, approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. Theplanepassed expert technical appraisal this March. The aircraft was given the go-ahead in April to begin a series of high-speed taxiing tests, the final step before its maiden flight. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. The jet was designed and produced in China and made with resources from around the world. It is an achievement in global cooperation, said Wu. The C919 incorporates parts from over 30 global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc. Its engines were made by a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines. COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service. China's new passenger planes pose no immediate threat to Western aviation companies such as Boeing and Airbus. "The Chinese government is interested in establishing independence and self-sufficiency in all aspects of aviation," Douglas Royce, an aerospace expert at Forecast International, an aerospace market research firm, told Xinhua. It is engaged in a long-term process of catching up to Europe, the United States, and Russia in commercial aircraft, he said. Royce predicted that demand for the C919 will be cantered in the Chinese market and a few satellite markets in the early years of service. Both Airbus andBoeinghave assembly plants in China considering the growing demand for new aircraft. Airbushaddelivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators in 2016, its seventh consecutive year of more than 100 deliveries, AirbusChina said earlier this year. A recent Boeing forecast saidthat China will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years at an estimated cost of USD one trillion. By the end of 2016, 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 C919 aircraft, and COMAC expects to sell at least 2,000. China's first regional commercial aircraft ARJ21 began commercial operation in June 2016. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

As onlookers cheered and clicked photos, the C919 airliner left the runway at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the home base of its builder Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. , or Comac. The single-aisle plane, which is designed to seat as many as 174 people, is slated to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2019. The test flight, after repeated delays, marks another step in Xi’s ambitious ‘Made in China 2025’ program, which identified aerospace among sectors that could accelerate China’s advancement. The government has said the ability to build and fly a large commercial aircraft is the “flower’’ and “pearl’’ of modern manufacturing.  More from Bloomberg.com: Why the Retail Crisis Could Be Coming to American Groceries The C919 would be the first competitor for Airbus SE and Boeing Co. in the most popular sector of the airliner market and gives Comac a home advantage in what is set to become the world’s biggest aircraft market. Boeing estimates China will need 6,810 aircraft worth more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035. “There’s a lot riding on the C919,’’ said Xu Yongling, a military test pilot and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. “The expectation for the C919 is not to become the best-selling single-aisle aircraft in the market, but rather become a stepping stone for COMAC to build something better, with indigenous technology.’’ More from Bloomberg.com: Is This the Most Valuable Car in the World? VIP Guests COMAC plans to make six of the planes for tests, and the second one is getting ready at the final assembly workshop in Shanghai, the builder said. Guests who witnessed Friday’s test flight included Vice Premier Ma Kai and Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary from Shanghai. The plane circled the skies around the Shanghai region after takeoff, and the test flight is slated to last for a couple of hours before the jet lands back in the city. The five people aboard the aircraft include the captain, co-pilot, a test observer and two engineers. Getting into the major league with Airbus and Boeing may be a few decades away as customers typically prefer aircraft with proven track record, reliability and safety, analysts said. COMAC is seeking certification for the C919 from European agencies. More from Bloomberg.com: GOP Sets Do-Or-Die Vote to Deliver on Obamacare Repeal Promise The C919 designation was chosen partly to reflect the idea of long life in Chinese numerology. With a maximum range of 3,450 miles, the plane is powered by two LEAP-1C engines from CFM International Inc., a joint venture between Safran SA and General Electric Co. Other key system suppliers include Honeywell International Inc., Rockwell Collins Inc., Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH, Thales SA and Panasonic Corp. To read a story on how the Chinese plane is made with U.S. technology, click here. The test flight of the plane follows China’s launch last month of its first domestically built aircraft carrier . The milestones, coming within weeks, burnish Xi’s credentials as a modernizer before he presides over the ruling Communist Party’s twice-a-decade congress later this year. Almost a billion people will fly to, from or within China by 2025, the International Air Transport Association estimates. Over the next two decades, about 75 percent of the jets ferrying those passengers will be single-aisle -- a category dominated by Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 family. China is looking at that business and saying “Why should I stand that out? I’d like a piece of that, serving my own market,” said Jeff Rollins, vice president at Honeywell, one of the equipment suppliers to the C919. “It’s also pride. China wants to have the same industrial economic capabilities as a lot of other leading nations.” To read David Fickling’s column on the C919, click here. In an email, Boeing congratulated COMAC for the “successful development” of the C919, while Airbus said it welcomes competition, “which is good for the development of the industry.” COMAC, which had postponed the test flight at least twice, says it has commitments from 23 customers for about 570 planes, with Shanghai-based China Eastern lined up to take the first delivery. The company estimates the market potential for the plane would be as much as 650 billion yuan ($94 billion). Read More Next Aircraft Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers. “At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,” he said. “First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday’s technology.”  COMAC has set its sights on building a wide-body aircraft. It is forming a joint venture with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. to develop a twin-aisle jet that can fly as far as 7,450 miles –- roughly the distance between Beijing and New York –- and can seat 280 people. The planemaker is targeting the first test flight in 2023 and delivery three years later. “The C919 is a testament to China’s civil aviation research and manufacturing capability,” said Yu Zhanfu, executive director at Roland Berger Management Consultants Shanghai Co. “China’s had a lot of success in making rockets, making spaceships. It shows the country is capable of mega tech-intensive manufacturing projects.” Updates with Boeing and Airbus comments in 14th paragraph.

Reuters  | Posted by Dev Goswami  reuters@intoday.com Shanghai, May 5, 2017 | UPDATED 20:56 IST A +A - Highlights 1 China's first home-grown passenger jet completed its maiden flight on Friday. 2 The C919 jet was conceived in 2008. 3 The flight underlines China's goal of entering the global jet industry. China's home-grown C919 passenger jet completed its long-delayed maiden flight today, a major first step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home. Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus." At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. PLANE FLEW AT 300 KMPH On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France's Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. HARDSHIP, STRUGGLE Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won't be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometres from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and "struggle" to meet the firm's goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

Mayer was aboard the airship Shenandoah when it visited the Northwest, seen here moored to a mast at what’s now JBLM in October 1924; the airship was destroyed in a crash in Ohio less than a year later. (Photo courtesy Lee Corbin) Comments Share Tweet Share Share This weekend will mark the 80th anniversary of the crash of the German airship Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey. RELATED: Northwest settlers created DIY government in 1843 The disaster still resonates, thanks to newsreel footage and the dramatic recording made by radio broadcaster Herb Morrison. But the Hindenburg wasn’t the only airship that crashed in the United States in the period between World War I and World War II. And throughout the 1920s and 1930s, a mostly-forgotten man from Seattle was deeply involved in America’s efforts to develop “lighter-than-air” aviation through balloons and helium-filled, rigid airships. He helped design the airship Shenandoah, and was serving as an officer on board when that giant Navy dirigible broke apart over Ohio in September 1925, and he helped guide safely to earth the forward section of the crippled craft. He served as an officer on the Navy airship Los Angeles, and flew on the Akron and the Macon. He was at Lakehurst, New Jersey the day after the Hindenburg disaster in May 1937, and took part in the Navy’s initial investigation into the crash. But for some reason, the high-flying aviation exploits of Seattle native Roland G. Mayer have remained in the background, even right here in his hometown. Roland G. Mayer’s grandson Kevin Vogel owns an art gallery and lives in Dallas. “He also was a glider pilot . . . [and he had a] glider license, actually, that was signed by Orville Wright,” Vogel said. “So that will give you an idea of how long ago he was involved in all of this.” Vogel says America’s “lighter-than-air” aviators have been mostly forgotten by history, as has the original military purposes of airships – to patrol the oceans for enemy ships and serve as skyborne aircraft carriers. This eventually proved impractical, dangerous and often deadly. Ian Ross, who studied Mayer and other airship officers for a book he wrote about Ross’ grandfather Herbert Wiley, says that a small group of Americans were at the heart of this country’s military airship program in the 1920s and 1930s. “In the core of that were this handful of men, and the women they were married to, that really made the whole thing go,” Ross said. “They were extremely brave, because [the airships] were untested. I mean, think about the winds aloft and how these things are very fragile.” And Roland G. Mayer, says Ian Ross, was one of these brave men. Lee Corbin, a retired airline pilot and Air Force officer who lives in Pierce County, came across Mayer’s name several years ago when he was researching the 1924 Pacific Northwest visit of the US Navy’s Shenandoah, the first American-designed and built airship. Corbin began digging into Mayer’s history, and found out that his family was owner of Seattle’s Washington Shoe Company, as well as the Mayer Shoe Company in their native Milwaukee. Corbin says that Mayer graduated from the University of Washington with an engineering degree in 1917. This led directly to a job for Mayer and two classmates. Their employer was the airplane company that had been launched the year before by Bill Boeing. The job with Boeing didn’t last for Mayer, but it turns out he was in pretty good company with the other two classmates who did stick around. “What’s interesting is the three names” of the UW graduates who went to work for Boeing in 1917, said Lee Corbin. “Mayer was one of them, Claire Egtvedt was the other, and [the other one was] named Phillip G. Johnson.” Incredibly, Egtvedt and Johnson would each go on to high-level leadership positions at Boeing. “So there’s no telling what Mayer would’ve done” if he’d stayed, Corbin said. But Mayer had other plans. Corbin says Roland Mayer worked at Boeing only for a few weeks before heading east to work as an engineer for the Navy in Philadelphia. In Philadelphia, Mayer helped design and build the Shenandoah. He then became a Naval officer and was aboard when the airship headed off on its cross-country trip in 1924. One of the goals of the trip was to test the viability of flying the ship to the arctic. “In order to test this theory of long-distance flight for a dirigible, they set up a planned trip to come up here [from Lakehurst, New Jersey] to Seattle by way of Fort Worth and San Diego,” Corbin said. “So they built three different mooring masts. One down in Fort Worth, which I think now is a parking lot for a warehouse down there. And they built one at what’s now called North Island Naval Air Station [near San Diego]. And I’m pretty sure that one is gone because of all the construction [from] when they were building the airfields.” “But interestingly enough, the one that was built at [what was then known as] Camp Lewis is now on a portion of McChord Air Force Base, and it’s out in an area that was left undeveloped all these years,” Corbin said. Corbin, with his Air Force connections, was able to investigate what remains of the mooring mast. “There’s actually still a foundation down there if you know where to look you can find it,” Corbin said. Photos that Corbin took show the concrete footing of the mast and the guy wires, as well as remains of the foundation of the shed built to service airships. “The mooring mast was only used once,” Corbin said, referring to the arrival of the Shenandoah in 1924. And the visit of the enormous craft was hugely popular with local residents. The Shenandoah was 680 feet long, and it was seen by countless people as it flew around Puget Sound during its day-long visit. Then, thousands of civilians converged on Camp Lewis to get a closer look at the airship when it spent part of the day tied to the mooring mast. But airships weren’t exactly a safe and reliable form of travel. Less than a year after the Shenandoah visited Camp Lewis, the ship met its untimely end in a thunderstorm over the Buckeye State. Roland Mayer’s grandson Kevin Vogel has studied airships and his grandfather’s role in their development and in the crash. He’s grateful to Lee Corbin for the research Corbin has shared with Vogel and with Vogel’s cousin Andrea Mayer, who lives in British Columbia. “This era was a period in aviation that most people don’t know anything about, and it’s absolutely fascinating,” Vogel said. Vogel says his grandfather, who passed away in the 1970s, didn’t talk much about his airship days, including the 1925 wreck. “Actually, he was very close-mouthed about that timeframe and the incidents related,” Vogel said. But from Corbin’s research and through his own reading, Vogel has learned exactly what role his grandfather played in the life – and death – of the ship. “Basically, he was a keel officer of the Shenandoah and he was responsible for the engineering aspects of the ship,” Vogel said. “Anything that happened to that ship, if there was a motor that went out or something like that, he was responsible for getting the guys together to get it working again. That’s what he did.” To hear author Ian Ross tell it, when the Shenandoah crashed, it was unlike any aviation tragedy before or since. “It hit extreme turbulence over Ohio and broke into basically three pieces,” Ross said. “And the control car, with most of the officers, dropped away and fell to earth and killed everybody [inside],” Ross said. “The upper section broke into two pieces, and both of those pieces floated to earth,” Ross said. “The rear section floated down and dragged across, and most of the people that were in that section survived.” For the six crew members in the front section – the section where Roland G. Mayer found himself – it was a little more complicated. “I personally believe very strongly that [Roland Mayer] played a vital role in the survival of that front section,” Ross said. When the ship broke apart, the front section floated free and gained altitude, and the men aboard had to pilot it as if it were, essentially, a rudderless balloon. Mayer’s grandson Vogel says that Roland Mayer and the other crewmembers somehow managed to decrease their altitude. Then, they dropped a line down far enough to touch the ground in the rural Ohio countryside. “They dragged the line down on the ground and apparently it went over the roof of a farmer’s house and the farmer came out and they kept yelling to him to run ahead and tie the line off on a tree so it would hold the ship in place,” Vogel said. “Once that happened, someone shimmied down the line and asked the farmer to get a shotgun so they could start shooting the gas cells of the aircraft” to release the helium and bring the section of the ship safely down. A total of 14 men died in the wreck of the Shenandoah, but remarkably, 29 survived. After the crash, Mayer remained involved in the airship program, and even took part in long-distance balloon travel with famous balloonist “Tex” Settle. Mayer then served as an officer aboard the airship Los Angeles. Rigid airships were ultimately made obsolete by advances in fixed-wing, heavier-than-air aviation, and several high-profile deadly disasters didn’t do much to promote their viability. Two additional Navy airships were destroyed in storm-related crashes in the 1930s. The Akron crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 1933 killing 73, and then the Macon crashed off the coast of California in 1935 killing two. Still, during World War II, the U.S. Navy used dozens of smaller, non-rigid inflatable blimps for patrol and reconnaissance. When the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg exploded in flames on May 6, 1937, at the Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, Roland G. Mayer wasn’t there. Airship historian Dan Grossman says that Mayer was likely in Philadelphia, where the Navy had other aviation facilities. “He was not there for the crash, I’m sure he kicked himself that he missed it, in a sense,” Grossman said. Mayer is pictured at Lakehurst in a news photo taken the day after the tragedy, as a member of a hastily organized Navy-led inquiry into what happened. Dan Grossman says this group was only active for a few days before the US Commerce Department took over the official Hindenburg investigation that later published a report of its findings. Though his airship days were over by the late 1930s, Roland Mayer spent several more years in aviation, eventually running Convair’s plant in Fort Worth, Texas where B-24 Liberator bombers were manufactured during World War II. After the war, Mayer retired, and he and his wife bought a nearly 400-acre ranch north of Fort Worth. Grandson Kevin Vogel says that Mayer didn’t dwell on his airship exploits. “It’s not like he had mementoes all around the house of his Navy days. Not at all. It was like he had moved on,” Vogel said. Though he was an early Boeing employee, aviation pioneer, Navy veteran, hero of the American airship era, and builder of World War II bombers, Roland G. Mayer left all that behind for pursuits much closer to the ground. “He would’ve been perfectly happy if he had died on his tractor, out in the field tilling the soil,” Vogel said.

China’s first large jetliner has successfully completed its maiden flight, a key moment in the country’s push to challenge the U.S. and Europe as a global manufacturer. The C919, China’s first domestically designed and built large airliner, took off Friday afternoon from Shanghai Pudong International Airport into hazy skies with a five-person crew aboard. The jet landed one hour and 19 minutes later after a seemingly uneventful first trial. With the flight, China joins the ranks of the few nations that have developed homegrown large airliners: the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany. Made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the 168-seat C919 is roughly the same size as Airbus’s A320 and Boeing’s 737-800, which are the most popular airliners in the world. The C919’s maiden flight was watched by people around the globe, including at least 2 million on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo. Comac also offered an unprecedented look inside the maiden flight of a new airliner. The company streamed live images from the jet’s cockpit looking over the shoulder of its test pilots as they performed gentle maneuvers off the coast. Neither Boeing nor Airbus has ever provided a live view of the cockpit on a first flight. The Chinese jet’s first flight is the biggest and most visible milestone in its development. But it still has a long way to go before it’s carrying passengers and competing with its U.S. and European competitors. The start of aerial testing kicks off months or years of grueling certification tests, and meeting safety standards might require design changes. Comac will also need to win the trust of airlines in China and elsewhere by proving the jet can operate efficiently and reliably on scheduled flights. However, the milestone marks another key achievement for China on its ascent to challenging the west and cultivating its aerospace ambitions. The country is already an adept designer of military aircraft, but has sought to catch up to Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in Europe in manufacturing civilian airliners. So far it’s been slow-going. The country’s state-owned airlines first signed up to buy the jet in 2010, and it was originally supposed to enter service in 2016. The prototype wasn’t unveiled until November 2015, and the project has been beset by technical delays as China learns the ropes of airliner development. Comac, a state-run enterprise, has partnered with western suppliers for nearly all the jet’s major systems to share technology and learn how to mass produce an airliner. The C919’s main customers will be China’s domestic airlines. China Eastern Airlines will be the first carrier to operate the C919 when it completes testing and secures approval from China’s aviation regulator. China is on track to surpass the U.S. by 2030 as the world’s largest commercial aviation market. Chinese airlines are buying hundreds of Boeing and Airbus jets to grow their fleets. Boeing estimates that the country will need a trillion dollars worth of new airplanes over the next two decades, including more than 5,100 of the same size as the C919. 35.861660 104.195397 Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The white, green and blue aircraft made a successful landing after a 90-minute flight from Shanghai's international airport. The long-delayed maiden flight was watched by a large crowd that included dignitaries and aviation workers. The C919 aircraft is the first large civil jet aircraft developed by China. It was built by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China or Comac. The C919 has a layout of 158 to 168 seats, with a range of 4,075 to 5,555 kilometers. The aircraft is part of China's long-term goal to become a global aviation player and break Airbus and Boeing's duopoly in the lucrative global jet market, which is estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades. The narrow-body twin-engine jet is intended to compete against Airbus A320 neo, Boeing 737 MAX, Bombardier and other next-generation single-aisle airliners. According to Comac, a total of 570 orders for the aircraft have been obtained from 23 customers. Comac plans a test program of 4,200 flight hours and introduction in 2020 with China Eastern Airlines. However, the C919 still has a long journey ahead, as it needs to undergo safety and certification checks. Currently, Boeing and Airbus are far ahead of Comac in terms of technical know-how and order books. The C919 continues to rely on technology from Western companies, including General Electric, Honeywell, United Technologies and France's Safran as well as Michelin. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Healthy Income: The 10 Highest Paid Occupations in the US Hollywood's 10 Highest Paid Film Stars Gold Diggers Delight: The Richest Single People On Earth Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories Crayola Looking For Name For New Crayon Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Jobs Data - U.S. Commentary Southwest Offers Cargo Service At Cincinnati Lonzo Ball's $495 Shoes Cook Political Report Changes Ratings For 20 GOP Districts After Healthcare Vote Two Trump Trips To Mar-a-Lago Cost Taxpayers $1.3 Million Starbucks Whips Up Frappucino Happy Hour Cohn Suggests More Inclusive Approach To Tax Reform HBO Banking On Game Of Thrones Spinoffs Major Averages Continue To Linger Near The Unchanged Line - U.S. Commentary 2017 Video Game Hall Of Fame Announced Senate Republicans To Start Over On Healthcare Bill Facebook Mothballs Virtual Reality Studio Choppy Trading Persists Following Monthly Jobs Report - U.S. Commentary U.S. Unemployment Rate Hits Ten-Year Low On Strong Job Growth <<Previous        87 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS The Boeing Q1 17 Earnings Conference Call At 10:30 AM ET Boeing Q1 Profit Tops View, But Revenues Miss; Lifts 2017 Profit View The Boeing Q1 17 Earnings Conference Call At 10:30 AM ET The Boeing Co.

World ASIA China signals new era as first homegrown jetliner takes off China’s first homegrown jetliner takes off U.S. and European safety regulators need to certify the jetliner before it can operate much beyond China. (May 5, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) U.S. and European safety regulators need to certify the jetliner before it can operate much beyond China. (May 5, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) Jessica Meyers China’s first home-built large passenger jet glided into Shanghai skies on Friday, a breakthrough in its soaring ambitions to launch a new era in aviation and upend the dominance of American-produced airplanes. Spectators crowded onto the tarmac and cheered as the green-tipped C919 jetliner rumbled down the runway at Pudong International Airport and disappeared in the smoggy air. China Central Television showed the broadcast live, including two pilots in the cockpit clad in bright orange jumpsuits. More than 1.4 million people watched the flight through the news organization’s social media account. The plane won’t go into service for at least two years, and it will take even longer before it comes close to matching industry leaders Boeing and Airbus. But the maiden flight represented something else: China’s ascendance from an impoverished nation once dependent on factory output to a sophisticated leader dedicated to high-tech advancement. State media called the flight “another fulfillment of a Chinese dream.” Friday’s takeoff occurred the week after China launched its first domestically built aircraft carrier. This hands two significant victories to President Xi Jinping, who is seeking to cement his legacy before a Communist Party leadership shuffle this fall. His “Made in China 2025” plan aims to enhance domestic production through innovation. Jetliners like this one “reflect the country’s industrial level, international competitiveness and comprehensive power,” Xu Jifeng, who helped design the plane for state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac, told the television network. “If the C919 is successful, China will be one of the few countries that has the capability to research, develop and manufacture such large jets.” Comac describes the plane as “the flower” and “pearl” of modern manufacturing. The company chose the number partly because the word for 9, jiu, also means everlasting. “I always knew my country was capable of this,” said Wu Min, 35, a Beijing deliveryman. “It sends a strong signal to the rest of the world about what China can achieve.” Designing and flying an aircraft are just part of a long road. The spending and probable losses are just beginning. — Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, a Virginia-based aeronautics consulting firm The 158-seat aircraft, intended for medium-haul flights, took more than a decade to plan and complete. Officials designed it to compete with Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus 320 in a market they’ve long controlled. It’s a lucrative one. China’s middle class continues to expand and desires vacations to Thailand or business trips to Texas. Boeing estimates single-aisle planes like these will generate about $535 billion — 75% — of passenger jet sales in China within the next two decades. Comac says it already received 570 orders from 23 customers, although most of these are domestic companies or ones with ties to Chinese businesses. “Designing and flying an aircraft are just part of a long road,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, a Virginia-based aeronautics consulting firm. “The spending and probable losses are just beginning.” Boeing has President Nixon to thank for China’s infatuation with its airplanes. He flew a Boeing 707 on his historic visit to Beijing in 1972; the Chinese later purchased 10. Xi made a point to stop at Boeing’s headquarters two years ago on a trip to Seattle and purchased 300 jets. China’s reliance on the industry giants won’t change any time soon. Comac needed the assistance of Western suppliers to build the jet. General Electric and French aerospace firm Safran supplied the engines. Others, like Honeywell, offered up parts for its belly or cockpit. U.S. and European safety regulators also need to certify the jetliner before it can operate much beyond China. The country’s first homemade plane, a smaller, clunky regional jet called ARJ21, waited eight years between its initial fight and the summer day last year it went into service. “Ultimately, making an entire airplane from Chinese manufactured components is probably half a century away,” said George Ferguson, senior aerospace analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, which conducts economic and industry analysis. “But this is the initial foray.” Demand will only increase. China is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world’s largest air travel market by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Assn. Beijing’s international airport, a sprawling, high-ceiling edifice, already ranks second busiest in the world behind Atlanta. Even for some in China, it’s hard to let go of the airplane standard. “Developed countries like France and the U.S. still have the best technology in this field,” said Li Xiao, 30, an operations manager in Beijing. “I still can’t say I’m 100% confident about our homemade aircraft.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump takes his first trip abroad as president this month.

Albeit three-years late, the take-off, at exactly 2pm, followed a five-minute ceremony on the tarmac that saw five crew members, led by 41-year-old captain Cai Jun, board the gleaming new aircraft. It flew to Nantong, about 100 kilometres from Shanghai, before making a U-turn to land back at Pudong airport at about 3:20pm. It has a range of 2,200 to 3,000 nautical miles (5,556 km). The jet is the first of six C919s which will now undergo rigorous flight testing until 2019 before deliveries are made to airlines, according to Bao Peng, a project manager at the jet’s assembly plant operated by Shanghai-based Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac). The C919 – whose key parts include engines and avionics systems provided by 15 international companies such as General Electric and Honeywell – has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service. China is projected to require 6,865 new aircraft over the next 20 years valued at 6 trillion yuan (US$869 billion), as airlines replenish their retiring fleets or expand, according to Comac’s projection. About 21 per cent of these will be twin-aisle planes, while single-aisle aircraft make up 65 per cent of the demand, Comac said. “The first flight of the C919 aircraft marks a great milestone not only for Comac, but for China and the entire global aerospace industry,” said Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace’ Asia-Pacific operations. “It expands the ‘China dream’ of flying high with home-grown aircraft.” The second C919 currently being built at Comac’s Pudong plant may be ready for testing in the second half. The C919 can carry 150 passengers in a standard configuration, putting it in the same class as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. It took Comac seven years to get its first aircraft, the 78-seat regional jet ARJ-21, with a range of 1,200 to 2,000 nautical miles, into production after its 2008 debut flight. Analysts said the effort to break the duopoly enjoyed by Boeing and Airbus reflect China’s higher ambitions of wielding its economic might worldwide. Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-ying offered his congratulations on the successful flight, saying that it was a moment when a dream comes true. Over two decades, orders for Boeing and Airbus jets were often used by China to reconcile with the US and Europe when trade tensions. The C919 is also viewed as a pet project of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who told engineers during a 2014 visit to Comac that a completed jumbo jet made by China was part of his Chinese dream. A home-made large aircraft, despite costing a large sum of money, would change history, he said. The next step in Comac’s evolution as an aircraft manufacturer is now likely to be the development of China’s first long-haul, wide-bodied jet, which can carry at least 250 passengers. Comac and its Russian counterpart United Aircraft Corp set up a 50-50 joint venture last year to develop the plane, scheduled for a test flight in 2022, with deliveries by 2025. Airbus, which currently assembles the A320 family of aircraft in Tianjin, is confident about China’s demand for larger, long-haul aircraft. Boeing is also getting in on the act. The US plane-maker is finalising plans for a facility in Zhoushan, near Shanghai, for finishing work and delivery of its best-selling B-737 narrow-bodied jets to Chinese airlines. “The first flight is just a step forward for the C919,” said Emil Zhang, a senior manager with Air France-KLM China. “It would fly higher in the global aviation industry if it were to pass through safety certification procedures by European and US authorities.” SCMP Today: HK Edition Get updates direct to your inbox.

The narrow-body 158-seater aircraft, which will compete with Boeing`s 737 and the Airbus A320, is a key symbol of China`s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth USD 2 trillion over the next 20 years. The aircraft, painted white, green and blue, took to the skies from Shanghai Pudong International Airport in eastern China. The 80-minute flight was greeted with applause by more than 1,000 spectators on the tarmac, including Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai and Shanghai Communist Party chief Han Zheng. The twin-engine plane departed with five crew members on board but without any passengers. "The maiden flight was exciting," said Wu Guanghui, C919's chief designer, adding that it was a major breakthrough in China's civil aviation history, as well as the start of a new era of advanced manufacturing in the country. The successful flight of the indigenously-made aircraft made China the world's fourth jumbo jet producer after the US, Europe, and Russia, the state media reported. The "C" in the aircraft's name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolises "forever" in Chinese culture and 19 represents the maximum 190 seats capacity. With a standard range of 4,075 kilometres, the narrow-body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737, signalling the country's entry into the global aviation market, Xinhua news agency commented. It also marks a milestone for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, it said. China in recent times has been making big breakthroughs in aviation with new fighter aircraft, including a stealth aircraft, but this is the first time it came out with a passenger plane. China's first amphibious aircraft, stated to be the largest in the world, successfully conducted its first glide test on April 29 in the Chinese city of Zhuhai and braced for its maiden flight. China began to develop its own jumbo passenger jets in the 1970s and the first one, the Y-10, had a successful test flight in 1980. But the project was abandoned later. In 2007, the State Council, China's Cabinet, approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. The plane passed expert technical appraisal this March. The aircraft was given the go-ahead in April to begin a series of high-speed taxiing tests, the final step before its maiden flight. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. The jet was designed and produced in China and made with resources from around the world. It is an achievement in global cooperation, said Wu. The C919 incorporates parts from over 30 global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc. Its engines were made by a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines. COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service. China's new passenger planes pose no immediate threat to Western aviation companies such as Boeing and Airbus. "The Chinese government is interested in establishing independence and self-sufficiency in all aspects of aviation," Douglas Royce, an aerospace expert at Forecast International, an aerospace market research firm, told Xinhua. It is engaged in a long-term process of catching up to Europe, the United States, and Russia in commercial aircraft, he said. Royce predicted that demand for the C919 will be cantered in the Chinese market and a few satellite markets in the early years of service. Both Airbus and Boeing have assembly plants in China considering the growing demand for new aircraft. Airbus had delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators in 2016, its seventh consecutive year of more than 100 deliveries, AirbusChina said earlier this year. A recent Boeing forecast said that China will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years at an estimated cost of USD one trillion. By the end of 2016, 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 C919 aircraft, and COMAC expects to sell at least 2,000. China's first regional commercial aircraft ARJ21 began commercial operation in June 2016.

Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with “C919” emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai’s international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing’s broader “Made in China 2025” plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. “Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time,” Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. “I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus.” At the moment, though, Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA) remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China’s ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a “major breakthrough” and milestone for China’s passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric (GE.N), France’s Safran (SAF.PA), Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. HARDSHIP, STRUGGLE Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. “Every year we spend billions on buying planes,” a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years,” said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won’t be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC’s C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometers from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term “hardship”, “dedication” and “struggle” to meet the firm’s goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.—Reuters Post navigation Previous Previous post: Deepika Padukone gets angry on foreign media Tweet Related Posts Oil train accident brings calls for tougher U.S. safety rules 100 Taliban believed killed in strike: Afghan government Thousands rally in East Timor, urging PM’s ouster Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

(AP) BLOOMBERG NEWS 5/05/2017 Reprints China successfully completed the first test flight of its home-built modern passenger jet, bolstering President  Xi Jinping's ambition of turning China into an advanced economy. Amid cheers from onlookers, the C919 airliner took off Friday from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the home base of its builder Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The jet landed back about an hour and 19 minutes later after cruising at 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The single-aisle plane, which is designed to seat as many as 174 people, is slated to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2019. "It shows China made a historic breakthrough in its years-old dream of building a big aircraft," Comac said in a statement, calling the test a "complete success." The nation's State Council, the top administrative authority, sent a congratulatory note to the designers. The test flight, after repeated delays, marks another step in Xi's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' program, which identified aerospace among sectors that could accelerate China's advancement. The government has said the ability to build and fly a large commercial aircraft is the "flower'' and "pearl'' of modern manufacturing. The C919 would be the first major competitor for Airbus SE and Boeing Co. in the most popular sector of the airliner market and gives Comac a home advantage in what is set to become the world's biggest aircraft market. Boeing estimates China will need 6,810 aircraft worth more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035. "There's a lot riding on the C919,'' said Xu Yongling, a military test pilot and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. "The expectation for the C919 is not to become the best-selling single-aisle aircraft in the market, but rather become a stepping stone for COMAC to build something better, with indigenous technology.'' VIP Guests COMAC plans to make six planes for tests, and the second one is getting ready at the final assembly workshop in Shanghai, the builder said. Guests who witnessed Friday's test flight included Vice Premier Ma Kai and Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary from Shanghai. The five people on board the test plane were the captain, co-pilot, an observer and two engineers. Getting into the major league with Airbus (EADSY) and Boeing (BA) may be a few decades away as customers typically prefer aircraft with proven track record, reliability and safety, analysts said. COMAC is seeking certification for the C919 from European agencies. "Comac could well be an option for us," said William Walsh, chief executive officer of IAG SA, the owner of British Airways Plc, adding he'd only seriously consider the plane when IAG reviews its existing fleet of short-haul Airbus A320-family jets in the long-term. More immediately, he's expecting lower prices from the added competition. Walsh, a former pilot who's flown in the plane's simulator, said he's due to meet with Comac next month to further advise on features that IAG looks for in a new model. "A new entrant will have an impact on pricing," Walsh told analysts on a call Friday. "We've seen that to some degree with the launch of the CSeries. It's something that both airlines and the manufacturers are aware of." The C919 designation was chosen partly to reflect the idea of long life in Chinese numerology. With a maximum range of 3,450 miles, the plane is powered by two LEAP-1C engines from CFM International Inc., a joint venture between Safran SA and General Electric (GE). Other key system suppliers include Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Collins (COL), Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH, Thales SA and Panasonic Corp. The test flight of the plane follows China's launch last month of its first domestically built aircraft carrier. The milestones, coming within weeks, burnish Xi's credentials as a modernizer before he presides over the ruling Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress later this year. Almost a billion people will fly to, from or within China by 2025, the International Air Transport Association estimates. Over the next two decades, about 75 percent of the jets ferrying those passengers will be single-aisle -- a category dominated by Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320 family. In an email, Boeing congratulated Comac for the "successful development" of the C919, while Airbus said it welcomes competition, "which is good for the development of the industry." Comac, which had postponed the test flight at least twice, says it has commitments from 23 customers for about 570 planes, with Shanghai-based China Eastern lined up to take the first delivery. Next Aircraft Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers. "At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be," he said. "First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday's technology." Comac has set its sights on building a wide-body aircraft. It is forming a joint venture with Russia's United Aircraft Corp. to develop a twin-aisle jet. "The C919 is a testament to China's civil aviation research and manufacturing capability," said Yu Zhanfu, executive director at Roland Berger Management Consultants Shanghai Co. "China's had a lot of success in making rockets, making spaceships. It shows the country is capable of mega tech-intensive manufacturing projects."

China's answer to Boeing and Airbus flew for the first time Friday in Shanghai, an achievement that shows both how far the country has come and how far it still remains from building a competitive airliner. State press treated the takeoff of the C919, China's first homegrown passenger jet, from Shanghai's Pudong airport this afternoon like the U.S. did space launches in the 1960s. Coverage of the flight led CCTV all afternoon. A live cam was broadcast from the C919's cockpit. Top Party officials attended the takeoff, in what was billed as seminal achievement in China's ambitions to build technically sophisticated goods for itself and the world. The plane landed safely after flying for 80 minutes. The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac, began in 2008 when the government combined several aviation companies from China's previous failure to build a commercial jetliner. The goal was to disrupt Boeing and Airbus's dominance in the Chinese market-where they control 95% of airline sales-and someday, compete on the global scale. But even Comac workers conceded in conversations with Fortune that their first plane, the C919, wouldn't do that. "Comac is young and our capabilities are weak," Comac chairman Jin Zhuanglong told Fortune three years ago as Comac was still designing the plane. The C919 is a collection of parts supplied by the same companies that supplied the Boeing Dreamliner. But they held back their best technology from Comac after being forced into Chinese joint ventures and wanting to protect their intellectual property, several analysts say. Whether they admit to it or not, suppliers aren't passing along the latest and greatest parts, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia says. Take the engine, produced by a GE joint venture with France's Safran called CFM. It was not forecast to be better than the competition three years ago, let alone when the C919 finally begins commercial flight, which could still be two to three years away. That means the 158-seat narrow-body twin-engine C919 is likely to be heavier than a comparable Boeing or Airbus; less efficient; and less trusted than the planes from either established company. Because China's state-owned airlines don't have a choice in the matter of ordering from Comac, the plane will at least operate in Chinese airspace. Comac says there are already nearly 600 potential orders, but the weaker efficiency of the planes puts the government in a bind of supporting either the homegrown airplane maker or the homegrown airlines. The attention now turns to whether in the next decade or two, China and Comac can improve its airliners the way Brazil's Embraer did in the 1990s to become a global player. Comac has already discussed 929 and 939 programs. And there will be plenty of demand in China to burnish further advances. Boeing anticipates the country will need $1 trillion worth of planes- more than 6,800 of them-in the twenty years through 2036.

The successful first flight is a huge deal for China, and an indication that Boeing and Airbus will eventually face a new competitor in a key aviation market. Here’s a look at China’s aviation market by the numbers: 487 million: That’s the number of domestic and international journeys made last year in China, according to data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). Even more impressive is how quickly the market is growing. The number of trips made last year increased by 12% over 2015, according to CAAC. The surge in air travel has been fueled in large part by middle class Chinese who are spending billions on domestic and foreign vacations. With a population of 1.4 billion, the trips add up: Analysts predict that China will surpass the U.S. as the world’s largest commercial aviation market by 2030. 5,100: Boeing estimates that the country will need a trillion dollars worth of new airplanes over the next two decades, including more than 5,100 of the same size as the C919. Most of that money would have been destined for bank accounts at Boeing and Airbus if not for the C919. Now, there’s a new competitor on the block. With 168 seats, the C919 is expected to go up against the Airbus’s A320 and Boeing’s 737-800. 55: That’s the number of Chinese airlines currently in operation. Domestic airlines expected to be major buyers of the C919. So far, demand for the jet has remained local: orders are almost entirely from Chinese carriers for domestic flying. The jet is one of the final pieces of an aviation ecosystem that has been in development for decades in China. The company that developed the C919, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), is owned by the state. Most domestic airlines are also backed by the government. China Eastern Airlines will be the first carrier to operate the C919 when it completes testing and secures approval from China’s aviation regulator. Eight: China has now joined the small group of nations that have developed large airliners: the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany. The C919 still faces months or years of grueling certification tests, and meeting safety standards might require design changes. But the maiden flight is a milestone: While China is already an adept designer of military aircraft, it has struggled to catch up to Boeing and Airbus in manufacturing civilian airliners. 1/3: China’s aviation market still has a ways to go. One third of all flights in the country were delayed in 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association. The statistic is a good reminder that developing an aviation industry takes many decades. It’s also an industry where results matter: Comac will need to win the trust of airlines in China and elsewhere by proving the jet can operate efficiently and reliably on scheduled flights. — Jon Ostrower contributed to this report.

The surge in air travel has been fueled in large part by middle class Chinese who are spending billions on domestic and foreign vacations. With a population of 1.4 billion, the trips add up: Analysts predict that China will surpass the U.S. as the world's largest commercial aviation market by 2030. 5,100: Boeing estimates that the country will need a trillion dollars worth of new airplanes over the next two decades, including more than 5,100 of the same size as the C919. Most of that money would have been destined for bank accounts at Boeing and Airbus if not for the C919. Now, there's a new competitor on the block. With 168 seats, the C919 is expected to go up against the Airbus's A320 and Boeing's 737-800. 55: That's the number of Chinese airlines currently in operation. Domestic airlines expected to be major buyers of the C919. So far, demand for the jet has remained local: orders are almost entirely from Chinese carriers for domestic flying. The jet is one of the final pieces of an aviation ecosystem that has been in development for decades in China. The company that developed the C919, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), is owned by the state. Most domestic airlines are also backed by the government. China Eastern Airlines will be the first carrier to operate the C919 when it completes testing and secures approval from China's aviation regulator. Eight: China has now joined the small group of nations that have developed large airliners: the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany. The C919 still faces months or years of grueling certification tests, and meeting safety standards might require design changes. But the maiden flight is a milestone: While China is already an adept designer of military aircraft, it has struggled to catch up to Boeing and Airbus in manufacturing civilian airliners. 1/3: China's aviation market still has a ways to go. One third of all flights in the country were delayed in 2015, according to the International Air Transport Association. The statistic is a good reminder that developing an aviation industry takes many decades. It's also an industry where results matter: Comac will need to win the trust of airlines in China and elsewhere by proving the jet can operate efficiently and reliably on scheduled flights. -- Jon Ostrower contributed to this report.

Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus." At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric , France's Safran , Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS> is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. HARDSHIP, STRUGGLE Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won't be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometers from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and "struggle" to meet the firm's goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with “C919” emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai’s international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion (approx. RM8.67 trillion) over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing’s broader “Made in China 2025” plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. “Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time,” Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. “I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus.” At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. Today, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China’s ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a “major breakthrough” and milestone for China’s passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France’s Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. Hardship, struggle Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 per cent of the aircraft in service worldwide. “Every year we spend billions on buying planes,” a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years,” said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won’t be easy. On a media visit yesterday to COMAC’s C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometres from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term “hardship”, “dedication” and “struggle” to meet the firm’s goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and US regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bursa to trend higher towards 1,770 points level next week Crude rebound eases markets but concerns linger Positive exports data to lift ringgit next week Insurance dampens Berkshire results before annual meeting Wall Street edges up as US job growth rebounds Firefly says cut Penang flights due to weak ringgit, competition Bitcoin soars above US$1,400 to all-time high Singapore Air may land unfamiliar net-debt spot by 2018 Ringgit rebounds as Asia’s FX laggards turn leaders of pack Abdul Wahid: More listed Islamic financial institutions needed on Bursa Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Thousands enjoy al fresco 'waste food' feast in Los Angeles Reuters Video: Moon rover debuts in 'Alien' movie Reuters Video: Macron stretches lead as French presidential campaign enters final day Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Related Articles China’s C919 narrow-body jet takes off on maiden flight (VIDEO) Made-in-China large passenger plane targets 2017 debut Chinese planemaker chases Xi’s dream to challenge Airbus, Boeing Chinese lessor orders ARJ-21 jets in US$2.3b deal Made in China passenger plane completed Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Tech & Trend C919: China's first homegrown large passenger jet can give Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 a run for their money While China targets the Western dominance in the global aviation industry, experts believe that the Chinese-made passenger planes like C919 pose no threat to Boeing and Airbus. Kukil Bora   May 5, 2017 15:46 IST China's first homegrown narrow-body passenger jet, the C919, made its maiden flight on Friday.Comac China's first homegrown narrow-body passenger jet, the C919, took off from the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on its maiden test flight on Friday. The new large civil aircraft, independently developed in China, is seen as the country's boldest attempt till date to challenge the monopoly of Western players in the commercial passenger jet market. The C919, which is expected to rival the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320, was originally scheduled to take to the skies in 2014, but the plan fell through due to some manufacturing issues. If Friday's maiden flight is successful, C919's state-owned maker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. (Comac) will approach the country's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators for certification, before making any deliveries. "C919 aircraft has a layout of 158 to 168 seats, and a range of 4,075 to 5,555 kilometers," Comac said on its website. "The first aircraft rolled out on November 2nd, 2015. A total of 570 orders have been obtained from 23 customers." The C919 measures 12 metres in height and 38.9 metres in length. It has a wingspan of 33.6 metres and it can fly at a maximum altitude of 12,100 metres.

The plane's front windshield is composed of only four pieces, instead of six found on normal planes, to help reduce air resistance, Global Times reported. Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said the plane which took off Friday was the first of six C919 jets that would go through rigorous testing until 2019, before going into production. China is also reportedly building various runways across the country for C919 test flights. Meanwhile, the second C919 is currently being produced at Comac's plant in Pudong, and is expected to make its first test flight in the second half of this year. Comac said more than 200 Chinese companies and 36 universities have worked together to develop the C919 aircraft. However, it also relied on overseas companies like General Electric and Honeywell for critical parts, including the jet's engines and avionics systems. Spectators take photos as they watch the Comac C919, China's first large passenger jet, coming in for a landing on its maiden flight at Shanghai's Pudong airport on May 5, 2017.REUTERS/Greg Baker/Pool While the C919 is part of China's goal to break into the Western-dominated global aviation industry, US experts believe the new Chinese-made passenger planes pose no threat to companies like Boeing and Airbus. "Airbus and Boeing have spent decades competing fiercely against each other and are lean and mean in the airliner market. The duopoly in the airliner sector has resulted in very well-made products," Douglas Royce, an aerospace expert at Forecast International, told Xinhua. Royce also added that "it will be very difficult for COMAC to break into western markets, particularly when very few airlines have experience with using COMAC's aircraft in service." China has already been in talks with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to put C919 in foreign market. Royce believes the certification from these agencies will be a huge win for China. "The aircraft requires Western certification to compete directly with Airbus and Boeing in major markets. On a symbolic level, it also shows huge progress for China's civil aircraft industry," Royce said.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool) The Associated Press THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Friday, May 5, 2017, 8:28 AM SHANGHAI (AP) — The first large Chinese-made passenger jetliner completed its maiden test flight on Friday, a milestone in China's long-term goal to break into the Western-dominated aircraft market. The takeoff of the C919 brought cheers and applause from hundreds of invited guests at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and was broadcast live on Chinese state television. The jet soon became invisible on a windy and polluted day in Shanghai, which was also in the path of dense sandstorms from the north. After the 1 ½ hour flight was over, the test pilots came down smiling from the plane, wearing orange overalls with the Chinese flag. With the flight, the official Xinhua News Agency said China had become "one of the world's top makers of jumbo aircraft," becoming the fourth large jet producer after the U.S., Europe and Russia.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool) China is touting the C919 as a rival to single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. It was originally due to begin flying in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. It's now unlikely to carry commercial passengers until at least 2019. Mohshin Aziz, a Kuala Lumpur-based aviation analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said it wouldn't be clear for 7-9 years whether the C919 can make a dent in Airbus and Boeing's duopoly. "This is just the test flight," he said. "Eventually it needs to have some cornerstone customers, of which it will have because there are state-owned airlines, some of them are going to be forced to use it."

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool) Mohshin said other potential customers would wait to see what experience the first customers have. "You are not going to spend a lot of money on something you don't know," he said. The aircraft's maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, will seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators before making any deliveries. Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said Thursday the manufacturer planned to make two planes a year from now to 2019 to obtain proof of safe flight before any mass production is started.

(Aly Song/Pool Photo via AP) Comac says it has 570 orders from 23 domestic and foreign customers. Most are state-owned Chinese airlines. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways. The plane can be configured with 155-175 seats and has a standard flight length of 4,075 kilometers (2,530 miles). The jet's development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world's low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool) At the same time, China's aviation market is growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business. Boeing forecasts that an annual 6 percent growth in China's air passenger traffic over the next two decades will create demand for 6,810 new planes worth a total of $1 trillion — the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast. Of the new planes, 75 percent are expected to be single-aisle. Airbus has five joint ventures in China, including a factory that assembles A320s in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, that opened in 2008. Mohshin said much of China's aircraft technology started from Russia, and the Tianjin factory has since given China's supply chain vital experience.

(Greg Baker/Pool Photo via AP) "I would say that a lot of their technology mirrors Airbus," he said. Comac says more than 200 Chinese companies and 36 universities have been involved in research and development of the C919. But it relies on foreign-made technology for critical systems, including its engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aviation subsidiary and France's Safran Aircraft Engines. The first deliveries of Chinese-developed engines are expected in 2020, according to the company tasked with making them, AVIC Commercial Aircraft Engine Co. Ltd.

The plane was originally due to fly in 2014 before being delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. (AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool) Airbus delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators last year, including 141 from the A320 family, Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, said in an emailed statement. "We believe C919 will bring new competition to the market," he said. "And we welcome competition, which is good for the development of the industry." Boeing says it delivered more than 160 planes to China in 2016, and more than half of China's fleet are Boeing planes. China's first domestically made commercial jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ-21, flew its first passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight. That smaller jet is a rival to aircraft made by Bombardier Inc. of Canada and Brazil's Embraer SA. ___ AP news assistant Fu Ting in Shanghai contributed to this report. Watt reported from Beijing.

The 158-seater C919 took to the skies from Shanghai Pudong International Airport and made China the fourth jumbo jet producer after the US, Europe and Russia. The twin-engine plane departed with five crew members on board but without any passengers. The “C” in the aircraft’s name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolises “forever” in Chinese culture and 19 represents the maximum 190 seats capacity. Spectators take photos as they watch China's homegrown C919 passenger jet coming in for a landing on its maiden flight at Shanghai's Pudong airport. (REUTERS) With a standard range of 4,075 km, the narrow- body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing’s new generation 737, signalling the country’s entry into the global aviation mark, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. It also marks a milestone for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, it said. China in recent times has been making big breakthroughs in aviation with new fighter aircraft, including a stealth aircraft, but this is the first time it came out with a passenger plane. People gather around China's home-grown C919 passenger jet following its maiden flight at the Pudong International Airport in Shanghai. (REUTERS) China’s first amphibious aircraft, stated to be the largest in the world, successfully conducted its first glide test on April 29 in Chinese city of Zhuhai and braced for its maiden flight. In 2007, plans to develop a Chinese-built large passenger jet were approved by the government. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. “Engineers have completed over 118 tests and are prepared for the maiden flight,” COMAC said. The plane passed expert technical appraisal this March. People take photos in front of the Chinese C919 passenger jet after its first flight at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai on Friday. (REUTERS) COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China’s national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service. Both Airbus and Boeing have assembly plants in China considering the growing demand for new aircraft. Airbus had delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators in 2016, its seventh consecutive year of more than 100 deliveries, AirbusChina said earlier this year. A recent Boeing forecast said that China will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years at an estimated cost of $1 trillion. By the end of 2016, 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 C919 aircraft, and COMAC expects to sell at least 2,000.

Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus." At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France's Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. HARDSHIP, STRUGGLE Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won't be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC's C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometres from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term "hardship", "dedication" and "struggle" to meet the firm's goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

Image:" Reuters/China Daily China’s first large homemade passenger jet, touted as a competitor to Boeing and Airbus, made its maiden flight from Shanghai today, signalling the Communist giant’s entry into the global aviation industry. The 158-seater C919 took to the skies from Shanghai Pudong International Airport and made China the fourth jumbo jet producer after the US, Europe and Russia. The twin-engine plane departed with five crew members on board but without any passengers. The “C” in the aircraft’s name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolises “forever” in Chinese culture and 19 represents the maximum 190 seats capacity. With a standard range of 4,075 kilometres, the narrow- body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing’s new generation 737, signalling the country’s entry into the global aviation mark, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. It also marks a milestone for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, it said. China in recent times has been making big breakthroughs in aviation with new fighter aircraft, including a stealth aircraft, but this is the first time it came out with a passenger plane. China’s first amphibious aircraft, stated to be the largest in the world,successfully conducted its first glide test on April 29 in Chinese city of Zhuhai and braced for its maiden flight. In 2007, plans to develop a Chinese-built large passenger jet were approved by the government. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. “Engineers have completed over 118 tests and are prepared for the maiden flight,” COMAC said. The plane passed expert technical appraisal this March. COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China’s national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service. Both Airbus and Boeing have assembly plants in China considering the growing demand for new aircraft. Air bus had delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators in 2016, its seventh consecutive year of more than 100 deliveries,Airbus China said earlier this year. A recent Boeing forecast said that China will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years at an estimated cost of USD one trillion. By the end of 2016, 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 C919 aircraft, and COMAC expects to sell at least 2,000. China’s first regional commercial aircraft ARJ21 began commercial operation in June 2016.

(Aly Song/Pool Photo via AP) SHANGHAI (AP) — The first large Chinese-made passenger jetliner completed its maiden test flight on Friday, a milestone in China's long-term goal to break into the Western-dominated aircraft market. The takeoff of the C919 brought cheers and applause from hundreds of invited guests at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and was broadcast live on Chinese state television. The jet soon became invisible on a windy and polluted day in Shanghai, which was also in the path of dense sandstorms from the north. After the 1 ½ hour flight was over, the test pilots came down smiling from the plane, wearing orange overalls with the Chinese flag. With the flight, the official Xinhua News Agency said China had become "one of the world's top makers of jumbo aircraft," becoming the fourth large jet producer after the U.S., Europe and Russia. China is touting the C919 as a rival to single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. It was originally due to begin flying in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. It's now unlikely to carry commercial passengers until at least 2019. Mohshin Aziz, a Kuala Lumpur-based aviation analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said it wouldn't be clear for 7-9 years whether the C919 can make a dent in Airbus and Boeing's duopoly. "This is just the test flight," he said. "Eventually it needs to have some cornerstone customers, of which it will have because there are state-owned airlines, some of them are going to be forced to use it." Mohshin said other potential customers would wait to see what experience the first customers have. "You are not going to spend a lot of money on something you don't know," he said. The aircraft's maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, will seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators before making any deliveries. Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said Thursday the manufacturer planned to make two planes a year from now to 2019 to obtain proof of safe flight before any mass production is started. Comac says it has 570 orders from 23 domestic and foreign customers. Most are state-owned Chinese airlines. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways. The plane can be configured with 155-175 seats and has a standard flight length of 4,075 kilometers (2,530 miles). The jet's development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world's low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology. At the same time, China's aviation market is growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business. Boeing forecasts that an annual 6 percent growth in China's air passenger traffic over the next two decades will create demand for 6,810 new planes worth a total of $1 trillion — the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast. Of the new planes, 75 percent are expected to be single-aisle. Airbus has five joint ventures in China, including a factory that assembles A320s in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, that opened in 2008. Mohshin said much of China's aircraft technology started from Russia, and the Tianjin factory has since given China's supply chain vital experience.

"I would say that a lot of their technology mirrors Airbus," he said. Comac says more than 200 Chinese companies and 36 universities have been involved in research and development of the C919. But it relies on foreign-made technology for critical systems, including its engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aviation subsidiary and France's Safran Aircraft Engines. The first deliveries of Chinese-developed engines are expected in 2020, according to the company tasked with making them, AVIC Commercial Aircraft Engine Co. Ltd. Airbus delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators last year, including 141 from the A320 family, Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, said in an emailed statement. "We believe C919 will bring new competition to the market," he said. "And we welcome competition, which is good for the development of the industry." Boeing says it delivered more than 160 planes to China in 2016, and more than half of China's fleet are Boeing planes. China's first domestically made commercial jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ-21, flew its first passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight. That smaller jet is a rival to aircraft made by Bombardier Inc. of Canada and Brazil's Embraer SA. ___ AP news assistant Fu Ting in Shanghai contributed to this report. Watt reported from Beijing.

The C919 commercial passenger jet took to the skies on its long-delayed maiden flight today. The move is considered a major step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home. Analysts, however, say the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years.

The narrow-body jet, which will compete with Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320, soon disappeared into the clouds carrying its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. State broadcaster CCTV sent out live footage from the plane, which had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots.

"It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market." State television reported the plane's test flight would last one-and-a-half hours at a height of around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. Inside the cockpit of the C919 (Photo: Rex Features) According to aircraft tracker Flightradar24, the plane flew over the Yangtze River estuary and headed due north. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai.

The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp.

However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived.

Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how.

Without their certification, China would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. Beijing is also already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

The C919 single-aisle jet, which can hold up to 168 passengers, soured over Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered. China is one of the biggest aviation markets, but relies on foreign-made aircraft and has long sought to enter the lucrative global jet market, which is estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.  The maiden test flight had been pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues. Friday's flight included a skeleton crew of five people and carried no passengers.  #C919 took off from Shanghai Pudong Int'l Airport at 1400LT. pic.twitter.com/aIHjHqj0fY — ChinaAviationReview (@ChinaAvReview) May 5, 2017 Aviation analyst Tom Ballantyne told Al Jazeera that Friday's flight represented a "huge moment" for China. "It is important for the Chinese government to show that its industrial processes are on par with the West or are heading in that direction," he said.  C919 must 'prove itself'  While the 39-metre long plane is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as engines. The Chinese plane is touted to rival to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, but a spokesman for the aircraft's maker said it cannot compare.  "You can't compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they're in a different strategic stage ... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue [of plane development], it will also take many years to solve the second [market] problem," Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), told Reuters news agency prior to the maiden flight.    Ballantyne said it will be years before the C919 will be able to fully compete with Western-made planes.  "This Chinese aircraft will have to prove itself in operation before any Western airline will even consider purchasing it," he said. Ballantyne added that "it is very unlikely that it will be able to compete in terms of technology and economics with the new-generation aircraft" produced by of Boeing and Airbus. The C919 is meant to rival the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 [Andy Wong/AP Photo]  Hundreds of orders If Friday's maiden flight is successful, COMAC, the aircraft's maker, will seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators. COMAC has already received 570 orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese-owned carriers and leasing companies.  The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally.

But the Y-10's heavy weight made it impractical and only three were ever made. China's first domestically-made regional jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ21, flew its passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight.

Dong LyuGregory Turk China’s C919 passenger jet prepares to take off from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai on 5 May 2017. Photo: AFP Beijing/Shanghai: China’s first modern passenger jet took off on its maiden test flight, giving wings to President Xi Jinping’s ambition of turning China into an advanced economy. As onlookers cheered and clicked photos, the C919 airliner left the runway at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the home base of its builder Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The single-aisle plane, which is designed to seat as many as 174 people, is slated to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2019. The test flight, after repeated delays, marks another step in Xi’s ambitious ‘Made in China 2025’ program, which identified aerospace among sectors that could accelerate China’s advancement. The government has said the ability to build and fly a large commercial aircraft is the “flower’’ and “pearl’’ of modern manufacturing. The C919 would be the first competitor for Airbus SE and Boeing Co. in the most popular sector of the airliner market and gives Comac a home advantage in what is set to become the world’s biggest aircraft market. Boeing estimates China will need 6,810 aircraft worth more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035. “There’s a lot riding on the C919,’’ said Xu Yongling, a military test pilot and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. “The expectation for the C919 is not to become the best-selling single-aisle aircraft in the market, but rather become a stepping stone for COMAC to build something better, with indigenous technology.’’ VIP guests COMAC plans to make six of the planes for tests, and the second one is getting ready at the final assembly workshop in Shanghai, the builder said. Guests who witnessed Friday’s test flight included vice premier Ma Kai and Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary from Shanghai. The plane circled the skies around the Shanghai region after takeoff, and the test flight is slated to last for a couple of hours before the jet lands back in the city. The five people aboard the aircraft include the captain, co-pilot, a test observer and two engineers. Getting into the major league with Airbus and Boeing may be a few decades away as customers typically prefer aircraft with proven track record, reliability and safety, analysts said. COMAC is seeking certification for the C919 from European agencies. The C919 designation was chosen partly to reflect the idea of long life in Chinese numerology. With a maximum range of 3,450 miles, the plane is powered by two LEAP-1C engines from CFM International Inc., a joint venture between Safran SA and General Electric Co. Other key system suppliers include Honeywell International Inc., Rockwell Collins Inc., Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH, Thales SA and Panasonic Corp. The test flight of the plane follows China’s launch last month of its first domestically built aircraft carrier. The milestones, coming within weeks, burnish Xi’s credentials as a modernizer before he presides over the ruling Communist Party’s twice-a-decade congress later this year. Almost a billion people will fly to, from or within China by 2025, the International Air Transport Association estimates. Over the next two decades, about 75% of the jets ferrying those passengers will be single-aisle — a category dominated by Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 family. China is looking at that business and saying “Why should I stand that out? I’d like a piece of that, serving my own market,” said Jeff Rollins, vice president at Honeywell, one of the equipment suppliers to the C919. “It’s also pride. China wants to have the same industrial economic capabilities as a lot of other leading nations.” In an email, Boeing congratulated COMAC for the “successful development” of the C919, while Airbus said it welcomes competition, “which is good for the development of the industry.” COMAC, which had postponed the test flight at least twice, says it has commitments from 23 customers for about 570 planes, with Shanghai-based China Eastern lined up to take the first delivery. The company estimates the market potential for the plane would be as much as ¥650 billion ($94 billion). Next aircraft Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers. “At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,” he said. “First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday’s technology.” COMAC has set its sights on building a wide-body aircraft. It is forming a joint venture with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. to develop a twin-aisle jet that can fly as far as 7,450 miles –- roughly the distance between Beijing and New York –- and can seat 280 people. The planemaker is targeting the first test flight in 2023 and delivery three years later. “The C919 is a testament to China’s civil aviation research and manufacturing capability,” said Yu Zhanfu, executive director at Roland Berger Management Consultants Shanghai Co. “China’s had a lot of success in making rockets, making spaceships. It shows the country is capable of mega tech-intensive manufacturing projects.” Bloomberg Dong LyuGregory Turk Topics: China C919 Test Flight Comac Boeing More From Livemint READ MORE Jammu and Kashmir: Army arrests 12-year-old PoK boy along LoC in Rajouri Suspended from AAP, Amanatullah Khan made Delhi assembly panel chief NEET 2017 exam: Madras HC asks MCI to consider ‘plus 2’ marks too for medical admission First Published: Fri, May 05 2017. 01 50 PM IST Editor's Picks The politics and positioning of Priyanka Chopra Why you can never leave the WhatsApp family group Onus on RBI as govt notifies new rules to tackle NPAs of banks Latest News Jammu and Kashmir: Army arrests 12-year-old PoK boy along LoC in Rajouri Suspended from AAP, Amanatullah Khan made Delhi assembly panel chief NEET 2017 exam: Madras HC asks MCI to consider ‘plus 2’ marks too for medical admission Emmanuel Macron campaign hacked as France prepares for Sunday election Tughlakabad gas leak: 85 students hospitalised, Delhi govt orders probe Mint On Sunday The private lives of Delhi’s LGBT youth Getting Justin Bieber to India is very, very hard work 2003 World Cup final: If only India had chosen to bat first...

May 06, 2017 0659 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:192140 Publish Date: Fri, 05 May 2017 13:13:18 GMT Service: Iran China's first large passenger jet is now airborne China's first large jetliner has taken off on its maiden flight, a key moment in the country's push to challenge the US and Europe as a global manufacturer. According to cnn.com, the C919, China's first domestically designed and built large airliner, took off from Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 2:01 p.m. local time on Friday with a five-person crew aboard.  With the prototype airborne, China joins the ranks of the few nations that have developed homegrown large airliners: The US, Russia, Brazil, Canada, the UK, France and Germany. Made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the 168-seat C919 is roughly the same size as Airbus's A320 and Boeing's 737-800, which are the most popular airliners in the world. The takeoff in Shanghai on Friday afternoon was watched by people around the globe, including at least 2 million on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo.   Comac also offered an unprecedented look inside the maiden flight of a new airliner. The company streamed live images from the jet's cockpit looking over the shoulder of its test pilots as they performed gentle maneuvers off the coast. Neither Boeing nor Airbus has ever provided a live view of the cockpit on a first flight. The Chinese jet's first flight is the biggest and most visible milestone in its development. But it still has a long way to go before it's carrying passengers and competing with its US and European competitors. The start of aerial testing kicks off months or years of grueling certification tests, and meeting safety standards might require design changes. Comac will also need to win the trust of airlines in China and elsewhere by proving the jet can operate efficiently and reliably on scheduled flights. However, the milestone marks another key achievement for China on its ascent to challenging the west and cultivating its aerospace ambitions. The country is already an adept designer of military aircraft, but has sought to catch up to Boeing in the US and Airbus in Europe in manufacturing civilian airliners. The C919 prototype was unveiled in November 2015.   So far it's been slow-going. The country's state-owned airlines first signed up to buy the jet in 2010, and it was originally supposed to enter service in 2016. The prototype wasn't unveiled until November 2015, and the project has been beset by technical delays as China learns the ropes of airliner development.

The C919, China’s first domestically designed and built large airliner, took off Friday afternoon from Shanghai Pudong International Airport into hazy skies with a five-person crew aboard. The jet landed one hour and 19 minutes later after a seemingly uneventful first trial. With the flight, China joins the ranks of the few nations that have developed homegrown large airliners: the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany. Made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the 168-seat C919 is roughly the same size as Airbus’s A320 and Boeing’s 737-800, which are the most popular airliners in the world. The C919’s maiden flight was watched by people around the globe, including at least 2 million on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo. Comac also offered an unprecedented look inside the maiden flight of a new airliner. The company streamed live images from the jet’s cockpit looking over the shoulder of its test pilots as they performed gentle maneuvers off the coast. Neither Boeing nor Airbus has ever provided a live view of the cockpit on a first flight. The Chinese jet’s first flight is the biggest and most visible milestone in its development. But it still has a long way to go before it’s carrying passengers and competing with its U.S. and European competitors. The start of aerial testing kicks off months or years of grueling certification tests, and meeting safety standards might require design changes. Comac will also need to win the trust of airlines in China and elsewhere by proving the jet can operate efficiently and reliably on scheduled flights. However, the milestone marks another key achievement for China on its ascent to challenging the west and cultivating its aerospace ambitions. The country is already an adept designer of military aircraft, but has sought to catch up to Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in Europe in manufacturing civilian airliners. So far it’s been slow-going. The country’s state-owned airlines first signed up to buy the jet in 2010, and it was originally supposed to enter service in 2016. The prototype wasn’t unveiled until November 2015, and the project has been beset by technical delays as China learns the ropes of airliner development. Comac, a state-run enterprise, has partnered with western suppliers for nearly all the jet’s major systems to share technology and learn how to mass produce an airliner. The C919’s main customers will be China’s domestic airlines. China Eastern Airlines will be the first carrier to operate the C919 when it completes testing and secures approval from China’s aviation regulator. China is on track to surpass the U.S. by 2030 as the world’s largest commercial aviation market. Chinese airlines are buying hundreds of Boeing and Airbus jets to grow their fleets. Boeing estimates that the country will need a trillion dollars worth of new airplanes over the next two decades, including more than 5,100 of the same size as the C919.

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 5 May 2017 | MYT 3:42 PM C919 jet takes off on maiden flight, to test China's aviation ambitions by jackie caiandadam jourdan SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's home-grown C919 passenger jet took to the skies on its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home. The white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, sped along the tarmac at Shanghai's international airport and lifted off under overcast skies in front of thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The narrow-body jet, which will compete with Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320, soon disappeared into the clouds carrying its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. State broadcaster CCTV sent out live footage from the plane, which had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "The significance is huge, it's the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China," Xiong Yuexi, a plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing said ahead of the launch. "It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market." State television reported the plane's test flight would last one-and-a-half hours at a height of around 3,000 metres and at a speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. According to aircraft tracker Flightradar24, the plane flew over the Yangtze River estuary and headed due north. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL], has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. Analysts, however, say the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp. JUST THE START Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators. Without their certification, China would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. Beijing is also already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

(Photo: AP) NEW DELHI: Even as China says it has 570 orders for its homemade jet which made its maiden flight today, its state media is downplaying, by a great extent, expectations of its success. "China-made C919 no challenge to Boeing, Airbus dominance", is the headline to an article published by China's official news agency Xinhua. The C919, which is what China calls the passenger jet, landed successfully in Shanghai after an 80-minute maiden flight earlier today. The jet is a single-aisled, two-engine plane with 158 seats. The C919's manufacturer, Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), says 23 foreign and domestic customers have placed orders for as many as 570 aircraft. "But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success...Shaking the dominance of aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say," the Xinhua article said. And while the C919 is ready for make its maiden flight, "it may take much longer for the newcomer to take off in the aviation market," the Xinhua article added. An article in China Daily, another news outlet from the state-run stable, is slightly, but only slightly, more positive about the C919. It quotes an analyst as first saying that C919 "could have the opportunity to break the monopolies of Boeing and Airbus", which have a duopoly in the global market. Then it mentions the caveat. "Despite the promising future" the article quotes Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst a saying "the C919's entry to the market won't occur soon. The date it goes into operation is expected to be between 2020 and 2022." Boeing last year said China is expected to become the world's top aviation market in 20 years, with a projected demand for 6,810 new aircraft over that time. And 75 percent of that demand is for single aisle planes like the 'Made in China' C919. That is, China will need 5,110 single aisle planes - like the C919 - through 2035. The C919 is in the same category of the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737. Xinhua's article went as far as to say that the maker of the C919 - despite touting the 'Made in China' aspect of the jet - should seek help. "Boeing and Airbus are very mature aircraft manufacturers, and COMAC should seek further cooperation with them to learn from their experiences, according to aviation analysts," Xinhua wrote.

The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Amid cheers from onlookers, the C919 airliner took off Friday from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the home base of its builder Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The jet landed back about an hour and 19 minutes later after cruising at 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The single-aisle plane, which is designed to seat as many as 174 people, is slated to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2019. “It shows China made a historic breakthrough in its years-old dream of building a big aircraft,” Comac said in a statement, calling the test a “complete success.” The nation’s State Council, the top administrative authority, sent a congratulatory note to the designers. QuickTake Will ‘Made in China’ Threaten Boeing and Airbus? The test flight, after repeated delays, marks another step in Xi’s ambitious ‘Made in China 2025’ program, which identified aerospace among sectors that could accelerate China’s advancement. The government has said the ability to build and fly a large commercial aircraft is the “flower’’ and “pearl’’ of modern manufacturing.  The C919 would be the first major competitor for Airbus SE and Boeing Co. in the most popular sector of the airliner market and gives Comac a home advantage in what is set to become the world’s biggest aircraft market. Boeing estimates China will need 6,810 aircraft worth more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035. “There’s a lot riding on the C919,’’ said Xu Yongling, a military test pilot and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. “The expectation for the C919 is not to become the best-selling single-aisle aircraft in the market, but rather become a stepping stone for COMAC to build something better, with indigenous technology.’’ VIP Guests COMAC plans to make six planes for tests, and the second one is getting ready at the final assembly workshop in Shanghai, the builder said. Guests who witnessed Friday’s test flight included Vice Premier Ma Kai and Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary from Shanghai. The five people on board the test plane were the captain, co-pilot, an observer and two engineers. Getting into the major league with Airbus and Boeing may be a few decades away as customers typically prefer aircraft with proven track record, reliability and safety, analysts said. COMAC is seeking certification for the C919 from European agencies. “Comac could well be an option for us,” said William Walsh, chief executive officer of IAG SA, the owner of British Airways Plc, adding he’d only seriously consider the plane when IAG reviews its existing fleet of short-haul Airbus A320-family jets in the long-term. More immediately, he’s expecting lower prices from the added competition. Walsh, a former pilot who’s flown in the plane’s simulator, said he’s due to meet with Comac next month to further advise on features that IAG looks for in a new model.  “A new entrant will have an impact on pricing,” Walsh told analysts on a call Friday. “We’ve seen that to some degree with the launch of the CSeries. It’s something that both airlines and the manufacturers are aware of.” The C919 designation was chosen partly to reflect the idea of long life in Chinese numerology. With a maximum range of 3,450 miles, the plane is powered by two LEAP-1C engines from CFM International Inc., a joint venture between Safran SA and General Electric Co. Other key system suppliers include Honeywell International Inc., Rockwell Collins Inc., Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH, Thales SA and Panasonic Corp.

The milestones, coming within weeks, burnish Xi’s credentials as a modernizer before he presides over the ruling Communist Party’s twice-a-decade congress later this year. Airplane enthusiasts watch. Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg Almost a billion people will fly to, from or within China by 2025, the International Air Transport Association estimates. Over the next two decades, about 75 percent of the jets ferrying those passengers will be single-aisle -- a category dominated by Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’s A320 family. To read David Fickling’s column on the C919, click here. In an email, Boeing congratulated Comac for the “successful development” of the C919, while Airbus said it welcomes competition, “which is good for the development of the industry.” Comac, which had postponed the test flight at least twice, says it has commitments from 23 customers for about 570 planes, with Shanghai-based China Eastern lined up to take the first delivery. Next Aircraft Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers. “At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,” he said. “First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday’s technology.”  Comac has set its sights on building a wide-body aircraft. It is forming a joint venture with Russia’s United Aircraft Corp. to develop a twin-aisle jet. The Comac Shanghai Research and Development Center in Shanghai.

It shows the country is capable of mega tech-intensive manufacturing projects.” — With assistance by Dong Lyu, and Gregory Turk Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The C919, a twin-engine airliner designed to compete with the Airbus 320 and Boeing 737, took off from Shanghai’s Pudong International airport just after 2pm on Friday and landed back there again 80 minutes later. The symbolic flight, which the government has celebrated as further evidence of China’s rise, was broadcast live on state-controlled television. 'I am Fan Yusu': China gripped by Dickensian tale of a migrant worker's struggle Read more “Today this is it! We have witnessed the successful takeoff!” said Yang Chengxi, a reporter for state-broadcaster CGTN, as the single-aisle jet powered into the skies over China’s financial capital. The jet is the work of the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), a state-run company founded in 2008 with the specific mission of producing the country’s first commercially viable passenger jet – something Chairman Mao tried but failed to achieve during the 1970s. Several of the plane’s key components are imported – the C919 features German landing gear, Franco-American engines and an Austrian interior – and one aviation analyst told Bloomberg the manufacturer’s claims to have produced a genuinely made-in-China jet were questionable. Nevertheless, the C919’s 79-minute debut was greeted with an outpouring of patriotism and pride. “I am very happy and proud to see the takeoff. It is very beautiful – a very smooth takeoff,” Fu Song, a Tsinghua University engineer who was involved in the project, told CGTN. “We are very proud to see that it worked.” ChinaAviationReview (@ChinaAvReview) #C919 took off from Shanghai Pudong Int'l Airport at 1400LT. pic.twitter.com/aIHjHqj0fY May 5, 2017 In an allusion to President Xi Jinping’s key political slogan, state media celebrated the flight as “another fulfilment of a Chinese dream”. A presenter on CGTN read out viewers’ messages of support. “These days China can make anything,” said one. “It’s awesome!” Gu Bin, an aviation expert from China’s Aviation Industry Cooperation, a state-run aerospace firm, predicted the aircraft would “rip a hole” in the duopoly enjoyed by Airbus and Boeing. America owes China $1tn. That’s a problem for Beijing, and Trump knows it Read more “For many years our country has been trying to do this, and we failed. Now, [the C919] can be compared to mainstream large passenger jets such as the Boeing 737 and the Airbus 320 in terms of its capacity and its technology and, to some extent, is even better than the latter,” he said. “I see a bright future for the C919 and its manufacturer.” In his book about China’s aviation revolution, The Dragon Takes Flight, Derek Levine described the C919 as part of an intense government attempt to show its citizens that their country possessed and could produce the world’s most advanced technology. The Communist party believed the “development of a large passenger aircraft would help wither emotional scars that linger in the mind of the Chinese people following the Century of Humiliation it suffered at the hands of the west”, Levine argued. He said the C919 had been created to help China “reclaim its status as a great power by developing indigenous innovation”. The decision was also a commercial one, with Beijing hoping to reclaim a slice of its lucrative domestic aviation market from foreign companies. Last year Boeing predicted that Chinese airlines would spend more than $1tn on new planes over the next two decades, including more than 6,800 aircraft, the majority being single-aisle planes. By 2024 China is expected to overtake the US as the world’s largest aviation market. Before the debut flight, Comac said it had received orders for 570 C919s from 23 different customers. Xinhua, China’s official news agency, said that while the plane would initially struggle to compete with “very mature aircraft manufacturers”, such as Airbus and Boeing, it “should do well in the Chinese market”. Levine said China would make its state-owned airlines purchase the C919, meaning it “might be harmful to current commercial aircraft producers, Airbus and Boeing”.

The C919, built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), was set to take wing over Shanghai on Friday, the company said on Wednesday, according to the official Xinhua news agency. “If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled,” COMAC said, adding that engineers had completed some 118 tests. The narrow-body jet represents nearly a decade of effort in a state-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. “The first flight itself is not a huge deal. (But) of course, it’s going to be a hugely symbolic moment in the evolution of China’s aviation industry,” said Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor at industry publication Flightglobal. The C919 is the country’s first big passenger plane and the latest sign of growing Chinese ambition and technical skill, coming one week after China launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. The C919 can seat 168 passengers and has a range of 5,555 kilometres. China is a huge battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers. The Chinese travel market is expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus has estimated Chinese airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes over the next two decades, while Boeing foresees 6,800 aircraft. Both put the combined price tags for those planes at around $1 trillion. But aviation analysts said Shanghai-based COMAC has a long journey ahead before it can challenge the lock on the market by Boeing and Airbus. “This is an important milestone for China with this new aircraft. But for it to move to the next stage, which is to sell this product, is not going to be so easy,” said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. But COMAC may be able to rely on purchases by fast-growing Chinese airlines. It had already received 570 orders by the end of last year, almost all from domestic airlines. — AFP About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Shell profits surge on rebounding oil Apple starting US tech manufacturing fund with $1 billion → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Summer or winter, come to Jabal Akhdhar New solar plane eyes edge of space Furore over Mediterranean migrant rescues, deaths Venezuela protests claim 36 lives Read More ...

The maiden flight of the C919 is scheduled for May 5. The flight will depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport. "If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled," COMAC said. (Xinhua/Ding Ting) BEIJING, May 4 -- While the much-awaited first Chinese-built passenger jet C919 is ready to make its maiden flight Friday, it may take much longer for the newcomer to take off in the aviation market. Shaking the dominance of aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come. Scheduled to depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on May 5, the C919, with 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737. A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success. Currently, Chinese airlines seem to be more keen to spend money on wide-body aircraft to enhance their global routes with rising enthusiasm for overseas travel. Those jets are still the exclusive province of Boeing and Airbus. China Eastern Airlines signed contracts in 2016 to buy 20 A350-900 aircraft from Airbus and 15 B787-9 aircraft from Boeing to be delivered between 2018 and 2022. China Southern Airlines announced in April that it will buy 20 A350-900 with a total catalog price of nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars. Boeing and Airbus are very mature aircraft manufacturers, and COMAC should seek further cooperation with them to learn from their experiences, according to aviation analysts. But looking ahead, single-aisle planes like C919 will be the market mainstream and COMAC should do well in the Chinese market, one of the most competitive. Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for 6,810 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars. China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to Boeing. The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field being economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities. If the maiden flight is successful, COMAC will seek airworthiness certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries. Also, to pave way for C919 to enter foreign markets, the airworthiness certification of the jet will be a part of bilateral air safety agreement talks between China and the EU. China has invested heavily in commercial passenger jet manufacturing. In 2007, plans to develop a domestic large passenger jet were approved by the State Council. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. The ARJ21, the country's first regional aircraft also produced by COMAC, began commercial operations in June 2016 following its maiden flight in 2008.

United Airlines on Wednesday inaugurated a three-times-weekly nonstop service from the U.S. West Coast city San Francisco to the southeast Chinese city of Hangzhou. (Xinhua/Huang Zongzhi) WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. experts said Thursday China's new passenger planes pose no immediate threat to Western aviation companies such as Boeing and Airbus. The maiden flight of China's C919 passenger plane, scheduled for Friday from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, represents one step towards the country's bid to reduce reliance on foreign airliners. "The Chinese government is interested in establishing independence and self-sufficiency in all aspects of aviation," Douglas Royce, an aerospace expert at Forecast International, an aerospace market research firm, told Xinhua. It is engaged in a long-term process of catching up to Europe, the United States, and Russia in commercial aircraft, he said, adding this is one step in that direction. The 158-seat C919 is China's first large passenger jet and is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737. So far, 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircrafts, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the manufacturer of the C919. Royce predicted that demand for the C919 will be centered in the Chinese market and a few satellite markets in the early years of service. "Airbus and Boeing have spent decades competing fiercely against each other and are lean and mean in the airliner market. The duopoly in the airliner sector has resulted in very well-made products," he explained. "What COMAC faces here is not two bloated, non-competitive players. Both companies are at the top of their game," Royce said. "So it will be very difficult for COMAC to break into western markets, particularly when very few airlines have experience with using COMAC's aircraft in service." In contrast, the A320 and 737 have huge advantages because the airlines already have built up a lot of knowledge and infrastructure around flying both types. Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group Corp., a U.S.-based aeronautics analysis firm, held a similar view. While building and flying a plane is an important step and an expensive one, the next steps such as customer support, finance, and the ability to offer aggressive discounts are "just as important, and just as expensive," he told Xinhua. Even if the C919 ends up being a superior aircraft, it will still take years for many Western airlines to consider adding the type to their fleets, Royce noted. But he added that the C919 might be able to get orders from startup airlines that aren't already flying either of the Western models. In addition, traditional customers of Russian passenger aircraft will also make viable sales targets. To pave the way for the jet to enter foreign market, China has already been in talks with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to obtain the airworthiness certification for the C919. "Getting FAA and EASA certification would be a huge win for the program," Royce said. "The aircraft requires Western certification to compete directly with Airbus and Boeing in major markets. On a symbolic level, it also shows huge progress for China's civil aircraft industry." However, he cautioned that certification is "a long and expensive process" for aircraft manufacturers in the U.S. and that for a newcomer like COMAC, dealing with the FAA is "a new world for them." Aboulafia said while certification is necessary, it "has no impact on commercial competitiveness." Meanwhile, COMAC estimated that it can sell 2,000 C919s over the next 20 years, but Royce said it's "way too optimistic." "An estimate of 600-800 C919s over 20 years once production starts is a more reasonable goal given the very strong competition offered by Boeing and Airbus, coupled with Chinese-made airliners' lack of a long-term operating and maintenance history," he said. "A COMAC-built airliner has no track record in either area, and it will take a long time for the aircraft manufacturer to establish itself as the equal of Airbus and Boeing in the area of global sales and product support." However, over the very long term, Royce said, COMAC is likely to become "a major player in the airline segment." "It's not something that will happen over the next decade, but rather a long-term process that will require ongoing support from the Chinese government," he said. When asked to comment on the C919, a spokesman for Boeing told Xinhua: "We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate COMAC for the successful development of the C919 airplane."

BEIJING: China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet is set to take to the skies on its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major step for Beijing as it looks to boost its profile in the global aviation market. The narrow-body aircraft, which will compete with Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus A320, is a key symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion over the next 20 years. The jet will take to the skies at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on China’s affluent east coast, at a ceremony expected to be broadcast live on state TV. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. “The significance is huge, it’s the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China,” said Xiong Yuexi, a professor and plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing. “It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market.” China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. Analysts, however, say the production delays mean the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric’s aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran, supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp. Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years,” said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and US regulators. Without their certification, China would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. Beijing is also already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

(Photo: Greg Baker / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Shanghai — The first large Chinese-made passenger jetliner completed its maiden test flight on Friday, a milestone in China’s long-term goal to break into the Western-dominated aircraft market. The takeoff of the C919 brought cheers and applause from hundreds of invited guests at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and was broadcast live on Chinese state television. The jet soon became invisible on a windy and polluted day in Shanghai, which was also in the path of dense sandstorms from the north. After the 1 ½ hour flight was over, the test pilots came down smiling from the plane, wearing orange overalls with the Chinese flag. With the flight, the official Xinhua News Agency said China had become “one of the world’s top makers of jumbo aircraft,” becoming the fourth large jet producer after the U.S., Europe and Russia. China is touting the C919 as a rival to single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. It was originally due to begin flying in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. It’s now unlikely to carry commercial passengers until at least 2019. Mohshin Aziz, a Kuala Lumpur-based aviation analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said it wouldn’t be clear for 7-9 years whether the C919 can make a dent in Airbus and Boeing’s duopoly. “This is just the test flight,” he said. “Eventually it needs to have some cornerstone customers, of which it will have because there are state-owned airlines, some of them are going to be forced to use it.” Mohshin said other potential customers would wait to see what experience the first customers have. “You are not going to spend a lot of money on something you don’t know,” he said. The jet’s development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world’s low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology. At the same time, China’s aviation market is growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business. Boeing forecasts an annual 6 percent growth in China’s air passenger traffic over the next two decades will create demand for 6,810 new planes worth a total of $1 trillion — the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast. Of the new planes, 75 percent are expected to be single-aisle. Airbus has five joint ventures in China, including a factory that assembles A320s in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, that opened in 2008. Mohshin said much of China’s aircraft technology started from Russia, and the Tianjin factory has since given China’s supply chain vital experience. “I would say that a lot of their technology mirrors Airbus,” he said.

The white, green and blue aircraft, with “C919” emblazoned on its tail, sped along the tarmac at Shanghai’s international airport and lifted off under overcast skies in front of thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The narrow-body jet, which will compete with Boeing’s 737 and the Airbus A320, soon disappeared into the clouds carrying its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. State broadcaster CCTV sent out live footage from the plane, which had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. The jet is a symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as Beijing’s broader “Made in China 2025” plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. “The significance is huge, it’s the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China,” Xiong Yuexi, a plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing said ahead of the launch. “It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market.” State television reported the plane’s test flight would last one-and-a-half hours at a height of around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. According to aircraft tracker Flightradar24, the plane flew over the Yangtze River estuary and headed due north. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. Analysts, however, say the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric’s aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp. Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 per cent of the aircraft in service worldwide. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Goldman’s Blankfein says London could stall due to Brexit Influence of English is fading, says EU chief → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Summer or winter, come to Jabal Akhdhar New solar plane eyes edge of space Furore over Mediterranean migrant rescues, deaths Venezuela protests claim 36 lives Read More ...

China’s first-ever domestically designed and built civilian airliner took its maiden flight Thursday in a watershed moment for the country’s aviation industry and new competitor to Western giants that have the market cornered. On Friday, a crowd of some 3,000 Chinese officials and industry execs gathered at the Shanghai airport to watch the test flight of the C919, China’s answer to the Boeing-737 and Airbus-320, the workhorse planes for global airlines. The C919 landed safely after an hour-long test flight, marking a major milestone in China’s long-term ambition to crack into the global civilian airline market. Built by state-owned aircraft corporation Comac, the C919 is designed to seat 155-175 with a range of 2,530 miles. U.S.-based Boeing and Europe-based Airbus Group have in essence dominated that market from the beginning, but Western executives may not be sweating the C919 just yet. The Chinese project was riddled with technical problems and delays from the outset (the test flight Friday was originally scheduled for three years ago) and it relies heavily on foreign technologies to function. Comac also still hasn’t proven itself capable of producing high quality planes that can pass toptier Western safety inspections on part with the Boeing-Airbus duopoly. Comac announced it’s already received 570 orders from 23 customers, but nearly every sale comes from Chinese companies. (The plane also has one U.S. buyer: General Electric Capital Aviation Services, a supplier to the C919 program, ordered 20 planes from Comac.) And that’s a small drop in the bucket compared to Boeing, which can roll out 400-500 Boeing 737’s a year. Still, industry experts agree Boeing and Airbus are watching Comac with a wary eye. The International Air Transport Association estimates China will overtake the United States as the world’s top aviation market by 2024. Over the next 20 years, the IATA forecasts there will be an additional 817 million passengers from China alone, making it the world’s fastest growing market. And Comac has the home-field advantage.

The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots.   "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. "I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus."   At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe.   On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 metres and at speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour.   The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight.   A letter from China's ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly.   The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France's Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers.   Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. "Every year we spend billions on buying planes," a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant.   However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year.   Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how.

Business Home LBoard Beached whale near Miri saved by villagers thanks to Whatsapp FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US With maiden jet flight, China enters dog-fight with Boeing, Airbus Reuters | May 6, 2017 The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. SHANGHAI: China’s home-grown C919 passenger jet completed its long-delayed maiden flight on Friday, a major first step for Beijing as it looks to raise its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech manufacturing at home. Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with “C919” emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai’s international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China’s ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing’s broader “Made in China 2025” plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. “Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time,” Wang Mingfeng, 42, who witnessed the maiden flight at the Shanghai airport, told Reuters. “I believe that in the not too distant future, we will be neck-and-neck with Boeing and Airbus.” At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know-how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. On Friday, the C919 flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000 meters and at speeds of 290-300 kilometers (180-186 miles) per hour. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jump suits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158-168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China’s ministerial cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a “major breakthrough” and milestone for China’s passenger jet industry. The industry ministry said in a statement the flight went smoothly and that all the systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric, France’s Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. Hardship, struggle Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50% of the aircraft in service worldwide. “Every year we spend billions on buying planes,” a COMAC promotional video showed President Xi Jinping saying during a site visit. He added China should become more self-reliant. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China’s first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years,” said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is aware the path won’t be easy. On a media visit on Thursday to COMAC’s C919 assembly plant less than 10 kilometers from the airport, large red banners could be seen in giant hangars calling for long-term “hardship”, “dedication” and “struggle” to meet the firm’s goals. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and US regulators as without their certification, it would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. But Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Lawyers decide not to seek resignation from PM 06-May-17 378 ISLAMABAD: The legal fraternit ... SHANGHAI: The first large made-in-China passenger plane successfully completed its maiden test flight Friday, marking a key milestone on the country's ambitious journey to compete with the world's leading aircraft makers. The narrow-body C919 jet -- white with green and blue stripes -- disappeared into the clouds after taking off from Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered, including top officials. It successfully landed some 80 minutes later and the five-member crew was handed flowers, with captain Cai Jun describing the flight as "very satisfactory." Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. "China's big commercial jet project made a huge breakthrough. It is a major milestone of China's aviation market," China's State Council said in a statement. State media said the plane flew at an altitude of around 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of more than 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. While delayed since last year, the flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet's production facility: "Accelerate the construction of the world's top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry." China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country's travel market expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around $1 trillion. Both companies congratulated COMAC on the flight. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for "everlasting", can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles) and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. COMAC made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co., COMAC's production arm. The Shanghai-based firm aims to become one of the world's leading civil aircraft manufacturer in the next three years, seeking to have the C919 and its ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet, both certified to fly internationally. But it will be sometime before the C919 is ready to compete with the top-selling products of the world's aviation giants, said Bao. "The biggest challenge is that the whole manufacturing experience still needs improvement because this is the first time China is making a primary route plane," Bao said. The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification and COMAC hopes to get the green light from US and European regulators. The ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. Another challenge for the C919 is earning consumers' trust, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "It will take some time for customers around the world to be comfortable buying Chinese airplanes," he said, adding, "it's not going to happen in the next 10 years."

As the plane smoothly landed in Pudong Airport after a 90-minute flight, the flight crew, wearing orange uniforms with the Chinese national flag sewn over the heart, emerged from the cockpit to applause. The captain, Cai Jun, told a reporter that the plane functioned very well and he would give the maiden flight a grade of 99 out of 100, “to be modest.” Jin Zhuanglong, the chairman of Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) and chief commander of the C919 project, claimed that flying a homemade passenger plane is a “state will and national dream;” the success marks “a milestone in China’s civil aviation industry.”Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month. The C919 plane, according to the official Xinhua News Agency, owns independent intellectual property rights for the design. Although the airplane’s engine is from foreign manufacturers, the plane’s shell — body, tail, wing — and many other fragments were made in China. Even the name was carefully crafted: “C” stands for China as well as COMAC; the first “9” means “forever,” since the word for “nine” sounds like “forever” in Chinese; and the “19” represents the fact that the plane can host 190 passengers. China has high hopes for C919. The country has desired to enter the global civil aviation market and become on par with Boeing and Airbus for a long time. As early as 2005, Bo Xilai, then the Minister of Commerce, told the Europeans at a Sino-French seminar in Paris, “Because of the low profit margins of Chinese textile products, China needs to export 800 million shirts in order to buy one Airbus A380.” The comparison was immediately widely reported in China. Even now, after Bo himself ended up in prison in 2013 for a huge political scandal and his own name has become taboo in Chinese media, his famous phrase of “800 million shirts for one plane” is quoted again and again. After the maiden flight, many Chinese netizens exclaimed that the era of “800 million shirts for one plane” was over. In 2007, Wen Jiabao,  the incumbent premier, (and later to be Bo’s political rival later), approved the grand project of making China’s own passenger planes and agreed to form the large passenger plane company,  COMAC. Wen emphasized on the importance of the project on numerous occasions as well: To have China’s passenger aircraft flying in the blue sky is the will of both the state and the people. We must make this matter a success and achieve the dream of generations. This is not only the need of the aviation industry, but also the need of building an innovative nation. The development of passenger aircraft will lead to a number of technological upgrades in various major areas. It is obvious that Wen’s words laid the foundation for current official statements. Up till now, 23 airlines and financial companies, mostly from China, have ordered 570 C919 planes from COMAC. Although the plane still needs years of testing before it will fully enter the market, China’s longstanding ambition is already half-realized, at least in the Chinese people’s mind.

The "Dream Jet", operated by the Chinese HNA Group's subsidiary Deer Jet, is a 2,400 square foot home for high rollers at high altitude. A Boeing 787-7 Dreamliner, it reportedly cost $100 million to fit out on top of the $225m purchase price. The interior is so specialised that it took a year to engineer and a further year and half to manufacture and install after the aircraft rolled off the Boeing production line. It can accommodate up to 40 passengers in its fuselage, which was originally designed for more than 335 people. Facilities include a master bedroom with double bed, a master bathroom complete with shower and double vanity unit, four kitchens, a main lounge with couches, a dining table and flat screen TVs, as well as a guest cabin with lie-flat seats for up to 18 people. The aircraft flies at Mach 0.85 and has a range of up to 17.5 hours or 9,800 miles, meaning it can reach pretty much any location in the world non-stop. Deer Jet is currently travelling around the world showing off the aircraft before it starts to lease it out. The cost of renting it is €66,000 an hour. However, the company is going to run exclusive packages which will enable customers to travel long-distance and then stay in luxury hotels for a set period. The interior is state of the art, with electronically moved furniture, electric window blinds controlled by tablet. The cabin pressure is set at an altitude of 6,000ft, lower than normal, in order to reduce the effects of jet lag, and the flight crew can add humidity to the air to stop it getting too dry.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Spectators watch as a Chinese C919 passenger jet taxis for take-off on its first flight at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, Friday, May 5, 2017. (AP Photo) The first Chinese-built large passenger jet began its maiden flight in Shanghai on Friday, marking an important milestone in China's quest to enter a commercial aircraft market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. The C919 aircraft took off from Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, according to state broadcaster CGTN. The aircraft, which will be fitted with 158 to 174 seats, was developed by state-owned company Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), to compete with the Airbus 320 and Boeing 737 models. The plane was originally due to fly in 2014 before being delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. If the maiden flight is successful, the aircraft's maker Comac will then seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators before making any deliveries. Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said Thursday the manufacturer planned to make two planes a year from now to 2019 to obtain proof of safe flight, before any mass production would be started. Comac says it has 570 orders, mostly from state-owned Chinese airlines. A total of 23 domestic and foreign customers have placed orders. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways. The jet's development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world's low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology. Comac says more than 200 Chinese companies and 36 universities have been involved in the research and development of the aircraft. But it also relies on foreign-made technology for critical systems, including its engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aviation subsidiary and France's Safran Aircraft Engines. The first deliveries of Chinese-developed engines are expected in 2020, according to the company tasked with making them, AVIC Commercial Aircraft Engine Co. Ltd. China's first domestically made jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ-21, flew its passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight. That smaller jet is a rival to aircraft made by Bombardier Inc. of Canada and Brazil's Embraer SA.

The takeoff of the C919 brought cheers and applause from hundreds of invited guests at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and was broadcast live on Chinese state television. The jet soon became invisible on a windy and polluted day in Shanghai, which was also in the path of dense sandstorms from the north. After the 1 ½ hour flight was over, the test pilots came down smiling from the plane, wearing orange overalls with the Chinese flag. With the flight, the official Xinhua News Agency said China had become "one of the world's top makers of jumbo aircraft," becoming the fourth large jet producer after the U.S., Europe and Russia. China is touting the C919 as a rival to single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. It was originally due to begin flying in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. It's now unlikely to carry commercial passengers until at least 2019. Mohshin Aziz, a Kuala Lumpur-based aviation analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said it wouldn't be clear for 7-9 years whether the C919 can make a dent in Airbus and Boeing's duopoly. "This is just the test flight," he said. "Eventually it needs to have some cornerstone customers, of which it will have because there are state-owned airlines, some of them are going to be forced to use it." Mohshin said other potential customers would wait to see what experience the first customers have. "You are not going to spend a lot of money on something you don't know," he said. The aircraft's maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, will seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators before making any deliveries. Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said Thursday the manufacturer planned to make two planes a year from now to 2019 to obtain proof of safe flight before any mass production is started. Comac says it has 570 orders from 23 domestic and foreign customers. Most are state-owned Chinese airlines. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways. The plane can be configured with 155-175 seats and has a standard flight length of 4,075 kilometers (2,530 miles). The jet's development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world's low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology. At the same time, China's aviation market is growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business. Boeing forecasts that an annual 6 percent growth in China's air passenger traffic over the next two decades will create demand for 6,810 new planes worth a total of $1 trillion — the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast. Of the new planes, 75 percent are expected to be single-aisle. Airbus has five joint ventures in China, including a factory that assembles A320s in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, that opened in 2008. Mohshin said much of China's aircraft technology started from Russia, and the Tianjin factory has since given China's supply chain vital experience. "I would say that a lot of their technology mirrors Airbus," he said. Comac says more than 200 Chinese companies and 36 universities have been involved in research and development of the C919. But it relies on foreign-made technology for critical systems, including its engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aviation subsidiary and France's Safran Aircraft Engines. The first deliveries of Chinese-developed engines are expected in 2020, according to the company tasked with making them, AVIC Commercial Aircraft Engine Co. Ltd. Airbus delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators last year, including 141 from the A320 family, Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, said in an emailed statement. "We believe C919 will bring new competition to the market," he said. "And we welcome competition, which is good for the development of the industry." Boeing says it delivered more than 160 planes to China in 2016, and more than half of China's fleet are Boeing planes. China's first domestically made commercial jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ-21, flew its first passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight.

The narrow-body C919 jet — white with green and blue stripes — disappeared into the clouds after taking off from Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered, including top officials. It successfully landed some 80 minutes later and the five-member crew was handed flowers, with captain Cai Jun describing the flight as “very satisfactory.” Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. “China’s big commercial jet project made a huge breakthrough. It is a major milestone of China’s aviation market,” China’s State Council said in a statement. State media said the plane flew at an altitude of around 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of more than 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. While delayed since last year, the flight is the latest sign of China’s growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service.

His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet’s production facility: “Accelerate the construction of the world’s top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry.” China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country’s travel market expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around $1 trillion. Both companies congratulated COMAC on the flight. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for “everlasting”, can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles) and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. COMAC made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co., COMAC’s production arm. The Shanghai-based firm aims to become one of the world’s leading civil aircraft manufacturer in the next three years, seeking to have the C919 and its ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet, both certified to fly internationally. But it will be sometime before the C919 is ready to compete with the top-selling products of the world’s aviation giants, said Bao. “The biggest challenge is that the whole manufacturing experience still needs improvement because this is the first time China is making a primary route plane,” Bao said. – Earning trust – The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification and COMAC hopes to get the green light from US and European regulators. The ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. Another challenge for the C919 is earning consumers’ trust, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. “It will take some time for customers around the world to be comfortable buying Chinese airplanes,” he said, adding, “it’s not going to happen in the next 10 years.” “It’s going to be incredibly tough not because it’s not a good product. But because you need to get comfort and credibility to the product among potential clients, potential customers.”   aviation C919 China Manufacturing planes 2017-05-05 The Independent Share Facebook Twitter Google + LinkedIn Tags aviation C919 China Manufacturing planes 2 comments Raymond Otika May 5, 2017 at 4:55 pm Unless it is the Chinanization of everything, but is it necessary that every developing economy or country like China must produce its passenger jets? Reply Benard Akol May 6, 2017 at 7:35 am As it is best known that China makes products for all walks of life; rich, poor etc, China will get potential buyers for its aircraft. China is neutral in the world affairs, its interest is business and with their ambitious marketing strategies, China will penetrate the market. Look at the way they started with Youtong Buses, today, Africa is flooded with these buses and they are excellent on road across boarders with efficiency. I congratulate China.

All eyes are on the skies at Shanghai Pudong International Airport as the maiden test flight of China's C919 airliner lifts off, and lands, successfully.More The maiden test flight of the C919 airliner made a successful takeoff, and landing, after a 90-minute flight from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday, according to a livestream via Twitter carried on China 's official news agency Xinhua. The plane's flight was watched by a large crowd gathered at the airport. The C919 has more than 150 seats and a range of 4,075 kilometers (2,532 miles), and is meant to compete with the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, among the most popular commercial planes flying in the skies. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, the state-owned company behind the plane, said 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 planes by the end of 2016, and it expected sales to exceed 2,000, state media said. Livestream Tweet China is making a big push to become a global aviation player, looking to compete with the likes of Airbus (: ) and Boeing (NYSE: BA). Establishing itself in this industry has been hailed a "strategic move" by President Xi Jinping , according to written remarks published by state media outlets. Beijing has also identified domestic development and production of engines and planes as a major goal. Friday's maiden flight will be a key milestone for the C919, which has been plagued by delays. Final ground tests only concluded a few weeks ago, much later than the original schedule of a first flight in 2014, and aircraft delivery in 2016. Still, it will still be a while before travelers can board the plane – the C919 still needs to undergo other safety and certification checks. China is expected to beat the U.S. as the world's largest aviation market by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. And it's going to be big business for a range of sectors, from tourism to airplane makers as the country's airlines buy more planes and add more routes. Boeing has estimated that China will need to buy up $1 trillion worth of planes – about 6,810 sets of wings – over the next two decades in order to meet demand. — Barry Huang contributed to this story.

(Xinhua/Ding Ting) By Xinhua writers Liu Jie, Qi Zhongxi, Hu Tao SHANGHAI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China took a major step toward becoming a global aviation powerhouse as its homegrown large passenger plane, the C919, took to the sky on Friday. The flight makes China the fourth jumbo jet producer after the United States, Western Europe and Russia. It also marks a milestone for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919. The twin-engine plane departed from Shanghai Pudong International Airport with five crew members on board but no passengers. The plane took off at around 2 p.m. amid applause from more than 1,000 spectators on the tarmac, including Vice Premier Ma Kai and Shanghai Party chief Han Zheng. The flight lasted about 80 minutes. The "C" in the aircraft's name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolizes "forever" in Chinese culture, and 19 represents the 190 seats at maximum capacity. With a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, the narrow-body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737 planes, signaling the country's entry into the global aviation market. The successful flight moves China one step closer to transforming itself from a manufacturer of low-cost goods to a creator of advanced technology. It marks a major breakthrough of China's large passenger plane project and a major landmark in the development of China's civil aviation industry, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council said in a congratulatory letter. It is a great achievement made under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, said the letter. "The maiden flight is exciting," said Wu Guanghui, the C919's chief designer, hailing it as the start of a new era in China's advanced manufacturing. China has taken pride in developing the homegrown jumbo jet, regarding it as a symbol of national strength. It began developing its own large passenger jets in the 1970s and the first one, the Y-10, had a successful test flight in 1980. But the project was later abandoned. In 2007, the State Council approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. The jet was designed and produced in China and made with resources from around the world. It is an achievement in global cooperation, said Wu. The C919 incorporated parts from over 30 global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc. Its engines were made by a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines. The flight marks the culmination of a successful collaboration between Safran and China. "We are very confident that the C919 will play a more important role in the world aviation industry," said Olivier Dubroeucq, Safran executive vice president of the COMAC and AVIC Programs. "China is willing to share growth opportunities with the rest of the world. For Honeywell, which has invested heavily in China's aviation industry, we are picking the winner," said Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific. Despite the successful test flight, it may still take time for the C919 to take off in the market. Shaking the dominance of giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come. A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to COMAC. But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success. Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for more than 6,000 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars. China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to Boeing. The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field as it is economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities. COMAC will seek airworthiness certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries slated for around 2019.

(AP Photo/Andy Wong, Pool) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (7) Shanghai • The first large Chinese-made passenger jetliner completed its maiden test flight on Friday, a milestone in China's long-term goal to break into the Western-dominated aircraft market. The takeoff of the C919 brought cheers and applause from hundreds of invited guests at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and was broadcast live on Chinese state television. The jet soon became invisible on a windy and polluted day in Shanghai, which was also in the path of dense sandstorms from the north. After the 1 ½ hour flight was over, the test pilots came down smiling from the plane, wearing orange overalls with the Chinese flag. VIDEOS TOP JOBS With the flight, the official Xinhua News Agency said China had become "one of the world's top makers of jumbo aircraft," becoming the fourth large jet producer after the U.S., Europe and Russia. China is touting the C919 as a rival to single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. It was originally due to begin flying in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. It's now unlikely to carry commercial passengers until at least 2019. Mohshin Aziz, a Kuala Lumpur-based aviation analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said it wouldn't be clear for 7-9 years whether the C919 can make a dent in Airbus and Boeing's duopoly. "This is just the test flight," he said. "Eventually it needs to have some cornerstone customers, of which it will have because there are state-owned airlines, some of them are going to be forced to use it." Mohshin said other potential customers would wait to see what experience the first customers have. "You are not going to spend a lot of money on something you don't know," he said. The aircraft's maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, will seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators before making any deliveries. Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said Thursday the manufacturer planned to make two planes a year from now to 2019 to obtain proof of safe flight before any mass production is started. Comac says it has 570 orders from 23 domestic and foreign customers. Most are state-owned Chinese airlines. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways. The plane can be configured with 155-175 seats and has a standard flight length of 4,075 kilometers (2,530 miles). The jet's development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world's low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology. At the same time, China's aviation market is growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business. Boeing forecasts that an annual 6 percent growth in China's air passenger traffic over the next two decades will create demand for 6,810 new planes worth a total of $1 trillion — the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast. Of the new planes, 75 percent are expected to be single-aisle. Airbus has five joint ventures in China, including a factory that assembles A320s in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, that opened in 2008. Mohshin said much of China's aircraft technology started from Russia, and the Tianjin factory has since given China's supply chain vital experience. "I would say that a lot of their technology mirrors Airbus," he said. Comac says more than 200 Chinese companies and 36 universities have been involved in research and development of the C919. » Next page...

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News World More China cheers passenger jet’s maiden flight as country takes first step toward airline big leagues Simon Denyer, Washington Post  05.05.2017 ShareAdjustCommentPrint China took a step towards the aviation big league Friday with the long delayed, but finally successful, maiden flight of its first modern passenger jet. China hopes its airline industry can someday challenge the Western duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, especially for its own large and fast-growing domestic market. But the flight of the single-aisle, twin engine C919 is also a symbol of the country’s ambitions to develop an advanced high-tech economy over the next decade. State media burst with pride and patriotism as the plane’s debut flight from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai was broadcast live, adding that around 3,000 officials, executives and other onlookers clapped “ecstatically” as the plane landed, carrying a skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. But the reaction on social media was a little more muted, with some pointing out that the flight was a reminder of how far China still lagged behind the West. The government says the ability to build and fly a modern passenger plane would be the “pearl” and “flower” of modern manufacturing, a centerpiece of the government’s “Made in China 2025” industrial plan that also includes ambitions to develop world-class robotics, advanced information technology, medicines and hi-tech transport industries. But there is still a long way to go down the road to a globally competitive aerospace industry. The plane’s development was beset by production problems and delays – it had initially been slated to fly in 2014 – and it still relies on a wide-range of foreign technology, with General Electric and French firm Safran supplying the engines through a joint venture. The single-aisle plane is designed to carry between 155 and 175 seats, and fly 4,075 km. It is expected to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines in 2019, and its maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) says it already has 570 orders from 23 customers. Most of the demand is coming from state-owned Chinese airlines, and the plane will initially target the domestic market, which is set to displace the United States as the world’s biggest by around 2024, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts. It says the 1.3 billion passengers will fly to, from and within China every year by 2035. To meet that demand, Boeing predicts China will need 6,800 new airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over that time period, as its economy and middle-class continue to grow. Most of the flights will be on single-aisle jets like the C-919. Chinese media said the plane will cost around $50 mln, significantly less then a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320, its closest equivalents. COMAC is now seeking certification from Europe’s aviation safety regulator. But Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, told Bloomberg News that China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers. “At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,” he said. “First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday’s technology.” China’s ambitions to develop a passenger jet of its own date back to the time of Mao Zedong. In the 1970s it developed the Shanghai Y-10 airliner, but the plane was beset by problems, including its heavy weight, high fuel consumption, limited range and safety concerns. Only two prototypes were ever built. Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

The white, green and blue aircraft made a successful landing after a 90-minute flight from Shanghai's international airport. The long-delayed maiden flight was watched by a large crowd that included dignitaries and aviation workers. The C919 aircraft is the first large civil jet aircraft developed by China. It was built by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China or Comac. The C919 has a layout of 158 to 168 seats, with a range of 4,075 to 5,555 kilometers. The aircraft is part of China's long-term goal to become a global aviation player and break Airbus and Boeing's duopoly in the lucrative global jet market, which is estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades. The narrow-body twin-engine jet is intended to compete against Airbus A320 neo, Boeing 737 MAX, Bombardier and other next-generation single-aisle airliners. According to Comac, a total of 570 orders for the aircraft have been obtained from 23 customers. Comac plans a test program of 4,200 flight hours and introduction in 2020 with China Eastern Airlines. However, the C919 still has a long journey ahead, as it needs to undergo safety and certification checks. Currently, Boeing and Airbus are far ahead of Comac in terms of technical know-how and order books. The C919 continues to rely on technology from Western companies, including General Electric, Honeywell, United Technologies and France's Safran as well as Michelin.

China hopes its airline industry can someday challenge the Western duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, especially for its own large and fast-growing domestic market. But the flight of the single-aisle, twin engine C919 is also a symbol of the country's ambitions to develop an advanced high-tech economy over the next decade. Share this story File image State media burst with pride and patriotism as the plane's debut flight from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai was broadcast live, adding that around 3,000 officials, executives and other onlookers clapped "ecstatically" as the plane landed, carrying a skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. But the reaction on social media was a little more muted, with some pointing out that the flight was a reminder of how far China still lagged behind the West. The government says the ability to build and fly a modern passenger plane would be the "pearl" and "flower" of modern manufacturing, a centrepieces of the government's "Made in China 2025" industrial plan that also includes ambitions to develop world-class robotics, advanced information technology, medicines and hi-tech transport industries. But there is still a long way to go down the road to a globally competitive aerospace industry. The plane's development was beset by production problems and delays - it had initially been slated to fly in 2014 - and it still relies on a wide-range of foreign technology, with General Electric and French firm Safran supplying the engines through a joint venture. The single-aisle plane is designed to carry between 155 and 175 seats, and fly 2,530 miles (4,075 km). It is expected to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines in 2019, and its maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) says it already has 570 orders from 23 customers. Most of the demand is coming from state-owned Chinese airlines, and the plane will initially target the domestic market, which is set to displace the United States as the world's biggest by around 2024, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts. It says the 1.3 billion passengers will fly to, from and within China every year by 2035. To meet that demand, Boeing predicts China will need 6,800 new airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over that time period, as its economy and middle-class continue to grow. Most of the flights will be on single-aisle jets like the C-919. Chinese media said the plane will cost around $50 million, significantly less then a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320, its closest equivalents.

But Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, told Bloomberg News that China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers. "At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be," he said. "First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday's technology." China's ambitions to develop a passenger jet of its own date back to the time of Mao Zedong. In the 1970s it developed the Shanghai Y-10 airliner, but the plane was beset by problems, including its heavy weight, high fuel consumption, limited range and safety concerns. Only two prototypes were ever built.

The takeoff of the C919 brought cheers and applause from hundreds of invited guests at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and was broadcast live on Chinese state television. The jet soon became invisible on a windy and polluted day in Shanghai, which was also in the path of dense sandstorms from the north. After the 1 ½ hour flight was over, the test pilots came down smiling from the plane, wearing orange overalls with the Chinese flag. With the flight, the official Xinhua News Agency said China had become "one of the world's top makers of jumbo aircraft," becoming the fourth large jet producer after the U.S., Europe and Russia. China is touting the C919 as a rival to single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. It was originally due to begin flying in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. It's now unlikely to carry commercial passengers until at least 2019. Play Video CBS Evening News How is China reacting to election of Donald Trump? After all of the tough talk about China during the campaign, how is the nation with the world's largest population and second largest economy rea... Mohshin Aziz, a Kuala Lumpur-based aviation analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said it wouldn't be clear for 7-9 years whether the C919 can make a dent in Airbus and Boeing's duopoly. "This is just the test flight," he said. "Eventually it needs to have some cornerstone customers, of which it will have because there are state-owned airlines, some of them are going to be forced to use it." Mohshin said other potential customers would wait to see what experience the first customers have. "You are not going to spend a lot of money on something you don't know," he said. The aircraft's maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, will seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators before making any deliveries. Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said Thursday the manufacturer planned to make two planes a year from now to 2019 to obtain proof of safe flight before any mass production is started. Comac says it has 570 orders from 23 domestic and foreign customers. Most are state-owned Chinese airlines. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways. The plane can be configured with 155-175 seats and has a standard flight length of 4,075 kilometers (2,530 miles). The jet's development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world's low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology. At the same time, China's aviation market is growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business. Boeing forecasts that an annual 6 percent growth in China's air passenger traffic over the next two decades will create demand for 6,810 new planes worth a total of $1 trillion — the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast. Of the new planes, 75 percent are expected to be single-aisle. Play Video MoneyWatch Does China or the U.S. have a bigger income inequality problem? Income inequality is rising globally, but how it impacts the world's two biggest economies may signal problems ahead. Airbus has five joint ventures in China, including a factory that assembles A320s in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, that opened in 2008. Mohshin said much of China's aircraft technology started from Russia, and the Tianjin factory has since given China's supply chain vital experience. "I would say that a lot of their technology mirrors Airbus," he said. Comac says more than 200 Chinese companies and 36 universities have been involved in research and development of the C919. But it relies on foreign-made technology for critical systems, including its engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aviation subsidiary and France's Safran Aircraft Engines. The first deliveries of Chinese-developed engines are expected in 2020, according to the company tasked with making them, AVIC Commercial Aircraft Engine Co. Ltd. Airbus delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators last year, including 141 from the A320 family, Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, said in an emailed statement. "We believe C919 will bring new competition to the market," he said. "And we welcome competition, which is good for the development of the industry." Boeing says it delivered more than 160 planes to China in 2016, and more than half of China's fleet are Boeing planes. China's first domestically made commercial jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ-21, flew its first passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight. That smaller jet is a rival to aircraft made by Bombardier Inc. of Canada and Brazil's Embraer SA. © 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Yet western experts believe it won’t put much of a dent in the market share of the dominant U.S. and European players. Launched nine years ago and now running three years late, the C919 jet won’t enter service until 2019 or 2020. The Airbus neo is already in service and has won more than 5,000 orders. And the Boeing MAX, which is due to enter service later this month with Malaysian carrier Malindo Air, has just over 3,700 orders. Boeing leaders have said for years that it’s the next generation of Chinese commercial jets after the C919 that will offer real competition, likely around 2030. It may be even longer before anyone trusts Chinese engines.

The 158-seater C919 aircraft took to the skies from Shanghai Pudong International Airport in eastern China and made the country the fourth jumbo jet producer after the US, Europe and Russia, the state media reported. The 80-minute flight was greeted with applause by more than 1,000 spectators on the tarmac, including Chinese Vice Premier Ma Kai and Shanghai Party chief Han Zheng. The twin-engine plane departed with five crew members on board but without any passengers. "The maiden flight was exciting," said Wu Guanghui, C919's chief designer, adding that it was a major breakthrough in China's civil aviation history, as well as the start of a new era of advanced manufacturing in the country. The "C" in the aircraft's name stands for both China and COMAC, while 9 symbolises "forever" in Chinese culture and 19 represents the maximum 190 seats capacity. With a standard range of 4,075 kilometres, the narrow- body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737, signalling the country's entry into the global aviation market, Xinhua news agency reported. It also marks a milestone for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the Shanghai-based manufacturer of the C919, it said. China in recent times has been making big breakthroughs in aviation with new fighter aircraft, including a stealth aircraft, but this is the first time it came out with a passenger plane. China's first amphibious aircraft, stated to be the largest in the world, successfully conducted its first glide test on April 29 in Chinese city of Zhuhai and braced for its maiden flight. China began to develop its own jumbo passenger jets in the 1970s and the first one, the Y-10, had a successful test flight in 1980. But the project was abandoned later. In 2007, the State Council, China's Cabinet, approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. The plane passed expert technical appraisal this March. The aircraft was given the go-ahead in April to begin a series of high-speed taxiing tests, the final step before its maiden flight. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. The jet was designed and produced in China and made with resources from around the world. It is an achievement in global cooperation, said Wu. The C919 incorporates parts from over 30 global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc. Its engines were made by a joint venture between General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines. COMAC has received 570 orders from 23 foreign and domestic customers, including from China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service. Both Airbus and Boeing have assembly plants in China considering the growing demand for new aircraft. Airbus had delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators in 2016, its seventh consecutive year of more than 100 deliveries, AirbusChina said earlier this year. A recent Boeing forecast said that China will need 6,810 new aircraft in the next 20 years at an estimated cost of USD one trillion. By the end of 2016, 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 C919 aircraft, and COMAC expects to sell at least 2,000. China's first regional commercial aircraft ARJ21 began commercial operation in June 2016. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

By Ed Adamczyk   |   May 5, 2017 at 7:05 AM Follow @upi Comments May 5 (UPI) -- China's first large passenger jet, the Comac C919, made a successful, 90-minute maiden flight on Friday, the Chinese news agency Xinhua said. Manufactured by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Company of China, the plane took off from, and later returned to, Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The company was established as a competitor to Boeing and Airbus, and with about 150 seats, the C919 is similar in size to the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The State Council, China's executive Cabinet, announced plans in 2007 to develop the aircraft, with a target date for a first flight of 2014, followed by delivery of aircraft in 2016. Although numerous delays occurred, state media reported that 21 customers have placed orders for more than 500 planes, and sales are expected to eventually exceed 2,000. Air China, China Eastern, China Southern and Germany's RuPen are among airlines that have ordered C919s, the state-owned Global Times said. Chinese President Xi Jinping called the establishment of China as a power in the aviation industry a "strategic move," CNBC said Friday, citing state media. It added that Boeing estimated China will require up to $1 trillion in aircraft, or over 6,800 new planes, in the next 20 years.

China-made passenger jet's first flightFri, 05 May 2017 11:50 AM Share Your Email China's home-grown C919 passenger jet took off on its maiden test flight on Friday, a key milestone in the country's drive to compete with US and European aircraft makers. Credit: AFP.     The first large made-in-China passenger plane successfully completed its maiden test flight Friday, marking a key milestone on the country's ambitious journey to compete with the world's leading aircraft makers. The narrow-body C919 jet -- white with green and blue stripes -- disappeared into the clouds after taking off from Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered, including top officials. It successfully landed some 80 minutes later and the five-member crew was handed flowers, with captain Cai Jun describing the flight as "very satisfactory." Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. "China's big commercial jet project made a huge breakthrough. It is a major milestone of China’s aviation market," China's State Council said in a statement. State media said the plane flew at an altitude of around 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of more than 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. While delayed since last year, the flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. - $1 trillion market - President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet's production facility: "Accelerate the construction of the world's top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry." China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country's travel market expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around $1 trillion. Both companies congratulated COMAC on the flight. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for "everlasting", can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles) and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. COMAC made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co., COMAC's production arm. The Shanghai-based firm aims to become one of the world's leading civil aircraft manufacturer in the next three years, seeking to have the C919 and its ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet, both certified to fly internationally. But it will be sometime before the C919 is ready to compete with the top-selling products of the world's aviation giants, said Bao. "The biggest challenge is that the whole manufacturing experience still needs improvement because this is the first time China is making a primary route plane," Bao said. - Earning trust - The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification and COMAC hopes to get the green light from US and European regulators. The ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. Another challenge for the C919 is earning consumers' trust, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "It will take some time for customers around the world to be comfortable buying Chinese airplanes," he said, adding, "it's not going to happen in the next 10 years." "It's going to be incredibly tough not because it's not a good product. But because you need to get comfort and credibility to the product among potential clients, potential customers."

An 11-hour flight from London to Los Angeles would set back a client at least £242,000. Read more China launches first domestically-built aircraft carrier The 2,400 square feet of space inside the plane - which would accommodate up to 335 passengers on a regular commercial flight - is decked out to cater to just 30 people, Mail Online reported. When passengers need some shut-eye after using the wood-floored lounge, they can retire to one of the craft’s 18 flat beds. The master bedroom, meanwhile, has an adjoining bathroom decorated with marble and oak wood and stocked with Jo Malone toiletries. In an attempt to combat jet-lag, the designers have kept the aircraft's cabin altitude at 6,000ft - as the side effects of flying are said to kick in at 6,500ft.  The VVIP Dreamliner B787 Dreamjet - In pictures + show all The VVIP Dreamliner B787 Dreamjet - In pictures 1/6 2/6 3/6 4/6 5/6 6/6 The crew and in-flight 'butlers', meanwhile, have a area on the plane worth £230million, according to The Sun.  In a nod to the high net worth individuals who Kestrel Aviation Management - the firm behind the plane - hope will rent it, the promotional video shows the aircraft kitted out with high fashion and yachting magazines, as well as Chanel products.  As the B787 can fly for up to 17.5 hours non-stop, suggested flights on its current itinerary include New York, Hong Kong and LA. A seven-night charter deal which comes with a stay at the Presidential Suite of St Regis Bora Bora Resort is also available. Deer Jet, the Beijing Capital Airlines firm behind the aircraft, plans to unveil more itineraries in June. The aircraft is currently on show at Stansted Airport.  Frank Fang, vice president of Deer Jet, said in a statement: "It showcases the signature service of Deer Jet, which is inspired by the values of performance, elegance, and distinction. "With the 787 Dream Jet, we are proud to serve discerning business and leisure travellers worldwide."

The C919 single-aisle jet, which can hold up to 168 passengers, soared over Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered. China is one of the biggest aviation markets, but relies on foreign-made aircraft and has long sought to enter the lucrative global jet market, which is estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. The maiden test flight had been pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues. Friday’s flight included a skeleton crew of five people and carried no passengers. Aviation analyst Tom Ballantyne told Al Jazeera that Friday’s flight represented a “huge moment” for China. “It is important for the Chinese government to show that its industrial processes are on par with the West or are heading in that direction,” he said. C919 must ‘prove itself’ While the 39-metre long plane is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as engines. The Chinese plane is touted to rival the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, but a spokesman for the aircraft’s maker said it cannot compare. “You can’t compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they’re in a different strategic stage … We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue [of plane development], it will also take many years to solve the second [market] problem,” Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), told Reuters news agency prior to the maiden flight. Ballantyne said it will be years before the C919 will be able to fully compete with Western-made planes. “This Chinese aircraft will have to prove itself in operation before any Western airline will even consider purchasing it,” he said. Ballantyne added that “it is very unlikely that it will be able to compete in terms of technology and economics with the new-generation aircraft” produced by Boeing and Airbus. Hundreds of orders If Friday’s maiden flight is successful, COMAC, the aircraft’s maker, will seek certification from China’s civil aviation authority and foreign regulators. COMAC has already received 570 orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese-owned carriers and leasing companies. The safety certification of the new plane – which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 – could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally. Questions remain regarding the safety approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold outside of China. Chinese airlines are expected to drive demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes – mostly from Boeing and Airbus. China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s when Jiang Qing, leader Mao Zedong’s wife and a member of the notorious “Gang of Four”, personally backed an attempt to do so. But the Y-10’s heavy weight made it impractical and only three were ever made. China’s first domestically-made regional jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ21, flew its passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight. The development of the C919 is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country into a creator of profitable technology.

The takeoff of the C919 bought cheers and applause from hundreds of invited guests at Shanghai Pudong International Airport and was broadcast live on Chinese state television. The jet soon became invisible on a windy and polluted day in Shanghai, which was also in the path of dense sandstorms from the north. After the 1 ½ hour flight was over, the test pilots came down smiling from the plane, wearing orange overalls with the Chinese flag. With the flight, the official Xinhua News Agency said China had become "one of the world's top makers of jumbo aircraft," becoming the fourth large jet producer after the U.S., Europe and Russia. China is touting the C919 as a rival to single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. It was originally due to begin flying in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, but has been beset by delays blamed on manufacturing problems. It's now unlikely to carry commercial passengers until at least 2019. Mohshin Aziz, a Kuala Lumpur-based aviation analyst at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, said it wouldn't be clear for 7-9 years whether the C919 can make a dent in Airbus and Boeing's duopoly. "This is just the test flight," he said. "Eventually it needs to have some cornerstone customers, of which it will have because there are state-owned airlines, some of them are going to be forced to use it." The aircraft's maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, will seek certification from China's civil aviation authority and foreign regulators before making any deliveries. Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said Thursday the manufacturer planned to make two planes a year from now to 2019 to obtain proof of safe flight before any mass production is started. Comac says it has 570 orders from 23 domestic and foreign customers. Most are state-owned Chinese airlines. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways. The plane can be configured with 155-175 seats and has a standard flight length of 4,075 kilometers (2,530 miles). The jet's development is a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country from the world's low-cost factory into a creator of profitable technology. At the same time, China's aviation market is growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business. Boeing forecasts that an annual 6 percent growth in China's air passenger traffic over the next two decades will create demand for 6,810 new planes worth a total of $1 trillion — the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast. Of the new planes, 75 percent are expected to be single-aisle. Airbus has five joint ventures in China, including a factory that assembles A320s in Tianjin, a port city near Beijing, that opened in 2008. Mohshin said much of China's aircraft technology started from Russia, and the Tianjin factory has since given China's supply chain vital experience. "I would say that a lot of their technology mirrors Airbus," he said. Comac says more than 200 Chinese companies and 36 universities have been involved in research and development of the C919. But it relies on foreign-made technology for critical systems, including its engines, which are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aviation subsidiary and France's Safran Aircraft Engines. The first deliveries of Chinese-developed engines are expected in 2020, according to the company tasked with making them, AVIC Commercial Aircraft Engine Co. Ltd. Airbus delivered 153 aircraft to Chinese operators last year, including 141 from the A320 family, Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, said in an emailed statement. "We believe C919 will bring new competition to the market," he said. "And we welcome competition, which is good for the development of the industry." Boeing says it delivered more than 160 planes to China in 2016, and more than half of China's fleet are Boeing planes. China's first domestically made commercial jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ-21, flew its first passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight. That smaller jet is a rival to aircraft made by Bombardier Inc. of Canada and Brazil's Embraer SA.     1st large Chinese-made passenger jet makes its maiden flight Independent Online/ AP The first large Chinese-made passenger jetliner completed its maiden test flight on Friday, a milestone in Chinas long-term goal to break into the Western-dominated aircraft market.

(Greg Baker/Reuters) By Simon Denyer By Simon Denyer May 5 at 6:33 AM Follow @simondenyer BEIJING — China took a step toward the aviation big leagues Friday with the long-delayed, but successful, maiden flight of its first modern passenger jet. China hopes its aircraft industry can someday challenge the Western duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, especially for its large and fast-growing domestic market. But the flight of the single-aisle, twin-engine C-919 is also a symbol of the country’s ambitions to develop an advanced high-tech economy over the next decade.  State media burst with pride and patriotism as the plane’s debut flight from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai was broadcast live, reporting that about 3,000 officials, executives and other onlookers clapped “ecstatically” as the plane landed, carrying a skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. But the reaction on social media was a little more muted, with some pointing out that the flight was a reminder of how far China lags behind the West. The government says the ability to build and fly a modern passenger plane would be the “pearl” and “flower” of modern manufacturing, a centerpiece of the government’s “Made in China 2025” industrial plan that includes ambitions to develop world-class robotics, advanced information technology, medicines and high-tech transport industries. There is, however, still a long road to a globally competitive aerospace industry.  The plane’s development was beset by production problems and delays — it had initially been slated to fly in 2014 — and it still relies on a wide range of foreign technology. General Electric and the French firm Safran supply the engines through a joint venture. The plane is designed to hold 155 to 175 seats and fly 2,530 miles. It is expected to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines in 2019, and its maker, state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, says it has 570 orders from 23 customers. Most of the demand is coming from state-owned Chinese airlines, and the plane will initially target the domestic market, which is set to displace the United States as the world’s biggest by around 2024, the International Air Transport Association predicts. It says that 1.3 billion passengers will fly to, from and within China every year by 2035. To meet that demand, Boeing predicts that China will need 6,800 new airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over that period, as its economy and middle class continue to grow.  Most of the flights will be on single-aisle jets like the C-919. Chinese media said the plane will cost about $50 million, significantly less than a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320, its closest equivalents. The Commercial Aircraft Corp. is seeking certification from Europe’s aviation safety regulator.  But Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group, told Bloomberg News that China may have to wait until its next aircraft to break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers. “At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,” he said. “First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday’s technology.”  China’s ambitions to build a passenger jet of its own date back to the time of Mao Zedong. In the 1970s, China developed the Shanghai Y-10 airliner, but the plane was beset by problems, including its weight, high fuel consumption, limited range and safety concerns. Only two prototypes were built.  Read more: Finally, China manufactures a ballpoint pen all by itself China offers huge rewards for Boeing, but it could also take that business away Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news world asia_pacific Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

KAZINFORM - China's first large domestically made passenger aircraft has completed its maiden flight, mounting a major challenge to Boeing and Airbus, BBC News reports.  After about 90 minutes in the air the plane landed safely back at Pudong airport in Shanghai. The plane is a key symbol of Beijing's soaring ambitions to enter the global aviation market. The jet by state-owned firm Comac has been planned since 2008 but the flight was repeatedly pushed back. For Friday's maiden flight, the plane carried only its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers and took off in front of a crown of thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. Ahead of the flight, state television said the plane would fly at an altitude of only 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and reach a speed of around 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. The C919 is designed to be a direct competitor to Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320. It's estimated that the global aviation market will be worth $2tn (£1.55tn) over the next 20 years. The plane still relies on a wide array of imported technology though, it is for instance powered by engines from French-US supplier CFM International. Orders have already been placed for more than 500 of the planes, with commitments from 23 customers, say officials, mainly Chinese airlines. The main customer is China Eastern Airlines. Europe's aviation safety regulator has started the certification process for the C919 - a crucial step for the aircraft to be successful on the international market. China has had ambitions to build its own civil aircraft industry since the 1970s, when leader Mao Zedong's wife, Jiang Qing, personally backed a project. But the Y-10, built in the late 1970s, was impractical due to its heavy weight and only three of the aircraft were ever made.     Keywords: World News, : Read also France bans extremely thin models U.S. House approves legislation significantly tightening sanctions on N.

Save & Share Tweet Share Email Print The narrow-body C919 jet -- white with green and blue stripes -- soared over Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered. allowfullscreen Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. The flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. Before takeoff, CCTV state television said the plane would be tested at an altitude of 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of around 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. The plane took off at 2:00 pm (0600 GMT) and was expected to fly for an hour and a half as ministers, COMAC staff, company partners and others looked on. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project, visiting COMAC even before he took office in 2013. The first flight was supposed to take place last year, but it was delayed until now. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet's production facility: "Accelerate the construction of the world's top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry." China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country's travel market expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around $1 trillion. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for "everlasting", can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles) and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification. The Shanghai-based company is also aiming to have the plane certified by US and European regulators. COMAC's smaller, 90-seat ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies. Another challenge for the C919 is earning consumers' trust, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "It will take some time for customers around the world to be comfortable buying Chinese airplanes," he said, adding, "it's not going to happen in the next ten years." "It's going to be incredibly tough not because it's not a good product. But because you need to get comfort and credibility to the product among potential clients, potential customers."

The narrow-body C919 jet - white with green and blue stripes - disappeared into the clouds after taking off from Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered.

COMAC made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co. - COMAC's production arm. The Shanghai-based firm plans to become one of the world's leading civil aircraft manufacturer in the next three years, aiming to have the C919 and ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet made by COMAC, both certified to fly internationally. But it will be sometime before the C919 is ready to compete with the top-selling products of the world's aviation giants, said Bao. "The biggest challenge is that the whole manufacturing experience still needs improvement because this is the first time China is making a primary route plane," Bao told reporters before the flight. Earning trust The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification. The Shanghai-based company is also aiming to have the plane certified by US and European regulators.

The C919. Image: AFP/Getty Images By Yi Shu Ng2017-05-05 08:22:53 UTC China's first homegrown passenger plane made its maiden flight on Friday afternoon, to much fanfare. The world manufacturing superpower has hitched much of its hopes on the 168-seat C919 jet, as its toe into a world dominated by America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus. SEE ALSO: Airbus wants to get rid of cabin classes and make planes totally customizable Made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the C919 faced a three-year long delay due to production issues.

The country tried to make the defunct Shanghai Y10 in the 1980s but it failed to be viable; more recently, Comac's ARJ-21 regional airliner made its first commercial flight in 2015. So on Friday, 3.3 million users on China's Weibo social network tuned into the official livestream of the flight.

My country is strong!" commented the verified account of a home-appliance company. Image: NG YI SHU/MASHABLE Another verified account, belonging to an electronics manufacturer said: "China is the best! Bring our portable charger along on your maiden flight, would you?" Image: NG YI SHU/MASHABLE A shoemaker said: "With an aircraft carrier sailing the four seas, and a plane going up the nine skies, isn't our country strong? Click like for the motherland!"  A long way to go, still Comac still has a long way to go before it can break Boeing and Airbus' duopoly, however. Without global certification, Comac can only sell its jets to a few developing economies in South America and Southeast Asia that accept China's certification standards, reports Reuters.  And so far, the only foreign airline that has bought the C919 is Thailand's City Airways, which lost its operating certification last year, according to Bloomberg. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," Si Jingzhe, an analyst with Sinolink Securities, told Reuters.   Still, China is looking up. Comac is currently working with Russia's state-owned United Aircraft to develop a bigger long-haul jet — designated the C929. Both companies said in November that they have started the hunt for suppliers, and they're aiming to conduct a maiden flight for the C929 in 2022.

Boeing KC-46 programme's second 767-2C aircraft completes first flight. (Boeing) Boeing spokesman Chick Ramey said on 3 May the KC-46's first flight was a "regular" first flight to check out the aircraft and specific tests were not performed. This KC-46 aircraft, he said, is expected to next head to Edwards Air Force Base in California for initial testing to ensure it can safely operate through electromagnetic fields produced by radars, radio towers, and other systems. It is the second low-rate initial production (LRIP) plane. Boeing will soon have six aircraft in its KC-46 test programme as it is converting one of its 767-2C aircraft into a KC-46 tanker. Ramey said Boeing is adding another tanker to its test fleet as it is moving past much of the commercial certification activities and is focusing on KC-46 testing, and adding another aircraft will expand the company's ability to complete ground- and flight-test activities as it progresses toward first deliveries to the US Air Force. Ramey said the first LRIP airplane has been conducting testing as a 767-2C and will transition to a tanker later this year. Boeing, he said, will start the next phase of refuelling tests in the coming months. The 767-2C is a KC-46 without the aerial refuelling system installed. Ramey said the first LRIP aircraft has already performed more than 40 flights. Want to read more?

Photo by AFP/Aly Song The flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill. The first large made-in-China passenger plane took off on its maiden test flight Friday, marking a key milestone on the country's ambitious journey to compete with the world's leading aircraft makers. The narrow-body C919 jet -- white with green and blue stripes -- soared over Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered. Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and U.S. aerospace giant Boeing. The flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. Before takeoff, CCTV state television said the plane would be tested at an altitude of 3,000 meters (9,800 feet), some 7,000 meters lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of around 300 kilometers (186 miles) per hour. The plane took off at 2:00 p.m. (0600 GMT) and was expected to fly for an hour and a half as ministers, COMAC staff, company partners and others looked on. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. $1 trillion market President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project, visiting COMAC even before he took office in 2013. The first flight was supposed to take place last year, but it was delayed until now. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet's production facility: "Accelerate the construction of the world's top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry." China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country's travel market expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around $1 trillion. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for "everlasting", can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555 kilometers (3,444 miles) and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. China's home-grown C919 passenger jet prepares to take off from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai on May 5, 2017. Photo by AFP/Aly Song Earning trust The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification. The Shanghai-based company is also aiming to have the plane certified by U.S. and European regulators. COMAC's smaller, 90-seat ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly U.S. skies. Another challenge for the C919 is earning consumers' trust, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "It will take some time for customers around the world to be comfortable buying Chinese airplanes," he said, adding, "it's not going to happen in the next ten years." "It's going to be incredibly tough not because it's not a good product. But because you need to get comfort and credibility to the product among potential clients, potential customers."

The narrow-body C919 jet — white with green and blue stripes — soared over Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered. Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. The flight is the latest sign of China’s growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. Before takeoff, CCTV state television said the plane would be tested at an altitude of 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of around 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. The plane took off at 2:00 pm (0600 GMT) and was expected to fly for an hour and a half as ministers, COMAC staff, company partners and others looked on. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. – $1 trillion market – President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project, visiting COMAC even before he took office in 2013. The first flight was supposed to take place last year, but it was delayed until now. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet’s production facility: “Accelerate the construction of the world’s top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry.” China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country’s travel market expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around $1 trillion. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for “everlasting”, can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles) and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. – Earning trust – The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification. The Shanghai-based company is also aiming to have the plane certified by US and European regulators. COMAC’s smaller, 90-seat ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies. Another challenge for the C919 is earning consumers’ trust, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. “It will take some time for customers around the world to be comfortable buying Chinese airplanes,” he said, adding, “it’s not going to happen in the next ten years.” “It’s going to be incredibly tough not because it’s not a good product. But because you need to get comfort and credibility to the product among potential clients, potential customers.” Shares Tweet Share this article | Read later AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE Agence France-Presse is a global news agency delivering fast, in-depth coverage of the events shaping our world from wars and conflicts to politics, sports, entertainment and the latest breakthroughs in health, science and technology.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup USA Europe Asia Africa Middle East The Americas World China's C919 passenger jet takes to the skies challenging Boeing and Airbus The narrow-body plane made its maiden flight from Shanghai overcoming years of delays due to technical issues. By Nandini Krishnamoorthy Updated May 5, 2017 13:03 BST Close China's C919 passenger jet takes off for maiden flight Reuters China is ready to flex its aviation muscle in the global market as its much-awaited domestically made large passenger plane made its maiden flight on Friday (5 May). The plane called C919 is thought to pose a major challenge to Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The global jet market is estimated to be worth $2tn (£1.55tn) over the next 20 years. The jetliner is made by state-owned firm Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) located in Shanghai. The country first announced plans to build the plane in 2008, but production issues repeatedly pushed the flight back. The cost of manufacturing the aircraft was reported to be around $50m, which is thought to be less than half the price of building a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. The narrow-body aircraft took off from the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday. There was a slight delay with the takeoff due to the weather — maiden aircraft have stricter weather requirements to follow compared to daily flights. The jet made a successful landing after an 80-minute flight. Ahead of the flight, state media reported that the aircraft would only fly at an altitude of around 3,000m (9,800ft) and at a speed of around 300km (186 miles) per hour. The jet flew over the Yangtze River and headed north, Reuters noted. While C919 is a home-grown aircraft, it has been dependent on foreign technology. One of the biggest components of the C919 jetliner — the core processing and display system — is being supplied by a joint venture between GE Aviation Systems and AVIC, a state-owned Chinese military contractor. French-US supplier CFM International has provided technology for the aircraft's engines. Other suppliers include Honeywell, Rockwell Collins, United Technologies' subsidiary Goodrich and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corporation. Comac said it has already received orders for 570 planes from around 23 customers, mostly Chinese carriers, including the country's main China Eastern Airlines. The company first unveiled a model of the C919 aircraft at the Asian Aerospace Expo in Hong Kong in September 2009, Reuters reported. But it was only in November 2015 that China unveiled the aircraft in public for the first time. It was technically ready for takeoff in March this year. Key features of C919: Single-aisle twin-engine plane. Seating capacity: Up to 168 passengers. Flying range: Between 4,075 and 5,555km (2,532 - 3,452 miles). The C919's maiden flight comes weeks after Boeing announced its decision to launch a larger version of its 737 jet within two months. The crucial step for C919 is to get a certification from Europe's aviation safety regulator to be able to survive successfully on the international market. China's ambition to build its own civil aircraft dates back to the 1970s. The C919 is the largest commercial airliner designed and built in China since the defunct Shanghai Y-10. The Y-10 was built in the 1970s but it was eventually deemed unviable due to its heavy weight and never entered service. Only three of the aircraft were ever made in the country, BBC noted.

The narrow-body C919 jet - white with green and blue stripes - disappeared into the clouds after taking off from Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered. It successfully landed some eighty minutes later. Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. The flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab.

China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. US$1 TRILLION MARKET President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project, visiting COMAC even before he took office in 2013. The first flight was supposed to take place last year, but it was delayed until now. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet's production facility: "Accelerate the construction of the world's top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry." China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country's travel market expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around US$1 trillion. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for "everlasting", can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555km and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. COMAC made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co - COMAC's production arm. The Shanghai-based firm plans to become one of the world's leading civil aircraft manufacturer in the next three years, aiming to have the C919 and ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet made by COMAC, both certified to fly internationally. But it will be sometime before the C919 is ready to compete with the top-selling products of the world's aviation giants, said Bao. "The biggest challenge is that the whole manufacturing experience still needs improvement because this is the first time China is making a primary route plane," Bao told reporters before the flight. EARNING TRUST The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification. The Shanghai-based company is also aiming to have the plane certified by US and European regulators. COMAC's smaller, 90-seat ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification that would allow it to fly US skies.

Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. "China's big commercial jet project made a huge breakthrough. It is a major milestone of China´s aviation market," China's State Council said in a statement. State media said the plane flew at an altitude of around 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of more than 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. While delayed since last year, the flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. Workers watch a television video feed as a Chinese C919 passenger jet taxis after landing on its first flight at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai on May 5, 2017 China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. - $1 trillion market - President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet's production facility: "Accelerate the construction of the world's top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry." China is a massive battleground for Boeing and Airbus, with the country's travel market expected to surpass the United States by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for "everlasting", can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle Airbus and Boeing estimate that Chinese airlines will need between 6,000-6,800 aircraft at a total price of around $1 trillion. Both companies congratulated COMAC on the flight. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for "everlasting", can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555 kilometres (3,444 miles) and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. COMAC made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co., COMAC's production arm. The Shanghai-based firm aims to become one of the world's leading civil aircraft manufacturer in the next three years, seeking to have the C919 and its ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet, both certified to fly internationally. But it will be sometime before the C919 is ready to compete with the top-selling products of the world's aviation giants, said Bao. "The biggest challenge is that the whole manufacturing experience still needs improvement because this is the first time China is making a primary route plane," Bao said. - Earning trust - The C919 will need to pass more tests to obtain Chinese airworthiness certification and COMAC hopes to get the green light from US and European regulators. The ARJ21 plane, which entered service in 2016, several years late, is currently restricted to flying domestic routes as it still lacks the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. Another challenge for the C919 is earning consumers' trust, said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "It will take some time for customers around the world to be comfortable buying Chinese airplanes," he said, adding, "it's not going to happen in the next 10 years." "It's going to be incredibly tough not because it's not a good product. But because you need to get comfort and credibility to the product among potential clients, potential customers."

By Jon Ostrower SEATTLE (CNNMoney) -- China's first large jetliner has taken off on its maiden flight, a key moment in the country's push to challenge the U.S. and Europe as a global manufacturer. The C919, China's first domestically designed and built large airliner, took off from Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 2:01 p.m. local time with a five-person crew aboard. With the prototype airborne, China joins the ranks of the few nations that have developed homegrown large airliners: the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany. Made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the 168-seat C919 is roughly the same size as Airbus's A320 and Boeing's 737-800, which are the most popular airliners in the world. The Chinese jet's first flight is the biggest and most visible milestone in its development. But it still has a long way to go before it's carrying passengers and competing with its U.S. and European competitors. The start of aerial testing kicks off months or years of grueling certification tests, and meeting safety standards might require design changes. Comac will also need to win the trust of airlines in China and elsewhere by proving the jet can operate efficiently and reliably on scheduled flights. However, the milestone marks another key achievement for China on its ascent to challenging the west and cultivating its aerospace ambitions. The country is already an adept designer of military aircraft, but has sought to catch up to Boeing in the U.S. and Airbus in Europe in manufacturing civilian airliners. So far it's been slow-going. The country's state-owned airlines first signed up to buy the jet in 2010, and it was originally supposed to enter service in 2016. The prototype wasn't unveiled until November 2015, and the project has been beset by technical delays as China learns the ropes of airliner development. Comac, a state-run enterprise, has partnered with western suppliers for nearly all the jet's major systems to share technology and learn how to mass produce an airliner. The C919's main customers will be China's domestic airlines. China Eastern Airlines will be the first carrier to operate the C919 when it completes testing and secures approval from China's aviation regulator. China is on track to surpass the U.S. by 2030 as the world's largest commercial aviation market. Chinese airlines are buying hundreds of Boeing and Airbus jets to grow their fleets. Boeing estimates that the country will need a trillion dollars worth of new airplanes over the next two decades, including more than 5,100 of the same size as the C919.

The C919, China’s first domestically designed and built large airliner, took off from Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 2:01 p.m. local time on Friday into hazy skies with a five-person crew aboard. With the prototype airborne, China joins the ranks of the few nations that have developed homegrown large airliners: the U.S., Russia, Brazil, Canada, the U.K., France and Germany. Made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the 168-seat C919 is roughly the same size as Airbus’s A320 and Boeing’s 737-800, which are the most popular airliners in the world. The takeoff in Shanghai on Friday afternoon was watched by people around the globe, including at least 2 million on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo. Comac also offered an unprecedented look inside the maiden flight of a new airliner. The company streamed live images from the jet’s cockpit looking over the shoulder of its test pilots as they performed gentle maneuvers off the coast. Neither Boeing nor Airbus has ever provided a live view of the cockpit on a first flight. The Chinese jet’s first flight is the biggest and most visible milestone in its development.

The maiden test flight of the C919 airliner made a successful takeoff, and landing, after a 90-minute flight from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Friday, according to a livestream via Twitter carried on China's official news agency Xinhua. The plane's flight was watched by a large crowd gathered at the airport. The C919 has more than 150 seats and a range of 4,075 kilometers (2,532 miles), and is meant to compete with the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, among the most popular commercial planes flying in the skies. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, the state-owned company behind the plane, said 21 customers had placed orders for more than 500 planes by the end of 2016, and it expected sales to exceed 2,000, state media said. Livestream Tweet China is making a big push to become a global aviation player, looking to compete with the likes of Airbus and Boeing. Establishing itself in this industry has been hailed a "strategic move" by President Xi Jinping, according to written remarks published by state media outlets. Beijing has also identified domestic development and production of engines and planes as a major goal. Friday's maiden flight will be a key milestone for the C919, which has been plagued by delays. Final ground tests only concluded a few weeks ago, much later than the original schedule of a first flight in 2014, and aircraft delivery in 2016. Still, it will still be a while before travelers can board the plane – the C919 still needs to undergo other safety and certification checks. China is expected to beat the U.S. as the world's largest aviation market by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. And it's going to be big business for a range of sectors, from tourism to airplane makers as the country's airlines buy more planes and add more routes. Boeing has estimated that China will need to buy up $1 trillion worth of planes – about 6,810 sets of wings – over the next two decades in order to meet demand. — Barry Huang contributed to this story.

More than 440 companies from 28 countries have filed applications for participation in the MAKS’2017 aerospace show, the press service of the Ministry of Industry and Trade said on Thursday upon the results of a meeting of the show’s organizing committee. "Participation of the world’s leading developers of aerospace technologies proves foreign companies continue being interested in cooperation with Russian manufacturers of aircraft and space technologies," Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said. All the major Russian companies designing and developing aircraft, space and defense technologies will be represented at MAKS’2017, he said. Among the international participants, Manturov pointed out the European Space Agency (ESA), Airbus, Boeing, Rolls Royce, and Safran Group. Belarus, France, Iran, Belgium, the Czech Republic, and Canada plan to have their national pavilions. The participating nations, agencies and corporations have reserved 18,000 square meters of floor space in the pavilions and in open-space areas. MAKS’2017, the thirteenth show in the Moscow International Aerospace Shows series, will take place in the town of Zhukovsky to the southeast of Moscow from July 18 through July 23. Three aerobatic groups of the Russian Aerospace Force - Russkiye Vityazi (Russian Knights), Strizhi (Swifts) and Sokoly Rossii (Russian Falcons) - have confirmed their participation in the program of exhibition flights that traditionally attract thousands upon thousands of visitors to Zhukovsky.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Local gymnast has big goals at Junior Olympic Nationals Nick Patterson Fri May 5th, 2017 10:42pm Sports You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Ashley Albrecht is determined to go out with a bang. The Leading Edge Gymnastics Academy member and senior at Cascade High School is representing Leading Edge for the final time this weekend when she competes at the 2017 Junior Olympic National Championships in Indianapolis. Because of that, Albrecht is motivated to do something special. “I’m super excited,” she said prior to departing for Indianapolis. “This is my fourth (national championships) and I have goals that I hope to make.” Albrecht has been a member of Leading Edge since she was 4 years old, so nearly her entire life has been spent at the gym that is now located near Boeing in south Everett. She’s been the club’s shining star, reaching nationals each of the past four years. Following nationals, she gets ready to depart for the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she has a full scholarship to compete in gymnastics. “It’s pretty rare that you find a gymnast who is pretty fearless and comes in every day with a smile on her face,” Albrecht’s coach, Casey Rigby, said. “It’s a very rare thing, so her personality will be missed next year when she goes to college.” But Albrecht wants to leave Leading Edge with one final memento before she departs — a podium finish at nationals. Albrecht heads to nationals full of confidence. The powerhouse tumbler qualified by winning the Level 10 all-around at the 2017 USA Gymnastics Region 2 Championships on April 7-9 in Boise, Idaho. At regionals she dominated her division, not only winning the all-around with a score of 37.300, but also finishing first on the vault (9.525), the balance beam (9.400) and in the floor exercises (9.625). “I performed well on every event but (uneven) bars,” Albrecht said of regionals. “But I was pleased with my other three events. “I thought my floor routine was my best,” Albrecht added. “I stuck all my tumbling passes and just sold my routine.” Now it’s off for a fourth bite at Level 10 nationals. Albrecht made progress in each of her previous trips to the national stage, cracking the top 10 in her division last year when she finished 10th in the all-around with a score of 37.675. This year, she doesn’t just want to take another step, she wants to make a leap. “My goal is to score a 38 and place in the top five,” Albrecht said. “I was in the top 10 last year, which is pretty good for me, and I was close to a 38.” Albrecht has an additional advantage upon reaching the national stage: her temperament. Most gymnasts at major events remain tense and nervous during competition. Not Albrecht. Her coaches marvel at the way she remains loose and goofy in even the tensest of competitive circumstances. “It seems stressful, but it’s really not,” Albrecht said of performing in the pressure cooker of nationals. “It’s actually quite calming sometimes. I know all the numbers that I put into practice (25 hours a week year round) help me to perform.” But will it be enough to help her reach her goal of finishing in the top five this weekend? “I think she’s very capable of being in the top five,” Rigby said. “Nationals is every gymnast in the country, every Level 10 in the country competing for this huge title. So getting on the podium is a huge deal, and I think top five is well within her reach.” And if Albrecht is able to pull it off, it will be the perfect ending to what’s been a storied career with Leading Edge.

A one-off masterpiece of engineering designed and built during the 1980s in the waning days of the USSR. The aircraft, designated the An-225, is the biggest to ever grace the Earth. It’s so large that the length of its cargo hold is longer than the Wright brothers’ first flight, from take-off to landing. Now 30 years old, and recently upgraded to give it another 20 years’ service, the plane rarely takes to the skies anymore. Instead, it sits stagnant under an enormous steel arch. However, a crew of dedicated Antonov employees still periodically tend to the An-225. Its sporadic use has nothing to do with its age. It’s grounded because there is simply little demand for its highly specialised and relatively costly service. Although the plane, nicknamed ‘Mriya’ (‘Dream’) in Ukrainian, is in fine condition, there are very few jobs that call for something so large . And the jobs need to be urgent; if you want to use the An-225 it will cost around $30,000 (£23,220) an hour. In 2016, it spent just three months traversing the globe on two lengthy deployments. The remainder of the time, it sat here at the Gostomel airport, once a top-secret flight testing airfield for Antonov. Originally built as a transport for the Soviet Union’s Buran space shuttle, the An-225 was forced to find new purpose as a cargo carrier after the USSR collapsed, says Alexander Galunenko, the first man to fly the plane. “When the USSR collapsed, the programme was shut down and the financing was closed as the need for this plane vanished,” says Galunenko. He first flew the An-225 on 21 December 1988, after over a decade’s service as a Soviet test pilot. Galunenko fondly remembers the bewilderment of first taking the behemoth across the world to visit the United States. “We were invited to an aviation show in Oklahoma and the media reported that the largest aircraft in the world was coming so that attracted a mass of people,” he says. “All of these people just assumed that the largest aircraft in the world was made by the Boeing company. We had to tell them it was made by Antonov, and they asked, ‘Where is Antonov from?’ We said, ‘It’s a company in Kiev’, so they asked us, ‘And what is Kiev?’ Well we told them ‘Kiev is in Ukraine’, and of course they asked, ‘But what is Ukraine?’” The navigator of the flight eventually pulled out his maps and began to point out Ukraine to the many curious visitors. “He took a marker and circled Kiev to show them where it is,” laughs Galunenko. “We got to show our plane and give the Americans a geography lesson too.” The An-225 in pictures: Up close with the world’s largest plane The plane is effectively an extension of its little brother, the An-124 ‘Ruslan’ – an aircraft rarely regarded as “little”, seeing as it’s the largest military transport in the world. From a room adorned with scale models of every aircraft the company has built in its 71-year history, the lead engineer of the An-225 project, Nikolay Kalashnikov, tells BBC Future that he spent his entire professional life working for Antonov. But it was building the Mriya that was the pinnacle of his career. “Today it’s hard to tell, but back then it was so impressive. It was just so difficult to imagine that such a big machine can fly,” says Kalashnikov. Although the An-124 Ruslan was already an impressively sized cargo carrier at that time, Kalashnikov and his team set about modifying the structure to increase its maximum takeoff weight. They added two engines, rows of landing gear, extended the fuselage and redesigned the tail in order to meet the most important requirement, which was to ensure that the Buran space-shuttle and the Energia booster rocket could slide off the plane midflight and take off into space. “It was possible to carry everything, the shuttle and all the elements of the rocket on the back of the aircraft,” says energetic CEO of Antonov Airlines, Mikhail Kharchenko, from his office at the Gostomel airport. “The idea hasn’t gone away. The United States is now working on an air-start programme.” At that time, the USSR’s space missions were run from what is now southern Kazakhstan, at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. So the AN-225’s mission was to bring the booster rockets from Moscow and ferry the Buran itself to Baikonaur. They calculated that the AN-225 programme would be cheaper than building a freeway across two rivers and through the Urals just to move these parts, says Kalashnikov. Kharchenko believes that the Mriya still has huge potential, despite its age, and it’s not just for its enormous cargo capacity. He thinks there’s still the chance to develop the An-225 into a proper in-air launch platform. “Approximately 90% of the energy of the launch vehicle is spent getting up to an altitude of 10km (6.5 miles) ,” says the CEO. “If we take some spacecraft and put it on the Mriya’s back and fly it up to a height of 10km, then we can launch it into space from there. From the point of view of cost, the economic benefit is huge if you launch from a height of 10km.” He admits it’s still going to take a little bit of refinement, but Kharchenko believes this is the best direction for his company’s flagship aircraft. And he’s not the only one. In 2016, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AICC), a Chinese state-owned aerospace and defense company, signed a cooperation agreement with Antonov for the An-225 program. If it goes through as planned, the skies could soon be flooded by a fleet of Chinese built An-225s. “The initial idea and early stage research of the An-225 started in 2009,” the president of AICC, Zhang Youshengtells BBC Future. “The official contact with Antonov began in 2011, and then from 2013 to 2016 was the acceleration phase of this project.” The Chinese company isn’t interested in purchasing the existing airworthy An-225. They have spent the past several years studying the feasibility of modernising the only other An-225, an unfinished airframe that has sat inside a hangar at Antonov’s giant corporate campus in downtown Kyiv for the past 30 years. This aircraft, when modernised, could give China a heavy lift capability that surpasses any other nation in the world – perhaps even greater than that of the US military. According to Zhang, the An-225 would be the centrepiece of a hyper ambitious plan to add 1,000 heavy lift aircraft over the next 10 years. Heavy lift is not the only capability they’re after though. “The An-225 can be equipped with spacecraft to high altitude, and can launch commercial satellites at any height below 12,000m,” Zhang tells the BBC. “Its launch time is flexible, accurate, and can quickly send the satellite into intended orbit, which greatly reduces launch costs.” The Chinese are aiming to make their way into the lucrative satellite launch industry, which doubled revenue from 2006 to 2015, according to figures provided by AICC. The purchase agreement for the existing An-225 airframe is similar to China’s acquisition of an aircraft carrier hull from Ukraine nearly 20 years ago. That hull, originally commissioned by the Soviet Union, was rebuilt and modernised over two decades until it was declared ‘combat ready’ by China’s military in November 2016. If the plan goes forward, the Mriya will have found new life flying the skies for China’s AICC, but Ukraine will have lost of a small but symbolic part of its aerospace industry. The men who built the plane have mixed feelings about the prospect of losing the programme to the Chinese. “The Chinese want to buy from us this plane and there’s no harm in it, but of course no one wants to sell the aircraft,” says Kalashnikov. “The Mriya is not separable from Ukraine, it’s like our child, and it’s something our children, and our grandchildren can always be proud of.” Join 800,000+ Future fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.

[Photo/Xinhua]  The C919, China’s first homegrown large passenger plane, made its debut flight on Friday in Shanghai, a breakthrough in the country’s innovation and manufacturing drive and a change to the landscape of the global civil aviation market. The successful test flight of the C919 comes only nine days after the country debuted its first homegrown aircraft carrier in Dalian, Liaoning province, showing the world its manufacturing prowess, development of advanced technology and national ambition to regain past glory. After the flight, which lasted about 79 minutes at an altitude of 3,000 meters and an average speed of 300 km/h, the plane returned to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, from which it had taken off at 2 pm. “All the activities made in the air are normal. The C919’s debut flight is a complete success,” said Cai Jun, captain of the flight. In a letter of congratulation to the C919 project, the State Council said: “The successful maiden flight of the C919 marks a milestone for China’s aviation industry. The project carries great weight and importance to the country’s innovation drive and manufacturing upgrade push. “It is also a shot in the arm for the ongoing supply-side reform,” the letter said. “The large passenger aircraft flying in the blue sky makes generations of Chinese people’s dream come true.” About 3,000 people witnessed the historic moment of the first flight of the narrow-body jetliner. Before the flight, the C919, whose enhanced version has a range of 5,555 kilometers, passed a series of strict tests after rolling off the assembly line in November 2015. Zhou Guirong, deputy chief designer of the C919, said more than 50 percent of its parts and components were domestically made, either by Chinese companies or joint ventures in China. Since launching the C919 project, the plane’s research team has made 102 technological breakthroughs in areas including integrated design of engines and systems control. With 158 to 174 seats, the twin-engine, single-aisle aircraft will be used for medium-haul commercial flights. The State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, which manufactured the C919, has received 570 orders for the C919 from23 clients. According to its designers, the commercialization of the C919 will take two to three years before getting certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035. With China’s aviation market growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business, the C919 aircraft is also expected to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market, which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. “We believe the C919 will bring new competition to the market, and we welcome com-petition, which is good to the development of the industry,” said Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China. Kevin McAllister, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, expressed his congratulations on behalf of Boeing for the C919’s successful debut flight. “This is a great achievement in the history of COMAC and an important milestone for Chinese aviation,” he said. Federico Marziali, head of quality management of Dornier Seawings GmbH, said he is very impressed by the size of the COMAC C919 project. “I can imagine the huge production ability once it starts production, by the size.” Meanwhile, Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com, one of China’s largest civil aviation web portals, said there is still a long way to go before the C919 enters the market. “Apart from meeting flight safety standards, the C919 team has to make sure all things go right, such as the reliability, fuel efficiency, maintenance cost, as well as the comfort level of the aircraft. They should all be considered before it is put into use in the market,” Lin said. The C919 project was launched in 2006. Two years later, the C919 maker COMAC was established in Shanghai. Plans for the plane, which was originally due to fly in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, were postponed for manufacturing reasons.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on May 6, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: May 6, 2017 @ 3:10 pm Filed Under: Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific Region, Business, China, China State Council Information Office, Economics, English, Internet Communications Technology, Manufacturing, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Peoples Republic Of China, PRC State Government, Technology NEXT ARTICLE → Air China inaugurates Barcelona-Shanghai direct flight ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE EU pushing Britain towards nationalism About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts EU pushing Britain towards nationalism C919 takes wing, marks milestone Air China inaugurates Barcelona-Shanghai direct flight Sandstorm expected to hit south West Lake patrol officer saves lives, smartphones © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

Ed Lazowska of the University of Washington takes home the Geek of the Year award at the 2017 GeekWire Awards. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) The University of Washington’s fingerprints were all over last night’s GeekWire Awards. Two of the Deal of the Year finalists, Impinj’s IPO and Turi’s $200 million acquisition by Apple, have ties to UW. Ed Lazowska, the longtime UW computer science professor who is spearheading the campaign for a second computer science building that will double the capacity of the program, took home this year’s Geek of the Year award. And one of his fellow nominees was Connie Bourassa-Shaw, who spent nearly two decades building UW’s entrepreneurship programs and announced plans earlier this year to step down. RELATED: GeekWire Awards 2017: Photos, videos, tweets and more from our annual celebration of NW tech Lazowska came up again later in the show, when Microsoft’s Project Catapult took home the award for Innovation of the Year. Andrew Putnam, principal research hardware design engineer at Microsoft Research, called out Lazowska for being “one of many reasons why I came to the University of Washington computer science program.” “We kept it around UW and kept it local,” Putnam said of his project. “Now we are changing the world. I hope you guys can use our AI and cloud platform for your next innovations.” Lazowska has been with UW since 1977, and he has been instrumental in the rise of the university’s computer science program, transforming it into a top-tier destination for aspiring computer science students.   Computer science is now the most in-demand major at UW, surpassing business. In addition to the new building, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen recently made a $40 million contribution, combined with an additional $10 million from Microsoft in Allen’s honor, to create a $50 million endowment for a new Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the UW. In addition to his win at the GeekWire Awards, Lazowska was honored today at the Technology Alliance luncheon in downtown Seattle. He received a standing ovation after he was introduced by UW President Ana Mari Cauce. He has been a “tireless, selfless champion” for technology and computer science in Washington state for the past 40 years, Cauce said. Lazowska has on the Tech Alliance board for the past 20 years — “uniting business, research and education leaders around the importance of computer science to our very much innovation-driven economy,” she said, touting his new status as Geek of the Year. Lazowska spoke to GeekWire at the awards last night — just before hopping on his bicycle to head to his Ballard home — and talked about the growth of the school over the years, how he stays connected to the Seattle tech scene and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. The conversation has been edited for style, length and clarity. Paul G. Allen (center) discusses a new $50 million endowment to create the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering with Hank Levy (left), Wissner-Slivka Chair in Computer Science & Engineering and director of the new school, and Ed Lazowska (right), Bill & Melinda Gates Chair in Computer Science & Engineering at the UW. GeekWire: How important has this year been for computer science at UW? Ed Lazowska: I’ve been here 40 years, and every year has been better than the one that came before. I say to people when I moved here, technology was Boeing making planes, and Fluke making voltmeters, and Physio-Control making defibrillators. Microsoft was 13 people in Albuquerque. Now you guys talk about 86 engineering offices of companies headquartered elsewhere that are here, in addition to all our great homegrown companies. What I love is graduating more fantastic students every year and seeing them out there, doing great. Obviously this year getting our new building under way was really important, and then the Paul G. Allen School is super important. Those are both the biggies for me, because they are the future. The new building doubles our capacity, and the Allen School is just monumentally important. Partly, it’s just being associated in perpetuity with Paul, one of the greats, somebody who is a real visionary – an ‘Idea Man,’ as the book says. To be joined at the hip with him for the future is important, and the program being a school at UW is important. It elevates our status. GW: How do you continue to foster relationships with the Seattle tech scene as new companies come to town and homegrown companies grow?  We spent 50 years making things smaller and faster and less expensive, and now we are going to spend 50 years attacking societal challenges. EL: Part of it is just personal, individuals working with individuals. UW has been very liberal in allowing relationships with companies. We have two faculty members who are essentially half-time at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, in addition to Oren Etzioni, who has left our faculty to run it. Why do we do that? If Paul Allen can do for artificial intelligence what he did for brain science, this is going to be transformational for Seattle and for us, so for gosh sakes go do it. We have a faculty member at Facebook now, doing face type stuff. The students create these relationships for us. We stay in very close touch with the students here and in the Bay Area. We have this Industry Affiliates meeting once a year, it’s sort of a small company and startup recruitment day, then a research day, then a major company recruiting day. Long ago, 20 years ago, we elected to set the price of membership incredibly low, and the reason is, we decided it was more important to focus on friend-raising than fundraising. Here we were in Seattle, with this incredible wealth of small companies headquartered here, and we decided that getting them in and connected was the important thing. I think connection to the community has always been really important to us. The planned UW Computer Science & Engineering Building. (LMN Architects Rendering) GW: What changes do you see in computer science education going forward? EL: It’s the recognition of computer science as central to everything, and that’s really important. It’s not just software, it’s biology, you name it, computer science is at the center of it. We spent 50 years making things smaller and faster and less expensive, and now we are going to spend 50 years attacking societal challenges. Whether it’s healthcare or transportation or energy efficiency or education, whatever you care about, you better care about computer science because we are central to tackling all of those things, and that’s a really important change in the nature of the field. There’s plenty of stuff still making things smaller and faster and cheaper, but it’s now really affecting people’s lives in ways that go far beyond a word processor or printing your paycheck. You look at what is happening in AI these days, and you look at the potential of deep learning, autonomous vehicles, and things like that. It’s utterly mind-boggling. GW: What does UW have to do to maintain its presence in the tech community as more companies come here? EL: We are a community here. It is astonishing the amount of support we get. What we have to do as a university, as a computer science department, is stay connected to that community. That’s really the strength. I am working hard to transition to others a certain amount of that connectivity that has traditionally been me. And I am a control freak, so I am not very good at bringing others along to take on my responsibilities, and that’s terrible. You should be judged on the succession plan you put into place, less by what you did and more by how things continue afterwards, so I am trying to be really serious about that now, partly because of lectures from friends. Those relationships need to belong to UW Computer Science and Engineering, the Paul G. Allen School, not to Ed. That’s the challenge: Making sure I cement the relationships between all these people and institutions and companies in the community to the Paul G. Allen School, so that it doesn’t matter if I am there or not. University of Washington’s Ed Lazowska and Connie Bourassa-Shaw catch up prior to the 2017 GeekWire Awards. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) GW: What do you see as the biggest challenges for your programs in the coming years? EL: We all know that universities do research, but fundamentally we are in the education business, and we are in the education business for Washington state’s kids. And scaling is very difficult, because when we get funded for enrollment expansion we take students right away, and it takes forever to hire the faculty. That’s because it is a dog-eat-dog world for the best people. And we are fighting with Stanford and Berkeley and MIT and Carnegie Mellon and basically nobody else, so it is pretty fast company.   I am completely infatuated with my Echo. We use it for all sorts of stuff, and it’s great. I think it’s phenomenal how right Amazon got this, by having it do a limited set of tasks in a way it could perform with 100 percent accuracy. The rate at which we can grow the faculty is far less than the rate at which we can grow the student body, and now the question is, how do you keep the educational quality up when class sizes are large? This quarter we have 200 undergraduate teaching assistants in our program, so astonishingly, a significant portion of our undergraduate student body is involved in teaching other undergrads. It’s how we are making up for the lack of faculty. So the challenge is keeping the quality up so that Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook and the startups want to hire these students, and doing that in this period when we are not in steady state. The students are coming in, and the faculty is coming in much more slowly. It’s a nationwide problem. Two years ago there was a graduate machine learning-course at Stanford with 760 students in it. You don’t go to Stanford to sit in a classroom with 760 graduate students – give me a break! Ed Lazowska at the 2017 GeekWire Awards. (GeekWire Photo / Kevin Lisota) GW: What is a piece of tech you can’t live without, and not just something simple like a smartphone or email? EL: I am completely infatuated with my Echo. We use it for all sorts of stuff, and it’s great. I think it’s phenomenal how right Amazon got this, by having it do a limited set of tasks in a way it could perform with 100 percent accuracy. Two years ago, it was so great to be able to say “Alexa, turn on Christmas,” and suddenly all the outdoor lights go on. It’s like the greatest stupid pet trick in the world. I’ve told people at Amazon that their mistake was selling Echos so cheaply and not investing in the companies that make Z-Wave switches and outlets, because I probably spent $2,000 refitting all my outlets and switches in my home, and I didn’t spend anything on my Echo because somebody gave it to me. Had I bought it, it would have been at 10 percent of what I spent on Z-Wave switches. We also are like the last people on earth to have bought a Roomba. We don’t have kids at home anymore. We don’t have pets. But still, it’s amazing how much crap this thing picks up. The first few times we ran it, my wife and I would spend an hour following the damn thing around the house watching what it was doing. It’s incredibly cool. It’s not like this is AI rocket science, but it’s a very sophisticated device that does a great job. These things that are part of your daily life are what’s really going on now, and it’s super exciting.

[Photo/Xinhua]  The C919, China's first homegrown large passenger plane, made its debut flight on Friday in Shanghai, a breakthrough in the country's innovation and manufacturing drive and a change to the landscape of the global civil aviation market. The successful test flight of the C919 comes only nine days after the country debuted its first homegrown aircraft carrier in Dalian, Liaoning province, showing the world its manufacturing prowess, development of advanced technology and national ambition to regain past glory. After the flight, which lasted about 79 minutes at an altitude of 3,000 meters and an average speed of 300 km/h, the plane returned to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, from which it had taken off at 2 pm. "All the activities made in the air are normal. The C919's debut flight is a complete success," said Cai Jun, captain of the flight. In a letter of congratulation to the C919 project, the State Council said: "The successful maiden flight of the C919 marks a milestone for China's aviation industry. The project carries great weight and importance to the country's innovation drive and manufacturing upgrade push. "It is also a shot in the arm for the ongoing supply-side reform," the letter said. "The large passenger aircraft flying in the blue sky makes generations of Chinese people's dream come true." About 3,000 people witnessed the historic moment of the first flight of the narrow-body jetliner. Before the flight, the C919, whose enhanced version has a range of 5,555 kilometers, passed a series of strict tests after rolling off the assembly line in November 2015. Zhou Guirong, deputy chief designer of the C919, said more than 50 percent of its parts and components were domestically made, either by Chinese companies or joint ventures in China. Since launching the C919 project, the plane's research team has made 102 technological breakthroughs in areas including integrated design of engines and systems control. With 158 to 174 seats, the twin-engine, single-aisle aircraft will be used for medium-haul commercial flights. The State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China, which manufactured the C919, has received 570 orders for the C919 from23 clients. According to its designers, the commercialization of the C919 will take two to three years before getting certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Boeing earlier predicted that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035. With China's aviation market growing rapidly as a rising middle class travels more for leisure and business, the C919 aircraft is also expected to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market, which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. "We believe the C919 will bring new competition to the market, and we welcome com-petition, which is good to the development of the industry," said Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China. Kevin McAllister, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, expressed his congratulations on behalf of Boeing for the C919's successful debut flight. "This is a great achievement in the history of COMAC and an important milestone for Chinese aviation," he said. Federico Marziali, head of quality management of Dornier Seawings GmbH, said he is very impressed by the size of the COMAC C919 project. "I can imagine the huge production ability once it starts production, by the size." Meanwhile, Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and columnist at Carnoc.com, one of China's largest civil aviation web portals, said there is still a long way to go before the C919 enters the market. "Apart from meeting flight safety standards, the C919 team has to make sure all things go right, such as the reliability, fuel efficiency, maintenance cost, as well as the comfort level of the aircraft. They should all be considered before it is put into use in the market," Lin said. The C919 project was launched in 2006. Two years later, the C919 maker COMAC was established in Shanghai. Plans for the plane, which was originally due to fly in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016, were postponed for manufacturing reasons.

The passenger aircraft, which experts say could shatter the Boeing-Airbus duopoly in a few years, took off around 2:00 pm local time from Shanghais Pudong International Airport, was airborne 80 minutes and landed without reporting any problems. Hundreds of officials and guests witnessed the takeoff of the C919, which was built by the state-run Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) in collaboration with some 200 companies from the sector and around 70 material and parts suppliers from several countries. Following repeated delays in construction and test deadlines, expectations were high ahead of the planes maiden flight. The fully-built jet ready for taxi tests was unveiled in November 2015, but its flight trial was delayed on numerous occasions until finally taking place Friday. During the flight, pilots said they conducted several tests successfully. The C901 is a narrow-body aircraft  similar to over half the commercial planes currently active worldwide  and can carry between 158 to 174 passengers, with a range of 4,075 and 5,555 kilometers (2,532 to 3,452 miles). Equivalent models manufactured by its main rivals and market leaders in the aviation sector are the Boeing 737 (United States), and the Airbus A320, headquartered in France. Following the C919s successful maiden flight, COMAC will be able to obtain the Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA) from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and other international regulators before making its first deliveries. COMAC has said a total of 23 national and international clients have placed orders for 570 C919 jets, construction on which is set to begin soon at a rate of 150 planes annually.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved
X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 6 May 2017 Made-in-China passenger plane makes maiden flight SHANGHAI: The first large made-in-China passenger plane successfully completed its maiden test flight, marking a key milestone on the country’s ambitious journey to compete with the world’s leading aircraft makers. The narrow-body C919 jet – white with green and blue stripes – disappeared into the clouds after taking off from Pudong International Airport in the commercial hub Shang­hai as a crowd of thousands cheered. It landed some 80 minutes later. Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. The flight is the latest sign of China’s growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first do­­mestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. Before takeoff, CCTV state television said the plane would be tested at an altitude of 3,000m, some 7,000m lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of around 300kph. Top officials, Comac staff and company partners attended the inaugural flight, which was shown live on state television. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never en­­tered service. President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project, visiting Comac even before he took office in 2013. The first flight was supposed to take place last year, but was delayed until now. The twin-engine C919, whose name sounds like the Chinese word for “everlasting”, can seat 168 passengers in an arrangement similar to other narrow-body jets: three white-velvet upholstered seats line each side of its central aisle. It has a range of 5,555km and has received 570 orders, almost all from domestic airlines. Comac made two planes for the test flight and it expects to produce four more by 2019, said Bao Pengli, deputy head of Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co. – Comac’s production arm. The Shanghai-based firm plans to become one of the world’s leading civil aircraft manufacturers in the next three years, aiming to have the C919 and ARJ21, a smaller 90-seat regional jet made by Comac, both certified to fly internationally. — AFP Tags / Keywords: world Related Stories Related Stories Beijing objects to US hearing on HK China calls on Japan to resolve issues, marks 45 years of relations ‘Security needs vital for new Silk Road plan’ Sandstorm engulfs one-sixth of country S.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Top 5 Vendors in the Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle Market from 2017 to 2021: Technavio LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Technavio has announced the top five leading vendors in their recent global unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) market report. This research report also lists four other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. UCAVs are in the early stage of development, and very limited countries possess sufficient capabilities to design and develop attack drone platforms. The use of attack UAVs is increasingly gaining momentum among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allied countries, like the US, Israel, South Korea, and Australia. Competitive vendor landscape The global UCAV market is highly competitive with many prominent players competing to augment their market share. However, the entry of new vendors is expected to be restricted during the forecast period due to the stringent safety and regulatory norms along with the need for superior investments. “Due to the rapid adoption of UCAVs for airstrike capabilities, they need to be developed and supplied cost effectively and embed effective payloads that can enhance their operation capabilities,” says Moutushi Saha, a lead defense research analyst from Technavio. Companies with superior technical and financial resources can bring substantial change in the existing payloads and subsystems, which will help them realize the development costs in shorter development cycle time. Meanwhile, small companies can establish collaborations to compete with the existing prominent vendors. Technavio’s insights help you make informed business decisions: Buy this report now Technavio reports answer key questions relating to market size and growth, drivers and trends, top vendors, challenges, and more. Their analysts continuously monitor and evaluate the market landscape to help businesses assess their competitive position. Top five UCAV market vendors BAE Systems BAE Systems designed and developed, Taranis, as a part of the British Demonstrator Program for UCAVs. In 2014, parts of Taranis were combined under the contract of Anglo-French development with the Dassault nEUROn (a joint European UCAV project). Currently, BAE Systems is working on the development of autonomous drone targeting. Boeing Boeing participated in the development of the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) X-45 drone, which was the first highly autonomous, unmanned system. The UCAV was designed specifically for combat operations in various network-centric scenarios. Under this program, the company designed and developed several combat drones such as X-45A, X-245B, and X-45C. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) designs and develops UCAVs such as Predator B (which was renamed as MQ-9 Reaper), Gray Eagle, and Predator-C Avenger. In 2016, the US Army awarded a contract to General Atomics to provide four MQ-1C Gray Eagle reconnaissance and attack drones. By 2018, the modified MQ-9 Reaper is expected to enter into service with the RAF, UK. Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) combined various capabilities and lethal missiles for the development of Harop UCAV, which is designed to search, find, identify, attack, and destroy targets as well as execute battle damage assessment. The UCAV is currently operated by India, Israel, and Azerbaijan. In 2016, Harop was deployed for the first time by Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman develops both surveillance and attack-enable UAVs (UCAVs) for the US and NATO allied countries globally. Northrop Grumman designed and developed the X-47B, a demonstration UCAV, as a part of DARPA’s J-UCAS program. The company also manufacturers X-47A Pegasus, a stealth technology demonstrator UCAV.

Under overcast skies, the white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned on its tail, touched down at Shanghai's international airport after an 80-minute flight to cheers from thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth US$2 trillion (S$2.8 trillion) over the next two decades, as well as of Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products. "Seeing the C919 take off into the sky made me quite emotional. This is a moment we have waited to see for a very long time," 42-year-old Wang Mingfeng told Reuters. At the moment, though, Boeing and Airbus remain far ahead in terms of sales, technical know- how and order books. And the C919, whose test flight was pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, may need years of tests to get certified in China, as well as in the United States and Europe. Yesterday, it flew north over the Yangtze River delta, carried out manoeuvres and then returned south along the coast before landing, according to aircraft tracker Flightradar24. State media said the plane flew at around 3,000m above ground and at speeds of 290 to 300kmh. The crew of five pilots and engineers, all wearing orange jumpsuits and aviators, were applauded as they disembarked. The plane, which can carry 158 to 168 passengers, had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. A letter from China's ministerial Cabinet, read out after the plane landed, said the successful flight marked a "major breakthrough" and milestone for China's passenger jet industry. The Industry Ministry said in a statement that the flight went smoothly and that all of the plane's systems functioned properly. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), relies on overseas technology from firms, including General Electric, France's Safran, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which Comac says has 570 orders from 23 customers. Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 per cent of the aircraft in service globally. However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and US regulators as without their certification, it would be able to sell the jet to only a handful of countries. Beijing is already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. Last November, Comac and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

Top 5 Vendors in the Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle Market from 2017 to 2021: Technavio Technavio has published a new report on the global UCAV market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global UCAV market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 05, 2017 04:23 PM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Technavio has announced the top five leading vendors in their recent global unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) market report. This research report also lists four other prominent vendors that are expected to impact the market during the forecast period. UCAVs are in the early stage of development, and very limited countries possess sufficient capabilities to design and develop attack drone platforms. The use of attack UAVs is increasingly gaining momentum among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allied countries, like the US, Israel, South Korea, and Australia. Competitive vendor landscape The global UCAV market is highly competitive with many prominent players competing to augment their market share. However, the entry of new vendors is expected to be restricted during the forecast period due to the stringent safety and regulatory norms along with the need for superior investments. “Due to the rapid adoption of UCAVs for airstrike capabilities, they need to be developed and supplied cost effectively and embed effective payloads that can enhance their operation capabilities,” says Moutushi Saha, a lead defense research analyst from Technavio. Companies with superior technical and financial resources can bring substantial change in the existing payloads and subsystems, which will help them realize the development costs in shorter development cycle time. Meanwhile, small companies can establish collaborations to compete with the existing prominent vendors. Technavio’s insights help you make informed business decisions: Buy this report now Technavio reports answer key questions relating to market size and growth, drivers and trends, top vendors, challenges, and more. Their analysts continuously monitor and evaluate the market landscape to help businesses assess their competitive position. Top five UCAV market vendors BAE Systems BAE Systems designed and developed, Taranis, as a part of the British Demonstrator Program for UCAVs. In 2014, parts of Taranis were combined under the contract of Anglo-French development with the Dassault nEUROn (a joint European UCAV project). Currently, BAE Systems is working on the development of autonomous drone targeting. Boeing Boeing participated in the development of the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) X-45 drone, which was the first highly autonomous, unmanned system. The UCAV was designed specifically for combat operations in various network-centric scenarios. Under this program, the company designed and developed several combat drones such as X-45A, X-245B, and X-45C. General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) designs and develops UCAVs such as Predator B (which was renamed as MQ-9 Reaper), Gray Eagle, and Predator-C Avenger. In 2016, the US Army awarded a contract to General Atomics to provide four MQ-1C Gray Eagle reconnaissance and attack drones. By 2018, the modified MQ-9 Reaper is expected to enter into service with the RAF, UK. Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) combined various capabilities and lethal missiles for the development of Harop UCAV, which is designed to search, find, identify, attack, and destroy targets as well as execute battle damage assessment. The UCAV is currently operated by India, Israel, and Azerbaijan. In 2016, Harop was deployed for the first time by Azerbaijan in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Northrop Grumman Northrop Grumman develops both surveillance and attack-enable UAVs (UCAVs) for the US and NATO allied countries globally. Northrop Grumman designed and developed the X-47B, a demonstration UCAV, as a part of DARPA's J-UCAS program. The company also manufacturers X-47A Pegasus, a stealth technology demonstrator UCAV.

While Delta will take five A350-900s this year as planned, it wants to postpone deliveries slated for 2019 and 2020 by three years, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified since the talks are private. The Atlanta-based airline has been reviewing whether it needs the 50 wide-body aircraft on order from the planemaker as it attempts to balance international flying capacity with demand. The move underscores the difficulty that Airbus has faced with its marquee jet in the U.S. -- the largest aviation market and a Boeing Co. stronghold. United Continental Holdings Inc. has cooled on a larger model of the twin-engine plane, and American Airlines Group Inc. said last month that it would put arrival of its first A350 on hold a second time, to late 2020. Spokesmen for Delta and Airbus declined to comment. Airbus has drawn raves from airlines and passengers for the A350, its counterpart to Boeing’s carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner and hot-selling 777 twin-engine aircraft. The A350 boasts a roomy interior and 25 percent fuel savings from its long-range competitor, thanks to state-of-the art engines and light-weight frame, according to the Toulouse, France-based planemaker. Delta plans to outfit its planes with specially designed business-class seats featuring a sliding door at each suite. The A350-900’s current list price is $311 million, although discounts are customary. Dreamliner’s Wake The A350’s entry into the commercial market in early 2015 was more than three years after the Dreamliner’s debut. The Airbus jet has faced obstacles ranging from cabin-equipment shortages that have forced delays, to inexpensive fuel sapping airline demand for more-efficient planes. The jet’s popularity led to long wait times for customers. In the meantime, some big U.S. carriers have changed management and fleet strategies since ordering their A350s earlier this decade.

(ALC) posted $84.9 million in net income for the 2017 first quarter, down 8.5% from $92.9 million in 1Q 2016. Los Angeles-based ALC’s revenues for the quarter totaled $360.2 million, up 4.9% over $343.3 million in the year-ago quarter. The company’s expenses increased 13.5% year-over-year (YOY) to $226.3 million; operating income for the quarter was $133.9 million, down 7% YOY. “Throughout the quarter, we saw solid lease demand … including robust placements of both our new generation single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft. We also continue to see demand from buyers of our used Boeing and Airbus aircraft,” ALC executive COB Steven Udvar-Házy said. “We view the slowing of new aircraft orders as healthy for the industry in the face of record backlogs and ongoing strain in the global supply chain.” “During the first quarter, we … focused on a strategic opportunity to sell and manage a portfolio of 19 mid-life aircraft,” ALC CEO and president John Plueger said, referring to ALC’s agreement with Thunderbolt Aircraft Leasing Limited, a group of third party investors who closed a $344.7 million fixed rate notes offering, backed by the portfolio of 19 aircraft, on May 4. The aircraft are a mix of narrowbodies and widebodies, average age 12.5 years, which were leased to 17 lessees based in 13 countries. ALC and its Irish affiliate ALC Aircraft Limited will act as servicers of the aircraft; ALC expects to sell all of the aircraft by the end of 2017. “Looking forward, we [will continue] to capitalize on incremental aircraft acquisition opportunities to help offset further delays on Airbus deliveries,” Plueger said. As of April 30, ALC has seven A320neos, one A321ceo, 129 A321neos, 25 A330-900s, 20 A350-900s and nine A350-1000s in Airbus’ order book queue. From Boeing, ALC has 120 737s and 43 787s in its unfilled order queue as of April 30. ALC signed 34 aircraft lease agreements and 19 letters of intent with five new airline customers during the quarter. As of March 31, ALC’s fleet comprised 243 owned aircraft and 31 managed aircraft, at an aggregate net book value of $12.6 billion, with a weighted-average age of 3.7 years and a weighted average lease term remaining of 6.9 years. ALC took delivery of 11 aircraft during the quarter, valued at $825 million, including two Airbus A320-200neos, six Boeing 737-800s, two 777-300ERs and one 787-9.

NEW DELHI: India and the US are looking at expanding the scope of their annual Malabar naval exercise, with this year’s edition to be conducted in the Bay of Bengal likely to focus on increasing capability to jointly counter submarine operations, among other maritime threats. While the final list of participants for the joint exercise to be held in July is still not final, the US Pacific Fleet Commander – whose warships will take part in the war games – said both sides are expected to share expertise in anti-submarine warfare, given the common platform they operate with, the Boeing P8 aircraft. “There is a desire on both sides to continue to deepen all elements of the exercise. We continue to learn more and more how to operate our P8s more effectively, expect that the Indian Navy has the same experience. There would be a deepening of our understanding on how to operate those platforms in anti-submarine warfare environments,” Admiral Scott Swift said, talking to the media after bilateral meetings in the capital. On calling in other nations like Australia for the exercise, the officer said the issue is under bilateral discussion between the US and India. It may be noted that Japan has been a regular participant at Malabar and Australia has long expressed its desire to be involved in the exercise as well. The top US Admiral also expressed his concern on the Chinese One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, saying that the intent of the initiative is still not clear. The officer shared that Chinese vessels had started visits in the Pacific Ocean as part of the OBOR plan but that there was little clarity on what their plan is. “Chinese ships are now doing an OBOR tour but (we are) not sure where they are going. It is the sense of uncertainty, the sense of angst that comes from (not knowing) what exactly the OBOR means,” Admiral Swift said. Asked for his assessment on the Chinese Navy, in the wake of the recent launch of its second aircraft carrier that is expected to join service by 2020, the Pacific fleet commander admitted that the PLA Navy (PLAN) capacity is increasing. “I would expect that their capacity will continue to grow as they learn more and more how to conduct operations. I would expect both their capability and capacity will continue to grow,” the officer said. Responding to a question on whether the US is still keen on conducting joint operations with the Indian Navy, the Admiral said the US is anxious to conduct joint exercises but cautioned on the use of the ‘joint patrols’ term. “Terms are important. I hesitate on (the use of the term) joint patrols. Last month, we have done multiple operations throughout the pacific – with Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France and Singapore. So, this is more the norm than the exception,” Admiral Swift said.

The narrow-body C919 jet -- white with green and blue stripes -- disappeared into the clouds after taking off from Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered. It successfully landed some eighty minutes later. Built by state-owned aerospace manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on European consortium Airbus and US aerospace giant Boeing. The flight is the latest sign of China's growing ambition and technical skill, coming one week after the country launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier and docked a cargo spacecraft with an orbiting space lab. Before takeoff, CCTV state television said the plane would be tested at an altitude of 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), some 7,000 metres lower than a regular trip, and at a speed of around 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour. Top officials, COMAC staff and company partners attended the inaugural flight, which was shown live on state television. China has dreamt of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s, when it began work on the narrow-body Y-10, which was eventually deemed unviable and never entered service. President Xi Jinping himself has endorsed the new project, visiting COMAC even before he took office in 2013. The first flight was supposed to take place last year, but it was delayed until now. His call to arms is emblazoned on the wall of the jet's production facility: "Accelerate the construction of the world's top aviation company and continue to make new contributions to develop a strong aviation industry."

Ogg May 5, 2017 11:00 am EDT Print Email Tweet When Warren Buffett talks, people listen. Buffett confessed on Friday morning, ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) annual meeting, that he and his team had unloaded part of their massive stake in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM). While there are some broader issues to consider here, the reality is that the early sell-off in IBM shares has put pressure on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Buffett told CNBC that he had sold about 30% of his stake in IBM after its shares hit $180 or so. He also said he stopped selling shares after they fell to about $160. This impact has ramifications for the Dow’s index change on Friday, and it has a role on what CEO Ginni Rometty’s future may hold. Earlier in the week, Moody’s Investor Services actually downgraded IBM’s corporate credit rating. Moody’s does think IBM can grow what its calls its “strategic initiatives,” but the agency feels that Big Blue will spend more on those initiatives and on gradual acquisitions. Whether that credit rating cut from Moody’s will make IBM’s relative borrowing costs rise ahead remains to be seen. The Dow is a price-weighted index rather than a market cap-weighted one, and IBM has the fifth highest weighting in the Dow, at 5.2%, behind UnitedHealth (5.69%), Boeing (5.98%), 3M (6.52%) and Goldman Sachs (7.41%). If the Dow was a market-cap weighted index, IBM would have far less of a market impact on it. Its fifth highest price-weighting actually is ranked at number 11 of 30 (under the median market cap), with a $149 billion market cap. To prove the point here: the S&P 500 Index is a market cap weighted index, and it was up $1.80 (almost 0.1%) while the Dow was down 25 points (over 0.1%), while and the Nasdaq was up four points (almost 0.1%). These are not huge numbers on the surface, but imagine if there is a day when IBM shares were down more than the $4.03 (or −2.5%) at $155.02. As far as what the IBM stake sale really means, let’s see what Buffett actually told CNBC about what made him change his mind about the value of Big Blue: I think if you look back at what they were projecting and how they thought the business would develop I would say what they’ve run into is some pretty tough competitors. IBM is a big strong company, but they’ve got big strong competitors too. Buffett said his sales were based on a lot of things. This was noted as IBM’s earnings and the decline in sales over time not proving to have as wide of a moat as he once thought. Buffett’s strong competition is coming from Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Satya Nadella of Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT). These two companies are more than formidable competitors against IBM in the cloud computing business. IBM’s Watson, its artificial intelligence business, is still growing handily, just not fast enough to stop the bleeding in IBM’s core IT-services operations. IBM has now posted almost 20 disappointing quarters of negative revenue trends, and Thomson Reuters does not see that revenue inversion changing very much (if at all) through 2020. IBM’s revenues were $104 billion in 2012, and they have slid ever since. Thomson Reuters sees a 2.1% sales drop to $78.3 billion in 2017, followed by $78.2 billion in 2018, $78.0 billion in 2019 and $75.2 billion in 2020.

Every day in Washington, DC, the blue-and-gold 1st Helicopter Squadron, codenamed “MUSSEL,” flies over the Potomac River. As obvious as the Presidential motorcade, most people assume the squadron is a travel perk for VIPs. They’re only half right: while the helicopters do provide transport, the unit exists to evacuate high-ranking officials in the event of a terrorist or nuclear attack on the capital. In the event of an attack, select officials would be whisked by helicopters to a ring of secret bunkers around Washington, even as ordinary citizens were left to fend for themselves. For sixty years, the US government has been developing secret Doomsday plans to protect itself, and the multibillion-dollar Continuity of Government (COG) program takes numerous forms—from its plans to evacuate the Liberty Bell from Philadelphia to the plans to launch nuclear missiles from a Boeing-747 jet flying high over Nebraska. In Raven Rock, Garrett M. Graff sheds light on the inner workings of the 650-acre compound (called Raven Rock) just miles from Camp David, as well as dozens of other bunkers the government built its top leaders during the Cold War, from the White House lawn to Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado to Palm Beach, Florida, and the secret plans that would have kicked in after a Cold War nuclear attack to round up foreigners and dissidents and nationalize industries. Equal parts a presidential, military, and cultural history, Raven Rock tracks the evolution of the government plan and the threats of global war from the dawn of the nuclear era through the War on Terror. “Garrett Graff has given us a colorful and frightening account of the American government’s plans for doomsday, and the secret bunkers where official could go to save themselves. These early plans still have their counterparts today, and they reveal a lot about how warfighting doctrine evolved. Read it and be fascinated—and a little scared,” says Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs and Einstein. Garrett M. Graff, a magazine journalist and historian, has spent more than a dozen years covering politics, technology, and national security. He’s written for publications from Wired to The New York Times, and served as the editor of two of Washington’s most prestigious magazines, Washingtonian and POLITICO Magazine. His books include The Threat Matrix: The FBI War in the Age of Global Terror and The First Campaign: Globalization, the Web, and the Race for the White House. Ticket proceeds will be donated to Vermont Foodbank. Tickets are $3 per person, and include a coupon for $5 off the featured book. Coupons expire at closing the evening of the event. Seating is limited. Phoenix Books Burlington is located at 191 Bank Street. Copies of Raven Rock will be available for attendees to purchase and have signed.

Airborne Wireless Network Receives Federal Communications Commission Approval to Test Demonstration System Airborne Wireless Network Receives Federal Communications Commission Approval to Test Demonstration System ICT Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 05/05/2017 14:01 SIMI VALLEY, California, May 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Airborne Wireless Network (OTCQB: ABWN), is pleased to announce that it has been granted an experimental operating certificate by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), file number 0378-EX-ST-2017X.  The FCC's approval will allow ABWN to ground test and flight test its demonstration system, in the development of the Infinitus Super Highway TM, the Company's patented air-to-air communication system. The FCC's approval allows the Company to conduct testing on the ground and over its intended flight test operating area near Roswell, New Mexico. As part of the tests, the Company will utilize two Boeing testbed aircraft and pass broadband data between each aircraft inflight and a ground station, in a first of its kind air-to-air and air-to-ground meshed network link.  Jason T. de Mos, the Company's Vice President of Business Development and Aviation Compliance, said, "This approval is a significant achievement in the testing and development of our Infinitus Super Highway. We believe our technology has the potential to become an important opportunity for improving and creating a global pipeline that takes connectivity beyond current limitations. We are very much looking forward to the test demonstration and bringing this new, highly innovative communications network system to market." About Airborne Wireless Network          The Company intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight.  It is projected that each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router, sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next and creating a digital superhighway in the sky.  The Company intends the network to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage connectivity.  The Company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies. Currently, the world's connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground based fiber and satellites. The Company believes that the Company's airborne digital highway may be a solution to fill the world's connectivity void.  Once the network is developed and fully implemented, its uses may be limitless.  The Company's network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.

It was scheduled to fly in 2014 but manufacturing problems delayed production. Andy Wong/AP hide caption toggle caption Andy Wong/AP A Chinese-made C919 passenger jet takes off on its first flight at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai on Friday. It was scheduled to fly in 2014 but manufacturing problems delayed production. Andy Wong/AP China, which has long had a goal of breaking into the Western-dominated aircraft market, on Friday tested its first large passenger jetliner. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, took off from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai. The new plane is expected to compete with the Airbus A320 and Boeing's 737. The lucrative narrow-body market accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. The C919 has been beset by delays: It was expected to first fly in 2014 and be delivered to buyers in 2016. Comac officials blamed the delays on manufacturing problems, but they are looking forward to a brighter future. The Associated Press reports: "Bao Pengli, deputy director of Comac's project management department, said Thursday the manufacturer planned to make two planes a year from now to 2019 to obtain proof of safe flight, before any mass production would be started. "Comac says it has 570 orders, mostly from state-owned Chinese airlines. A total of 23 domestic and foreign customers have placed orders. The handful of foreign customers includes GE Capital Aviation Services and Thailand's City Airways. "The plane can come with 155-175 seats and has a standard flight length of 2,530 miles." Over the next 20 years, the global jet market is estimated to be worth $2 trillion. China's new jet, however, likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. A similar thing happened to China's first domestically made jet. The twin-engine ARJ-21, flew its passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight. The smaller regional jet is a rival to aircraft made by Bombardier of Canada and Brazil's Embraer SA. chinese-made passenger jet C919 Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

Picture: Andy Wong/AP The narrow-body jet, which will compete with Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320, soon disappeared into the clouds carrying its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers. State broadcaster CCTV sent out live footage from the plane, which had no passenger seats installed for the maiden flight. The jet is a symbol of China's ambitions to muscle into a global jet market estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next two decades, as well as Beijing's broader "Made in China 2025" plan to spur home-made products, from medicines to robots. "The significance is huge, it's the first ever large-frame aircraft made in China," Xiong Yuexi, a plane design expert at Beihang University in Beijing said ahead of the launch. "It has a great impact for the Chinese people and the domestic market." State television reported the plane's test flight would last one-and-a-half hours at a height of around 3,000 metres and at a speeds of 290-300 kilometres (180-186 miles) per hour. According to aircraft tracker Flightradar24, the plane flew over the Yangtze River estuary and headed due north. The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), has seen its test flight pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues, underlining the scale of the task facing Beijing. China first gave the world a glimpse of the plane, which will be able to carry 158-168 passengers, in November 2015 when it rolled it out at a ceremony in Shanghai. Analysts, however, say the C919 will lag technologically behind improved versions of the A320 and 737 which will enter service in the next two years. China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which COMAC says has 570 orders from 23 customers. The plane also relies on an array of overseas technology, with CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric's aerospace arm and a unit of French firm Safran supplying the engines. Others include Honeywell International Inc, United Technologies Corp subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and a unit of Parker-Hannifin Corp. JUST THE START Conceived in 2008, China wants the C919 to eventually take market share from Boeing and Airbus in the lucrative narrow-body market which accounts for more than 50 percent of the aircraft in service worldwide. For a TIMELINE on the C919, click However, the jet likely faces a lengthy journey from first flight to commercial usage. China's first home-made jet, the regional ARJ-21, received its type certification in December 2014, six years after its first flight and more than 12 years after it was conceived. It made its maiden passenger flight in June last year. Then there is also the daunting task of selling the jet in a global market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. "Aviation is a complex market and you need experience over a long time. Boeing has 100 years, Airbus has over 40 years," said Sinolink Securities analyst Si Jingzhe, adding COMAC still lagged far behind in terms of supply chain know-how. China is pushing for recognition globally of its certification by European and U.S. regulators. Without their certification, China would only be able to sell the jet to a handful of countries that accept its certification standards. Beijing is also already looking beyond the C919, with plans to develop a wide-body long-haul jet with Russia. In November COMAC and its partner United Aircraft Corp said they have started the hunt to find suppliers.

    By Jackie Cai and Adam JourdanSHANGHAI, May 5 (Reuters) - China's home-grown C919
passenger jet took to the skies on its long-delayed maiden
flight on Friday, a major step for Beijing as it looks to raise
its profile in the global aviation market and boost high-tech
manufacturing at home.
    The white, green and blue aircraft, with "C919" emblazoned
on its tail, sped along the tarmac at Shanghai's international
airport and lifted off under overcast skies in front of
thousands of dignitaries, aviation workers and enthusiasts.
    The narrow-body jet, which will compete with Boeing's <BA.N>
737 and the Airbus <AIR.PA> A320, soon disappeared into the
clouds carrying its skeleton crew of five pilots and engineers.

Request a sample report @ https://www.htfmarketreport.com/sample-report/392253-global-commercial-aircraft-health-monitoring-systems Summary ABSTRACT About Commercial Aircraft Health Monitoring Systems Aircraft health monitoring systems (AHMS) collect data in real time from the aircraft fleet and make it available to ground operations. Various sensors are installed at various damage hotspots throughout aircraft structure/engine, which provide an early detection of anomaly (or initiation of crack/fatigue). Thus, necessary preventive measures can be implemented on-time, which reduces the chances of critical damage and major system failure. The abovementioned advantages of AHMS result in the installation of these systems by airline operators in their aircraft. Keeping this in consideration, aircraft manufacturers are currently focusing on integrating these systems in new aircraft, and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) providers are upgrading the systems in the old fleet. Research analysts forecast the global commercial aircraft health monitoring systems market to grow at a CAGR of 7.19% during the period 2017-2021.

Nearly half of the 300 business leaders who were questioned as part of the Sheffield City Region’s Quarterly Economic Survey said they didn’t know enough about the industrial strategy. The study concluded that 75 per cent of manufacturing firms in the city region had increased their employment expectations during the first quarter of this year, but many companies were experiencing problems finding the right staff. Some manufacturing firms were finding it hard to find skilled manual and technical workers, while, in the services sector, some companies reported problems recruiting managers. Earlier this year, the Government set out draft plans for its new industrial strategy, which aims to help the UK become more competitive on a global stage. Professor Andrew Simpson, of Sheffield University Management School, said in his foreword to the report: “On balance, businesses in the Sheffield City Region remain to be convinced by the Government’s proposed industrial strategy.” Prof Simpson said that businesses who took part in the survey hoped the strategy would encourage growth across the country, boost trade and investment and provide support for new and fast-growing businesses. He added: “Overall, the message from Sheffield City Region businesses is positive, as they look to invest in plant and people and see opportunities to increase sales; putting the turbulence of the last year behind them.” Sir Nigel Knowles, the chairman of the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership, highlighted the fact that super car makers McLaren and aerospace company Boeing had made “a major commitment to the region, bringing high value jobs and great supply chain opportunities”. He added: “Looking at the Government’s proposed industrial strategy, we know that businesses want to see the right local institutions to support people, industries and places. That’s why we are telling Government that we want to see greater local decision-making as an important part of the strategy.” The survey found that Sheffield City Region firms have continued to deliver growth in domestic and export markets since the New Year. They are also increasing investments in plant, people and training, the study concluded. Dan Fell, the chief executive of Doncaster Chamber, said: “Many employers are saying – despite macro-economic headwinds such as Brexit – that it is business as usual and they are experiencing solid growth. “However, many firms are facing higher costs which increasingly translates into companies having to raise their own prices and charging customers and consumers more. “With inflation already above the Bank of England’s target these pressures look set to continue, during this continuing time of uncertainty and I suspect that, in the not too distant future, we may see a tapering of business confidence. “Recruitment remains a big issue for many firms and there is a fear that an inability to access the right talent could constrain growth aspirations.” Mr Fell said that business and education must join forces to ensure young people are ready for the world of work. The survey’s findings were discussed at a debate held at the Source, near Meadowhall, which was chaired by Greg Wright, The Yorkshire Post’s deputy business editor. Ashley Shackleton, the head of public affairs at the British Chambers of Commerce, told the meeting that he hoped the planned industrial strategy would create a sense of national mission, and secure broad public and political support. The quarterly economic survey (QES) is conducted by the chambers of commerce in Barnsley & Rotherham, Doncaster, the East Midlands and Sheffield, with the backing of the local enterprise partnership and support from Sheffield University Management School. The results are used to influence government policy at a national and regional level. The findings also help to shape the support structures available to the local business community. The QES is sponsored by The Source, a training and development centre, which is based near Meadowhall.

David Pollard reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Shares slipped but not the mood in early trading on Europe's markets. At least when it came to some of the headline makers. First up: Syngenta. ChemChina says it's won more than enough support from the Swiss company's shareholders to clinch its $43 billion takeover. China's biggest foreign takeover to date ... (SOUNDBITE) (English) LCG SENIOR ANALYST, JASPER LAWLER, SAYING: "Where maybe ChemChina benefit most from the from the deal, is that it's a less developed market. They have less sophisticated seeds and other products that Syngenta can bring to the bring to the table. And so it's going to help develop China." In new competition for Airbus and Boeing, the day also saw China's first home-grown large passenger jet taking off on its maiden flight. In Europe, BA-owner IAG shares did the same - on record Q1 profits. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LCG SENIOR ANALYST, JASPER LAWLER, SAYING: "Really it's the lower fuel costs. They're helping IAG in a typically low part of the season. That along side cost cutting." But BHP Billiton came under some selling pressure. The miner under shareholder pressure to simplify its structure - and now, it's reported, to dump chief executive Andrew Mackenzie. Pearson shares, meanwhile, were up a mighty 15 per cent - on the promise of more cost cuts. And if the US earnings season continues to surprise, the mood in Europe should stay upbeat. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LCG SENIOR ANALYST, JASPER LAWLER, SAYING: That has been the theme and we're looking at double digit earnings growth in USA and continue with some of the big companies reporting next week. You know I think that bodes well for overall market sentiment." After hitting fresh 20 month highs, the STOXX 600 was on track to end the week up more than 1 percent. German blue chips have been at record highs and France's CAC at its highest level in more than 9 years - despite a fraught second run-off to its presidential election.

The FCC's approval will allow ABWN to ground test and flight test its demonstration system, in the development of the Infinitus Super Highway(TM), the Company's patented air-to-air communication system. The FCC's approval allows the Company to conduct testing on the ground and over its intended flight test operating area near Roswell, New Mexico. http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/508284/Airborne_Logo.jpg [http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/508284/Airborne_Logo.jpg] As part of the tests, the Company will utilize two Boeing testbed aircraft and pass broadband data between each aircraft inflight and a ground station, in a first of its kind air-to-air and air-to-ground meshed network link. Jason T. de Mos, the Company's Vice President of Business Development and Aviation Compliance, said, "This approval is a significant achievement in the testing and development of our Infinitus Super Highway. We believe our technology has the potential to become an important opportunity for improving and creating a global pipeline that takes connectivity beyond current limitations. We are very much looking forward to the test demonstration and bringing this new, highly innovative communications network system to market." About Airborne Wireless Network The Company intends to create a high-speed broadband airborne wireless network by linking commercial aircraft in flight. It is projected that each aircraft participating in the network will act as an airborne repeater or router, sending and receiving broadband signals from one aircraft to the next and creating a digital superhighway in the sky. The Company intends the network to be a high-speed broadband internet pipeline to improve coverage connectivity. The Company does not intend to provide retail customer coverage to end users, but, instead, act as a wholesale carrier with target customers, such as internet service providers and telephone companies. Currently, the world's connectivity is achieved by use of undersea cables, ground based fiber and satellites. The Company believes that the Company's airborne digital highway may be a solution to fill the world's connectivity void. Once the network is developed and fully implemented, its uses may be limitless. The Company's network, once developed, should provide low cost, high-speed connectivity to rural areas, island nations, ships at sea, oil platforms, in addition to connectivity to commercial and private aircraft in flight.
