Travel News & Advice Aeroplanes of the future: From ultra-luxury AirCruises to planes that turn into trains and passenger seats that make us human batteries The future of flight is looking increasingly barmy. Here’s what we’ve got to look forward to Laura Chubb @LauraChubb1 Saturday 22 October 2016 10:30 BST The Clip-Air design, where detachable aircraft cabins can turn into trains Clip-Air “Air cruises” – ultra-luxury planes flying groups of guests on round-the-world itineraries – just might be the next big thing in travel. That’s if high-end operator Crystal Cruises’ new Crystal AirCruises plane, launching next autumn, is a hit. Crystal’s Boeing 777-200LR will be kitted out with lie-flat seats, dining tables, divans and a bar, with room for 84 guests to fly in style. The company is also said to be planning themed flights, with the likes of visiting Michelin-starred chefs – though cabaret acts are unlikely to feature. Itineraries are planned to last either 14, 21 or 28 days, and passengers will stay in luxury hotels when on the ground. How Crystal expects its AirCruises plane to look While experiencing the AirCruises plane will only be a matter for the privileged few, it got us thinking about other aviation innovations slated to take to the skies in the not-too-distant future. Here are some of our favourite plans and patents for the aeroplanes of tomorrow. The plane that turns into a train The “Clip-Air” concept is the brainchild of the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Lausanne, Switzerland, and involves a detachable fuselage that can be transferred from an “airframe” onto train tracks. Theoretically, this would mean passengers can transfer from a plane to a train without ever leaving their seat. While it’s unlikely this could become a reality for several decades, it’s not the first time the idea of a detachable passenger cabin has been mooted. Last year, Airbus filed a patent for that very idea, arguing that it would save time to board passengers onto a removable cabin, and that the plane could even undergo maintenance while passengers boarded elsewhere. Read more Budget airlines rated: What you get for your money The cabin that will make you feel zen Just last week, Airbus said it was seriously considering the possibility of coating the interior of cabins in a light-emitting material, onto which they would then project images of the outside environment – be that a blue sky with clouds, or a night sky with stars. The idea is that it would improve the cabin environment for passengers – though if you’re already afraid of flying, the sensation of whizzing through the air at several hundred miles per hour with no tin can to protect you might not help.  An innovation you will definitely be seeing, however, is the company’s solution to improving overhead storage – and not a minute too soon. The new A350 and A330neo models have taller overhead bins where bags sit vertically, as though on a book shelf, which should be far more efficient than the horizontal madness we have now. Plans for in-built VR helmets filed by Airbus (United States Patent and Trademark Office) Seats with in-built VR helmets Another Airbus idea is the unfortunately named “sensory helmet”, which would be built into passenger seat headrests so you can isolate yourself in your own VR world (ie, pretend you’re not living the nightmare of modern commercial aviation). The patent says the helmet would “preferentially” also have a function where nice odours could be diffused into it. Particularly useful on a long-haul journey after the inflight meal has been digested. Boeing’s folding wings The plans for Boeing’s 777-9X model – which will be the largest twin-engine jet in the world – show such an enormous wingspan that the tips will need to fold up in order for the craft to fit into airports. The wingspan, of just over 235ft, will be reduced by 12ft when the hinged tips fold up. Locking pins will stop the wings from accidentally folding up during the flight. Read more These are the worst inflight meals we've ever seen Benches instead of seats More from Airbus, and this time it's replacing conventional aeroplane passenger seats with, erm, benches. The patent, published earlier this year, would bring an end to defined seat width, depending on how many people are fit onto the bench – which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on how the benches are sold. The new Boeing model will have folding wings (Boeing) The flat-pack plane Amazingly, the flat-pack plane is a real thing. Cambridge, England-based company e-Go has created a one-person aircraft that can be taken apart and packed away after a flight. The plane is actually available on pre-order now, and will set you back a tidy £50,000. The company is now working on multi-seater flat-pack planes, so watch this space. The e-Go plane has detachable wings so you can take it apart and store it easily post-flight (e-goaeroplanes.com) Energy-harvesting seats Our final entry is the energy-harvesting seats proposed by France’s Zodiac Aerotechnics, which proposes a sort of Matrix-style dystopia where humans become batteries. Passenger seats on commercial flights would capture “ambient energy” from human bodies to provide power and lower the overall energy consumption in an aircraft cabin. Creepy much?

(Photo courtesy of St. Margaret's Episcopal School) By CANDLER CUSATO / CAPPIES REVIEWER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Passengers, fasten your seat belts for the turbulent but hysterical ride that is St. Margaret’s production of “Boeing Boeing,” in which amorous scoundrel Bernard and his right-hand man Robert struggle to keep his three engagements to flight attendants airborne when they all arrive unexpectedly at his Paris apartment because of a snowstorm and the new Super Boeing aircraft. With uproariously funny actors onstage and seamless technical direction behind the scenes, St. Margaret’s production of “Boeing Boeing” soars. Bernard and Robert, played by Tyler Ashman and Jaden Cloobeck, respectively, hilariously mirror a married couple with their witty banter and degradation from suave to inconsolably stressed as the play’s conflict evolves and doors open to reveal yet another flight attendant arriving to greet her fiance. Ashman remains somewhat restrained while Cloobeck sprints around the apartment screaming as their evening slowly descends into madness. As cynical French maid Berthe, Casey Healy is constant amid a swirling vortex of insanity, with her unceasing French frown and careless flicks of a cigarette while Bernard’s well-crafted plan falls to pieces. St. Margaret’s shines in a partnership between acting, costumes and hair and makeup. While seamless American, Italian and German accents are all that can be heard onstage, the costumers, under the direction of Hailey Hageman and Elizabeth Haugen, enhance these stereotypes via colorful outfits. Hair and makeup, courtesy of Alyssa Chong, Valentina Martino and Zoe Mellard, aptly reflect these cultural generalizations as well, for Gretchen, a German flight attendant, has her hair permanently glued to her head in tight braids while Gloria, her American counterpart, sports bright blue eyeshadow characteristic of 1960s U.S. fashion. With apt comedic timing and attention to minute technical details, St. Margaret’s adds its own hilarious spin to this modern farce, ensuring that the comedy, like the ideal flight, is nonstop.

By Mary-Ann Russon October 21, 2016 18:23 BST The US Air Force wants to reuse its old F-16 fighter jets as drones for testing weapons and simulating enemy attacksUS Air Force/Sara Vidoni Aerospace company Boeing is helping the US Air Force reuse old F-16 fighter jets by converting them into drones that simulate enemy aircraft, as well as enabling new tactics, weapons and technologies to be tested in mid-air. The US Air Force decided that it wanted to turn its old fighter jets into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in 2010, when it awarded Boeing $72m ($59m) to take six F-16 aircraft and turn them into QF-16s, which are full-scare unmanned aerial targets that can be used to simulate enemy actors trying to attack the US. "It's a full scale aerial target, you can imagine the adversaries that our Air Force flies against around the rest of the world, this aircraft is designed to be a threat representative for those adversaries," Tim Bartlett, director of off-Boeing platforms for Boeing Defense, told Avionics Magazine. "It is comparative to what our pilots will fly against, the [Air Force] uses them for two main missions. The first is to qualify and test their munitions and armaments. The second mission is being around threat representatives gives our pilots a better sense of what they're flying against in an adversary and from a training perspective as well." It takes five months to convert an F-16 into a UAV and eventually the US Air Force wants all the F-16s to become dronesUS Air Force/Sara Vidoni Six years later and the US Air Force has declared that the new QF-16s are operationally capable, but how exactly do you turn a manned military aircraft into a drone? "We add a flight control computer to enhance data processing within, which is a vital component to enable the unmanned capabilities," said Bartlett. "What we are doing is inserting hardware that is ultimately designed to replace the pilots. A new autopilot helps with that as well, and there's also some telemetry technology added that helps tell you where the aircraft is within the world, and the speed as well." The process takes five months and requires multiple components of the plane to be removed and 3,000 new wires to be installed, as well as a Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS) with a data link range of 120 nautical miles to enable mission control to stay in command of the UAV at all times. Boeing is contracted to convert another further 97 F-16 fighter jets into drones, and eventually the US Air Force wants all 210 aircraft to become UAVs. It is currently considering whether the QF-16s can be sold to foreign partners who want to test weapons and simulate enemy attacks as well.

Yesterday a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Boeing 757 flew 81 scientific and support personnel and about three tonnes of baggage and equipment that are needed to support the New Zealand and United States Antarctic research programmes. It was the NZDF’s first strategic airlift support flight to the continent for the 2016-17 summer season. Lieutenant Commander Ross Hickey, the NZDF’s Senior National Officer on the continent, said two more RNZAF Boeing flights are scheduled before the end of October to take another 100 people to Scott Base and McMurdo Station. Further flights will be made from late November by the C-130 Hercules, the workhorses of the RNZAF. “For the past 51 years the NZDF has been contributing to the lifeline of support for New Zealand and American scientists working in Antarctica,” Major General Tim Gall, the Commander Joint Forces New Zealand, said. “Every year, our aircraft support the Antarctic research programmes by bringing about 330 scientists and other personnel and almost 40 tonnes of equipment needed to carry out vital research on the continent,” MAJGEN Gall said. Antarctica New Zealand Chief Executive Peter Beggs said the significant contribution of the NZDF demonstrated the collaborative nature of Antarctic research and logistics. “NZDF support is an integral part of New Zealand’s strategic leadership both on the Antarctic continent and in the Southern Ocean and we are grateful for the level of professionalism under which these personnel operate,” Mr Beggs said. The NZDF also provides search and rescue support, air transport, terminal operations at Harewood Terminal in Christchurch and McMurdo, and support for the unloading of the annual container ship. Up to 220 NZDF staff – including air crew and ground support, passenger and cargo facilitation, logistics, fuel specialists, Army engineers and heavy plant operators, cargo handlers and communications specialists – are deployed during the summer to support the Scott Base and McMurdo stations. The 2016-17 research season marks the 60th anniversary of New Zealand’s operational presence in Antarctica and the construction of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition Hut.

He also served as a contracts manager for Boeing Defense & Space and as regional manager for a telecommunications company. But, the high-rolling lifestyle came to a crashing halt — quite literally — when David staged a small aircraft accident in an attempt to fraudulently obtain insurance money. David pleaded guilty and was sentenced to serve one year plus a day at Eglin Federal Prison Camp, a minimum-security facility near Pensacola, Florida. That certainly didn’t seem so bad. After all, Eglin is still to this day known among the corporate world as Club Fed, with a notorious reputation for being soft on the white-collar criminals who routinely request it as their prison of choice. Mr. Novak finished paying his debt to the US federal government years and since his release has authored a book based on the journals he kept during his prison experience: “Down Time — A Guide to Federal Prison Incarceration.” When you arrive at Eglin, your first view is a beautiful, wide-open space devoted to recreation — basketball courts and soccer and softball fields. It almost seems like being at a country club. There are old oak trees with Spanish moss. Aesthetically, it’s gorgeous. There are no fences, barbed wire or guard towers. And, it’s Florida! You work a 40-hour week in Eglin, but other than that you’re free to do anything else within reason. In fact, that’s one of the biggest challenges for most white-collar types — suddenly having more time than they know what to do with. There’s free access to newspapers and TV. Lots of inmates work out diligently and actually leave prison looking better than when they went in. But, with all the perks there is one constant reminder that Eglin is not just another southern resort. It’s a yellow line painted around the border of the compound, which every inmate has to stay behind. Of course, if you wanted, you could simply leave — they call it a “walk away.” But, the consequences are swift and severe. You will get caught and then will have to serve and additional 18 months or more in a higher security facility. That’s a pretty strong deterrent. Strange, isn’t it, how accustomed people can get to their prisons? Even David Novak says that there are times when he misses the from all responsibility, the recreational facilities and the huge blocks of time to read that he had in Eglin. But, ask him today, now that he has had a taste of real freedom, if he would be willing to go back. The answer? Absolutely not. Many people spend their lives hiding behind the lie that they free, when actually they are bound! One of the hardest things to do when you love someone is to watch them be bound in a prison that has no walls, but they can’t seem to find a way out. Trust God enough to make a way when there seems to be no way! In North Africa, trappers have a clever method of capturing monkeys. A gourd is filled with nuts and firmly fastened to a branch of a tree. It has a hole just large enough for the unwary monkey to stick his paw into it. When the hungry animal discovers the scent of food, he will quickly put his hand in the gourd and grasp a handful of nuts, but the hole is too small for him to withdraw his clenched fist. The monkey doesn’t have enough sense to open up his hand and let go in order to escape, so he is easily taken captive. He doesn’t realize that his “liberty” to make a choice has actually stolen his freedom! As much as you want to help the ones you love get out of their prison, we have to remember it starts with their choice. Sometimes life isn’t fair, but other times we need to let go of what is in our hand. We cannot allow our desires and feelings to keep us captive when God has something bigger for us. Let go and let God. Tony Bohrer More like this story Faith Column: Avoiding temptation, letting go of sins F.

They include air and ground crew, army engineers, cargo handlers and communications specialists. On Thursday, a Royal New Zealand Air Force Boeing 757 flew 81 scientific and support personnel and about three tonnes of baggage and equipment to support the New Zealand and US Antarctic research programmes at the Scott Base and McMurdo stations. It was the NZDF's first support flight to the continent for the 2016-17 summer season. Two more RNZAF Boeing flights are scheduled before the end of October, and from late November the C-130 Hercules, the workhorses of the RNZAF, swing into action. "Every year, our aircraft support the Antarctic research programmes by bringing about 330 scientists and other personnel and almost 40 tonnes of equipment needed to carry out vital research on the continent," says Major General Tim Gall, the Commander Joint Forces New Zealand. This season is the 60th of New Zealand's operations in Antarctica and the NZDF has been involved for 51 years. The NZDF also provides search and rescue support, air transport, terminal operations at Harewood Terminal in Christchurch and McMurdo, and support for the unloading of the annual container ship.

Fiji Time: 12:35 PM on Wednesday 16 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / News Airline reforms Matilda Simmons Saturday, October 22, 2016 THE Fiji Airways was leasing Boeing 747s and 767s for $US500,000 ($F1 million) and $US800,000 ($F1.6m) a month before the Government stepped in to carry out reforms, it was revealed yesterday. Acting Prime Minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said it required the absence of unions or unionists whom, he said, "did not understand finance or commerce when Government carried out a restructure in 2011 after the Civil Aviation decree was put in place. "You had people in Fiji Airways who made $96 million in losses because they went and hedged on fuel with absolutely no experience of hedging," Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said during a press conference at the Fiji Electricity Authority office in Suva. "These are the things that we don't talk about publicly, but these were the shennigans that went on inside the organisation. "Maybe I can find a lot of that too that happened in the past in FEA." The national carrier had retired the 747 in 2013 after purchasing three brand new Fiji Airways A330s. Fiji Airways is the largest airline group in the South Pacific, serving 10 domestic and 13 international destinations. Mr Sayed-Khaiyum had made the comments after he was asked about the restructure carried out at Fiji Airways and whether a similar one would take place for FEA. He said FEA was doing well and the organisation was looking at new ways of reducing its operational costs. Back to top Fiji Times & Kaila Frontpage PDF Downloads Use the free Acrobat Reader to view.

Three tonnes of equipment and baggage and 81 scientific and support personnel have been flown to Antarctica as part of the New Zealand Defence Force's annual mission to help advance research in the world's harshest continent. The scientists and support staff and equipment are needed to aid the New Zealand and United States Antarctic research programmes. They were flown to the icy continent on a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Boeing 757 as part of the NZDF's first strategic airlift support flight to Antarctica for the 2016-17 summer season. NZDF senior national officer on the continent Lieutenant Commander Ross Hickey said two more RNZAF Boeing flights were scheduled before the end of October to take another 100 people to Scott Base and McMurdo Station. Further flights will be made from late November by the C-130 Hercules, the workhorses of the RNZAF.

Antarctica New Zealand Chief Executive Peter Beggs said the significant contribution of the NZDF demonstrated the collaborative nature of Antarctic research and logistics. "NZDF support is an integral part of New Zealand's strategic leadership both on the Antarctic continent and in the Southern Ocean and we are grateful for the level of professionalism under which these personnel operate," Beggs said. The NZDF also provides search and rescue support, air transport, operations at Harewood Terminal in Christchurch and McMurdo, and support for the unloading of the annual container ship. Up to 220 NZDF staff - including air crew and ground support, passenger and cargo facilitation, logistics, fuel specialists, Army engineers and heavy plant operators, cargo handlers and communications specialists - are deployed during the summer to support the Scott Base and McMurdo stations.

Heyamoto has worked alongside Rondeau for thirty years. (Johnny Andrews/The Seattle Times) Craig Heyamoto is an anonymous but invaluable fixture in the Seattle sports scene, or more accurately, behind it, a mathematical wizard who has spent nearly four decades heading up local stats crews – and sometimes writing the programs that run the software. Share story If there is a number to be crunched, a scoring rule to be interpreted, or a Husky broadcast to be enhanced, chances are, Craig Heyamoto has his hand in it. Heyamoto is an anonymous but invaluable fixture in the Seattle sports scene, or more accurately, behind it, a mathematical wizard who has spent nearly four decades heading up local stats crews — and sometimes writing the programs that run the software. “He’s a computer, an absolute computer,” said Husky voice Bob Rondeau, who can barely imagine calling a game without Heyamoto nearby, serving as what he calls “my security blanket.” Husky Hall of Fame These are the inductees in the 2016 Husky Hall of Fame class. The ceremony will be Sunday. • Olin Kreutz (football, 1995-97) • Sara Pickering (softball, 1994-97) • Nate Robinson (basketball, 2003-05; football 2002) • Bob Rondeau (radio announcer, 1978-present) • Sanja Tomasevic (volleyball, 2002-05) • Brad Walker (track & field, 2002-05) • Mary Whipple (rowing, 1999-2002) • 1984 Washington football team Longtime football stats crew chief Craig Heyamoto will be presented with the Don H. Palmer Award. If it involves the Seahawks, the Sounders, the Storm, or, especially, his beloved Huskies, the 63-year-old Heyamoto is right in the middle of the action — and has been since his days at Washington’s law school in the mid-1970s.

Oh, did I mention that Heyamoto is also an attorney — a senior counsel for Boeing since 1983, specializing in commercial contracts and antitrust counseling. He’s UW’s most interesting man in the world, having appeared on both “Jeopardy” and “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” in the midst of the hundreds — probably bordering on thousands — of games he’s worked. You can call him Seattle’s stats guru, but Storm play-by-play man Dick Fain, one of a legion of broadcasters whose work has been aided by Heyamoto’s efforts, realizes that’s not quite strong enough. “He’s really Seattle’s stats legend,” Fain said. Rondeau will be among those inducted into the Huskies’ Hall of Fame on Sunday, a fitting reward for his work as the school’s radio announcer since 1978. But it’s also fitting that at the same ceremony, Heyamoto will receive the Don H. Palmer Award, established in 1994 to recognize those who have “exemplified a special commitment to the UW Athletic Department.” You want to talk special commitment? Heyamoto donates all the money he gets for his various sporting ventures into an endowment for a scholarship in his name that goes to a University of Washington student who works in the Sports Information Department. “It’s just a small repayment for what the university has done for me,” Heyamoto said. Heyamoto has been the stats crew chief for Husky football since 1977. He’s done stats for Husky basketball even longer — since 1975. That’s when Heyamoto, a math major as a UW undergraduate, was taking a business computing class where the project was to design a business-oriented piece of software. “I convinced the professor that keeping track of baskets and steals and fouls was similar to an inventory system,” Heyamoto said. “So he let me write a basketball stat-keeping program.” The Huskies promptly used Heyamoto’s program, believed to be the first of its kind in college athletics. Washington director of communications Jeff Bechtold still has an old, curled-up printout of Heyamoto’s stats from John Wooden’s last loss, which occurred at Hec Edmundson Pavilion in ’75. Heyamoto has been the Seahawks’ stats crew chief since 1982, after starting out as a crew sub in their inaugural season of 1976. He did stats for the Sonics’ visiting television crews from 1995 until their departure. He’s done the Storm since 2000, and the Sounders since 2009. But he’s most identified with the Huskies, having also worked on stats for their women’s basketball team since 1986. Heyamoto and Rondeau are neighbors in Normandy Park, where they grow tomatoes together, and close partners on Husky broadcasts since 1980. For home football games, Heyamoto and his crew — which includes his brother, Gary, a dentist and UW grad; (another brother, Brian, also a UW grad and recently retired from Boeing, is on the Seahawks crew) — compile the official stats. Heyamoto also attends most Husky road games — on his own dime — to sit in the booth as Rondeau’s stat man. Although the home team provides the official stats, Rondeau prefers to use Heyamoto’s while on the road. “He’s more valuable and more accurate than whatever stat system is in whatever stadium we’re in,” Rondeau said. “Sometimes, those systems break down. Craig never breaks down.” And the two have developed such a rapport over the years that Heyamoto knows just what sort of trends Rondeau is looking for, and constantly slips him notes with that information. “The game moves faster than ever before with all the no-huddle offenses,” Rondeau said. “You don’t have a lot of time to explain what you need, nor he what he has. That symbiotic relationship is invaluable.” Heyamoto is legendary for his preparation, which includes studying press notes and media coverage. “He’s come up with probably anywhere from two to a half dozen notes that are nowhere else to be found, and germane to the game,” Rondeau said. “He has them on sticky notes on the ready for when the need arises.” Heyamoto will even watch video of the upcoming opponent for pertinent information. For instance, in advance of Saturday’s game against Oregon State, Heyamoto noticed on film that on their fly sweep, the Beavers sometimes flip the ball forward rather than a straight handoff. That can be the difference between a run and a pass, with obvious statistical ramifications, so he’ll put his crew on alert. Another Heyamoto hallmark is his encyclopedic knowledge of the stat rules, which can be arcane — and vary from college to pro. For instance, sacks in college count as a minus rush for the quarterback, while in pro, they are negative against the team passing yards. He moves seamlessly between the two sets of rules, due in large part to the study he puts in. Heyamoto’s devotion to the Huskies was planted at the age of 7, in 1960, when his father, Hiromu, sat him in front of the television to watch the Rose Bowl between Washington and Wisconsin. He told his son, “We’re going to root for Washington.” Said Heyamoto: “I kind of fell in love with Washington that day.” Hiromu Heyamoto, who died in 2010, grew up in Oregon and played baseball at UW in 1949-50, but not before he was rounded up after World War II broke out, along with other Japanese-Americans, and placed in the Minidoka internment camp in Idaho. That’s where he met his future wife, Masue. As a means to get out of the camp, Heyamoto volunteered to join the army, serving in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, comprised almost exclusively of Japanese-Americans and the most decorated regiment in the U.S. Army in World War II. Shipped off to Italy, Heyamoto earned a bronze star and a purple heart. Asked if his father expressed any bitterness over his internment, Heyamoto replied: “He never said. He didn’t really talk much about the war. I’ve always assumed if he was bitter, he wouldn’t have volunteered to fight. I think that was true of all Japanese-Americans who fought.” A graduate of Highline High School in Burien, Heyamoto wasn’t much of an athlete, but he cut his teeth on stats working the scorebook for his dad’s Little League teams. Stats have been in his blood ever since — even when he’s watching a game on television in his leisure time. “This will sound really nerdy, but I generally have my laptop set up to watch the stat crew that’s working,” he said. “Part of being a good statistician is knowing different plays that could come up.” Heyamoto calculates that he’s attended, watched, listened to or followed online all but two Husky football games since that Rose Bowl in 1960. On both occasions, he was tied up doing stats for national television broadcasts, which he also does as a fill-in on occasion. Heyamoto’s Washington stats crew — which includes Gary Heyamoto calling the defensive stats, Theresa Ripp calling the offensive stats, Bryan Thorn handling the computer input, Lisa Krikava writing down the stats manually as a backup, plus a revolving group of student helpers that Heyamoto patiently mentors — has worked the Rose Bowl since 2009. They also have done the national championship game for several years and will again this year. If Washington’s in it, Heyamoto will keep his professional decorum, which he prides himself on — “but in our hearts, you can kind of guess which way we would be going,” he said with a smile. In the stat booth, Heyamoto is the conductor of the whole operation, calling out the yardage, decisively interpreting the rules, and making sure it all flows smoothly. “He’s completely dedicated to his craft, and he’s a perfectionist,” said Dan Lepse, the assistant athletic director and SID at Seattle Pacific, who has worked extensively on Heyamoto’s stat crew. Heyamoto even sparked an NCAA rule change in basketball. He felt it was wrong for players to get charged with a shot attempt on desperation heaves at the end of a half, so he lobbied the NCAA. They agreed, and such heaves no longer count as a shot, unless they go in. “That’s the Heyamoto rule,” said Lepse. Heyamoto says he models his craft on Don James, the Husky coach when he started working on the UW stats crew. “I really admired Coach James and the way he did things,’’ he said. “Thorough preparation, coach the coaches; in other words, help my teammates understand what they need to do. And then let them do what they do, and I do what I do.” Heyamoto’s predecessor as chief of the Husky stats crew held the job for 40 years, and Heyamoto is closing fast on 40 years. He doesn’t see an end in sight, jokingly pointing to a member of Virginia’s stat crew, Dr. John Risher, still working at 106. “I tell myself I’m going to keep doing it as long as I can keep doing it at the level the teams deserve, and that I feel is up to my standards,” he said. The benefits, he says, are a sense of camaraderie with his crew, being part of the sports scene, and the mental challenge of unraveling the fast-moving and often complex stats matrix. And all the while being unfailingly polite, cordial and helpful. “It’s a way to measure your own ability to do things,” Heyamoto said. “In other words, the team might not be playing very well, but at least you can do your job. And when the team is playing well, all the better.” Larry Stone: 206-464-3146 or lstone@seattletimes.com; on Twitter: @StoneLarry.

Yesterday a Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Boeing 757 flew 81 scientific and support personnel and about three tonnes of baggage and equipment that are needed to support the New Zealand and United States Antarctic research programmes. It was the NZDF’s first strategic airlift support flight to the continent for the 2016-17 summer season. Lieutenant Commander Ross Hickey, the NZDF’s Senior National Officer on the continent, said two more RNZAF Boeing flights are scheduled before the end of October to take another 100 people to Scott Base and McMurdo Station. Further flights will be made from late November by the C-130 Hercules, the workhorses of the RNZAF. "For the past 51 years the NZDF has been contributing to the lifeline of support for New Zealand and American scientists working in Antarctica," Major General Tim Gall, the Commander Joint Forces New Zealand, said. "Every year, our aircraft support the Antarctic research programmes by bringing about 330 scientists and other personnel and almost 40 tonnes of equipment needed to carry out vital research on the continent," MAJGEN Gall said. Antarctica New Zealand Chief Executive Peter Beggs said the significant contribution of the NZDF demonstrated the collaborative nature of Antarctic research and logistics. "NZDF support is an integral part of New Zealand’s strategic leadership both on the Antarctic continent and in the Southern Ocean and we are grateful for the level of professionalism under which these personnel operate," Mr Beggs said. The NZDF also provides search and rescue support, air transport, terminal operations at Harewood Terminal in Christchurch and McMurdo, and support for the unloading of the annual container ship. Up to 220 NZDF staff - including air crew and ground support, passenger and cargo facilitation, logistics, fuel specialists, Army engineers and heavy plant operators, cargo handlers and communications specialists - are deployed during the summer to support the Scott Base and McMurdo stations. The 2016-17 research season marks the 60th anniversary of New Zealand’s operational presence in Antarctica and the construction of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition Hut.

Colombia's Defense Ministry said the plane flying from Madrid to Bogota was briefly approached by a Venezuelan military plane, resulting in diplomatic conversations and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordering an investigation.

An Avianca Boeing 787 on a flight from Madrid to Bogota with some 200 passengers aboard was cruising at high altitude near Venezuela's western border with Colombia Friday evening when a Venezuelan military plane was spotted on radar flying a short distance away, the Colombian Defence Ministry said in a statement. The Avianca pilot immediately notified Colombian aviation authorities and sharply diverted from the flight path. Four minutes later, the military aircraft split away and the jetliner resumed its course, the ministry said. More than 90 minutes after the flight landed safely in Bogota, Venezuela's air defence authorities told their Colombian counterparts that the military aircraft was on a routine patrol. Avianca said it was halting flights to Venezuela and would reroute several flights to Europe to avoid Venezuelan air space. But on Saturday, the airline issued a statement saying it would resume flights to Venezuela on Sunday "following clarifications between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela." Venezuelan officials had not commented publicly on the incident, which comes amid a tension-filled standoff between President Nicolas Maduro and his opponents over the decision to suspend a recall referendum against the embattled socialist leader. Maduro frequently accuses neighbouring Colombia of plotting with his critics to undermine his rule. Relations between the two nations have been hit by a number of crises over the past decade as Venezuela's role as Latin America's leftist stalwart has clashed with Colombia's traditionally staunch support for the United States. The two countries' foreign ministers spoke to each other and Maduro, who is on a multi-nation tour of the Middle East, personally ordered an investigation, the Colombian Defence Ministry said. Defence Minister Luis Carlos Villegas and his Venezuelan counterpart, Gen. Vladimir Padrino, also spoke and agreed to strengthen their early warning communications systems, the ministry added. Colombians across the political spectrum expressed alarm, attributing political overtones to the incident. "These manoeuvrs put in serious risk the lives of the passengers on the plane," said Rodrigo Lara, president of the government-aligned Radical Change party. "It's more evidence of the unpredictability of Nicolas Maduro's government." Avianca is one of the few foreign airlines still serving Caracas after a number of carriers slashed service or stopped selling tickets to Venezuelans because Maduro's government, facing a severe cash crunch triggered by low oil prices, hasn't allowed them to repatriate some $3.8 billion in funds held in the country.

According to the aviation company’s statement, its passenger plane bound for Minsk was forced to return to Zhulyany airport after departing from Kiev after the aircraft’s pilot received an order from a Ukrainian traffic controller to immediately head back, with no further explanation. “On October 21, 2016, Belavia Boeing 737-800 number EW-456PA, carrying out flight V2-840 from Zhulyany (Kiev) to Minsk was forced to return to the departure airport. There were 136 passengers and six crew members on board,” Belavia said in a statement, noting that, according to the flight schedule, the plane was a mere 50 kilometers from the Belarusian border when it was ordered to turn back. “It was also stated [by the traffic controllers] that in case the order was not fulfilled, fighter jets would be sent into the air,” the statement continued. The conversation between the pilot and air traffic controllers, including the threat to send fighter jets to intercept the plane, has been recorded and is currently in possession of Belavia, the company’s deputy director general, Igor Cherginets, told RIA Novosti news agency. The pilot in command of the plane later confirmed he had received the fighter jets threat from the ground. Read more Russia launches criminal cases against leaders of Ukrainian radical group Right Sector "We communicate with air traffic controllers in English, but in this case he contacted us in Russian. We were in the Kiev sector. He contacted us and said that we must return to the Zhulyany airport," captain Viktor Shyshlo told Belarus television on Sunday, as quoted by RIA Novosti. "He [the air traffic controller] said that we would be informed on the cause [of diversion] on the ground, and that if we didn't follow the order to return, fighter jets would be scrambled," the pilot said, adding that his passengers' safety was his priority and that the crew "must follow all commands from the ground." Upon landing in Kiev, one of the passengers was taken off the flight by Ukrainian law enforcement before the plane was refueled and allowed to continue its flight to Minsk. Belavia airlines offered an apology to its passengers for the inconvenience, saying it intends to request compensation for the detour from Ukraine’s aviation authorities. However, Ukraine’s aviation authorities, insist the plane was ordered to return to Kiev to comply with an order from the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU), which explained that they had received intelligence about a possible threat to national security on board the plane in question. “Yesterday, our office received information about a foreign citizen and a possible threat to national security of our country. At the time we received this information, the person in question, as it appeared, was on board the Belavia airlines aircraft, which was supposed to depart to Minsk,” the chief of staff of the SSU, Alexander Tkachuk, told 112 Ukraine broadcaster, claiming that the SSU had acted within the framework of the law. He also refuted claims that Ukraine had threatened to scramble fighter jets to intercept the plane, calling them “absurd.” The passenger who appears to have been the cause of the incident was later released by authorities the same day and left Kiev for Minsk at 7pm. According to Strana.ua news outlet, he has been identified as Armen Martirosyan, a journalist, blogger, and anti-Maidan activist. According to the outlet, Martirosyan left Kiev and moved to Moscow back in 2014 after the Maidan revolution in Ukraine. In a Facebook post published after the incident, he wrote that he has already returned to Moscow and will reveal the details of his detention in Kiev and plans for further action after he speaks to his lawyers. Responding to a question about how he had managed to get away so quickly in the comments to this post, he wrote that “a friend’s call can solve many problems.” Belarus’ Foreign Ministry has filed a note of protest with the Ukrainian authorities over the forced return of the aircraft, and, on Saturday, called in the Chargé d’affaires of Ukraine in the Republic of Belarus, Valery Dzhigun, to express its discontentment with the incident.

VADODARA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today inaugurated the new integrated airport terminal here, which is now the country's second green airport after Kochi, and said such projects will encourage people to take up environment-friendly constructions. Modi, who visited the city for the first time after becoming Prime Minister, said the airport will add another bright spot to the city. "I am happy that after the formation of the new NDA government, two airports in the country have become a part of the green movement. "The first was in Kochi and the second such airport is being dedicated to the nation at Vadodara. This airport will be zero discharge, waste to wealth, energy saving and environment friendly," he said. "It will be considered as one of the top-class airports of the country," Modi said. He said the airport is constructed on the principle of green infrastructure using bricks of fly ash. "Construction of such iconic buildings on green concept will encourage citizens to take up construction on these lines," said the Prime Minister. Spread in an area of 17,500 sq mt, the new integrated terminal has been built at a cost of Rs 160 crore. It has been designed to handle 700 passengers, including international fliers, per hour with 18 check-in counters, which would help in a seamless boarding process. It took about seven years to complete the project as the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel had laid the foundation stone in 2009. The 8,100-meter-long runway of the Vadodra airport can handle small and narrow body aircraft such as Airbus 320 and Boeing 737s. Besides national carrier Air India, private airlines likes IndiGo and Jet airways are operating from here. Stressing on the need to focus on connectivity for development, Modi said the first Railway University to be set up here is an important decision in this direction and will impact the next century. "The government has taken a very important decision whose impact will be felt for nearly 100 years. And the decision is that country's first railway university will be constructed in Vadodara," Modi said addressing public after inaugurating the terminal. Modi had won 2014 Lok Sabha elections with record landslide margin from Vadodara constituency. He also won from Varanasi and later vacated Vadodra. The PM also said the varsity will help in carrying out innovation and modernisation for the Indian Railways. "Connectivity is becoming very important in this century," he said. He also brought up the work to increase the height of Sardar Sarovar dam in neighbouring Narmada district. Modi said his government did two things soon after assuming office in 2014. "The first was the permission to increase height of Sardar Sarovar dam, a work that was waiting since five decades, struggling, and facing difficulties," he said. The second he said was the airport project. "Similarly, air traffic is also needed. Air services are required in a big way for growth of tourism in the country. Better air connectivity means more tourists and this means better economic growth. There are immense possibility for tourism growth in India. Keeping that in view, this government has decided to promote the aviation sector," he said. Referring to the first Railway University to be set up here, Modi said it will impact the next century. "The government has taken a very important decision whose impact will be felt for nearly 100 years. And the decision is that country's first railway university will be constructed in Vadodara," Modi said addressing public after inaugurating the terminal. The PM said the varsity will help in carrying out innovation and modernisation for the Indian Railways. Earlier, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajpathi Raju said since the NDA government came to power, air passengers traffic has "grown by over 20 per cent".

Ken Colburn: How safe are portable battery packs? Ken Colburn, Special for The Republic | azcentral.com 5:02 a.m. MST October 21, 2016 Despite the stories of exploding batteries, it’s quite rare when you consider all the devices we have with lithium ion batteries Take precautions to charge batteries safely. (Photo: Getty Images) Story Highlights Lithium Ion batteries are in just about every rechargeable device we own There is a potential for a "thermal runaway" chain reaction whenever the battery becomes overheated I’d suggest you stick to name brand chargers Question: How safe are portable power banks used to charge a cell phone or tablet? Answer: With all the exploding battery stories surrounding the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, there seems to be a heightened awareness of battery issues, which is actually a good thing. Lithium Ion batteries are in just about every rechargeable device we own and there have been many instances of them catching on fire in everything from laptops to hover boards to Tesla cars and even Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. In fact, there have been over 40 recalls by the Consumer Product Safety Commission since 2002 for products with defective lithium ion batteries. Despite all of the stories of exploding batteries, it’s actually quite rare when you take into consideration the number of devices we have with lithium ion batteries. Why batteries catch fire The very nature of how they work is also what subjects them to becoming a fire hazard. There is a potential for a "thermal runaway" chain reaction whenever the battery becomes overheated, so keeping any device as cool as possible is important. Well-made batteries have safety features built into the battery itself to prevent overcharging and overheating, which is why exploding batteries are relatively rare. Common mistakes The biggest mistake that most people make when using or charging a device with a lithium ion battery is contributing to the overheating. For example, using a laptop for extended periods on a soft surface, like a pillow or comforter usually blocks off any air vents and acts like an insulator, which keeps the heat from dissipating. This scenario can be even more hazardous if you’re charging the laptop at the same time as charging always generates additional heat. If your device has been exposed to direct sunlight and is hot to the touch, you should wait until it reaches room temperature before attempting to recharge it. Using the wrong charger to recharge your battery is another major contributor to problems, especially when too much energy is passed during the charging process. If you ever lose your charger, it’s always safest to replace it with the original manufacturers replacement instead of a third-party charger. Portable chargers To date, I’m not aware of any portable chargers that have been recalled because of a battery defect, but knowing that the design of the unit is a critical factor, I’d suggest you stick to name brand chargers. I’ve always been a fan of the products from Mophie (http://mophie.com), Anker (https://anker.com)  and IOGear (https://iogear.com). Choosing a charger A portable battery’s capacity is rated in milliamps hours or mAh and amperage (A) with the higher the numbers, the more capacity it has to charge your devices. Generally speaking, the higher the capacity, the larger the battery as well so finding the right combination of size and capacity is key. Start by determining the battery capacity of the item(s) you want to charge and then divide the capacity of the portable charger by that number to determine how many charges you can expect. If you plan on charging larger devices, like a tablet, you’ll also need to make sure the amperage is high enough to get the job done (usually 2A).

Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Singapore gets 10,000th Airbus Singapore Airlines has taken delivery of its sixth Airbus A350-900 – the 10,000th aircraft that Airbus has delivered. The airline is the largest A350-900 customer with commitments for 67 firm orders, including seven of the ultra-long-range A350-900ULR (ultra long range) variant. This aircraft, for which deliveries will begin in 2018, will be used to re-launch non-stop flights from Singapore to New York and Los Angeles. The just delivered A350-900 (pictured) will be used to launch non-stop flights between Singapore and San Francisco later this month. China Southern buys bigger 787s Boeing and China Southern Airlines have sealed a $US3.2 billion deal for 12 787-9 Dreamliners. China Southern was the launch customer of the 787 in China and has 10 787-8s in its fleet. They have enabled the Guangzhou-based carrier to launch six new non-stop global routes, connecting Guangzhou to London and Rome in Europe, Vancouver in North America, as well as Perth, Auckland and Christchurch. Qantas opens Brisbane lounge The new Qantas Brisbane International Lounge is the first of several new facilities it will open there as part of a multi-million dollar upgrade. The airline’s A330 fleet is being refurbished at the Brisbane Maintenance Facility and the domestic terminal lounges are set for a complete redesign. The Brisbane International Lounge is based on Qantas’ Hong Kong and Singapore lounge concept, with the food and interior design taking inspiration from the local region. The lounge – split across two levels – offers nearly 30% more space. The furniture is inspired by a relaxed approach to living in the tropical north with timber café seating and low slung lounges. Inset rugs bring colour and texture reminiscent of the reef, sandbars and waterways of Queensland’s coast and inlets. Best and worst airports for sleeping Singapore's Changi Airport has topped Canadian travel site Sleeping in Airports’ latest annual survey. It was followed by Seoul Incheon in Korea in second place followed by Tallinn in Estonia, Tokyo Haneda and Helsinki-Vantaa in Finland. The three worst are Jeddah King Abdulaziz in Saudi Arabia, London’s Luton and Reykjavik-Keflavik in Iceland. Wellington Airport was 33rd on the list with Auckland at 48. More airlines cut Nigeria services Emirates and Kenya Airways have both announced they will be pulling out of services to the Nigerian capital, Abuja, citing the country's worsening foreign currency shortage.   Emirates’ last flight is on October 22, while Kenya Airways will exit from November 15. Other foreign operators that have withdrawn from the Nigerian market in past six months include Iberia and United Airlines. Route news of the week Sichuan Airlines, the newest Chinese airline planning a service to Auckland, has just launched its Chengdu-Hangzhou-Los Angeles route. It runs twice a week using Airbus A330 aircraft. Hainan Airlines will increase its Beijing-Tel Aviv service to four times weekly from November 6. Vietnam-based Jetstar Pacific plans to add four new international routes in coming weeks. They are: Ho Chi Minh City-Hong Kong four times weekly from November 18; Hanoi-Guangzhou daily from December 1; Da Nang-Taipei Taoyuan three times weekly from December 2 (the airline’s predecessor Pacific Airlines served Ho Chi Minh-Taipei until May 2007);   and Ho Chi Minh City-Guangzhou five times weekly  from December 2.

And if 41 people within a 330-yard radius have a cellphone app alerting them to your distress, so much the better. That’s what happened in Seattle last week when Stephen DeMont collapsed at a bus stop in front of University of Washington Medical Center. While a medical student rushed over and began chest compressions, a cardiac nurse just getting off her shift at the hospital was alerted by her phone, sprinted outside and assisted until paramedics arrived. Five days later, DeMont, 60, is walking, smiling and talking about how the PulsePoint app helped save his life. Seattle officials say the rescue shows the potential the free download has for connecting CPR-trained citizens with patients who urgently need their help. It’s being used in 2,000 U.S. cities in 28 states. “I put it on my phone yesterday,” said DeMont’s wife, Debi Quirk, a former registered nurse. “He would not be here as we see him today.” Seattle officials hope DeMont’s story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in Northern California, Richard Price, the app works through a city’s 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. Some 34,000 off-duty professional and citizen responders around the country have downloaded it, Price said Wednesday, and they’ve been alerted to more than 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. “The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,” Price said. “The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.” It occurred to him that at any given time, two-thirds of his staff was off duty — in restaurants, out in the community. If there was a way to alert them to such emergencies by phone, it could save lives, Price said. It’s not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient’s outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington, said she downloaded the app about a month ago after reading a news story that mentioned it. Last Friday morning was the first time she’d ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found 27-year-old medical student Zach Forcade performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. “I hadn’t responded to a cardiac arrest before,” Forcade said. “I thought, ‘Did he just fall?’ ... Even being in the medical field, I thought, ‘Oh, man, who’s going to step up?’ ” He told another passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide any needed backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said. For DeMont, it was about more than just being lucky. A contract technical writer at Expedia, he said he has a love-hate relationship with technology — “You see all these things about people falling off cliffs texting, people are so disconnected” — but the response from Forcade, Dahl and the use of PulsePoint reaffirmed his belief in its power to make a positive difference. “There’s hope,” DeMont said. He’s due to have a defibrillator implanted on Thursday. Now he just has to figure out how to pay the $100,000 tab without insurance. For that, his family has turned to a program with a different app: GoFundMe.

Bombardier is eliminating 7,500 jobs, its second round of steep job cuts this year. The cuts at the Canadian jet and train manufacturer, which represent more than 10% of its global workforce, come on top of 7,000 cuts announced in February. Those earlier cuts are "nearly complete," a spokesman said. The company had 67,200 employees as of Sept. 30. Bombardier said 2,000 of the job cuts will be in Canada and the rest spread around the globe. It has U.S. operations in Pittsburgh; Wichita, Kansas; and Plattsburgh, New York. The cuts will come in both its jet and train businesses. Related: Airbus CEO vows to retake jet production crown from Boeing Job cuts have become common across the aerospace industry this year. Boeing (BA) announced in March it would cut 4,000 jobs, though it said it hoped to accomplish the reduction through voluntary buyouts. Airbus chief Tom Enders was quoted last month saying he couldn't rule out job cuts. And Brazil's Embraer is reportedly also using buyouts to cut jobs. Related: Airbus offers a peek at its flying taxi But the cuts at Bombardier (BDRAF) are much deeper than those of rivals because the regional jet business, in which it is a major player, has been particularly hard hit. Airlines are shifting away from using those smaller jets.

Seattle officials hope DeMont’s story will help persuade thousands more people to sign up for notifications; so far, about 4,000 people in Seattle have downloaded PulsePoint since the city adopted it earlier this year with financial support from an employee charitable fund at Boeing. The goal is to have 15,000 using it. Developed by a former fire chief in California, Richard Price, the app works through a city’s 911 system. When a call comes in, operators alert people within a certain radius that CPR assistance is needed, along with the location of the nearest portable defibrillator. About 900,000 people around the country have downloaded and carry the app, and 34,000 people have been activated to respond, he said, adding that alerts have been issued in 13,000 cardiac events. He came up with the idea in 2009, he said. He was in a restaurant when he heard sirens from his crews at the San Ramon Valley fire department. As he wondered where they were going, they arrived at the restaurant. “The patient was unconscious, unresponsive. I was 20 feet away on the other side of the wall,” Price said. “The whole time I was listening to that siren, I could have been making a difference.” It’s not clear how many lives have been saved thanks to the app. Patient confidentiality laws often prevent hospitals from disclosing a patient’s outcome. Madeline Dahl, a 23-year-old cardiac nurse at the University of Washington Medical Center, said she downloaded the app about a month ago. Last Friday was the first time she’d ever received an alert. She bolted down a couple flights of stairs and ran outside into the rain, where she found medical student Zach Forcade, 27, performing chest compressions. Forcade had been on his way into the hospital for a lecture when he saw DeMont, who was just getting off his bicycle, slump over. He told a passerby to call 911, which triggered an alert sent out to 41 responders nearby. It was reassuring when Dahl arrived to provide backup, help check for a pulse and otherwise make sure Forcade was responding correctly, he said.

BUSINESS REAL ESTATE Hot Property Neighborhood Spotlight: Canoga Park rocketing on fewer engines (Los Angeles Times) Scott Garner If there’s one part of the San Fernando Valley that most expressed the go-go spirit of Space Age America, it’s Canoga Park. The neighborhood is where aerospace giant Rocketdyne designed the massive rockets that would take us to the moon and back, and where each sprawling new ranch home contained a nuclear family in which at least one parent was a bona fide pocket protector-sporting rocket scientist. The national craze for all things aerospace extended even to the finned cars thronging Sherman Way, cruising through the warm Valley nights under a wall of neon signs. At a certain time in the last century, it must have seemed to the Tang-swilling citizens of Canoga Park that a Jetsons-like future was just around the corner. Less than 50 years before the U.S. and USSR began lobbing men into space, Canoga Park had been a treeless, windswept corner of the Valley where sheep far outnumbered people. That didn’t stop the Los Angeles Suburban Home Co. from marketing the area as a desirable locale to put down roots. In one of the boldest bits of chicanery in Valley real estate history, the syndicate named the town Owensmouth, implying it was near the new mouth of the Owens River (a.k.a. the terminus of the Los Angeles Aqueduct) — never mind that it was 15 miles distant and still a year away from completion. Owensmouth grew fitfully at first, but the aqueduct’s water — and new connections to Los Angeles via a Pacific Electric Railway line that ran down the center of Sherman Way — kept the little town alive long enough for residents to jettison the name in favor of Canoga Park. It wasn’t until the end of World War II, when the Valley became the red-hot center of SoCal’s suburban boom, that Canoga Park and the future would finally meet in the clean rooms and laboratories of Rocketdyne, TRW, Boeing and other aerospace companies that flocked to the area. Unfortunately, the future is fickle. Waves of industry consolidation, the end of the space shuttle program and the general exodus of much of the Valley’s aerospace industry to other parts of the country hit Canoga Park hard. Now, only Aerojet Rocketdyne remains, and Canoga Park has transitioned into a bedroom community better known for Sherman Way’s antique stores than for cutting-edge space flight technology. Neighborhood highlights Suburban living that’s (relatively) affordable: Unlike closer-in Valley nabes like Sherman Oaks and Studio City, Canoga Park prices rarely range into the seven figures, with many homes available right around the $500K mark. A touch of the past: The remnants of Owensmouth can still be seen along Sherman Way, in Canoga Park’s Antique Row. These brick buildings from the 1920s and 1930s took a beating in the Northridge quake but lived to tell the tale. Indoors / Outdoors: If nature is your thing, there are plenty of state parks and open spaces a short drive away; shoppers and mall walkers will appreciate the proximity to Warner Center’s retail offerings. Neighborhood challenges A long road to recovery: The loss of the aerospace industry is a blow that Canoga Park has yet to fully bounce back from, with weed shops and payday loan outlets lining many formerly thriving business corridors. Expert insight Ashish Trivedi, licensed partner and president of Engel & Volkers, a Valley real estate firm, said there’s been a push to revitalize Canoga Park. Single-family homes that neighbor mall behemoth Westfield Topanga in particular have seen increases in value and demand, he said. Canoga Park is “a little more community-based” than other parts of Los Angeles, he said. “The price affordability factor is also huge.” Market snapshot Portions of the 91303, 91304, and 91307 ZIP Codes overlap the Canoga Park area. In the 91303 ZIP, the median price for single-family homes in August was $571,000, based on six sales, according to CoreLogic. The median price in the 91304 ZIP, based on 28 sales, was $578,000, and in the 91307 ZIP, 36 sales produced a median price of $641,000. Report card Canoga Park schools include N.E.W. Academy Canoga Park, which scored 812 out of 1,000 in the 2013 Academic Performance Index. Canoga Park Elementary had a score of 750 and Hart Street Elementary scored 703. Christopher Columbus Middle and Canoga Park Senior High scored 698 and 693, respectively. hotproperty@latimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, Los Angeles Times Real Estate Housing Market Why Trump — or any other politician — can't do much to bring back manual labor jobs The LAPD police watchdog has taken the unusual step of dedicating today's entire meeting to one issue Clippers push record to NBA-best 10-1 with thumping of Nets Most Popular Local Sports Entertainment Politics Orange County Opinion Place An Ad 69°

UK May Investigate Military Purchases From US © Flickr/ U.S. Pacific Command Military & Intelligence 02:55 21.10.2016(updated 08:20 21.10.2016) Get short URL 442601315 The United Kingdom’s new defense contract oversight agency may launch an investigation into the government-to-government (G2G) sales of London’s principal ally. The Single Source Regulations Office (SSRO) was established in 2014 as part of an effort to ensure British taxpayers were getting the best bang for their buck when it comes to defense contracts. With the UK’s Ministry of Defense spending roughly $10.8 billion each year on single-source contracts, a lot of money is at stake. © AP Photo/ Alastair Grant UK Defense Secretary Believes Brexit to Promote Defense Sector Revolution The SSRO has already expressed concern over the purchase of Boeing Apache helicopters and P-8 patrol aircraft. Now the organization has set its sights on the potential purchase of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles from the United States. "Foreign military sales [FMS] (for example, Poseidon P-8A and Apache helicopters) are decisions to award single source contracts which do not fall under the regulations and therefore do not benefit from the transparency brought by the regime," reads a September SSRO report, according to Defense News. "It is vital that there is transparency in all these cases and the reasons are fully justified." Jon Louth, of the Royal United Services Institute, agrees, telling Defense News that being open about G2G contracts will improve efficiency. "The lack of transparency drives uncertainty and cynicism. Some of these deals are really good for the operator and can be good for the taxpayers as well. Having a light shine on these kind of contracts would not necessarily be a bad thing," he said. © Flickr/ Forsvarsdepartementet UK Defense Ministry Signs $237Mln Deal to Purchase Latest Missiles for F-35 "Why are we having these deals unless we can point to them being specific and exceptional? Something like P-8 is a good example. It’s difficult to see why it trumps other potential solutions other than the operators really wanted it, there’s nothing wrong in that, but let’s at least put it to some kind of scrutiny if we are going to have uncontested solutions." In August, the Ministry of Defense announced a number of major purchases, including "dragonfly drones," virtual reality helmets, and a device that can survey enemy tunnels. The MoD plans to spend over $1 billion on this technology. The UK also signed a $237 million contract to purchase air-to-air missiles for its F-35B fighter jets. These, however, will be produced domestically. "Wholly designed and built in the UK, this air-to-air missile on our F-35 aircraft will secure cutting-edge air power for the UK for years to come," Harriet Baldwin, minister for defense procurement, said in a press release, adding that it would "sustain around 400 jobs across the country." ...

Reply support 06:08 03.11.2016 | 0 | Edit | Delete It is a bit of a WW II-type problem in that then as now there lacks a proper liaison office where both the buy side and the sell side sit down in the same room to compare notes. Funnily enough, just immediately prior to Pearl Harbour the USA was still selling munitions and kit to both sides (in practice, not in terms of treaties). Under those conditions US sales to the Germans swent along swimmingly as their procurement specialists were happy to share cost data with the Yanks so as to harmonize & smoothen their buying needs with the US manufacturing machine. Following Pearl Harbour, the Royal Navy's Ordnance division liaison office in Warren, Michigan, USA, used the paradigm the Germans developed to coordinate their purchases and to provide useful feedback to the Yanks. As ever and as with all international long-term procurement, the weakest link is always how changes in the in-process supply requirements of the customer impacts the customer's original terms and conditions of product acceptance. Without the feedback mechanism making actual changes to the acceptance criteria, costs go through the roof whilst no one is really sure what is going to arrive during the next supply round. The book "Industrialists in olive drab: the emergency operation of private industries during World War II" by John H. Ohly and edited by Clayton D. Laurie goes into the grisly details of this mind-numbingly boring accountant's topic (boring unless you do it for a living, anyway). Another topical read on how government to government military trade can become massively dysfunctional with little effort whatsoever is "Defense acquisition reform 1960–2009 : an elusive goal " by J. Ronald Fox with contributions by David G. Allen.Show new comments (0) Сomment Reply in reply to(Show commentHide comment) | | Edit | Delete Save Thank you!

The Federal Reserve meeting Nov. 1-2 and of course the presidential election the following week are giving investors additional dynamics to consider along with the seasonal gauging of financial performances at some of the world’s largest corporations. Most traders expect no interest rate hike by the Fed in November but are leaning toward a move in December, are attempting to make sense of a chaotic election and trying to figure out how businesses are navigating the current political and economic environments. Many companies have decided to show extreme caution in their guidance to The Street as only 21 S&P 500 corporations issued financial outlooks in September to show a record low for any month since 2000, per the Wall Street Journal. Against that backdrop, third quarter financial season for government contractors including those in our GovCon Index started this week with reports from S&P 500 firms Textron and Honeywell. Textron’s stock spiked 3 percent Thursday after the aircraft maker reported year-over-year earnings and revenue increases for the July-September period, while Honeywell shares added three-quarter a percent Friday as of midday on mixed results with some growth-oriented guidance. Next week is the traditional primetime week for the large GovCon primes as Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and L-3 Communications will all disclose third quarter results and speak with analysts to discuss defense market conditions and outlooks. DigitalGlobe will also detail its financial picture to investors nearly two weeks after the satellite imagery giant announced the $140 million acquisition of The Radiant Group. This season figures to more than just about dollars and cents for GovCon firms and investors as the defense spending and post-election environments all contribute to a very murky picture.

Stop Video Replay 2:38 News break – October 23 UP NEXT VIDEO News break – October 23. Source: Sunrise News break – October 23 The warplane briefly approached the airliner flying from Madrid to Bogota on Friday, prompting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to order an investigation. The incident took place Friday night, when Avianca's Boeing Dreamliner carrying 150 passengers detected the Venezuelan warplane "at close range," where it remained four minutes, the Colombian government said on Saturday. The fighter jet then turned north and roared away. The incident prompted diplomatic discussions and Maduro's order for an investigation. But Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, downplayed the incident early Saturday. "The ministers have spoken and cleared it all up, everything is normal," he said. "There's no need to worry." On the Venezuelan side, lawmaker Diosdado Cabello later called it a "regrettable misunderstanding. "I understand, to the best of my knowledge, there was a regrettable misunderstanding. It was nothing planned against Avianca in any way at all. It will be taken care of," said Cabello, who is also the number two in Maduro's administration. In the end, the suspension of two daily flights between Bogota and Caracas one daily flight between Caracas and Lima never took effect. The flights are to run as normal on Sunday, Avianca said. The airline had previously reduced the frequency of its flights to crisis-wracked Venezuela. Analysts have warned of a risk of violent unrest in this country of 30 million people. Hit by the fall in crude oil prices, the Venezuelan economy has crashed. Food shortages have prompted looting in recent months. Opposition leaders in Caracas plan mass street protests for next week, accusing the socialist government of staging a coup by blocking efforts for a recall referendum against the unpopular Maduro. Riots in 2014 left 43 people dead.

Photo: Ariana Cubillos, Associated Press Venezuela braces for tensions over recall 1 / 2 Back to Gallery CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela is bracing for turbulence after the socialist government blocked a presidential recall referendum in a move opposition leaders are calling a coup. The opposition urged supporters to take to the streets, beginning with a march on a major highway Saturday led by the wives of jailed activists, while a leading government figure, Diosdado Cabello, called for the arrest of high-profile government critics. Polls suggest socialist President Nicolas Maduro would lose a recall vote. But that became a moot issue Thursday when election officials issued an order suspending a recall signature drive a week before it was to start. “What we saw yesterday was a coup,” said former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, who had been the leading champion of the recall effort. “We’ll remain peaceful, but we will not be taken for fools. We must defend our country.” International condemnation was swift. Twelve western hemisphere nations, including the U.S. and even leftist-run governments such as Chile and Uruguay, said in a statement Friday that the suspension of the referendum and travel restrictions on the opposition leadership affects the prospect for dialogue and finding a peaceful solution to the nation’s crisis. In another sign of growing regional tensions, Colombia’s flagship airline on Saturday briefly grounded all flights to Caracas after a mid-air incident involving one of its planes and the Venezuelan air force. Avianca said one of its Boeing 787s was flying near Venezuela’s western border with Colombia when a Venezuelan military aircraft was spotted on radar flying a short distance away. The commercial jet diverted from its course but landed safely. The socialists won power nearly two decades ago with the election of the popular former President Hugo Chavez, and for years enjoyed easy election victories. But with the economy in free fall, polls show most Venezuelans have turned against the party, and over the years, the administration has gradually become increasingly autocratic.

The warplane briefly approached the airliner flying from Madrid to Bogota on Friday, prompting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to order an investigation. The measure "will continue indefinitely until we have explicit security guarantees for crossing Venezuelan airspace," a company spokesman told AFP.

Colombia's Defense Ministry said the plane flying from Madrid to Bogota was briefly approached by a Venezuelan military plane, resulting in diplomatic conversations and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordering an investigation. There was as yet no official word from Avianca, but a source at the carrier told Reuters it had suspended flights to and over Venezuela after two warplanes approached its plane on Friday evening, forcing it out of Venezuelan airspace. Data from online tracker FlightRadar24 confirmed Avianca's flights were avoiding Venezuela on Saturday. It also showed Avianca's Boeing Dreamliner took a sharp turn when flying over west Venezuela around 2000 local time (2000 EST/0000 GMT), in line with a statement by Colombian authorities. Both nations' defense and foreign ministers have discussed the plane incident, Colombia said. It said Maduro "personally ordered the investigation into the case." "The ministers have spoken and cleared it all up, everything is normal," Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said during a visit to cacao growers. "There's no need to worry." The South American neighbors have for years had a volatile relationship, with Venezuela's socialist government sometimes accusing Colombia of provocation, and claims in the other direction that Caracas has supported Colombian guerrillas. The two countries' lengthy border is a constant source of tension. Venezuelan authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Colombian statement cited Venezuelan authorities as saying its warplane was on a "navigation mission."

Avianca said it would resume flights on Sunday, after cancelling transport to Venezuela when a passenger jet flying from Madrid to Bogota was briefly approached by Venezuelan military aircraft on Friday evening, resulting in diplomatic conversations and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordering an investigation. "After clarifications between the governments of Colombia and Venezuela about the incident registered last night in Venezuelan skies with an Avianca plane, the Colombian civil aviation authority has authorized the restart of operations to and from Venezuela," Avianca said in a statement on Saturday evening. The South American neighbors have for years had a volatile relationship, with Venezuela's socialist government sometimes accusing Colombia of provocation, and claims in the other direction that Caracas has supported Colombian guerrillas. The two countries' lengthy border is a constant source of tension. Data from online tracker FlightRadar24 showed Avianca's flights were avoiding Venezuela on Saturday and a source from the company confirmed to Reuters that flights to Venezuela had been cancelled.

The Colombian defense ministry said the plane, which was flying from Madrid to Bogota, was briefly approached by a Venezuelan military plane, resulting in diplomatic conversations and the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, ordering an investigation. Venezuelans warn of 'dictatorship' after officials block bid to recall Maduro Read more There was no official word from Avianca, but a source at the carrier told Reuters it had suspended flights to and over Venezuela after two warplanes approached its plane on Friday evening, forcing it out of Venezuelan airspace.

It also showed Avianca’s Boeing Dreamliner took a sharp turn when flying over west Venezuela around 8pm local time, in line with a statement by Colombian authorities. The South American neighbors have for years had a volatile relationship, with Venezuela’s socialist government sometimes accusing Colombia of provocation and claims in the other direction that Caracas has supported Colombian guerrillas. The lengthy border is a constant source of tension. Both nations’ defense and foreign ministers have discussed the plane incident, Colombia said. It said Maduro “personally ordered the investigation into the case”. Venezuelan authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Containers arriving and leaving the Wando Welch Terminal are unloaded and loaded for shipment. Foreign trade is a large part of the South Carolina economy. Tim Dominick tdominick@thestate.com i By Jeff Wilkinson jwilkinson@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s nominee for president, might be leading in the polls in South Carolina, but his economic positions on immigration and foreign trade would hurt the Palmetto State’s economy, experts say. However, Sen. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has softened her support for a major free trade deal as the campaign has progressed, they say. And free trade is perhaps the most important economic issue for South Carolina workers because the state is manufacturing heavy, export and import dependent and has one of the nation’s leading ports. Like the majority of the America public, economists and business leaders interviewed are not overly enamored with either candidate. One economist even refused to comment because he felt the plans weren’t worthy of comment. But the majority of those interviewed feel Clinton’s proposed economic policies – particularly her call for comprehensive immigration reform – are more in line with South Carolina’s economic goals. “Both candidates appear to be less focused on free trade relative to Obama, Bush – both W. and H.W. – Bill Clinton and Reagan,” said Mark Witte, College of Charleston economist and director of the school’s Master of Business Administration program. “And given that so much of South Carolina’s trade relations are with Europe, free trade is a big, big deal for workers here.” Witte added that Trump’s opposition to free trade deals that he deems poor might play well in the unionized rust belt, but don’t apply or are counterproductive to the growing manufacturing base in South Carolina. We don’t have the same problem as other states (in the Midwest and Northeast) have. We’re not shipping jobs off to Mexico. Europe is shipping jobs here. Mark Witte, College of Charleston economist “We don’t have the same problem as other states” in the Midwest and Northeast, he added. “We’re not shipping jobs off to Mexico. Europe is shipping jobs here.” ‘Economic pillars’ The three pillars of South Carolina’s economy are manufacturing, tourism and agribusiness. All three would be negatively impacted by Trump’s positions on either free trade or immigration, economists say. “Tourism and agriculture are the top two industries in the state,” said Joseph Von Nessen, an economist with the University of South Carolina’s Darla Moore School of Business, which is home to the nation’s leading international business program. “Manufacturing is not quite as large, but is right up there.” Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis compiled by Von Nessen show: Manufacturing represents about 12 percent of employment in South Carolina, and contributes about $33 billion in gross state product ▪  Manufacturing represents about 12 percent of employment in South Carolina, and contributes about $33 billion in gross state product. ▪  Tourism represents approximately 13 percent of employment and $10 billion in gross state product. ▪  Agribusiness is about 6 percent of the state’s employment and $27 billion in gross state product. Although economists say Trump’s policies would threatened the stability of the state’s main industries, a majority of South Carolinians – particular poorer whites in rural areas where jobs are scarce – still support him. Raising tariffs? Lowing taxes? Experts interviewed said that Trump’s stance on free trade – such as his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and his threats to raise tariffs against Mexico and China – could cost South Carolina jobs. Clemson economist Scott Baier, interim chairman of the school’s John E. Walker Department of Economics, said, “The immediate impact would be on consumers and producers that use imported intermediate goods,” referring to parts used in the manufacture of other products. In 2015, South Carolina imported more than $9 billion in goods from China and Mexico. In 2015, he said, the state imported more than $9 billion in goods from China and Mexico. “Many of these imports were used as intermediate goods,” he said. “If the state would have to turn to other suppliers, it would up the costs of doing business and may cost jobs in the state rather than create jobs.” For example, nearly 50 percent of the nation’s auto parts are imported from Mexico and China, Baier said, and the port of Charleston is one of the leading destinations for those auto imports. “In addition, you worry about a trade war where China and Mexico would raise tariffs on our goods,” he said. “This could reduce the market for our exports and slow job growth in South Carolina.” Trump has said his tax plans, which would cut income taxes across the board and drastically lower corporate taxes to 15 percent from 35 percent, would spur job growth. “You will find varying estimates on the economic impact of the two candidates’ plans,” Baier said. “The success of Secretary Clinton's fiscal plan depends largely on the faith that the government expenditures will help grow the economy and that the higher taxes on top income earners will have little impact on the how they choose to work and spend. For Mr Trump, the success of his plan depends on the belief that lower taxes creates the incentive for the private sector to create jobs and boost economic growth as well as Mr Trump's ability to reduce government expenditures.” ‘Our customers are in Europe’ Witte, the College of Charleston economist, said opposition to TPP by both Trump and now Clinton, as well as Trump’s threat to dismantle NAFTA, would have less impact on South Carolina than other parts of the country. However, a future trade agreement with the European Union – an agreement called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – could be a huge boost to the state, he said. But negotiations on that agreement have stalled because of opposition by some unions, charities, non-governmental organizations and environmentalists, particularly in Europe. “It’s all about where your clients are,” Witte said. “Our customers are in Europe. If we have a free trade agreement with them, we’ll be able to export more to them” because the goods – mostly cars and tires – could be sold for a lower price. Witte added that if Trump imposes tariffs on China and Mexico, trade would likely shift to other cheap labor countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh and India. That would having little impact on U.S. consumers, he said, “but inconvenience many multi-national firms.” If we make it hard for (multi-national corporations) to compete, one of the things they will cut will be jobs Republican consultant Chip Felkel Republican consultant Chip Felkel of Greenville noted that those multi-national firms are driving South Carolina’s new manufacturing base – firms like BMW, Michelin, Boeing, Continental and Volvo. “You’ve got a manufacturing community that is so critical to our economy,” he said. “If we make it hard for them to compete, one of the things they will cut will be jobs.” Efforts to interview S.C. Commerce Secretary Bobby Hitt for this story were unsuccessful. However in a prepared statement he said: “There are numerous factors that impact the global business environment. And, from a business perspective, South Carolina remains committed to ensuring that we maintain a business-friendly climate – one that provides our companies with the resources they need to succeed in marketplaces around the world.” ‘Keep them in the system’ Tourism and agriculture, the other two pillars of South Carolina’s economy, rely heavily on foreign workers, along with the vital construction industry. Trump has made tougher immigration laws and coming down hard on illegal immigrants the bedrock of his campaign. Clinton has promised comprehensive immigration reform involving guest worker programs and a path to citizenship to allow illegal immigrants to keep working, but as yet hasn’t delivered any firm plan on how to do it. “Clinton is making comprehensive immigration a priority, but we don’t know what those plans would look like,” Witte said. “Trump has been very audible about limiting immigration. But illegal immigration exists because legal immigration is so difficult.” John Durst, president and CEO of the South Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association, said his organization for years has joined state and national hospitality, agriculture and construction associations to call for immigration reform. “And that appears to be consistent with the position Senator Clinton has taken,” he said. Some mass exodus is not going to help this state Republican consultant Chip Felkel Felkel, the Republican consultant, added that Trump’s plan to deport illegal immigrants rather than create a way for them to continue working legally would have disastrous affects on the state. “What has launched Trump for so many people is his pounding the table and saying he was the savior to fix immigration,” he said. “But some mass exodus is not going to help this state. Those small business people that run hotels on the Grand Strand or farm in the Pee Dee would be crippled. “Yes, there has to be better enforcement of the laws on the books,” he said. “But we need a viable, prudent, logical solution. Register legally, make amends, pay a fine, go to the back of the line, but stay in the system.” But the experts also noted that no president can implement immigration reform or create trade policy without the consent of Congress. “A lot of what happens will depend on who controls the House and Senate,” said Baier, the Clemson economist. “While we often complain about gridlock, sometimes gridlock is a good thing. It can slow the implementation of bad policies or at lease allow us to rethink and formulate new policies that will likely lead to better outcomes.” The candidates’ economic positions FOREIGN TRADE ▪  Trump would potentially place large tariffs on goods from China and Mexico, which represent 50 percent of the imports used to manufacture cars produced in South Carolina. ▪  Trump opposes the TPP and would repeal NAFTA if, he says, other countries aren't playing fair. ▪  Clinton helped negotiate TPP, but now she says she opposes it. She prefers small tweaks to the status quo in terms of foreign trade. IMMIGRATION ▪  Trump wants to build a wall to prevent illegal immigration, close the borders and has even suggested millions of illegals be deported. ▪  Clinton wants immigration reform which conceivably would make it easier for workers to come in legally and those already here to become legal. ▪  Trump opposes any pathway to legal status for those now here illegally, and has called for an end to “birth right citizenship” presently granted to anyone born in the United States regardless of their parents’ citizenship. TAXES ▪  Trump wants to lower taxes across the board, especially for the rich, and drop significantly taxes on corporate America. He would lower revenues over 10 years to $9.6 trillion, according to the Tax Policy Center’s study. ▪  Clinton would leave the middle class about the same and raise dramatically the taxes on the top 1 percent. She said her plan would increase revenues by $1.1 trillion a year. ▪  Clinton would raise from 40 percent to 45 percent the estate taxes on individuals who receive more than $3.5 million in inheritance and couples who receive more than $7 million. Trump would eliminate the so called “death tax.” Related content If US-EU trade deal is dead, what does that mean for South Carolina?

Photo: AFP Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc on Friday said it was cutting 7,500 jobs, its second major layoff announcement this year following delays in deliveries of its C-series airplanes. The job cuts, to be completed by the end of 2018, are expected to mostly hit administrative posts, with two-thirds from the transport division, a Bombardier spokesman said. These layoffs come on the heels of a February announcement to eliminate 7,000 manufacturing jobs. The two rounds of job cuts account for about 20 percent of Montreal-based Bombardier’s workforce. Bombardier, which has taken on debt to finance its ambitious plane-building program, said the latest downsizing would result in annual savings of about US$300 million as part of a five-year plan to turn the firm around. “The actions announced today will ensure we have the right cost structure, workforce and organization to compete and win in the future,” chief executive Alain Bellemare said in a statement. Bombardier has been trying to accelerate production of the C Series, as well as to develop the new Global 7000 business jet, scheduled to begin production in 2018. The company announced plans to hire as many as 3,750 employees to speed these initiatives, according to Canadian media reports. Bellemare said the new jobs would be added in low-cost countries and more established higher-cost operations. “It’s the only way that we can protect the thousands of jobs in the industry and at Bombardier. It’s a very competitive industry and it’s important to take the necessary steps to remain competitive in this context,” he was quoted as saying Bombardier had touted the C Series, its first completely new aircraft in the 100 to 150-seat category in more than 25 years, as a means to cut into the dominance of US aerospace giant Boeing Co and European rival Airbus Group SE. However, the project has been stymied by delays, with Bombardier announcing last month that it cut its this year’s forecast for deliveries of the plane from 15 to seven due to engine delivery delays from Pratt & Whitney. Costs for the C Series program have risen to US$5.4 billion, Bombardier has estimated. The Quebec government came to the rescue of Bombardier last year, investing US$1.0 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in its C Series plane program. Bombardier has also sought support from federal officials in Canada, but no deal has been reached. This story has been viewed 1251 times. Comments will be moderated.

No pricing details were given in the filing. The company intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol INTR. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, RBC Capital and Credit Agricole CIB.   This global leasing company acquires and leases passenger aircraft to a diverse group of airlines throughout the world. Intrepid’s strategy is to firmly establish it as a leading aircraft lessor of primarily, though not exclusively, young, modern, fuel-efficient twin-engine wide-body passenger aircraft with long-term leases to well-established airlines, while seeking to maximize long-term earnings growth and returns through the economic cycle. The company believes its portfolio that consists mainly of wide-body aircraft will allow it to meet the needs of airlines’ growing preference for larger gauge aircraft due to increasing demand for air travel. Intrepid believes that it is the only aircraft lessor primarily focused on acquiring and leasing twin-engine wide-body passenger aircraft, which it believes is a relatively less competitive market segment that has substantial latent demand. The company also intends to expand its fleet mix by acquiring select narrow-body passenger aircraft that it expects to have long useful lives and that are currently in widespread use and in-demand by airlines, while still maintaining a greater focus on acquiring wide-body aircraft. In the filing the company said: Our owned and committed portfolio includes popular twin-engine widebody passenger aircraft such as the Airbus A330-300, Airbus A330-200, Boeing 777-300ER and Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, as well as the popular Airbus A321 narrowbody passenger aircraft. As of June 30, 2016, we owned 28 aircraft. Our owned aircraft as of June 30, 2016 have an average age of 2.9 years and our aircraft on lease have an average remaining lease term of 8.5 years.

Modi, who visited the city for the first time after becoming Prime Minister, said the airport will add another bright spot to the city. "I am happy that after the formation of the new NDA government, two airports in the country have become a part of the green movement. "The first was in Kochi and the second such airport is being dedicated to the nation at Vadodara. This airport will be zero discharge, waste to wealth, energy saving and environment friendly," he said. "It will be considered as one of the top-class airports of the country," Modi said. He said the airport is constructed on the principle of green infrastructure using bricks of fly ash. "Construction of such iconic buildings on green concept will encourage citizens to take up construction on these lines," said the Prime Minister. Spread in an area of 17,500 sq mt, the new integrated terminal has been built at a cost of Rs 160 crore. It has been designed to handle 700 passengers, including international fliers, per hour with 18 check-in counters, which would help in a seamless boarding process. It took about seven years to complete the project as the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel had laid the foundation stone in 2009. The 8,100-meter-long runway of the Vadodra airport can handle small and narrow body aircraft such as Airbus 320 and Boeing 737s. Besides national carrier Air India, private airlines likes IndiGo and Jet airways are operating from here. Stressing on the need to focus on connectivity for development, Modi said the first Railway University to be set up here is an important decision in this direction and will impact the next century. "The government has taken a very important decision whose impact will be felt for nearly 100 years. And the decision is that country's first railway university will be constructed in Vadodara," Modi said addressing public after inaugurating the terminal. Modi had won 2014 Lok Sabha elections with record landslide margin from Vadodara constituency. He also won from Varanasi and later vacated Vadodra. The PM also said the varsity will help in carrying out innovation and modernisation for the Indian Railways. "Connectivity is becoming very important in this century," he said. He also brought up the work to increase the height of Sardar Sarovar dam in neighbouring Narmada district. Modi said his government did two things soon after assuming office in 2014. "The first was the permission to increase height of Sardar Sarovar dam, a work that was waiting since five decades, struggling, and facing difficulties," he said. The second he said was the airport project. (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration The next President will take power with significant space decisions looming Moon or Mars? SLS or private rockets? The next president will face big questions. by Eric Berger - Oct 22, 2016 1:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 117 Trump and Clinton, should we send them into space? Aurich / Getty At the upper edge of the atmosphere, where the sky kisses outer space, a few molecules of nitrogen and oxygen bounce around. If we consider the presidential election as playing out at the surface of the Earth, amid a thick atmosphere of invective and accusation, it is not a stretch to say the relative importance of space policy lies somewhere near the edge of space, bouncing around inconsequentially, like these stray molecules. Even so, the next president of the United States will have the ability, if not the desire, to shape the future of America’s civil space programs—especially with major decision points on the horizon, including the privatization of spaceflight and the details of where humans should go beyond low-Earth orbit. For this reason, we’re going to look at what changes a new president might make and what attitudes each candidate has had toward space. Among the first tasks of a new administration is to launch a transition team to review major federal programs. With a budget that comprises about 0.4 percent of all federal spending and a significant chunk of the country’s discretionary funds, NASA will face meaningful scrutiny. Such transition teams will delve far beyond the rhetoric of hashtags, like #JourneyToMars, and get under the hood of the space agency’s programs and whether funding exists to carry them out. Mark Albrecht served as President George H.W. Bush’s principal advisor on space, and he has been enmeshed in such policy discussions for the better part of three decades. He’s lived through several presidential transitions, and he can say exactly what will happen to NASA and its human spaceflight programs when either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump become the next president of the United States. “The first thing a new administration will do is an independent review of the status of programs, and what they find will surprise no one,” Albrecht said. Inevitably, he said, an independent commission will discover an ever-growing bureaucracy and underfunded, over-ambitious programs. Whether the new president acts on these findings is another question entirely. The modern NASA Before digging into positions held by Clinton and Trump, let’s get some perspective on how NASA has changed since the days of Apollo. During a US human spaceflight panel discussion titled “Lost in Space,” held at Rice University in October, Albrecht described how NASA has grown from a lean agency focused on beating the Soviets to the Moon into one that now serves many masters. “NASA takes on more and more activities, everything from more Earth science to exploration activities to high-speed computing,” Albrecht said. “I’m sure there’s stem cell research being done somewhere at some NASA center. Over time, those pieces begin to grow constituencies, and, like anything else, they get a little more money every year. That cycle goes on and on.” NASA How did our space policy get to where it is today? We look at the key players during the administration of President Barack Obama. NASA How did our space policy get to where it is today? We look at the key players during the administration of President Barack Obama. NASA Obama chose four-time astronaut Charles Bolden as NASA's administrator. Bolden has embraced the Journey to Mars but has not said how much it will cost or how NASA will pay for it. NASA NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, speaking to shuttle commander Chris Ferguson, sought to make sweeping changes to NASA in 2010 by turning over rocket building entirely to private companies and allowing the space agency to focus on innovating spaceflight technology. She left NASA in 2013. NASA Florida Sen. Bill Nelson wanted no part of Garver's changes. He spearheaded a "compromise" that allowed NASA to continue building large rockets. The Senate wrote the specs for the Space Launch System, leading some to dub it the "Senate Launch System." NASA Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was the co-leader of the compromise with Nelson. She felt NASA would lose essential capabilities without an SLS-like program. She also tried without success to keep the space shuttle flying beyond 2011. NASA Alabama Senator Richard Shelby has emerged as the chief supporter of the SLS rocket in the Senate. The rocket is being designed and tested in his home state. Each year since 2011, as a lead Senate appropriator, Shelby has added more money to NASA's budget for the rocket than NASA has said it needed. NASA Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski has worked to make sure that other areas of NASA's budget, including the costly and oft-delayed James Webb Space Telescope, have received ample funding. NASA Elon Musk, of SpaceX, has benefited from NASA contracts to develop commercial cargo and crew services. His company could almost certainly develop a lower-cost large rocket than the SLS, but the Senate wanted no part of that. NASA Mike Griffin, NASA's administrator under George W. Bush, wanted to remain in that position for Obama. But the president rejected Griffin's Constellation plan—and Griffin himself. If a Republican wins the 2016 election, Griffin could return to NASA or elsewhere to shape policy. NASA John Holdren, President Obama's science adviser and director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, has favored Earth science over human spaceflight. NASA Bill Gerstenmaier, who has overseen NASA's human spaceflight programs since 2005, has tried to make the best of the Orion capsule, the SLS rocket, President Obama's grand goal of Mars, and limited funding. The bureaucracy has infected large projects like NASA’s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, Albrecht said. When these big projects start out, they have “optimistic” estimates for cost, schedule, and technical challenges. Those estimates eventually catch up with the programs. And while NASA’s top line budget might increase to account for these problems, much of those increases are consumed by new constituencies that have cropped up in recent decades. Accordingly, when the National Academies or an independent panel review these big exploration programs in 2017 or 2018, they will find them to be underfunded, behind schedule, and, given budget projections, a long way from delivering significant accomplishments. Yes, it's possible that the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft will fly together in late 2018, but these vehicles are unlikely to carry humans into space until 2023, and human landings on Mars remain more than two decades away. Will the new president care? Space hasn’t been a meaningful issue in the 2016 presidential election to date, and it’s unlikely to become one. This is part of the problem with NASA overall—it simply has lost its relevance to the nation’s strategic interests. In the 1960s, NASA served as a champion of US preeminence during the Cold War. In the 1980s and 1990s, the space shuttle launched national security satellites. Now? The agency has a much reduced role. Certainly, NASA represents a potent projection of soft power, and it has utility in easing geopolitical tensions thanks to the healthy US-Russian partnership to sustain the International Space Station. But when the president confronts the major issues of the day, such as border security, terrorism, the economy and more, NASA is not essential to resolving any of these. James Muncy, a Republican-leaning space policy expert based in Washington, DC, said NASA and civil space efforts won’t rank high enough to be addressed during the early days of either a Clinton or Trump presidency. The agency will probably drift awhile, he said, along its present course. “Neither President Clinton nor President Trump is going to make any major changes in US civil space policy for the first couple years of their term,” Muncy bluntly declared. “So it would be nice if everyone just chilled out. Congress can write another ‘don’t terminate any contracts’ provision into the omnibus if they want, but it’s a waste of words. The next president may trim NASA’s budget, but they will not change direction because that would require thinking and caring about NASA. Hint: they don’t.” The wild card Probably the biggest change in the aerospace industry since President Obama took office in 2009 is the emergence of SpaceX, which has provided substantially lower-cost launch services to NASA, the private sector, and the US military. Now SpaceX, along with other companies such as Blue Origin, are continuing to develop new, larger rockets, which on paper promise to significantly undercut the price of NASA’s SLS rocket. During his remarks at Rice University, Albrecht addressed this issue as something a new administration and Congress will have to grapple with. “For a few years now, we’ve been watching the private sector leaping and bounding ahead,” Albrecht said. This may cause a “confidence problem” for NASA; decision-makers may start to ask whether NASA should be building large launch systems when the private sector can do it at a lower cost. Some may begin to wonder why NASA isn’t facilitating the private companies instead of trying to compete with them, he said. For now, NASA’s response to such questions has been that it has a special competence, along with its traditional aerospace contractors such as Boeing, to design and build large rockets. Congress has bought into that. This viewpoint will remain defensible for a few years more, but it may be a very different conversation in 2020, when not only is SLS flying, but both SpaceX and Blue Origin have heavy lift options at a fraction of the cost of the government rocket. So what could change? With all this said, we can glean some insights into how each of the presidential administrations might eventually change NASA. The big questions with human spaceflight concern the fate of the large, costly SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, especially in light of the rise of commercial space, and how NASA should employ its big rockets to explore the solar system. In the case of SLS and Orion, Congress is explicit in its support of these large, multibillion dollar programs that provide a multitude of jobs across many states. Killing either of them outright would require a significant investment of political capital in convincing a skeptical Congress. (This might become marginally easier if Democrats take the Senate, as it would remove SLS champion and Alabama Senator Richard Shelby from his powerful subcommittee chairmanship, which has oversight of NASA’s budget). Were a president skeptical of these big vehicles, instead of making a full frontal attack, a potential policy may entail providing basic funding to keep SLS and Orion going while waiting to see if SpaceX, Blue Origin, or other private providers come through with much less costly private options by the end of the decade. The bigger question may well become how NASA will use the vehicles. President Obama set NASA on a course to have astronauts visit a near-Earth asteroid before sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. However, due to funding, the crewed asteroid mission has devolved into a robotic spacecraft that would return a small lump of rock to near the Moon. Neither Congress nor the scientific community have embraced this mission, and it will probably be modified or canceled. Substantial questions also remain about the viability of NASA’s Journey to Mars absent a significant infusion of funding to the space agency’s exploration budget.

Dedicating the new integrated terminal building of the airport here, Modi noted that India in the near future would probably become the third country in the world in terms of airport activity benchmarks and "if you think only 80 to 100 airports are enough, then we are trying to create hurdles in the country's growth". He said the country's development can take new dimensions if attention is given to tier-2 and tier-3 cities, which have the same potential, and referred to government's new regional connectivity scheme. Attacking the previous governments, he said, "Earlier airports were set up, planes would fly but the country did not have an aviation policy. "How to take the sector forward in next five or ten years and take care of its and passengers' needs, what should be done for common people, there was no vision in place earlier. It was just moving," he said. "After the new NDA government came to power, for the first time since independence it formulated a new aviation policy for the country," he said inaugurating the terminal building which is now the country's second green airport after Kochi. He said the new aviation policy will take care of the consumers' needs and the growth of the sector. Modi said that the aviation sector is growing at a very fast pace and more middle-class families aspire to travel by air. "It is estimated that within five years, the situation in India would be such that the airports in the country would have as much footfall in a year as America's total population. "You can well imagine how this sector is growing. India in the near future would probably become the third country in the world in terms of airport activity benchmarks. This will help increase employment opportunities and would spur economic activity," he said. Spread in an area of 17,500 sq mt, the new integrated terminal has been built at a cost of Rs 160 crore. It has been designed to handle 700 passengers, including international fliers, per hour with 18 check-in counters, which would help in a seamless boarding process. It took about seven years to complete the project as the then Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel had laid the foundation stone in 2009. The 8,100-meter-long runway of the Vadodra airport can handle small and narrow body aircraft such as Airbus 320 and Boeing 737s. Besides national carrier Air India, private airlines likes IndiGo and Jet aiways are operating from here. This airport will be zero discharge, waste to wealth, energy saving and environment friendly, the PM said. Speaking about the potential of tier-2 and tier-3 cities,he said the government brought "out a new regional connectivity scheme under which people can travel with airfares of only Rs 2,500 for up to 500 kms distance." Claiming that his government had taken a number of steps to promote the aviation sector, Modi said, "I am happy that after the formation of the new NDA government, two airports in the country have become a part of the green movement." He said when such iconic buildings come up, the common people get encouraged to use economically viable and environment-friendly technology. "Connectivity plays an important role in the world today, both physical and digital connectivity is required and if we need highways, we also need I-ways (Information ways). "Similarly, air traffic is also needed. Air services are required in a big way for growth of tourism in the country. Better air connectivity means more tourists and this means better economic growth. There are immense possibility for tourism growth in India. Keeping that in view, this government has decided to promote the aviation sector," he said. Earlier, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajpathi Raju said since the NDA government came to power, air passengers traffic has "grown by over 20 per cent".

(Reuters/Shamil Zhumatov) Share Written by Akshat Rathi Obsession Space Business October 22, 2016 This week the ExoMars team placed a satellite in orbit around the red planet but failed to land the accompanying spacecraft. Scientifically the mission was largely a success: the satellite will soon start sniffing the Martian atmosphere for signs of present or past life. But the lander’s failure is symbolic of the fortunes of Russia’s Roscosmos, which is an equal partner with the European Space Agency (ESA) on ExoMars. Russia is one of two nations (the other is China) currently capable of putting humans into space, and at that job it’s been spectacularly reliable. Without Russia’s Soyuz rockets, there would be no US astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). But on other fronts the once mighty Russian (previously Soviet) space program has floundered. Its last successful interplanetary mission was to Venus in 1984. With Mars, it’s had a string of almost unmitigated failures since its first attempted flyby in 1960. At its height, Soviet spending on space rivaled America’s (pdf, p. 5). But now Roscosmos’s budget for the coming decade is equal to NASA’s for a single year. The $7.5 billion Vostochny Cosmodrome—a new launch site intended to restore Roscosmos’s glory—has been hit with spiraling costs, delays, strikes, and even admissions of embezzlement. Russia has also had to delay an ambitious new moon program, which includes building a lunar complex and orbital station. Worse still, Roscomos’s lucrative contracts to send NASA astronauts to the ISS may not continue beyond 2017, when SpaceX or Boeing start human launches. So ExoMars matters a lot to Roscosmos. The mission’s next phase involves sending a rover to Mars in 2021. ESA is to build the rover while Roscosmos is to redesign the failed landing gear based on the data gathered this week. If that mission fails too, it’ll wound ESA’s pride, but it could ruin Russia’s. This was published as part of the weekend edition of the Quartz Daily Brief.

Fuller Photo courtesy of Sikorsky Sikorsky is slated to donate its X2 high-speed demonstrator to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in ceremonies Oct. 27, R&WI has learned. The aircraft is to go on public display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, after the private ceremonies hosted by the Lockheed Martin unit.  Sikorsky began work on the compound, coaxial-rotor helicopter a decade ago with internal research and development funds to demonstrate the design could fly at roughly twice the operational speed of a conventional helicopter. Hence the X2 designator. The X2 first flew on Aug. 27, 2009, with Sikorsky Chief Test Pilot Kevin Bredenbeck at the controls. Sikorsky achieved its main design goal a bit more than two years later, when Bredenbeck took the X2 to 250 kt in level flight on Sept. 15, 2010. The aircraft was retired in July 2011 after 23 flights as the company turned its attention to developing the high-speed S-97 military demonstrator based on X2 technology. Sikorsky’s X2 work contributed to the U.S. Army’s decision to pursue development of a family of high-speed military rotorcraft and the Pentagon’s follow-on Future Vertical Lift program. Sikorsky is teamed with Boeing on the SB>1 Defiant contender for that program; the Defiant also draws on X2 research.  X2 Technology was awarded the National Aeronautic Assn. (NAA) Robert J. Collier Trophy in 2010 on the award’s 100th birthday. It beat out other nominees, like Boeing, with its unmatched speed, its maneuverability and its utility. In addition to its rigid, counter-rotating main rotor blades, the X2 features an integrated auxiliary propulsion, active vibration control and fly-by-wire controls.

(Photo by Leonard Ortiz, Orange County Register/SCNG) By DEEPA BHARATH / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Historical background A victorious Soviet Union succeeded in forcing its political, social and economic system on much of Eastern Europe including Hungary soon after World War II. But the Hungarians never reconciled themselves to Soviet hegemony and rebelled against them and their Hungarian allies in 1956. Initially, the freedom fighters with their small arms and petrol bombs seemed to push the Soviet tanks to withdraw. But, on Nov. 4, 1956, a large Soviet force invaded Budapest and other regions of the country. The revolution was eventually crushed and brought to power Janos Kadar, who attempted to institute a milder form of communist rule. Communism fell in Hungary in 1989. Source: Orange County Hungarians The date was Oct. 23, 1956. It was close to 9 p.m. Tens of thousands of people – many of them college students – marched upon the Radio Budapest building to broadcast their demands to the communist government dominated by the Soviets. Topping the list was their demand for the Soviets to leave Hungary ... and take their tanks with them. Laguna Beach resident Elizabeth Varo Rozsnyai’s husband, Zoltan, was in that crowd, which was angered and roused to a frenzy by Hungarian Communist Party leader Erno Gero’s cold dismissal of their demands. “The situation escalated and that was when we heard the first machine gun firing ... rat-a-tat-tat,” Rozsnyai, now 89, recalled. “The Hungarian Revolution had begun.” Zoltan Rozsnyai, a young orchestra conductor at the time, made it home. Days later, after the revolution ended, he escaped with his wife and 3-year-old daughter to Vienna to escape capture and imprisonment. There, he formed the Philharmonia Hungaric, an orchestra consisting of Hungarian refugee musicians. The family moved to San Diego in 1967 when Rozsnyai became the music director of the San Diego Symphony. Like Rozsnyai, for many Hungarian families that settled in Orange County and around Southern California, the 60th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution being observed Sunday, brings back memories of the uprising and fleeing their country with little but the clothes on their backs. More than 200,000 Hungarians were forced to risk the dangerous crossing of barbed wire border fences and mines to flee to Austria and what was Yugoslavia. At least 3,000 people, hailed as martyrs by the Hungarians, were killed as they stood up to the Soviet Army. Following the revolution – which is believed to have weakened the position of the Soviets in Europe – thousands of Hungarians were arrested, with 13,000 imprisoned and hundreds executed. The age limit for the death penalty was reduced at the time to 16. For Hungarians, the sacrifices made for the sake of democracy during the revolution are among the most glorious chapters of their national history. The Orange County families that came to the U.S. as refugees are remembering the heroes who stood up for their homeland and fought for what they believed in, said Judith Kastely-Ruzicska, co-director of Orange County Hungarians. “When you talk about expat communities in Orange County, Hungarians are not even mentioned,” she said. “That’s because we look like natives, we learned the language and we assimilated.” But thousands of Hungarians live in the area and many of the older families, like Rozsnyai’s, came here as political asylum seekers soon after the 1956 revolt, Kastely-Ruzicska said. There is no data available for the exact number of Hungarians in Orange County, she said. Louis Boyer, 81, of San Clemente, lived through the 19 days of the revolution as an ambulance driver for a military hospital in Budapest. He drove doctors and nurses and picked up fighters and innocent civilians who had been shot and wounded. “I remember this one particular incident where families had lined up outside a bakery for bread,” he said, adding that food was scarce at the time. “That was when (the Soviets) fired at them. There were women in that line holding little children. That stuck with me for a long time.” Boyer also remembers getting shot at ... a lot. “Bullets whizzed past my shoulders and ears as I was driving,” he said. “I hated it. But I never fired a gun.” Boyer, a retired Boeing engineer, still recoils at the mention of guns. He would drive around mostly at night because there was less shooting after dark. He would be told to leave those who were dead on the street and pick up only those who were “still moving.” Boyer also remembers anguished parents coming to the hospital looking for their children among the wounded. “When you heard that gut-wrenching scream, you knew that a parent had found their child,” he said. “It was heartbreaking to watch.” He saw the bloodied faces and bodies of the wounded in his nightmares for a while. And then, with time, they faded away. Boyer was decorated for bravery during the revolution and for assisting the wounded. He fled a month after the revolt with a couple of his friends to Austria and moved to the U.S. shortly afterward. The Hungarian refugees from the time of the revolution “came here with a thankful heart,” said Tibor Farkas, 76, of Orange, a retired subsystems manager at Boeing, who started the website 56erhungariansinamerica.org to tell the stories of those who came to the U.S. after the revolt. Farkas said he even helped resettle Vietnamese refugees who escaped the communist regime in their homeland after the fall of Saigon. “I understood what they were going through,” he said. “They had been oppressed by communists just as we were.” Zsolt Bor, 67, of San Clemente, was just 7 during the revolution. “I remember collecting empty shells lying on the street and bringing them back home because they were so shiny,” he said. “My father was so angry. I was punished.” The revolution was short, “but its effect was big and was felt around Europe,” Farkas said. “The Soviet Union’s tyranny was not as strong as before and other countries in Europe understood the power of a people’s revolution.” This generation of Hungarians in Orange County seems to view the current refugee crisis differently. “We went through a long process to come to America,” Bor said, adding that they even had to prove that they were not Nazis. “It was a process that ensured that we would become productive citizens.” Also, there were few “cultural differences,” he said. “When you don’t assimilate, it’s not good,” Bor said. “It just creates more tension.” Contact the writer: 714-796-7909 or dbharath@ocregister.com Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Boeing to shift 1,600 Huntington Beach jobs to L.A.

About a third of S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple on Tuesday. Amazon.com and Google's parent Alphabet are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season. "If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards. In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday. Next week, "I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings," said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. "I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy." A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates. Correlation of S&P 500 vs. interest rates and EPS, last five years, in % Source: UBS, as of October 20, 2016. The average year-end S&P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market. "Next year's earnings look too high, and that might mean the market is a tad more expensive than it looks, but it's helpful that the third-quarter earnings [are beating so far]," said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at TIAA Global Asset Management, which has about $915 billion in assets under management. "We're still making our way out of this period where energy earnings look weak compared to where they were one year ago," Nick said. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates at its December meeting, but will watch data ahead of the central bank's meeting on Nov. 1 and 2. The Markit manufacturing and services PMI are scheduled for release next Monday and Wednesday, respectively. Three Fed speakers are set to speak Monday ahead of the blackout period heading into the Fed's meeting Nov. 1 and 2. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard speaks on the U.S. economy and monetary policy Monday morning, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans is set to speak on current economic conditions and monetary policy in the afternoon. Fed Governor Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later in the day on the future of Treasury market settlement. The first read on U.S. gross domestic product is due next Friday, and the consensus estimate from Reuters is 2.5 percent. The final read on second-quarter GDP showed an annual rate of 1.4 percent growth. A print between 1.5 percent and 3 percent is "probably a number consistent with the Fed passing in November but hiking in December," said John Canally, chief economic strategist at LPL Financial. Other data scheduled for release next week include the Markit manufacturing and services PMI, the employment cost index, consumer sentiment and pending home sales. Overseas, the preliminary estimate on third-quarter U.K. GDP is due for release Thursday, the first full-quarter GDP data since the surprise U.K. vote to leave the European Union. "Brexit negotiations [are] always on slow boil every week and next week is no different," Canally said. "A very weak number on the U.K.[GDP] may weaken Prime Minister May's hand temporarily." European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is scheduled to speak Tuesday in Berlin on "Stability, Equity and Monetary Policy."

Finance Search Wed, Nov 16, 2016, 11:36 AM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 4 hrs 24 mins Bombardier to cut 7,500 more jobsAFP – Fri, Oct 21, 2016 9:17 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Canada's Bombardier said it was cutting around 7,500 jobs by the end of 2018 Canada's plane and train maker Bombardier said Friday it was cutting 7,500 jobs, its second major layoff announcement this year following delays in deliveries of its C-series airplanes. The job cuts, to be completed by the end of 2018, are expected to mostly hit administrative posts, with two-thirds from the transport division, a Bombardier spokesman said. These layoffs come on the heels of a February announcement to eliminate 7,000 manufacturing jobs. The two rounds of job cuts account for about 20 percent of Montreal-based Bombardier's workforce. Bombardier, which has taken on debt to finance its ambitious plane-building program, said the latest downsizing will result in annual savings of about $300 million as part of a five-year plan to turn the firm around. "The actions announced today will ensure we have the right cost structure, workforce and organization to compete and win in the future," said chief executive Alain Bellemare in a statement. Bombardier has been trying to accelerate production of the C Series, as well as to develop the new Global 7000 business jet, scheduled to begin production in 2018. The company announced plans to hire as many as 3,750 employees to speed these initiatives, according to Canadian media reports. Bellemare said the new jobs would be added in low-cost countries and more-established higher cost operations. "It's the only way that we can protect the thousands of jobs in the industry and at Bombardier. It's a very competitive industry and it's important to take the necessary steps to remain competitive in this context," he was quoted as saying Bombardier had touted the C Series, its first completely new aircraft in the 100- to 150-seat category in more than 25 years, as a means to cut into the dominance of US aerospace giant Boeing and European rival Airbus. But the project has been stymied by delays, with Bombardier announcing in September that it cut its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the plane from 15 to seven due to engine delivery delays from Pratt & Whitney. Costs for the C Series program have risen to $5.4 billion, Bombardier has estimated. The government of Quebec came to the rescue of Bombardier last year, investing $1.0 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in its C Series plane program. Bombardier has also sought support from federal officials in Canada, but no deal has been reached. The Canadian government remains interested in supporting the company if certain conditions are met, such as keeping the headquarters and other key operations in Montreal and a large presence in Canada. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Trump links off to good start: TurnbullAAP Malcolm Turnbull says Australia is getting off to a good start with US president-elect Donald Trump's team.

Emblazoned with a special "10,000th Airbus" logo, the plane will be used to launch the airline's new Singapore to San Francisco direct route later this month. The long-haul route's flying time will vary between 14 hours and 35 minutes, and an epic 17 hours and 45 minutes, depending on direction and winds. That will be the airline's longest route until it receives a new variant of the A350-900, the A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range), which will allow it to resume direct flights from Singapore to New York. Once that occurs, Singapore Airlines will regain the title for the world's longest flight route. Emirates currently flies the world's longest route – Dubai to Auckland direct. The ULR version of the A350 will be able to fly for up to 19 hours non-stop. Singapore Airlines placed its first order with Airbus in 1979 and became the launch customer for the world's largest passenger aircraft, the A380 super jumbo, in 2005. The first route for that plane was from Singapore to Sydney. Despite initial success, demand for the A380 has waned in recent years as airlines move on to new aircraft made of lightweight materials that deliver savings on fuel, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the A350. The A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials. The first ever Airbus plane, the A300B2, was delivered to Air France in 1974. In the 1980s the company launched the hugely successful A320, its first single-aisle plane. Airbus is reportedly on track to deliver 650 aircraft this year but has a backlog of 6700 on order – a number it says it will take 10 years to deliver at current production rates.

The in-flight Wi-Fi market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 26.35% during 2015-2021. Asia-Pacific in-flight Wi-Fi market of the region is majorly boosted by the increasing number of air passengers. In the past 20 years, Asia Pacific region has witnessed an increase in the number of air passengers by over 6.5%. This trend of growth is anticipated to continue for the coming 10-12 years. Backed up by this trend, Asia Pacific is expected to account for 40.8% of the global air transport in comparison to that of 28% at present. In addition to that, rising penetration of smartphones and formulation of favorable guidelines by the aviation authorities from countries like India for the use of in-flight Wi-Fi services inside an aircraft would further bid to boost the airborne wireless connectivity market over the next few years. In August 2016. Aviation Ministry of India has given a green signal to launch in-flight wifi services in the country. Hence, a spur a expected by the launch of such services. The two major airline companies of the Asia-Pacific region i.e. Boeing and Airbus further anticipates that in order to satisfy the growing air passenger traffic, the demand for new aircrafts would soar from 12,520 to 15,010 aircrafts in the coming 20 years. This burgeoned increase in the total number of aircrafts would surely lead Asia-Pacific to achieve the fastest growth in the in-flight Wi-Fi market in the coming future. Key Topics Covered: 1.

Speaking at the event, Modi said that he was "happy" that the Kochi and Vadodara Airports have joined the green movement. He also spoke about the new aviation policy which he said looked at the growth of the aviation sector.

Many innovations have happened in the world; Rail is old, but we need to bring new technology to the Railways: PM Modi — ANI (@ANI_news) October 22, 2016 He is also scheduled to attend a programme to distribute artificial limbs and other implements to more than 8000 'Divyangs' (disabled persons) in the city. This is Modi's first visit to Vadodara after becoming PM in May 2014. In last Lok Sabha elections, Modi got elected from both Vadodara and Varanasi seats, but he retained latter. File photo of PM Narendra Modi. Reuters "After arriving in Vadodara tomorrow afternoon, the PM will first inaugurate the newly-built international terminal at the city airport and then he will attend Divyang camp at Navlakhi ground," an official of Gujarat Information Department said earlier. The state-of-the-art terminal, built at the cost of Rs 160 crore, is spread over 18,120 sq mt and can handle 700 passengers (domestic plus international) per hour. It will have 18 check-in counters. The airport is located in Harni area on the outskirts of Vadodara. After the function, Modi will head to Navlakhi ground, where artificial limbs, tri-cycles and other assistive devices will be distributed to over 8000 'Divyangs'. The event has been jointly organised by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Kanpur-based Artificial Limb Manufacturing Corporation of India (ALIMCO), and Vadodara district administration, stated a government release. This will be Modi's fourth visit in last three months to his home state, where Assembly elections are due next year. On his 66th birthday on 17 September, Modi had inaugurated various irrigation and drinking water projects in the tribal district of Dahod. He had attended a Divyang camp at Navsari in south Gujarat. In August, he had visited Gujarat twice — once to condole death of Pramukh Swami Maharaj at Botad district and then to inaugurate the ambitious Sauni Irrigation Scheme in Jamnagar district. Harni is only the second "green building" airport in country. Airport Authority of India (AAI) chairman Guruprasad Mohapatra told PTI in Vadodara on Saturday that new terminal will enhance the combined passenger handling capacity of airport by almost four-fold. It took more than seven years for completing the new international terminal building project, foundation stone for which was laid in February 2009 by then Civil Aviation Minister. "At present, flights to Mumbai, Delhi, Goa and Bengaluru are operated at this airport by Air India, Jet Airways, Jet Connect, Indigo and Etihad Airways," Airport Director Sono Marandi said, adding that international flights can be launched after receiving requisite proposals from carriers. "We cannot fly directly to far away countries like UK, US, Canada etc. owing to runway constraints. However, (operating) flights to closer foreign destinations like Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok etc. is possible," he said. Marandi said that length of the existing runway is only 8100 feet and it has not been extended despite the construction of new international terminal, due to unavailability of land. "It is not large enough to facilitate landing of big aircraft like Boeing 744 which are used for long-distance international flights. Currently, the airport can handle medium-range flier aircraft like Airbus-320 and Boeing-737 etc," he added. Project in-charge Narendra Kumar Shukla said that handling of passengers will become much easier now and that boarding will become smoother for flyers. "The new terminal is designed in such a flexible way that its use for domestic and international operations can be varied as per needs," he added.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE A plane flies over a Bombardier plant in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on January 21, 2014. (Reuters Photo) Airplane and train maker Bombardier will cut some 20 percent of its workforce around the world over the next two years as it tries to turn around its business. The Montreal-based company said Friday that the reductions are designed to save about US$300 million a year, part of a plan to restore it to profitability by 2020. Its plans to eliminate 7,500 positions through the end of 2018, are on top of 7,000 positions Bombardier already planned to eliminate by the end of 2017. About 2,000 positions will be cut across Canada, the aerospace giant said Friday. Two-thirds of the job losses throughout Montreal-based Bombardier will come from its transportation division, with the rest from its aerospace operations. The company said the job losses will be partially offset by more than 3,700 strategic hirings as Bombardier ramps up production of its CSeries commercial jet and new Global 7000 business aircraft, along with rail contracts. The manufacturer has been struggling because of heavy spending on new aircraft, a slowdown in business jet demand and production challenges for its railway products. "I know these aren't easy decisions in the short-term," CEO Alain Bellemare said. "But they are the right decisions to ensure the future of the company." In February, Bombardier announced plans to cut 7,000 positions by the end of next year as it struggled to sell its signature CSeries passenger jet in the face of competition from global rivals. Bellemare said the latest measure will enable Bombardier to continue investing in its operations and secure more rail and plane work. He said the new jobs will be created in countries where labor costs are cheaper but also within Bombardier's existing network of global operations. "It's the only way that we can protect the thousands of jobs in the industry and at Bombardier," he said. "It's a very competitive industry and it's important to take the necessary steps to remain competitive in this context." Bombardier said it expects to record between US$225 million and US$275 million in restructuring charges through the end of next year, starting in the fourth quarter. The announcement comes after Bombardier asked Canada's federal government for a US$1-billion investment nearly a year ago. Canada's Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said the question of federal assistance was not a matter of if, but how it would be given. He said Ottawa wants Bombardier to keep its head office and jobs connected to its research and development activities in Canada. Bombardier has been trying to accelerate production of the C Series, as well as to develop the new Global 7000 business jet, scheduled to begin production in 2018. The company announced plans to hire as many as 3,750 employees to speed these initiatives, according to Canadian media reports. Bellemare said the new jobs would be added in low-cost countries and more-established higher cost operations. "It's the only way that we can protect the thousands of jobs in the industry and at Bombardier. It's a very competitive industry and it's important to take the necessary steps to remain competitive in this context," he was quoted as saying. Bombardier had touted the C Series, its first completely new aircraft in the 100- to 150-seat category in more than 25 years, as a means to cut into the dominance of US aerospace giant Boeing and European rival Airbus. But the project has been stymied by delays, with Bombardier announcing in September that it cut its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the plane from 15 to seven due to engine delivery delays from Pratt & Whitney. Costs for the C Series program have risen to $5.4 billion, Bombardier has estimated. The government of Quebec came to the rescue of Bombardier last year, investing $1.0 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in its C Series plane program. On its website, Bombardier said it has 31,200 employees in aerospace and 39,400 in transportation globally.

The number of people flying to, from and within China will almost double to 927 million annually by 2025, from 487 million last year, according to forecasts from IATA made in an e-mailed statement, and reach 1.3 billion by 2035. In comparison, passengers in the U.S. will increase to 904 million by 2025, from 657 million last year, according to the predictions. Global passenger travel is predicted to surge, with most of that growth coming from the Asia-Pacific region as economies expand and more people can afford to fly. India is set to surpass the U.K. as the world’s third-largest aviation market by 2025, according to IATA, with 263 million passengers compared with 256 million, it said in an e-mail. “People want to fly,” Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and chief executive officer said in a report this week. “Runways, terminals, security and baggage systems, air traffic control, and a whole raft of other elements need to be expanded to be ready for the growing number of flyers.” Boeing Co., the world’s biggest planemaker, expects the Asia-Pacific region will need over 15,000 new planes and more than half a million new pilots and technicians over the next 20 years as economic growth boosts air travel.
