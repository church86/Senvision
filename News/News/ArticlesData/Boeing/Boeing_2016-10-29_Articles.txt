The official also anticipated that a number of the 111 aircrafts ordered to Airbus and 108 ones ordered to Boeing will be delivered to Iran by the end of the current Iranian calendar year (March 20, 2017). Following the implementation of the last year’s nuclear accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), between Iran and six world powers, Airbus and Boeing received permission from the U.S. government to sell aircraft to Iran. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on September 21, followed by Boeing’s announcement later in the day. Iran has announced its need for about 400 passenger planes in the next decade to modernize its ageing fleet. Iranian airlines are not interested in buying any more Russian planes. Their performance was unsatisfactory when flown in the country's aviation market during the sanctions period. Iran hopes to improve the relations with the world in the wake of the nuclear deal to renovate its fleet with western aircraft.

It aims to lift this figure to 50 percent by 2014. But it may also double its total workforce over time, suggesting local recruitment must go at a faster rate. Picture taken May 14, 2012.

Strata, a key strategic holding within Mubadala Development Corporation’s aerospace and defence portfolio – which includes Avanti turboprop aircraft maker Piaggio Aerospace, as well as the Emirates Defence Industries group of firms – has ambitions to establish itself as one of the world’s leading composite aerospace parts manufacturers. "We want to be one of the top key suppliers in the world," said the deputy chief executive Ismail Abdulla. "Our first six years were about building the reputation of the company by delivering quality products on time, but we haven’t reached cruising altitude yet," he added. Strata said yesterday that it made its first deliveries on parts for the Airbus A330neo, as well as a Saab subcontract for A350–1000 wing parts. In July at the Farnborough show, Strata won contracts with a combined value of US$1 billion to make inboard flaps for Airbus A350-900 wings, and the horizontal tail plane for the Airbus A320, which will run initially through 2032. The company also won a multiyear contract to make vertical fins for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner family of aircraft worth "hundreds of millions", said Mr Abdulla, who added that the Al Ain facility would be hiring an additional 350 people to deliver the new contracts, bringing total employment there to just above 1,000. The company started production in 2010, leveraging the UAE’s fast-growing airlines and their aircraft purchasing power, with product lines including wing and fin parts for the Airbus 330, 340 and 380, as well as Boeing’s 777 and 787, and some "tier one" original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Saab and Alenia Aermacchi. Revenue rose from Dh60 million in its first year to above Dh400m last year. For the first half of this year, revenue is at Dh192m, up from Dh144m for last year’s first six months, and Strata executives say the company expects to break even next year on revenue of more than Dh500m, with a revenue target of Dh1bn by 2020. "We have studied the market and what we have noted talking to some of the big OEMs is that they want a handful of key suppliers around them," said Mr Abdulla. "We will be doing that internally here and also by looking at opportunities to expand in other countries around the world." Last year, the chief executive Badr Al Olama said Strata was studying expansion in North Africa as its first step internationally. "North Africa seems to be a viable market. It opens up a gateway into southern Europe and into more the western side of the world," he said at the time, and Strata confirmed yesterday that option is still being studied. Strata expects that the downturns on some product lines will be balanced by growing volume in others, said Mr Abdulla, addressing comments last week by the Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg warning that 777 production could be cut from about 100 a year to as low as 42 a year from next year. "We don’t see any major contracts running off," Mr Abdullah said. "When a programme runs down there is usually a programme that ramps up – the 777 goes down, the 777X go up. There has been a drop communicated on the A380, but we believe there will be a compensation with other contracts", such as the A350. Strata forms the keystone of Mubadala’s Nibras Al Ain Aerospace Park, a five-square-kilometre aerospace free zone which Mr Abdulla says has ambitions to become an industry cluster along the lines of Seattle and Toulouse, homes to Boeing and Airbus, respectively. Strata was the first greenfield project at Nibras, which Mr Abdulla ran until he took his current role earlier this year. Nibras has leased 60 per cent of its space, with tenants including Etihad Flight College, Horizon International Training Academy, The Advanced Military Maintenance Repair and Overhaul Centre and Abu Dhabi Autonomous Systems Investments Company. "Strata itself has already taken around 1.7 million square feet to cater for the growth that we are planning for," says Mr Abdulla. amcauley@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Honda plans to increase business jet production Strata starts delivering on new Airbus product lines Abu Dhabi takes flight in next phase for aviation Abu Dhabi’s Strata extends Boeing deal with parts for 787 More Aviation Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Delivery of 61 Boeing jetliners on hold as United looks to save $1.6bn UK’s easyJet reports first annual profit slide in six years Malaysia Airlines pins hopes on adding flights to China MOST VIEWED Business | All Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Majid Al Futtaim will expand Sharjah City Centre Stronger dollar could hold back Dubai property recovery Leonardo DiCaprio and synthetics irritate the diamond industry Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Rolls-Royce chief: ‘Our targets are always based on profitability, not volumes’ Review: Moto Z is a brilliant modular device Review: Joyable app helps ease social anxiety at work A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first More Most Viewed Album review: Hardwired...

The courier has ordered 14 more of the famous jumbo jet. Courtesy UPS Multi-plane Boeing 747 order from UPS may be jumbo jet’s last hurrah October 30, 2016 Updated: October 30, 2016 01:45 PM Related Pilots at biggest US budget carrier fly off with 29 per cent pay rise Emirates’ Boeing 777X passengers will find flying an entertaining experience Boeing 777X set to become world’s first flying iPad Boeing’s 747 jumbo jet creator, Joe Sutter dies Boeing freezes jet prices for first time in seven years as sales slow Topics: Boeing The Boeing 747 revolutionised air travel and ushered in the era of jumbo jets back in the 1970s, but these days it is often used to carry packages, not people, and its future is uncertain. The hump-backed behemoth has got a boost, however, after UPS announced it has ordered 14 Boeing 747-8 cargo freighters and took an option for another 14. It is the biggest order for the jumbo jet since Lufthansa ordered 20 back in December 2006. Neither Boeing nor UPS disclosed terms of the sale. At list price, 14 747 freighters would cost US$5.3 billion, although big customers routinely get discounts on planes. Boeing has delivered more than 1,500 747s since the first one went to Pan Am in 1970 but the number of 747s rolling off the assembly line has slowed to a crawl in recent years. It is not just the 747; orders for a much newer four-engine superjumbo plane, the Airbus A380, have also stalled. As the remaining 747s get older, airlines are retiring more of them. United Airlines recently announced that it would mothball its fleet of 747s by the end of 2018. Before the UPS announcement, Boeing had received only four new orders for the 747 this year – and one cancellation. The 747 accounted for less than 2 per cent of commercial planes that Boeing has delivered since the start of 2015. As of September 30, there were only 15 unfilled 747 orders out of a total Boeing backlog of 5,600 planes, mostly 737s. For UPS, the planes will help it to haul a growing load of air freight around the globe. UPS expects to take delivery of the first two in late 2017 and put them on international routes. Painting the firm’s new order of world’s longest aircraft will be no mean feat. Aside from the cost, which can be anything from US$100,000 to $200,000 per plane, the weight of the dried paint alone on a 747 is a about 250kg, according to Boeing’s airframe design division. UPS said it will shift older 747 models to shorter US routes, where their poor fuel mileage will be less of a factor. Boeing said the 747-8 has 16 per cent more room for cargo than the 747-400 freighter and creates 30 per cent less noise around airports. It is the fourth generation of the venerable plane. Even if the 747 is nearing the end of the line, it has had a remarkable history. Its distinctive shape made the double-decker among the most famous planes ever. It has carried millions of passengers around the globe and its size and financial benefits helped to make international air travel possible for the masses. * AP business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Pilots at biggest US budget carrier fly off with 29 per cent pay rise Emirates’ Boeing 777X passengers will find flying an entertaining experience Boeing 777X set to become world’s first flying iPad Boeing’s 747 jumbo jet creator, Joe Sutter dies More Aviation Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Delivery of 61 Boeing jetliners on hold as United looks to save $1.6bn UK’s easyJet reports first annual profit slide in six years Malaysia Airlines pins hopes on adding flights to China MOST VIEWED Business | All Next-gen A380s and Boeing 777s on the way as Emirates boosts superjumbo-only fleet Majid Al Futtaim will expand Sharjah City Centre Stronger dollar could hold back Dubai property recovery Leonardo DiCaprio and synthetics irritate the diamond industry Etihad Airways on the lookout for new pilots in Europe Rolls-Royce chief: ‘Our targets are always based on profitability, not volumes’ Review: Moto Z is a brilliant modular device Review: Joyable app helps ease social anxiety at work A380s and Boeing 777s make up Emirates’ entire fleet as it scores a world’s first More Most Viewed Album review: Hardwired...

The deal will make SpiceJet the first Indian domestic private carrier to have Airbus and Boeing in its fleet. “Right now, we are very focussed on procuring new planes,” SpiceJet CEO Ajay Singh said. Airbus and US-based aircarft aircraft manufacturer Boeing are locked in a battle to supply narrow-bodied planes to SpiceJet and are wooing and offering the airline with aggressive offers. A government official said SpiceJet had ordered 40 fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2014, which it would be delivered in 2018. “Ordering 100 fuel efficient Boeing 737 MAXs could take time, and it could hamper SpiceJet’s growth plan in India,” said a senior industry official. While Airbus dominates the domestic short-haul market, which uses narrow-bodied planes, Boeing has dominated the long-haul market in India with wide-bodied passenger aircraft. Airbus commands a two-third market share of aircraft in India. There are 460 narrow- and wide-bodied passenger planes with Indian carriers, and 194 more have been ordered since 2014 (see box). SpiceJet has a fleet size of 40 aircraft, of which 22 are narrow-bodied Boeing 737-800 and of Bombardiers and turboprops, besides 40 Boeing 737-MAX on order. Indian carriers have largely remained with either Airbus or Boeing for narrow- and wide-bodied aircraft, with state-owned Air India as an only exception to have aircraft manufactured by both manufacturers. Airlines benefit by having a fleet of single manufacturer as they have to engage fewer pilots and engineers. Boeing, Airbus or any other aircraft require a different team, which increases an airline’s operational costs. Some of the newer Indian airlines—such as IndiGo—have chosen to buy a single type from a single manufacturer. IndiGo, with a fleet size of 119 aircraft, has all narrow-bodied Airbus, while Jet Airways has largely Boeing, with a few Airbus as well. GoAir has only Airbus planes. In 2015, IndiGo ordered 250 Airbus A320neo planes, Jet Airways ordered 75 Boeing 737 Max planes and Vistara ordered seven Airbus 320neo planes. In 2014, SpiceJet ordered 40 Boeing 737 MAX planes and Air Costa ordered 50 Embraer E-2 jets. In July 2016, GoAir ordered 72 Airbus A320neo. IndiGo, Jet Airways, Air India, Air Asia and other airlines also have deliveries lined up for orders placed between 2011 and 2013, which are adding to their fleet in phases and will be delivered by 2020.

"The air cargo market has faced several years of below trend growth," said Randy Tinseth, vice president, Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "As trade continues to recover, we're confident the air cargo market will see growth over the long-term." Boeing projects the e-commerce market will be one of the primary factors driving that growth, reaching $3.6 trillion by 2020. Additionally, China's express market keeps expanding, with a five-year growth rate of 55% in volume and 39% in revenue. The forecast shows markets linked to Asia will lead all other international markets in average air cargo growth.  Dedicated freighters still carry more than half of air cargo traffic and remain the leading cargo capacity provider. Boeing forecasts that the world air cargo fleet will expand by 70% by 2035, adding a total of 2,370 freighters to the market.  The forecast sees demand for 550 large production freighters, 380 production medium widebody freighters, 400 widebody conversion freighters and 1,040 medium conversion freighters. Boeing products make up more than 90% of the world's dedicated freighter capacity. Boeing offers integrated solution for freighter operators, whether they carry express cargo or industrial goods. "Air cargo is critical to global trade, and Boeing offers the most comprehensive product lineup in the industry," Tinseth added.

No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which crippled a Boeing 767 with 161 passengers and nine crew members aboard as it was departing for Miami and briefly closed all O'Hare's runways. The failure was so intense that a disk from the engine hit a building roof, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jet engines are designed to keep parts within the outer cover as escaped shrapnel can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such "uncontained" failures therefore are extremely rare and National Transportation Safety Board officials were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine, with maintenance or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. Smoke Billows From Burning Plane on Chicago Airport Runway Play! 00:49 The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6 introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. The NTSB said it planned to release more details at a news conference later on Saturday at O'Hare. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of "industry-leading levels of reliability," Kennedy said. Passenger Films His Evacuation From Burning Plane at Chicago Airport Play! 01:21 The O'Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The "rupture of the high pressure turbine stage 1 disk" was traced partly to inadequate GE design of the disk and poor FAA oversight of inspections, according to the summary. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.  Follow Telegraph News READ MORE ABOUT: aviation Chicago Boeing Passengers Show more News latest 16 Nov 2016, 12:01am Street protests could halt hospital closures - NHS boss 16 Nov 2016, 12:01am Kids better off at nursery rather than staying at home with mum, say researchers 16 Nov 2016, 12:01am Britain still giving hundreds of millions of pounds in aid to China and India, official report finds 02:02 16 Nov 2016, 12:01am Father Christmas gets dementia in Alzheimer’s Research UK advert so sad it has to be shown after 9pm 16 Nov 2016, 12:01am RSPCA should be stripped of powers to prosecute cases of animal cruelty, MPs say 16 Nov 2016, 12:01am Children are now spending more time online than watching television 15 Nov 2016, 11:48pm When is Donald Trump's inauguration, what will happen on the day and when will Barack Obama move out of the White House? 15 Nov 2016, 11:23pm 'Post-truth' named Oxford Dictionaries UK and US Word of the Year in the wake of Donald Trump's victory and Brexit 01:00 15 Nov 2016, 11:00pm Cockatoo filmed making tools from twigs, wood and cardboard to reach nut 15 Nov 2016, 10:55pm Richard Branson backs plan unveiled in Colorado to launch 3.5hr trans-Atlantic flight 15 Nov 2016, 10:01pm Schoolboy who ran away because he was 'bored' of life is found  15 Nov 2016, 10:00pm Angela Merkel suggests she is willing to compromise on free movement in the wake of Brexit 15 Nov 2016, 10:00pm Revealed: Iraqis paid to travel abroad by UK taxpayer to give evidence against British war veterans  15 Nov 2016, 10:00pm Nigel Farage hints he may seek to rejoin the Tories as sources suggested he will meet with Theresa May 15 Nov 2016, 10:00pm Cut “crazy” Stamp Duty to stop a “tax on mobility”, ex-Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson tells Philip Hammond 15 Nov 2016, 9:57pm Bashar al-Assad says Donald Trump a 'natural ally' for Syria alongside Russia and Iran 15 Nov 2016, 9:20pm SNP Social Security Minister denies ducking welfare powers 15 Nov 2016, 9:00pm Embarrassment for English National Opera as much-hyped Blackpool venue spurns them for rival show 00:36 15 Nov 2016, 8:33pm Swimmers complete seven-hour journey across shrinking Dead Sea 15 Nov 2016, 8:09pm Farmer, 80, admits beating two swans to death 15 Nov 2016, 7:55pm Police officer 'joked about raping a female colleague and groped her' If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2016

Disclosure of the "uncontained" failure," in which internal engine parts breach the protective housing designed to keep them safely enclosed, even in a breakdown, came a day after a mishap that authorities said neared the point of disaster but caused no serious injuries. Shrapnel escaping from the engine's outer cover can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such engine failures are extremely rare, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine itself, with its manufacture or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6, introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American Airlines Flight 383, a twin-engine Boeing 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down a runway for departure when the right-side engine failed, forcing the crew to abort takeoff, authorities said. Leaking jet fuel caught fire under the wing, as the crew evacuated passengers via emergency exit chutes from the left side of the plane, and fire crews arrived to begin pouring foam on the flames within minutes. One flight attendant and 19 passengers suffered minor injuries in their escape. NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday that while flames never breached the plane's cabin, some smoke did, though city fire officials have said no one suffered from smoke inhalation or burns. City fire department officials said on Friday the plane was 15 to 20 seconds from becoming airborne, fully loaded with 43,000 pounds of jet fuel. Ward said the aircraft stopped about 3,000 feet from the end of the runway. "That's a lot of runway to have left," she said. FAR-FLUNG ENGINE DEBRIS In a sign of the intensity of the engine breakdown, at least two pieces of a stage-2 high-pressure turbine disk were flung from the scene. One was found at a United Parcel Service warehouse nearly 3,000 feet (915 meters), or about half a mile, south of the accident site. Another was found three-tenths of a mile to the north on airport property, NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday. She said the escaped engine parts would be shipped to a lab for examination, and the crippled right engine would be sent to a GE facility to be dismantled and examined there for clues to what caused the failure. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s, and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of "industry-leading levels of reliability," Kennedy said. The O'Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.

No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which crippled a Boeing 767 with 161 passengers and nine crew members aboard as it was departing for Miami and briefly closed all O'Hare's runways. The failure was so intense that a disk from the engine hit a building roof, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jet engines are designed to keep parts within the outer cover as escaped shrapnel can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such "uncontained" failures therefore are extremely rare and National Transportation Safety Board officials were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine, with maintenance or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6 introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. The NTSB said it planned to release more details at a news conference later on Saturday at O'Hare. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of "industry-leading levels of reliability," Kennedy said.

Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The "rupture of the high pressure turbine stage 1 disk" was traced partly to inadequate GE design of the disk and poor FAA oversight of inspections, according to the summary. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.

The Seattle Times reports the patent details a passenger plane that takes off and lands vertically like a helicopter via tilting rotors. The rotors—horizontal for takeoff and landing—rotate to become propellers during flight. Boeing was one of two developers behind the military's similar V-22 Osprey, which went into service in 2007. However, the Osprey can only carry up to 24 soldiers. And a prototype for a commercial plane that takes off and lands vertically from Bell—the other developer of the Osprey—can only carry nine passengers, according to Business Insider. Boeing's patent calls for a plane that carries 100 passengers. There are other major differences between the Osprey and the plane shown in Boeing's patent. Boeing's plane would have four engines housed in its wings instead of two engines housed in the tilt-rotors themselves. This means less structural reinforcement is necessary. The wings are also positioned lower than the Osprey's, closer to a traditional commercial plane's, in order to make maintenance and fueling easier. A passenger plane that takes off and lands like a helicopter could allow for more regional commercial flights to leave from small airfields, New Atlas reports. But it's unclear if Boeing actually plans to build the new plane. "Boeing files tons of patents, so this might not even come to fruition," a Boeing spokesperson tells Business Insider. "I'm not saying it won't." (The design could have saved Mike Pence a scare last week.)

Boeing will need to reduce its 777 production plans again unless it starts to see a steady stream of orders. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 29, 2016 at 2:25PM With the troubled 787 Dreamliner program finally starting to turn a profit, Boeing's (NYSE:BA) most pressing challenge now is filling its open delivery slots for the current-generation 777 over the next few years. In the past two years, order activity for the 777 has slowed dramatically. Boeing's management has admitted that it will be hard for the company to meet its order goals for the 777. However, Boeing isn't conceding yet. Let's take a look at whether it has a realistic chance of getting the orders it needs to avoid another deep production cut. Order activity grinds to a halt Since the beginning of 2015, a combination of low oil prices, currency volatility, and subpar global growth has taken a big bite out of the wide-body market. For example, Boeing only won 38 firm orders for the current-generation 777 in 2015, compared to a goal of 40 to 60. Boeing hasn't received enough 777 orders recently. Image source: Boeing. As a result, Boeing admitted last year that it might have to reduce 777 production to seven per month from the current rate of 8.3 per month. In early 2016, it confirmed that it would cut production to that level at the beginning of 2017. Moreover, Boeing plans to deliver just 5.5 units per month in 2018 and 2019, as it will start building some 777Xs on the same production line by then. Yet as 2016 progressed, analysts started to doubt that even this reduced target was achievable. As of the end of September, Boeing had just six new net orders for the 777 this year. Last week, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg acknowledged that Boeing may have to reduce deliveries to as little as 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019. Based on Muilenberg's comments, there are about 40 open slots for the current-generation 777 in the 2017-2018 period, assuming no further production cuts. In addition, Boeing would probably need another 100 orders for 2019 and beyond. A year-end order flurry? Still, there have been some hopeful signs. Earlier this month, Qatar Airways ordered 10 more 777-300ERs. Just this week, SWISS ordered a single additional 777-300ER. That brings the year-to-date order total to 17. More orders could potentially be finalized soon. Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) announced last month that it plans to add 15 more 777-300ERs to its fleet. Boeing hasn't reported an order from Saudia yet, so it's not clear whether these are all new orders. Iran Air also hopes to acquire 15 new 777-300ERs. It reached a tentative agreement with Boeing earlier this year and the U.S. government has now approved the sale. However, lining up financing remains a major obstacle due to ongoing financial sanctions against Iran. There's also a lot of political opposition within the U.S. to doing business with Iran, so the deal could potentially be torpedoed at any moment. Time to replace those 747s! Aside from these already-rumored potential sales, Boeing could look to current operators of the 747-400 for new 777 orders. The in-service fleet of 747s has been shrinking rapidly. Rising maintenance costs and declining availability of spare parts could encourage airlines to accelerate their 747 retirements. Many airlines are retiring their 747-400s in a hurry. Image source: The Motley Fool. Many of the top operators of passenger 747s have already ordered enough planes to replace their 747 fleets. But some -- such as KLM, China Airlines, and Thai Airways -- might need to order a few more planes to replace the last of their 747s. There are also a lot of active 747-400 freighters, and many of their operators haven't planned for their replacement yet. The 747 offers some unique advantages over the 777 as a freighter, due to its nose-loading capabilities. Moreover, fuel efficiency is less of a concern for cargo airlines. Nevertheless, Boeing could potentially pick up a few 777F orders as 747 replacements, especially if fuel prices rise in the next year or two. Will Emirates order more 777s? Middle Eastern airline giant Emirates is by far the largest 777 customer in the world, accounting for more than 10% of all orders for the current-generation models. As of last year, it was looking at ordering up to 15 additional current-generation 777s, but it hasn't pulled the trigger yet. If Emirates sees incremental growth opportunities in the next year or two, it could order more 777s for delivery in 2018 or 2019. It could even replace some of its older 777s just to keep its fleet age young. This year, it is retiring nine 777s. Emirates may be interested in buying even more 777s. Image source: The Motley Fool. A fleet refresh could be aided by the growing market for secondhand 777-300ERs. For example, British Airways is interested in acquiring some used 777-300ERs to help replace its aging 747 fleet, rather than buying any more new 777s. Anybody else? FedEx could be another source of incremental orders for Boeing's 777F in the coming years. In fact, the company plans to buy at least 7 777Fs that are not in Boeing's firm order book yet. It could order even more if rising fuel prices or maintenance costs make it advisable to accelerate the retirement of its older three-engine MD-10s and MD-11s. Boeing could also nab some orders in emerging markets if air travel demand grows faster than expected, as the 777 is one of the few wide-body models available on relatively short notice. The bottom line is that aside from potential orders of about 15 planes each from Iran Air, Saudia, and Emirates, there aren't many prospects for big 777 orders out there. There are a large number of potential sale opportunities, but they are mostly for deals of a few airplanes each -- or even just one, as in the case of the recent SWISS order. Unless Boeing has an amazing success rate in closing these deals, it's not going to get enough orders to maintain the current production plan. That said, if it can seal the relatively large Iran Air and Saudia deals in the next few months, Boeing should at least be able to avoid the worst-case scenario of reducing deliveries all the way to 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019.

There's also a lot of political opposition within the U.S. to doing business with Iran, so the deal could potentially be torpedoed at any moment. Time to replace those 747s! Aside from these already-rumored potential sales, Boeing could look to current operators of the 747-400 for new 777 orders. The in-service fleet of 747s has been shrinking rapidly. Rising maintenance costs and declining availability of spare parts could encourage airlines to accelerate their 747 retirements. Many airlines are retiring their 747-400s in a hurry. Image source: The Motley Fool. Many of the top operators of passenger 747s have already ordered enough planes to replace their 747 fleets. But some -- such as KLM, China Airlines, and Thai Airways -- might need to order a few more planes to replace the last of their 747s. There are also a lot of active 747-400 freighters, and many of their operators haven't planned for their replacement yet. The 747 offers some unique advantages over the 777 as a freighter, due to its nose-loading capabilities. Moreover, fuel efficiency is less of a concern for cargo airlines. Nevertheless, Boeing could potentially pick up a few 777F orders as 747 replacements, especially if fuel prices rise in the next year or two. Will Emirates order more 777s? Middle Eastern airline giant Emirates is by far the largest 777 customer in the world, accounting for more than 10% of all orders for the current-generation models. As of last year, it was looking at ordering up to 15 additional current-generation 777s, but it hasn't pulled the trigger yet. If Emirates sees incremental growth opportunities in the next year or two, it could order more 777s for delivery in 2018 or 2019. It could even replace some of its older 777s just to keep its fleet age young. This year, it is retiring nine 777s. Emirates may be interested in buying even more 777s. Image source: The Motley Fool. A fleet refresh could be aided by the growing market for secondhand 777-300ERs. For example, British Airways is interested in acquiring some used 777-300ERs to help replace its aging 747 fleet, rather than buying any more new 777s. Anybody else? FedEx could be another source of incremental orders for Boeing's 777F in the coming years. In fact, the company plans to buy at least 7 777Fs that are not in Boeing's firm order book yet. It could order even more if rising fuel prices or maintenance costs make it advisable to accelerate the retirement of its older three-engine MD-10s and MD-11s. Boeing could also nab some orders in emerging markets if air travel demand grows faster than expected, as the 777 is one of the few wide-body models available on relatively short notice. The bottom line is that aside from potential orders of about 15 planes each from Iran Air, Saudia, and Emirates, there aren't many prospects for big 777 orders out there. There are a large number of potential sale opportunities, but they are mostly for deals of a few airplanes each -- or even just one, as in the case of the recent SWISS order. Unless Boeing has an amazing success rate in closing these deals, it's not going to get enough orders to maintain the current production plan. That said, if it can seal the relatively large Iran Air and Saudia deals in the next few months, Boeing should at least be able to avoid the worst-case scenario of reducing deliveries all the way to 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019.

Chief Pilot of KLM’s Boeing 747 team Paul van der Ven told RTL News in the Netherlands that the pilots were disappointed that they would no longer be landing the majestic four-engine aircraft at Princess Juliana International Airport. “It is an iconic approach, especially because of the inseparable view of the blue Caribbean sea and the aircraft landing just behind the beach. The Boeing 747 is slowly disappearing from our fleet, but the end of this landing hurts. We find it a great pity, also because of the historic ties that this aircraft has with the island,” Van der Ven told RTL. The last KLM Boeing 747-400 touched down in St. Maarten on Friday at 11:03am, ending an era of what has been termed by aircraft enthusiasts as one of the scariest and most exhilarating landings in the world. Since 1990, KLM has served beach goers hair-raising landings as the Boeing soared at low altitudes over Maho Beach and onto the runway. The landing was one of the main attractions mainly for tourists who crowded the beach to witness the landing and take-off. From now on, the route Amsterdam-St. Maarten will be served by Airbus A330-200, seating. 243 passengers, as oppose to the 408 passengers that fit into the Boeing 747. The reward for passengers travelling from St. Maarten-Amsterdam will be the considerable shorter flying time as this will be a direct flight instead of making a stop-over in Curaçao. The Curaçao route will still use a Boeing 747. Chief Pilot Van der Ven has performed the landing some 12 times in his seven years as 747 pilot. He explained that the approach was very special for pilots because they have to do a large part manually. The height of the aircraft is very important because the runway is short. “At other airports, you make the landing as smooth as possible for the applause and your own ego. But in St. Maarten you have to put the aircraft on the ground at once,” he stated in the RTL article. The pilots are so concentrated when they land that they don’t notice a lot of the crowd on the beach. “But you know that they are there. When we take off, we do see them. We wave at them. Those are precious memories.” The aircraft that will be used on the route Amsterdam-St. Maarten is also a nice plane, but it cannot be compared to the Boeing 747-400, said Van der Ven. Modern aircraft look more alike and they don’t have a second floor and the four engines of the 747. “She is the Queen of the Skies,” said the chief pilot who would not be carrying out the last flight to St. Maarten.

That ambition is slowly taking shape in a hangar in Shanghai. The state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd, locally known as COMAC, is building the 168-seat, single-aisle aircraft C919, betting the model would help the planemaker break into the big league. It’s banking on expertise gained from its smaller 90-seat jet, the ARJ21, which has won commercial orders worth at least US$2 billion (RM8.4 billion), mostly from local companies. Despite delays to the C919 programme — the first test flight has been postponed at least twice since 2014 — COMAC’s message to the world: Watch this space. The builder says it has already got commitments from 21 customers for 517 planes. At the Zhuhai Air Show this week, COMAC is set to showcase the aircraft with a mock-up and could announce more interest from prospective buyers. The passenger jet project is part of an ambitious plan by President Xi Jinping to transform China from a maker of sneakers, apparels and toys into one that can compete with the likes of Airbus and Boeing. Getting the C919 from the design board to the skies is crucial for Xi, who has identified aerospace among sectors that could help accelerate modernisation of the economy to resemble Japan and Germany. Good case “Domestic airplane manufacturing is a good case of the country’s ambition to secure a foothold at the very top of the global value chain,” said Liu Yuanchun, executive dean of the National Academy of Development and Strategy at Renmin University of China in Beijing. “There’s still some serious groundwork to do to eventually realise its ambition of mastering sophisticated design and manufacturing processes.” Aerospace ranks third after information technology and robotics on the priority list of Xi’s master plan “Made in China 2025” unveiled last year. For aviation manufacturing, Beijing has set its eyes on developing widebody passenger jets, heavy helicopters and various types of engines, in cooperation with global partners. The Zhuhai Air Show will also feature the newly formed Aero Engine Corp of China, which has plans to build engines for aircraft. COMAC kicked off research and development on the C919 in 2008 as soon as the establishment of the company. The mission was to realise the dream of building and flying a large commercial aircraft — hailed as the “flower” and “pearl” of modern manufacturing and embodiment of the nation’s technological standing. The aircraft maker counts as many as 16 global corporations as suppliers, including General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc, and has set up at least 16 joint ventures for avionics, flight control, power, fuel and landing gear, according to COMAC, which estimates the market potential for the plane at as much as 650 billion yuan (RM405 billion). The C919 is in good shape for the test flight and the developer sees no reason for another delay, a representative for COMAC said, without providing a date. Since the work has just started, it’s too early to talk about competing with the majors as they are in a different league, he said. Workers aboard an almost completed COMAC ARJ21-700 passenger jet at a final assembly and manufacturing centre in Shanghai. — AFP picARJ playbook Though the goal may be decades away, the planemaker may already have a playbook to count on. The Advanced Regional Jet ARJ21, which took 13 years to design, build and bring to market, has been flying since June. With a maximum range of about 1,380 miles and powered by GE engines, the jet competes with those of Bombardier Inc. and Embraer SA. China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed company, was the latest customer, agreeing to purchase 60 ARJ21s in a July deal worth about US$2.3 billion at list prices. China may eventually pull it off with the C919, but the aircraft may be initially confined only to the domestic market and to some interest from a few developing countries, said Shukor Yusof, a founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. Safety concerns may deter the world’s top airlines from opting for the jet, he said. “After a few upgrades, it should be able to show the world that it’s a serious aircraft,” Shukor said. “In order to achieve the comfort level for airlines, especially first-tier airlines, it could take more than two decades.” For the C919, once ready and safe, China could prove to be a captive market. The nation, set to surpass the U.S. to become the world’s largest aviation market by passengers by 2024, will have 1.3 billion travellers by 2035, according to the International Air Transport Association. The country may need 6,810 new aircraft valued at US$1.03 trillion in the next two decades to meet rising demand for air travel, Boeing estimated in September. “At some point, China cannot simply rely on imports from Boeing and Airbus for its aircraft demand,” Renmin University’s Liu said. “Making its own plane elevates China’s status and is a key component of propelling China’s economic growth in the future.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Chinese lessor orders ARJ-21 jets in US$2.3b deal Made in China passenger plane completed China signs €17b deal for 130 Airbus planes China buys 300 Boeing jets, signs pact for aircraft plant, says Xinhua China regional jet gets green light to conduct domestic flights Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

COMAC estimates the market potential for the plane at as much as 650 billion yuan ($96 billion). The C919 is in good shape for the test flight and the developer sees no reason for another delay, a representative for COMAC said, without providing a date. Since the work has just started, it’s too early to talk about competing with the majors as they are in a different league, he said. The test flight could happen later this year or early 2017, COMAC’s chief designer Wu Guanghui said separately in Zhuhai. ARJ Playbook Though the goal may be decades away, the planemaker may already have a playbook to count on. The Advanced Regional Jet ARJ21, which took 13 years to design, build and bring to market, has been flying since June. With a maximum range of about 1,380 miles and powered by GE engines, the jet competes with those of Bombardier Inc. and Embraer SA. China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong-listed company, was the latest customer, agreeing to purchase 60 ARJ21s in a July deal worth about $2.3 billion at list prices. China may eventually pull it off with the C919, but the aircraft may be initially confined only to the domestic market and to some interest from a few developing countries, said Shukor Yusof, a founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. Safety concerns may deter the world’s top airlines from opting for the jet, he said. “After a few upgrades, it should be able to show the world that it’s a serious aircraft,” Shukor said. “In order to achieve the comfort level for airlines, especially first-tier airlines, it could take more than two decades.” For the C919, once ready and safe, China could prove to be a captive market. The nation, set to surpass the U.S. to become the world’s largest aviation market by passengers by 2024, will have 1.3 billion travelers by 2035, according to the International Air Transport Association. The country may need 6,810 new aircraft valued at $1.03 trillion in the next two decades to meet rising demand for air travel, Boeing estimated in September. “At some point, China cannot simply rely on imports from Boeing and Airbus for its aircraft demand,” Renmin University’s Liu said. “Making its own plane elevates China’s status and is a key component of propelling China’s economic growth in the future.” — With assistance by Dong Lyu Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Disclosure of the "uncontained" failure," in which internal engine parts breach the protective housing designed to keep them safely enclosed, even in a breakdown, came a day after a mishap that authorities said neared the point of disaster but caused no serious injuries. Shrapnel escaping from the engine's outer cover can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. REUTERS Passengers were evacuated from the plane via emergency chute at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois. Such engine failures are extremely rare, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine itself, with its manufacture or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. Read more: * American Airlines jet bursts into flames at Chicago's O'Hare Airport * The moment American Airlines plane burst into flames caught on recording   JIM YOUNG Soot covers the fuselage of an American Airlines jet that blew a tire, sparking a fire and prompting the pilot to abort takeoff. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6, introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American Airlines Flight 383, a twin-engine Boeing 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down a runway for departure when the right-side engine failed, forcing the crew to abort takeoff, authorities said. Leaking jet fuel caught fire under the wing, as the crew evacuated passengers via emergency exit chutes from the left side of the plane, and fire crews arrived to begin pouring foam on the flames within minutes. JOSHUA ROBERTS Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation. One flight attendant and 19 passengers suffered minor injuries in their escape. Ad Feedback NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday that while flames never breached the plane's cabin, some smoke did, though city fire officials have said no one suffered from smoke inhalation or burns. City fire department officials said on Friday the plane was 15 to 20 seconds from becoming airborne, fully loaded with 43,000 pounds of jet fuel. Ward said the aircraft stopped about 3,000 feet from the end of the runway. "That's a lot of runway to have left," she said. Jim Young / Reuters An American Airlines was diverted to Denver International Airport on Sunday. FAR-FLUNG ENGINE DEBRIS In a sign of the intensity of the engine breakdown, at least two pieces of a stage-2 high-pressure turbine disk were flung from the scene. One was found at a United Parcel Service warehouse nearly 915 meters south of the accident site. Another was found three-tenths of a mile to the north on airport property, NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday. She said the escaped engine parts would be shipped to a lab for examination, and the crippled right engine would be sent to a GE facility to be dismantled and examined there for clues to what caused the failure. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s, and more than 4000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of "industry-leading levels of reliability," Kennedy said. The O'Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.  MECHANICAL ISSUE DIVERTS PLANE More than 100 people on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Toronto are safe after the plane was diverted to Denver International Airport on Sunday. Airport spokeswoman Daria Serna says the plane landed in Denver after the crew reported a mechanical issue. Airline spokesman Kent Powell says the Airbus 319 was diverted to Denver because of an odor onboard. He says maintenance crews are investigating the cause. Flight 569 landed safely and people were able to get off the plane at the terminal. Powell says the airline is working to get passengers to their destinations.  - Reuters Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Travel Troubles story: British Airways pilot suspended for alleged cockpit sex act Travel Homepage Comments travel headlines Blogger forgives eerie copycat photos No carry-on bags allowed Passengers sue over plane fire Pilot shuts down Trump fight NZ's 'shaky isles' still on tourist map 5 fun trips for Christmas fans 'Most of our ghosts are friendly' London's best new restaurants Only superjumbos, 777s for Emirates Plane damaged in Brisbane storm Tourists told NZ is safe Petra is rose-red and awe inspiring Italy and Spain in one trip How not to be an ugly American Passenger threat on Air NZ flight Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented Live: 7.5 New Zealand earthquake Earthquake: Slow process to freedom for stranded tourists in Kaikoura Second Wellington building cracks after magnitude 7.5 quake New storm heads for Wellington, snow warning for passes Earthquake: Damage to quake-hit Wellington building is getting 'incrementally worse' Weta 'IT geek' captures Wellington tsunami surge after earthquake rocks New Zealand Earthquake: International flotilla and aircraft drafted in to help with humanitarian relief in Kaikoura Earthquake: More cows stranded on an outcrop of land after three saved A warning to expect the worst Wellington: What you need to know - Wednesday Photos: Widespread damage after large earthquake hits NZ Earthquake: Slow process to freedom for stranded tourists in Kaikoura Earthquake: More cows stranded on an outcrop of land after three saved Earthquake: International flotilla and aircraft drafted in to help with humanitarian relief in Kaikoura New storm heads for Wellington, snow warning for passes Don Henley announces New Zealand tour with singer Jewel Earthquake: Damage to quake-hit Wellington building is getting 'incrementally worse' Divers and volunteers band together to save stranded shellfish and sea life Famous seal breeding ground destroyed by quake Wellington-Christchurch ferry link considered as SH1 quake repairs cause freight chaos special offers Ad Feedback National World Business Technology Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Stuff.co.nz About Us | Contact Us | View Mobile Site Subscribe Text | Follow us on Facebook and Twitter | Newspapers | Magazine subscriptions | RSS - Top Stories Services Stuff Fibre | Newspapers in Education | A-Z Directories | Online Advertising | Print Advertising | Careers Classifieds Death Notices | Celebrations | Trade Me | Jobs | Property | Motors | Accommodation | Personals | Newspaper Classifieds Newspapers Dominion Post | The Press | Waikato Times | Auckland Now | Sunday News | Sunday Star-Times   Marlborough Express | Manawatu Standard | Nelson Mail | Southland Times | Taranaki Daily News | Timaru Herald Other Sites Essential Mums | Cuisine | NZ House & Garden | NZ Fishing News | NZ Life & Leisure | NZ Gardener | Fairfax Archives Breaking news?

About Us Our People Advertising News Sports Shows WV Poll Outdoors Constellium says new tank contract shows its expertise Share Article By Brad McElhinny in News | October 30, 2016 at 8:30AM RAVENSWOOD, W.Va. — The Constellium aluminum plant in Jackson County already supplies metal for Boeing and Airbus. Workers proudly say more than 20 percent of the aluminum on any plane is made there. Now Constellium can add tanks to its list. The plant has been awarded a contract to produce KEIKOR 2139 plates for the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center — which, because the military loves acronyms, goes by TARDEC. TARDEC, located in Michigan, is the Army’s research and development center for advanced military automotive technology. The plates made by Constellium are to be used for armor applique on side armor and underbelly protection for ground combat vehicles. TARDEC refers to the end product as a Combat Vehicle Prototype, its next generation prototype fighting vehicle. Buddy Stemple “What they’re trying to do is develop the next generation of fighting vehicles,” said Buddy Stemple, chief executive officer of Constellium in Ravenswood. “They selected our material to do this development.” Constellium says landing the contract demonstrates the company’s leadership in innovative and high-quality aluminum products. The contract also demonstrates the expertise of Constellium in the defense market and confirms its growing position as a leading partner for aluminum armored vehicle solutions, company leaders said. “Thanks to a tireless focus on research and innovation, and a strong investment program over the past five years, we have developed the broadest global offering of specialized aluminium alloys for armor applications,” stated David Meacham, vice president of sales transportation, industry and defense at Constellium’s corporate headquarters. TARDEC praised Constellium for being both innovative and efficient. “What’s more, once we selected the material, we were able to work with Constellium closely to begin the alloy processing quickly, and they were able to cut the originally-quoted delivery time by more than half,” stated Erik Polsen, TARDEC’s chief engineer for Combat Vehicle Prototype survivability. No upgrades to the plant are necessary, and it’s unclear if any other type of expansion will occur. “Being a prototype vehicle, we cannot anticipate on production and jobs,” Constellium said in a statement released by Hill+Knowlton Strategies, its corporate advisor. Not all aluminum is alike, and what’s made for TARDEC will be specially suited to its needs. “It just has a special set of characteristics that you control with alloying elements and the manufacturing process,” Stemple said. “That allows us to meet the requirements of the military.” Constellium started the process of landing the contract a couple of years ago. Stemple said there’s a significant amount of testing required. “We’ll take it out and shoot it,” he said. “If it’s going to be for a tank, we might shoot it with a tank.” Stemple said Constellium’s workers are proud that their products are used in a practical way to help America’s military. “Our stuff is protecting our soldiers,” he said. “We take great pride in that.” Share this: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Brad McElhinny brad.mcelhinny@wvmetronews.com @BradMcElhinny Brad McElhinny is the statewide correspondent for MetroNews.

William Hartung on fear, greed, and the cash cow Congress won't touch. William D. HartungOct. 30, 2016 5:00 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Rodger Mallison/Fort Worth Star-Telegram via ZUMA Press This story first appeared on the TomDispatch website. Through good times and bad, regardless of what's actually happening in the world, one thing is certain: In the long run, the Pentagon budget won't go down. It's not that the budget has never been reduced. At pivotal moments, like the end of World War II as well as the war's end in Korea and Vietnam, there were indeed temporary downturns, as there was after the Cold War. More recently, the Budget Control Act of 2011 threw a monkey wrench into the Pentagon's plans for funding that would go ever onward and upward by putting a cap on the money Congress could pony up for it. The remarkable thing, though, is not that such moments have occurred, but how modest and short-lived they've proved to be. The current DoD budget is roughly $600 billion—more than it was at the peak of Ronald Reagan's massive arms buildup. Take the current budget. It's down slightly from its peak in 2011, when it reached the highest level since World War II, but this year's budget for the Pentagon and related agencies is nothing to sneeze at. It comes in at roughly $600 billion—more than the peak year of the massive arms buildup initiated by President Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s. To put this figure in perspective: Despite troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan dropping sharply over the past eight years, the Obama administration has still managed to spend more on the Pentagon than the Bush administration did during its two terms in office. What accounts for the Department of Defense's ability to keep a stranglehold on our tax dollars year after endless year? Pillar one supporting that edifice: ideology. As long as most Americans accept the notion that it is the God-given mission and right of the United States to go anywhere on the planet and do more or less anything it cares to do with its military, you won't see Pentagon spending brought under real control. Think of this as the military corollary to American exceptionalism—or just call it the doctrine of armed exceptionalism, if you will. The second pillar supporting lavish military budgets (and this will hardly surprise you): the entrenched power of the arms lobby and its allies in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. The strategic placement of arms production facilities and military bases in key states and congressional districts has created an economic dependency that has saved many a flawed weapons system from being unceremoniously dumped in the trash bin of history. Military subcontractors in dozens of states make it hard for Congress to cut or delay even failing programs. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has put together a handy map of how its troubled F-35 fighter jet has created 125,000 jobs in 46 states. The actual figures are, in fact, considerably lower, but the principle holds: Having subcontractors in dozens of states makes it harder for members of Congress to consider cutting or slowing down even a failed or failing program. Take as an example the M-1 tank, which the Army actually wanted to stop buying. Its plans were thwarted by the Ohio congressional delegation, which led a fight to add more M-1s to the budget in order to keep the General Dynamics production line in Lima, Ohio, up and running. In a similar fashion, prodded by the Missouri delegation, Congress added two different versions of Boeing's F-18 aircraft to the budget to keep funds flowing to that company's St. Louis area plant. The one-two punch of an environment in which the military can do no wrong while being outfitted for every global task imaginable, and what former Pentagon analyst Franklin "Chuck" Spinney has called "political engineering," has been a tough combination to beat.   The overwhelming consensus in favor of a "cover the globe" military strategy has been broken from time to time by popular resistance to the idea of using war as a central tool of foreign policy. In such periods, getting Americans behind a program of feeding the military machine massive sums of money has generally required a heavy dose of fear. For example, the last thing most Americans wanted after the devastation and hardship unleashed by World War II was to immediately put the country back on a war footing. The demobilization of millions of soldiers and a sharp cutback in weapons spending in the immediate postwar years rocked what President Dwight Eisenhower would later dub the "military-industrial complex." As Wayne Biddle has noted in his seminal book Barons of the Sky, the US aerospace industry produced an astonishing 300,000-plus military aircraft during World War II. Not surprisingly, major weapons producers struggled to survive in a peacetime environment in which government demand for their products threatened to be a tiny fraction of wartime levels. "We had one underlying element of comfort and reassurance during the war," Lockheed's president wrote. "We knew we'd get paid for anything we built." Lockheed President Robert Gross was terrified by the potential impact of war's end on his company's business, as were many of his industry cohorts. "As long as I live," he said, "I will never forget those short, appalling weeks" of the immediate postwar period. To be clear, Gross was appalled not by the war itself, but by the drop off in orders occasioned by its end. He elaborated in a 1947 letter to a friend: "We had one underlying element of comfort and reassurance during the war. We knew we'd get paid for anything we built. Now we are almost entirely on our own." The postwar doldrums in military spending that worried Gross so were reversed only after the American public had been fed a steady, fear-filled diet of anti-communism. NSC-68, a secret memorandum the National Security Council prepared for President Harry Truman in April 1950, created the template for a policy based on the global "containment" of communism and grounded in a plan to encircle the Soviet Union with US military forces, bases, and alliances. This would, of course, prove to be a strikingly expensive proposition. The concluding paragraphs of that memorandum underscored exactly that point, calling for a "sustained buildup of US political, economic, and military strength…[to] frustrate the Kremlin design of a world dominated by its will." Sen. Arthur Vandenberg put the thrust of this new Cold War policy in far simpler terms when he bluntly advised President Truman to "scare the hell out of the American people" to win support for a $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey. His suggestion would be put into effect not just for those two countries but to generate support for what President Eisenhower would later describe as "a permanent arms establishment of vast proportions." Industry leaders like Lockheed's Gross were poised to take advantage of such planning. In a draft of a 1950 speech, Gross noted, giddily enough, that "for the first time in recorded history, one country has assumed global responsibility." Meeting that responsibility would naturally mean using air transport to deliver "huge quantities of men, food, ammunition, tanks, gasoline, oil and thousands of other articles of war to a number of widely separated places on the face of the earth." Lockheed, of course, stood ready to heed the call. The next major challenge to armed exceptionalism, and to the further militarization of foreign policy, came after the disastrous Vietnam War, which drove many Americans to question the wisdom of a policy of permanent global interventionism. That phenomenon would be dubbed the "Vietnam syndrome" by interventionists, as if opposition to such a military policy were a disease, not a position. Still, that "syndrome" carried considerable, if ever decreasing, weight for a decade and a half, despite the Pentagon's Reagan-inspired arms buildup of the 1980s. With the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Washington decisively renewed its practice of responding to perceived foreign threats with large-scale military interventions. That quick victory over Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein's forces in Kuwait was celebrated by many hawks as the end of the Vietnam-induced malaise. Amid victory parades and celebrations, President George H.W. Bush would enthusiastically exclaim, "And, by God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all." However, perhaps the biggest threat since World War II to an "arms establishment of vast proportions" came with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, also in 1991. How to mainline fear into the American public and justify Cold War levels of spending when that other superpower, the Soviet Union, the primary threat of the previous nearly half-century, had just evaporated and there was next to nothing threatening on the horizon? General Colin Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, summed up the fears of that moment within the military and the arms complex when he said, "I'm running out of demons. I'm running out of villains. I'm down to Castro and Kim Il-sung." In reality, he underestimated the Pentagon's ability to conjure up new threats. Military spending did indeed drop at the end of the Cold War, but the Pentagon helped staunch the bleeding relatively quickly before a "peace dividend" could be delivered to the American people. Instead, it put a firm floor under the fall by announcing what came to be known as the "rogue state" doctrine. Resources formerly aimed at the Soviet Union would now be focused on "regional hegemons" like Iraq and North Korea. After the 9/11 attacks, the rogue-state doctrine morphed into the Global War on Terror (GWOT), which neoconservative pundits soon labeled "World War IV." The heightened fear campaign that went with it, in turn, helped sow the seeds for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which was promoted by visions of mushroom clouds rising over American cities and a drumbeat of Bush administration claims (all false) that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda. Some administration officials including Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld even suggested that Saddam was like Hitler, as if a modest-sized Middle Eastern state could somehow muster the resources to conquer the globe. The administration's propaganda campaign would be supplemented by the work of right-wing corporate-funded think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. And no one should be surprised to learn that the military-industrial complex and its money, its lobbyists, and its interests were in the middle of it all. Take Lockheed Martin Vice President Bruce Jackson. In 1997, he became a director of the Project for the New American Century and so part of a gaggle of hawks including future Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, his future boss Donald Rumsfeld, and future Vice President Dick Cheney. In those years, PNAC would advocate the overthrow of Saddam Hussein as part of its project to turn the planet into an American military protectorate. Many of its members would, of course, enter the Bush administration in crucial roles and become architects of the GWOT and the invasion of Iraq. A DoD spokesman recently admitted that more than half of the Pentagon's $59 billion "war budget" is being used to pay for nonwar costs. The Afghan and Iraq wars would prove an absolute bonanza for contractors as the Pentagon budget soared. Traditional weapons suppliers like Lockheed Martin and Boeing prospered, as did private contractors like Dick Cheney's former employer, Halliburton, which made billions providing logistical support to US troops in the field. Other major beneficiaries included firms like Blackwater and DynCorp, whose employees guarded US facilities and oil pipelines while training Afghan and Iraqi security forces. As much as $60 billion of the funds funneled to such contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan would be "wasted," but not from the point of view of companies for which waste could generate as much profit as a job well done. So Halliburton and its cohorts weren't complaining. On entering the Oval Office, President Barack Obama would ditch the term "global war on terror" in favor of "countering violent extremism"—and then essentially settle for a no-name global war. He would shift gears from a strategy focused on large numbers of "boots on the ground" to an emphasis on drone strikes, the use of Special Operations forces, and massive transfers of arms to allies like Saudi Arabia. In the context of an increasingly militarized foreign policy, one might call Obama's approach "politically sustainable warfare," since it involved fewer (American) casualties and lower costs than Bush-style warfare, which peaked in Iraq at more than 160,000 troops and a comparable number of private contractors. Recent terror attacks against Western targets—Brussels, Paris, Nice, San Bernardino, Orlando—have offered the national security state and the Obama administration the necessary fear factor that makes the case for higher Pentagon spending so palatable. This has been true despite the fact that more tanks, bombers, aircraft carriers, and nuclear weapons will be useless in preventing such attacks. The majority of what the Pentagon spends, of course, has nothing to do with fighting terrorism. But whatever it has or hasn't been called, the war against terror has proven to be a cash cow for the Pentagon and contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. The "war budget"—money meant for the Pentagon but not included in its regular budget—has been used to add on tens of billions of dollars more. It has proven to be an effective "slush fund" for weapons and activities that have nothing to do with immediate war fighting and has been the Pentagon's preferred method for evading the caps on its budget imposed by the Budget Control Act. A Pentagon spokesman admitted as much recently by acknowledging that more than half the $58.8 billion war budget is being used to pay for nonwar costs. The abuse of the war budget leaves ample room in the Pentagon's main budget for items like the overpriced, underperforming F-35 combat aircraft, a plane that, at a price tag of $1.4 trillion over its lifetime, is on track to be the most expensive weapons program ever undertaken. That slush fund is also enabling the Pentagon to spend billions of dollars in seed money as a down payment on the department's proposed $1 trillion plan to buy a new generation of nuclear-armed bombers, missiles, and submarines. Shutting it down could force the Pentagon to do what it likes least: live within an actual budget rather than continuing to push its top line ever upward. Trump's "plan," which mirrors a blueprint developed by the Heritage Foundation, could increase Pentagon spending by $900 billion over 10 years. Although rarely discussed because of the focus on Donald Trump's abominable behavior and racist rhetoric, both candidates for president are in favor of increasing Pentagon spending. Trump's "plan" (if one can call it that) hews closely to a blueprint developed by the Heritage Foundation that, if implemented, could increase Pentagon spending by a cumulative $900 billion over the next decade. The size of a possible buildup under Hillary Clinton is less clear, but she has also pledged to work toward lifting the caps on the Pentagon's regular budget. If that were done, and the war fund continued to be stuffed with non-war-related items, the Pentagon and its contractors will be sitting pretty. As long as fear, greed, and hubris are the dominant factors driving Pentagon spending (no matter who is in the White House), substantial and enduring budget reductions are essentially inconceivable. A wasteful practice may be eliminated here or an unnecessary weapons system cut there, but more fundamental change would require taking on the fear factor, the doctrine of armed exceptionalism, and the way the military-industrial complex is embedded in Washington. Only such a culture shift would allow for a clear-eyed assessment of what constitutes "defense" and how much money would be needed to provide it.  Unfortunately, the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned Americans about more than 50 years ago is alive and well, and gobbling up your tax dollars at an alarming rate.

Disclosure of the "uncontained" failure," in which internal engine parts breach the protective housing designed to keep them safely enclosed, even in a breakdown, came a day after a mishap that authorities said neared the point of disaster but caused no serious injuries. Shrapnel escaping from the engine's outer cover can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such engine failures are extremely rare, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine itself, with its manufacture or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6, introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American Airlines Flight 383, a twin-engine Boeing 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down a runway for departure when the right-side engine failed, forcing the crew to abort takeoff, authorities said. Leaking jet fuel caught fire under the wing, as the crew evacuated passengers via emergency exit chutes from the left side of the plane, and fire crews arrived to begin pouring foam on the flames within minutes. One flight attendant and 19 passengers suffered minor injuries in their escape. NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday that while flames never breached the plane's cabin, some smoke did, though city fire officials have said no one suffered from smoke inhalation or burns. City fire department officials said on Friday the plane was 15 to 20 seconds from becoming airborne, fully loaded with 43,000 pounds of jet fuel. Ward said the aircraft stopped about 3,000 feet from the end of the runway. "That's a lot of runway to have left," she said. FAR-FLUNG ENGINE DEBRIS In a sign of the intensity of the engine breakdown, at least two pieces of a stage-2 high-pressure turbine disk were flung from the scene. One was found at a United Parcel Service warehouse nearly 3,000 feet (915 meters), or about half a mile, south of the accident site. Another was found three-tenths of a mile to the north on airport property, NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday. She said the escaped engine parts would be shipped to a lab for examination, and the crippled right engine would be sent to a GE facility to be dismantled and examined there for clues to what caused the failure. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s, and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of "industry-leading levels of reliability," Kennedy said. The O'Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.   Share More > Vote MORE FROM International India 910 rape cases reported in Kerela six months Of them, 2332 were cases of molestation, 190 cases of eve teasing and ...

Captain Colin Glover, 51, was removed from flying duties after we alerted bosses to a series of sordid images seemingly shot in a Boeing 777 on a long-haul flight. Supplied 8 A BA pilot has been suspended over these pictures which appear to show a pilot masturbating in a cockpit Supplied 8 Glover has denied that the pictures of the pilot in the cockpit are of him They reveal a pervy airman in stockings taking lurid selfies of his aroused manhood. One image shows a leg sprawled over the dashboard while the plane appears to be on autopilot and with the co-pilot’s seat empty. In another, an airman spreads his stocking-clad legs over the joystick while revealing himself. Supplied 8 The pilot in question is sporting stockings in the pictures Supplied 8 Pornographic magazines were laid open across the craft’s controls A further sordid snap shows the man with his genitals exposed in a cabin’s toilet. Other images show a pornographic magazine spread on the controls and explicit playing cards scattered around the cockpit. Serial numbers on the control panel suggest the pictures were taken aboard at least two separate British Airways planes. Supplied 8 Colin Glover denies he is the pilot in the pictures The airline confirmed yesterday it was probing the images — and whether they were taken feet from passengers mid-flight. BA said: “We are taking these allegations extremely seriously.” PA 8 British Airways are now investigating the alleged sexting over fears they were taken mid-flight, which would be hugely dangerous Twice-married dad Glover — a BA Captain since 1990 — is thought to have denied to bosses the pictures are of him. But he is likely to be permanently grounded if they disagree. A senior airline source said investigators would examine whether the images could have been shot in a flight simulator. Getty Images 8 The cockput of a Boeing 777, used by BA, looks similar to the one in the pictures One of the serial numbers visible — GYMMB — is used on BA’s simulators. But it is also registered to a twin-engine Boeing. The other — GVIIL — is also one of the 777 fleet used by BA. Airline expert Chris Yates said yesterday: “This is very dangerous if the plane is in mid-flight. “If you are flying, you can fly into serious turbulence. related stories fighter near-miss Russian and US planes so close pilot 'could feel it's jet wash as it passed by' MIND OVER MATTER Paralysed people pilot thought-controlled robotic body from 6,000 miles away PANIC AT 30000FT BA pilots among 25 passengers and crew rushed to hospitals for smoke inhalation FLIGHT TO DEATH ‘Suicidal’ Jordanian student pilot ‘deliberately’ crashes plane into high street in fireball REAL-LIFE IRON MAN Incredible moment pilot wearing a JETPACK takes to the skies above London “This person is in danger of losing his aircraft and his job.” He said it was unlikely the pictures were taken on a simulator. Chris added: “You can tell by the lighting it is a plane. “There is also more going on in the control panels than on a ­simulator. It looks a live aircraft.” A former BA pilot also said there were not toilets like the one seen in one of the pictures on the airline’s simulators. 8 Flight expert Chris Yates said he believes the pictures are taken on a plane, not a simulator Glover, who has a grown-up son, regularly takes control of 777s on long-haul flights to destinations including America, the Caribbean and the Far East. He was born in Windsor, Berks, went to uni in Edinburgh and lives in Dublin. The Sun last week revealed a first class BA passenger was arrested amid claims he used a phone to film up a stewardess’ skirt. Last night, Glover’s lawyer denied the pictures were of him.   Dramatic footage shows a British Airways flight abort its landing in Vancouver at the very last second Topics British Airways Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments Comments Most Read in News WTF ghost in the back seat Girl captures image of ‘ghost child’ in back of her car in ‘warning to wear seat belt’ News VIGILANTE JUSTICE Shocking moment 'paedo' who raped and killed girl, 4, is dragged out of police cell and hanged News Exclusive 'He's a different person now' Boy, four, 'sexually assaulted in his school toilets by a gang of ten-year-old lads' News Pictured EU-ER, MISSUS!

REUTERS/Jim Young By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher An American Airlines jet engine that failed seconds before takeoff in a fiery runway accident at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport flung broken turbine parts as far as half a mile from the scene, a federal investigator said on Saturday. Disclosure of the "uncontained" failure," in which internal engine parts breach the protective housing designed to keep them safely enclosed, even in a breakdown, came a day after a mishap that authorities said neared the point of disaster but caused no serious injuries. Shrapnel escaping from the engine's outer cover can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings.

The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6, introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American Airlines Flight 383, a twin-engine Boeing 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down a runway for departure when the right-side engine failed, forcing the crew to abort takeoff, authorities said. Leaking jet fuel caught fire under the wing, as the crew evacuated passengers via emergency exit chutes from the left side of the plane, and fire crews arrived to begin pouring foam on the flames within minutes. One flight attendant and 19 passengers suffered minor injuries in their escape. NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday that while flames never breached the plane's cabin, some smoke did, though city fire officials have said no one suffered from smoke inhalation or burns. City fire department officials said on Friday the plane was 15 to 20 seconds from becoming airborne, fully loaded with 43,000 pounds of jet fuel. Ward said the aircraft stopped about 3,000 feet from the end of the runway. "That's a lot of runway to have left," she said. FAR-FLUNG ENGINE DEBRIS In a sign of the intensity of the engine breakdown, at least two pieces of a stage-2 high-pressure turbine disk were flung from the scene. One was found at a United Parcel Service warehouse nearly 3,000 feet (915 meters), or about half a mile, south of the accident site. Another was found three-tenths of a mile to the north on airport property, NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday. She said the escaped engine parts would be shipped to a lab for examination, and the crippled right engine would be sent to a GE facility to be dismantled and examined there for clues to what caused the failure. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s, and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of "industry-leading levels of reliability," Kennedy said. The O'Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.

Disclosure of the "uncontained" failure," in which internal engine parts breach the protective housing designed to keep them safely enclosed, even in a breakdown, came a day after a mishap that authorities said neared the point of disaster but caused no serious injuries. Shrapnel escaping from the engine's outer cover can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such engine failures are extremely rare, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine itself, with its manufacture or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6, introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American Airlines Flight 383, a twin-engine Boeing 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down a runway for departure when the right-side engine failed, forcing the crew to abort takeoff, authorities said. Leaking jet fuel caught fire under the wing, as the crew evacuated passengers via emergency exit chutes from the left side of the plane, and fire crews arrived to begin pouring foam on the flames within minutes. One flight attendant and 19 passengers suffered minor injuries in their escape. NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday that while flames never breached the plane's cabin, some smoke did, though city fire officials have said no one suffered from smoke inhalation or burns. City fire department officials said on Friday the plane was 15 to 20 seconds from becoming airborne, fully loaded with 43,000 pounds of jet fuel. Ward said the aircraft stopped about 3,000 feet from the end of the runway. "That's a lot of runway to have left," she said. FAR-FLUNG ENGINE DEBRIS In a sign of the intensity of the engine breakdown, at least two pieces of a stage-2 high-pressure turbine disk were flung from the scene. One was found at a United Parcel Service warehouse nearly 3,000 feet (915 meters), or about half a mile, south of the accident site. Another was found three-tenths of a mile to the north on airport property, NTSB investigator Lorenda Ward told reporters at O'Hare on Saturday. She said the escaped engine parts would be shipped to a lab for examination, and the crippled right engine would be sent to a GE facility to be dismantled and examined there for clues to what caused the failure. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O'Hare assisting in the investigation, GE's Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s, and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different wide-body jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of "industry-leading levels of reliability," Kennedy said. The O'Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international nonprofit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show. The most recent, in 2009, required airlines to remove an engine rotor within 30 days and reduced the allowed lifespan of an engine disk, conditions that could lead to cracks and uncontained engine failure, according to FAA records.

(Courtesy of Robocast.com/Handout via REUTERS) By Alwyn Scott and Tim Hepher, Reuters Oct 29, 2016 at 5:11 pm | Print View CHICAGO — Investigators were scouring Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport on Saturday after an engine caught fire on an American Airlines plane attempting to take off on Friday, as a source said a detached engine part had hit a nearby building, something the design should have prevented. No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which crippled a Boeing 767 with 161 passengers and nine crew members aboard as it was departing for Miami and briefly closed all O’Hare’s runways. The failure was so intense that a disk from the engine hit a building roof, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jet engines are designed to keep parts within the outer cover as escaped shrapnel can tear through the cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. Such “uncontained” failures therefore are extremely rare and National Transportation Safety Board officials were looking for clues as to whether the fault lay with the engine, with maintenance or a freak event such as debris on the runway entering the engine. The General Electric engine that powered the plane was a workhorse model known as the CF6 introduced decades ago, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy told Reuters on Saturday. The American Airlines plane engine dates from the 1980s or 1990s, and had been serviced by the airline, he said. American on Saturday declined to provide details about the aircraft, engine or maintenance, referring questions to the NTSB. The NTSB said it planned to release more details at a news conference later on Saturday at O’Hare. Officials from GE Aviation, Boeing and American Airlines were on the scene at O’Hare assisting in the investigation, GE’s Kennedy said. The CF6 was introduced in the 1970s and more than 4,000 are currently in service on seven different widebody jetliner models, including the Boeing 747 and 767, and Airbus A300 and A330, according to GE. The engine has racked up more than 400 million flight hours and has a record of “industry-leading levels of reliability,” Kennedy said. The O’Hare incident marks the third uncontained GE engine failure in little over a year, following a British Airways Boeing 777 in September 2015 and a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 in August. Both aircraft used different engines, the GE90 and CMF56, made by a joint venture of GE and Safran of France. In a full-power ground test situation in 2006, an American Airlines 767 with GE CF6 engines suffered an uncontained failure, according to a summary produced by the Aviation Safety Network, a service of the Flight Safety Foundation, an international non-profit based in Alexandria, Virginia. The “rupture of the high pressure turbine stage 1 disk” was traced partly to inadequate GE design of the disk and poor FAA oversight of inspections, according to the summary. The high pressure turbine of the CF6-80A engine used on the 767 has been cited in six regulatory actions by the Federal Aviation Authority since 1986, FAA records show.

In the world of technology, the present time might well be labeled the Age of Drones. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or UAVs, or just drones, have taken over much of the dangerous, difficult, or just plain tedious work that used to be done by human pilots. This development has given rise to much speculation about the role of humans in the cockpit, some people wondering whether they will still be needed at all. Now that same phenomenon is invading the vast, undersea world that once was the exclusive domain of the submarine. Autonomous Undersea Vehicles, or AUVs are growing in capability and sophistication, doing dangerous, difficult, and tedious work that submariners have long performed. The Association of Naval Aviation (ANA) is fortunate to have one of the leading authorities in this field agree to speak at the ANA luncheon on Thursday, Nov. 10. The event will being at 11:30 a.m. at Elks Lodge #1952, 11551 Trask Ave. in Garden Grove. Reservations are required. Please call 562-287-4846, no later than noon on Tuesday November 8. Cost is $15 including buffet lunch. Luncheon speaker Fred Sheldon, a program manager at the Boeing Defense, Space & Security Division, has prepared a fascinating presentation, revealing some of the amazing developments in this very special area of new technology. He is program manager for Advanced Technology Programs, a business area within Boeing that develops maritime acoustics and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions as well as autonomous undersea vehicles.

In his current role, Sheldon is responsible for the development and application of Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUV) and projecting the future of AUV platforms and advanced applications in offshore oil and gas and environmental spaces. He has successfully led a diverse portfolio of mission developments and deployments for a variety of customers, including the U.S. Navy, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and commercial markets. His efforts include the very first demonstration of an AUV’s ability to launch and recover through the torpedo tubes of a submerged submarine. Previous assignments include program manager for Quicksilver/Phoenix, a $31 million development and operations maintenance contract; systems engineering integration and test manager for the AN/BLQ-11 Long Term Mine Reconnaissance (LMRS) program; systems engineer and lead test director for LMRS and systems engineering lead for the Naval and Electronic Navigation – Fiber-Optic Gyro Navigation program, where he supported the development and analysis of system mechanization. Sheldon holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Humboldt State University.

McCANN and JOAN LOWY, The Associated Press Published: October 29, 2016, 12:20 am Updated: October 29, 2016, 8:40 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) CHICAGO (AP) — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight on a runway at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time … and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It’s mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it’s like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. ___ Lowy reported from Washington, D.C.

McCANN and JOAN LOWY, The Associated Press Published: October 29, 2016, 12:08 am Updated: October 29, 2016, 9:08 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) CHICAGO (AP) — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight on a runway at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time … and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It’s mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it’s like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. ___ Lowy reported from Washington, D.C. Associated Press writers Michael Tarm and Caryn Rousseau in Chicago also contributed to this report.

By Peter Carty October 30, 2016 17:32 GMT Close Embed Feed Boeing 777X: Everything you need to know about the world's biggest passenger airliner IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/18153" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> British Airways has suspended a pilot after photos emerged of a man wearing stockings who appeared to be masturbating at the controls of a plane. Father-of-one Colin Glover has denied he is the individual in the images. BA has temporarily relieved him of his duties. Serial numbers visible on the control panel in the images suggest the pictures were taken aboard at least two different BA aircraft. They show a figure wearing stockings with his legs on the steering controls. Other images show a man exposing himself in the toilets, a pornographic magazine on the cockpit dashboard, and a number of pornographic playing cards strewn around the cockpit. Glover has worked for the airline for 26 years. He regularly takes the controls of Boeing 777s on long-haul flights to a range of destinations including America, the Caribbean and the Far East. Glover's profile and CV on employment site LinkedIn say he has long-haul and short-haul experience on a wide variety of commercial passenger aircraft, ranging from B737s to B777s. The photos appear to have been taken on a B777. Large airliners now rely heavily on autopilot technology while in flight. Nevertheless, aviation expert Chris Yates told the Sun newspaper: "This is very dangerous if the plane is in mid-flight. If you are flying, you can fly into serious turbulence." A senior airline source said investigators would examine whether the images could have been shot in a flight simulator. However, Yates said this was unlikely. "You can tell by the lighting it is a plane," he said. "There is also more going on in the control panels than on a ­simulator. It looks [like] a live aircraft." A former BA pilot also said there were no toilets similar to the one seen in one of the pictures in the airline's simulators. A BA spokesman said: "We are taking this matter very seriously and are investigating." The images are the latest in a line of embarrassments for BA. Recently two BA pilots were questioned after allegedly getting into a bar-room brawl. Senior first officer Sean Murphy, 39, and pilot Paul Lytollis, 43, reportedly came to blows in a bar in Houston, Texas, during a stopover. In 2015, Matthew Underwood, a BA worker who delayed a flight for late passengers, was suspended amid allegations that he was taking bribes. In 2013, a drunken cabin-crew employee ran amok while travelling off-duty on a flight, prompting complaints from other passengers.

QRZ Callsign Search  Page last updated on: Sunday, October 30, 2016 NASA astronaut Kate Rubins, KG5FYJ after Soyuz landing Astronaut Kate Rubins and crewmates return safely from the ISS NASA astronaut and Expedition 49 crew member Kate Rubins, KG5FYJ, who became the first person to sequence DNA in space, returned to Earth Saturday after a successful mission aboard the International Space Station. Rubins and her crewmates Anatoly Ivanishin of the Russian space agency Roscosmos and Takuya Onishi, KF5LKS of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, touched down in their Soyuz MS-01 at 11:58 p.m. EDT (9:58 a.m. Oct. 30, Kazakhstan time) southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan. Rubins, who has a degree in molecular biology, contributed to several new studies taking place for the first time aboard the space station, including the Biomolecule Sequencer experiment. The ability to sequence the DNA of living organisms in space could enable astronauts to diagnose an illness, or identify microbes growing in the space station and determine whether they represent a health threat. During her time on the orbiting complex, Rubins ventured outside the confines of the station for two spacewalks. During the first one on Aug. 19, she and NASA astronaut Jeff Williams installed the first international docking adapter. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter’s main purpose is to provide a port for spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be the Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft now in development in partnership with NASA's Commercial Crew Program. During her second spacewalk Sept. 1, Rubins and Williams retracted a spare thermal control radiator and installed two new high-definition cameras.  Together, the Expedition 49 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard the world-class orbiting laboratory during their 115 days in space. The trio also welcomed three cargo spacecraft delivering several tons of supplies and research experiments. Rubins was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft to the station in October, the company's sixth contracted commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX’s Dragon ninth contracted mission in July. One Russian ISS Progress cargo spacecraft also docked to the station in July. Rubins and Onishi have each spent a total of 115 days in space during their first mission. Ivanishin now has 280 days in space from two flights. Expedition 50, with Shane Kimbrough of NASA in command and his crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos, will operate the station for three weeks until the arrival of three new crew members. Peggy Whitson, KC5ZTD of NASA, Thomas Pesquet, KG5FYG of ESA (European Space Agency) and Oleg Novitskiy of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch Nov. 17 from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

As part of its investment drive between now and next spring, the 14 A330s operated by Swiss will be equipped with the requisite Panasonic technology – eXConnect for the internet and eXPhone for telephony. The five remaining A340s in the fleet will be equipped with onboard connectivity in 2018, as part of their cabin refurbishment. “We are pleased to offer our passengers from Dubai the excellent service of Swiss especially with the added benefit of connectivity on board. This serves well for passengers from Dubai to Zurich and throughout our long haul network who desire to continue staying on line during their flight in order to work or connect with family and friends via social media,” said Karsten Zang, Lufthansa’s regional director Gulf, I.R. Iran, Afghanistan & Pakistan. In improving its fleet, Swiss has also currently ordered nine Boeing 777-300ERs, some of which have already been delivered and is set to acquire its 10th such aircraft in 2018. The Boeing aircraft are to replace some of Swiss' Airbus A340-300s fleet. The upgrade totals to a $330 million investment. Swiss will also be equipping its five remaining Airbus A340-300s with a new cabin product in all three seating classes. Following the refurbishment, the A340s will seat 223 passengers: eight in First Class, 47 in Business and 168 in Economy. The new First Class cabin as well as the Business Class will be closely modelled to that of the Boeing 777 while the Economy Class cabin will sport a new seat type. The new inflight entertainment system will also be patterned after that of Boeing 777.

/PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- NASA astronaut and Expedition 49 crew member Kate Rubins, who became the first person to sequence DNA in space, returned to Earth Saturday after a successful mission aboard the International Space Station. Rubins and her crewmates Anatoly Ivanishin of the Russian space agency Roscosmos and Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, touched down in their Soyuz MS-01 at 11:58 p.m. EDT (9:58 a.m. Oct. 30, Kazakhstan time) southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan. Rubins, who has a degree in molecular biology, contributed to several new studies taking place for the first time aboard the space station, including the Biomolecule Sequencer experiment. The ability to sequence the DNA of living organisms in space could enable astronauts to diagnose an illness, or identify microbes growing in the space station and determine whether they represent a health threat. During her time on the orbiting complex, Rubins ventured outside the confines of the station for two spacewalks. During the first one on Aug. 19, she and NASA astronaut Jeff Williams installed the first international docking adapter. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter's main purpose is to provide a port for spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be the Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft now in development in partnership with NASA's Commercial Crew Program. During her second spacewalk Sept. 1, Rubins and Williams retracted a spare thermal control radiator and installed two new high-definition cameras.  Together, the Expedition 49 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard the world-class orbiting laboratory during their 115 days in space. The trio also welcomed three cargo spacecraft delivering several tons of supplies and research experiments. Rubins was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK's Cygnus spacecraft to the station in October, the company's sixth contracted commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX's Dragon ninth contracted mission in July. One Russian ISS Progress cargo spacecraft also docked to the station in July. Rubins and Onishi have each spent a total of 115 days in space during their first mission. Ivanishin now has 280 days in space from two flights. Expedition 50, with Shane Kimbrough of NASA in command and his crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos, will operate the station for three weeks until the arrival of three new crew members. Peggy Whitson of NASA, Thomas Pesquet of ESA (European Space Agency) and Oleg Novitskiy of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch Nov. 17 from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

Most of that came from the city of Anaheim, which agreed to foot the bill for up to $200 million in infrastructure improvements when Disney built its second theme park, California Adventure, next to Disneyland. 1 of 14 Over the past two decades, the biggest tax breaks among California companies went to two aerospace defense giants, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, whose El Segundo plant is shown here in 2006. The F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assembly line is seen at the Northrop Grumman plant in El Segundo, Calif., Tuesday, Jan. 24, 2006. The defense contractor said Tuesday that its fourth quarter earnings rose 22 percent, topping Wall Street expectations.

The park across from the entrance to Disneyland in the former parking lot opened in 2001. It was not well received with critics saying there was not enough there for kids to do. Disney immediately started addressing that issue. In 2010, the letters changed to a new colors in celebration of the premiere of the World of Color show at that theme park. The park's name was changed to Disney California Adventure after the addition of Cars Land in 2012. FILE PHOTO, MARK EADES 1 of 14 The L.A.

View slideshow The Walt Disney Co. received subsidies worth $149.7 million. Most of that came from the city of Anaheim, which agreed to foot the bill for up to $200 million in infrastructure improvements when Disney built its second theme park, California Adventure, next to Disneyland. By TERI SFORZA / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF CORPORATE BREAKS More than 80 companies in California received tax breaks and subsidies worth $1 million or more. Compared to other states, California is stingy. Company Northrop Grumman $ 440,313,268 Lockheed Martin $ 429,297,758 Anschutz Co. $ 290,000,000 Walt Disney $ 149,657,320* Time Warner $ 70,196,726 Viacom $ 55,561,662 Twenty-First Century Fox $ 28,322,000 Samsung $ 17,015,520 Tesla Motors $ 15,647,626 Comcast $ 15,388,418 *Good Jobs First used Anaheim's original projection of $200 million for the Disney expansion project. Audited totals from Anaheim showed the Mickey & Friends Parking garage costing $108 million; electrical improvements, $17.6 million; and the pedestrian bridge, $3.6 million. SOURCES: Public data, Good Jobs First RELATED: Six O.C. companies among 67 statewide that will share $47 million in GO-Biz tax credits Businesses in California were given state tax breaks worth about $2.67 billion over the past two decades, with more than half the money going to two sectors of the economy – those trading in war and circus. These tax breaks – denounced as “corporate welfare” or praised as “business incentives” – totaled $889.3 million for aerospace and military contractors, and $389.4 million for entertainment and media companies, according topublic data compiled by the nonprofit Good Jobs First. The biggest breaks went to two aerospace defense giants, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. In 2014, the Legislature approved a controversial bill aimed specifically at Lockheed, a key subcontractor for Boeing on a bid to build next-generation bombers for the Air Force. The bill granted Lockheed a tax credit of 17.5 percent of wages paid to its workers, worth $420 million over the 15-year life of the deal. Northrop, a rival, quickly protested, saying the credit gave Lockheed a tremendous competitive advantage, and the Legislature extended the break to Northrop. An analysis by the state Assembly suggests the tax credits operate as subsidies for wages paid. California’s next-largest corporate break, worth $290 million, went to Anschutz Co. for construction of a 55-story hotel next to the Los Angeles Convention Center. That package, courtesy of the city of Los Angeles, included a hotel-bed-tax rebate of up to $270 million over 25 years, a $16 million loan at below-market rate and a $4 million fee waiver. The Walt Disney Co. weighed in at No. 4, receiving subsidies worth $149.7 million. Most of that came from the city of Anaheim, which agreed to foot the bill for up to $200 million in infrastructure improvements when Disney built its second theme park, California Adventure, next to Disneyland. The Mickey & Friends Parking Structure cost the city $108 million, electrical improvements cost $17.6 million, and a pedestrian bridge cost $3.6 million, Anaheim said. Walt Disney Studios’ films “Whale” and “Overnight at 42nd Street” received state film tax credits worth $18.4 million, and Disneyland has received worker training reimbursements worth $2 million. Not included in the Disney tally is the potential value of Anaheim’s 30-year ban on entertainment ticket taxes, or the $550 million in hotel bed taxes that Anaheim will return to Disney and developer Wincome Group in exchange for the construction of three luxury hotels in Anaheim’s resort district. California’s state government has a dozen different incentive programs for businesses, and local governments offer myriad incentives of their own. The $2.67 billion number is not exhaustive, as data reporting among local governments is spotty, but that will soon change. More on that in a minute. ‘CHOICE’ Proponents of corporate tax breaks say the money encourages businesses to stay and grow in high-cost California, thus creating or preserving jobs. “We must always remember that in today’s global economy, location is not permanent, but by choice,” said a letter signed by more than a dozen SoCal Jobs Defense Council members – leaders of business, labor and government – urging the Legislature to embrace the aerospace tax breaks. “We have to be ready as a state to make that choice easier for them to locate, innovate, produce, and expand here.” The very term “corporate subsidy” aggravates Orange County Business Council President Lucy Dunn. “It is no more a ‘subsidy’ than when the feds let you deduct your personal home mortgage interest from your annual tax returns,” she said. “That deduction is supposed to incentivize home ownership – making it a bit easier to buy a home – a good thing! So it's disingenuous for folks who take that deduction to say a business can’t do something similar when it delivers something a city wants, and takes all the risk.” That’s what these incentives are: government enticements to get businesses to do something the government wants, but that the market has not yet delivered, Dunn said. “Usually, no up-front funding comes from the government to do these projects. Instead, less taxes are paid for a limited time by business, if and only if, they meet certain conditions,” Dunn said. “When the project is built, there are usually numerous other economic benefits – increased tourism, sales taxes, jobs creation, mitigation fees, public benefits like parks and transportation improvements, that a city weighs to offset the business’s tax incentive/deduction.” Anaheim’s decision to refund bed taxes in order to get its desired four-star hotels is a classic example, she said. From the city’s perspective, it can be a no-brainer, officials said. “Anaheim views economic development, rather than resident taxes, as the best way to fund city services,” Anaheim spokesman Mike Lyster said in a statement. “When we work with companies to bring investment to Anaheim, we see a substantial return on that investment for our residents. “Since we worked with Disney in the 1990s to expand the Anaheim Resort, our hotel-stay revenue has more than tripled. That allowed Anaheim to weather the Great Recession better than many cities and today is helping us add police officers, pay down debt and liabilities and to provide parks, libraries, community centers and family services for our residents.” The Register contacted each of the companies receiving $10 million or more in subsidies/incentives, but only Disney and Lockheed Martin responded. Both declined to comment on specifics. Lockheed Martin spokesman Bill Phelps instead pointed out that the company employs 10,000 people throughout California who work on high-tech aerospace and defense projects, from unmanned systems technology to space research. GRATUITOUS Opponents counter that while the incentives may sound grand, they do precious little to tip the economic scale in any direction whatsoever, often making them gratuitous and irrelevant. “All state and local taxes, combined, only amount to about 2 percent of the cost of doing business,” said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First. “Incentives don’t matter. They just can’t move the needle very much.” An Assembly analysis of the bill to extend the $420 million tax credit to Northrop said as much. “A defense project’s scope and budget are determined by the federal government. Personnel hiring decisions, capital investments, and additional activities a contractor must undertake to complete the project are all dependent on the parameters specified by the federal program.” State subsidies are unlikely to change these investment decisions. The Tax Foundation, an independent think tank, also had sharp words for the subsidies. “Narrow incentives such as these are not sound tax policy. They rarely succeed in their aims of ‘creating’ jobs, and (instead) create major distortions as existing companies foot the full freight of the tax bill in order to provide incentives to other favored firms and new investments,” argued economist Lyman Stone. And the threat of companies fleeing the state is often fiction, critics said. “So, where is Disneyland going to move to if it doesn’t get a subsidy?” asked Scott Klinger of Good Jobs First. “Of course they’re going to expand in Anaheim.” TRANSPARENCY Good Jobs First’s LeRoy began his career in corporate subsidy reform in the 1980s, when he was working to fend off industrial plant closures in Chicago. It turned out that many of the shuttering factories had received economic development subsidies and, despite that public investment, the shutdowns were legal. Those revelations led to reforms, but in his opinion, they were not nearly comprehensive enough. It was hard to determine the true public cost of these deals: How much were the companies really getting to keep? How much tax revenue were governments really giving up? That led to the nonprofit Good Jobs First, and its push for public transparency on “corporate welfare.” That effort will get a major boost next year when most governments will have to start placing a dollar figure on tax breaks they give to businesses. Those numbers will then be included in the annual audited financial statements of those governments, allowing a much more precise accounting of how much corporate tax breaks divert from public coffers, and whether the tradeoff is worth it. This new disclosure requirement is brought to you by the eggheads at the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which made news recently for requiring governments to include unfunded pension liabilities in their bottom lines. That disappeared billions of public dollars instantly, and was meant to underscore that pension debts are real and must be paid. Similar logic is at work here. “Financial statements prepared by state and local governments ... provide citizens and taxpayers, legislative and oversight bodies, municipal bond analysts, and others with information they need to evaluate the financial health of governments, make decisions, and assess accountability,” GASB says in its statement on the new rule, Number 77. Tax abatements are widely used to encourage economic development, but governments “do not always provide the information necessary to assess how tax abatements affect their financial position ... including their ability to raise resources in the future,” GASB says. The numbers will start showing up in audits next year. The details might incite further outrage in those who think the system is rigged for the wealthy – but California is likely to come out looking a lot better than big-spending states like Louisiana and Michigan, which sometimes give up more revenue than they collect in taxes, LeRoy said. “California, actually, is pretty stingy,” he said. ‘STINGY’ While the $2.67 billion California governments have extended in corporate subsidies may not be chump change, it’s small potatoes compared with New York’s $24 billion, Louisiana’s $16.65 billion, Michigan’s $14.2 billion and Washington’s $13.4 billion in corporate subsidies, according to the data. “In the broad scheme of things, California is not a go-go spender, and you can blame a lot of that on Prop. 13, and the end of redevelopment in 2011,” LeRoy said. “It wasn’t seriously throwing money at Tesla during that five-state competition (for who would land its battery factory). It wasn’t competing hard for Boeing. And we don’t think that’s a bad thing. California’s job-creation numbers and entrepreneurial culture look great. There are lots of good things happening in your stingy state. “Stingy can often be very smart.” The stingiest state of all was Hawaii, which offered just $515,430 in subsidies, followed by Wyoming ($1.2 million) and New Hampshire ($8.4 million). It’s also worth noting that California’s $2.67 billion-worth of subsidies are but a fraction of what corporations pay in taxes. There are the aforementioned property taxes, as well as payroll taxes, sales and use taxes, and corporate income taxes. Corporations pay tax of 8.84 percent of net income, and over the past decade revenues from the corporate income tax have averaged $10 billion a year, according to data from the state controller. California’s stinginess has left it vulnerable to piracy, some say, allowing lower-cost states such as Texas, Nevada and Arizona to lure away businesses. A study by Joseph Vranich of Spectrum Location Solutions in Irvine found that, from 2008 through 2015, at least 1,687 businesses bailed out of California or chose to expand operations elsewhere. Vranich blames that on California’s “hostile business climate,” including high taxes and heavy regulation. Wallace Walrod, chief economic adviser for the Orange County Business Council, had never seen state-by-state incentive values laid out quite like this. The next discussion might not be how to curb corporate subsidies in California, but how to provide more incentives, he said. Dunn, president of the Business Council, agrees. “California is not as creative as it could be,” she said.

No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred hours before an unrelated mishap in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the landing gear of a FedEx Corp cargo plane collapsed on touchdown, sparking a fire that was quickly extinguished. The company later said the FedEx pilots were safe. American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing Co 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down an O’Hare runway at about 2:30 pm CDT (1930 GMT) when the right-side engine of the twin-engine jet burst into flames, authorities said. Footage from Chicago’s ABC News affiliate station, WLS-TV, showed the idled plane on the ground with flames and large clouds of black smoke billowing from its right side and emergency slides deployed on the left side. Passengers milled about watching the blaze as fire trucks pumped water on the flames. Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner, said the mishap could have been much worse. The plane was fully loaded with 19,504 kg of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Sampey told a news conference later. “So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing,” he said. “This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later.” Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. The plane’s CF6 engine, the “workhorse” of the commercial aviation industry, was built by General Electric Co, and GE dispatched investigators to the scene, the company said. The Federal Aviation Administration initially said the pilot aborted takeoff after reporting a blown-out tire. But city fire spokesman Larry Langford said he saw no blown tires at the scene. Langford said 19 passengers and one flight attendant were taken to a hospital with minor injuries — such as bumps, bruises and sprained ankles — suffered in exiting the plane. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← French MPs urge UK to accept camp minors Spain’s former Socialist chief quits as lawmaker → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Oman welcomes Yemen ceasefire HM receives greetings from Fahd Higher Committee for Conferences meets Kerry concludes oman visit Read More ...

It’s too early to conclude how the engine failed, senior investigator Lorenda Ward said Saturday at a news conference in Chicago. A disc in a high-pressure turbine failed, and a piece of it was found 2,920 feet (890 meters) away at a United Parcel Service Inc. warehouse, Ward said. The American Airlines jetliner at O’Hare International Airport on Oct. 28. Photographer: Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune via AP Twenty people were taken to hospitals for treatment of minor injuries ranging from bruises to hurt ankles, Juan Hernandez, district chief of emergency medical services for the Chicago Fire Department, said Friday at a news conference. American said seven travelers and one flight attendant were injured. Passengers escaped the plane on slides as the fire sent columns of thick black smoke into the air. The Boeing Co. 767 had an engine malfunction just before the fire, said Leslie Scott, a spokeswoman for American. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration initially said the fire occurred after a tire burst and later issued a statement saying it happened “after experiencing a problem during takeoff.” In an uncontained failure, debris escapes the hardened engine casing and can damage or penetrate the wings or fuselage, amplifying the risk to the aircraft far beyond the loss of thrust. A Southwest Airlines Co. jet was caught in a similar accident just two months ago in Florida. “There was a huge explosion on the right-hand side of the airplane,” passenger Hector Cardenas told the ABC television affiliate in Chicago. “Everyone was sort of panicking.” Charred Wing Cardenas said the plane was about to take off when the explosion occurred. The last ground speed was recorded at 115 knots, or 132 miles an hour, Flightradar24 posted on Twitter. The fire blackened one side of the plane, and pictures appeared to show the charred wing on that side drooping toward the ground. The plane was carrying about 43,000 pounds of fuel and there was “a substantial fuel leak,” Timothy Sampey, Chicago’s assistant deputy fire commissioner for airport operations, said at the news conference. “There was a heavy volume of fire on the engine and all the way to the wing tip.” “This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later,” Sampey said. Incident Investigation The pilots aborted the takeoff, said the FAA, which will investigate. Flight 383, headed for Miami, carried 161 passengers and nine crew members. One potential cause of jet engine explosions is a foreign object that gets sucked in, said Bill Waldock, a professor of aviation safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, comparing the power plant to a vacuum cleaner. Issues inside the engine have also led to explosions, said Waldock, who was speaking generally and didn’t have specific details about the Chicago incident. Explosions can send shrapnel across the plane and rupture fuel tanks and fuel lines, he said. In the case of a Boeing 767 or Boeing 777, much of the fuel actually is stored in the wing in what’s called an integral fuel tank, or “wet wing,” Waldock said.

American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren't replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it's like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles.

AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung F 12,04 -0,02 (The Lincoln Navigator concept, unveiled in 2016.AP) Kumar Galhotra is what you might call the right man for the job, and the job happens to be one of the toughest in the entire auto industry. Galhotra runs Lincoln, Ford’s luxury brand. Since roughly 2013, the brand has been attempting to stage a comeback, with billions in funding from the mothership in Dearborn, Michigan. Born in India, Galhotra — who has a degree in engineering from the University of Michigan — came to Ford in 1988 and rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the vice president who oversaw how all Ford and Lincoln vehicles were screwed together. In 2014, Ford CEO Mark Fields tapped him to take on the Lincoln challenge, promoting him to president of the marque. Founded in 1917 by Henry Leland, one of the most successful automotive entrepreneurs of the early 20th century, Lincoln was a magnificent American brand for almost its entire history. Leland had also started Cadillac, selling it to General Motors in 1902 for the then vast sum of $4.5 million. Premium cars were Leland's specialty, along with a Roaring Twenties version of mergers and acquisitions: Lincoln went to Ford in 1922. In the mid-1950s, when the US auto industry was at its postwar apex, Lincoln created the iconic Continental. The 1961 Continental is one of the most famous cars ever designed, distinguished by its rear suicide doors and its sober avoidance of flash. It was as close a big four-door could come to being a perfectly tailored tuxedo. It announced itself with reserve. The ’61 Continental was powerful, but there was almost no point in driving it fast. It wanted to cruise along in an aura of serene self-confidence. Enter the Navigator (The mighty Navigator SUV.Lincoln) In the late '90s, Lincoln gave birth to its first large luxury SUV, the Navigator. That massive vehicle capitalized on the SUV boom of the 1990s and early 2000s, when gas prices fell in defiance of earlier predictions that Middle East oil supplies would dry up, spawning a permanent gas crisis that would make the crunches of the 1970s look tame by comparison. The Continental had been associated with the national well-being of the Kennedy years, and in many respects the Navigator was the Continental of the Clinton administration. It brought a new level of finish to the large yet utilitarian SUVs that Ford had considerable expertise in building. Customers who never would have looked twice at the Expedition snapped up Navigators, which were marketed using jazzy TV commercials and smoothly urbane imagery that profitably overrode any hesitation over the sheer size of the vehicle, one of the biggest on the road. Lincoln was selling a quarter of a million cars and SUVs annually in the late '90s, but that would turn out to be a peak for the brand, which then fell into a seemingly terminal decline. For one, gas prices began rising again in the mid-2000s, and the bottom fell out of the SUV market. A wave of hybrids took the US market by storm, led by the Toyota Prius. The Prius won the 2000s, while gas-guzzling hulks like the Navigator lost. By the time gas prices in California hit almost $5 a gallon in 2009, it was widely assumed that luxury SUVs like the Navigator and Cadillac’s Escalade were woolly mammoths headed for extinction. The market shift was a disaster for the Lincoln brand, which couldn’t compete with the German luxury triumvirate of Mercedes, BMW, and Audi. (Kumar Galhotra, the man with the plan.Ford) Lincoln wasn’t matching up against the Japanese, either: Lexus, Acura, and Infiniti were hanging with the Germans. Lexus was a first choice with many buyers, and seemed to have figured out how to beat the Germans at their own game. Acura and Infiniti were “second-tier” luxury brands, but even the seconds were stronger than Lincoln, which was barely on anyone’s radar. Cadillac, meanwhile, had set about reinventing itself with a new radically angular, Stealth-fighter-inspired art-and-science design vocabulary, which endeared the brand to customers who wanted something more aggressive than what BMW, Mercedes, or Lexus were selling. Caddy wasn’t moving a lot of product but its cars stood out. Identity crisis By the time the 2008 financial crisis hit, Lincoln had almost no brand identity left. The austerely sexy Continentals of the 1960s were a distant memory; the nameplate left the lineup in 2002, but by then the JFK associations had been replaced by the impression that Continentals were driven by livery-cab guys in New York City and hadn’t had a whiff of the country club in decades. A certain retro vibe had kept Lincoln afloat — barely. It was the brand of some aging hipsters and Hollywood coolios, making an appearance in the opening credits for the HBO bromantic series “Entourage” and oozing Rat Pack authenticity, particularly for the convertible versions. (A 1961 Lincoln Continental.Lincoln) But the reality of the brand was that its most important vehicle was out of favor and its sedans were both unexciting and beset with an aging customer base. The cars were perfectly competent, but unlike BMW’s or Mercedes’ sport sedans, Lincolns were throwback freeway cruisers, rebadged versions of Ford’s mass-market sedans. They came in various trim levels, to satisfy customers who might want a slightly peppier ride, but Lincoln had nothing like the high-performance M Sport or AMG divisions that amped up the cars sold by BMW and Mercedes, respectively. Even Cadillac had a “V” designation for its high-performance division and was taking its cars to the legendary Nürburgring racetrack in Germany to vindicate their speed and handling. For all practical purposes, Lincoln had been left behind by this league when the Navigator ceased to carry the weight of the brand. By 2010, Lincoln was seen as competing with Buick, GM’s “near luxury” marque. To top it all off, Ford was lagging behind GM, Toyota, VW, and the main German luxury brands in China, widely considered to be the world’s second most important market for autos, after the US. (Europe in the aggregate is larger than the US, but also fragmented, with some countries providing better customer bases than others; growth in Europe has also been relatively flat over the past decade and half, leading Ford and others to make ill-advised forays into the Russian market.) Bolstering the Ford brand in China was critical for the carmaker, but it couldn’t afford to be a bit player in the exceptionally profitable luxury space. Why Lincoln? In 2016, Mark Fields dropped by Business Insider for an interview and explained the luxury stakes for Lincoln. In the US alone, he said, luxury can make up 13% of the entire industry and upwards of 9% worldwide. “But is represents over a third of the profits,” he added. (Ford CEO Mark Fields.Reuters) That’s a datapoint that’s impossible to ignore. If Ford let Lincoln go, it would become the only major global carmaker without a luxury brand, because it had shed its premium portfolio as part of then-CEO Alan Mulally’s pre-financial crisis home-improvement plan. Some global automakers are of course luxury brands first — BMW, Mercedes — and some like Ferrari, after its 2015 IPO, are independent. But Ford’s competition — GM, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and even Hyundai and Kia — all maintain luxury marques in their stables. Lincoln was going through its roughest patch ever. But without it, Ford could be giving up billions in revenue and profits. By 2010, after the worst of the financial crisis had passed, Ford was stuck with a tough call: Fix Lincoln? Or let the brand go? The Mercury brand was rolled up in 2011, leaving Ford with nothing to take into battle against Buick. If Lincoln went away as well, the core Ford brand would be all that remained. Mulally wanted to put Lincoln out of its misery, and many auto-industry commentators leaned that way as well. He had already released Ford from the responsibility of managing its portfolio of foreign luxury brands: Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, and Aston Martin. In doing so he was following a playbook written by none other than Mark Fields, head of Ford’s North American business. Fields oversaw the all-important US market and had developed a plan to streamline Ford and force it into more reliable profitability. Fields titled his plan the “Way Forward,” and he thought it might get him the nod as CEO. But the Ford board of directors went for Mulally, leaving Fields in an awkward position: watch as someone else took over his master vision, or become a willing and loyal colonel in the new general’s army. Fields chose what was best for Ford, not Fields, and went on to become an executive who was ideally positioned to both vacuum up everything he could learn from Mulally and work on convincing the former Boeing man what he thought was really right for a global car company. (Mullaly had come to Ford in an unexpected move from the planemaker before the 2008 financial crisis hit.) Keeping Lincoln was one of those things that Fields thought was right. The brand has him to thank for its existence. Comeback And so there was Galhotra in March 2016, standing on a rotating dais at a cool event space in Manhattan’s West Chelsea art-gallery district to introduce Lincoln’s newest lineup. The cars drove out from behind a scrim, up a ramp, and onto the dais, accompanied by a few quick licks from a jazz combo. It was pure auto-industry theater, presented to journalists eating a three-course dinner — some of the same journalists who might have been calling for Lincoln’s demise a few years earlier. Galhotra was at ease in the role of Lincoln’s impresario, more so than he had been a year earlier, when at the 2015 New York Auto Show the carmaker had nabbed useful attention by revealing its Continental concept car. Galhotra seemed slightly less confident then in Lincoln’s new tagline, “quiet luxury,” and the brand’s capacity to embody the suave reserve of that message. He had come across as someone still practicing the message, although he certainly looked the part: trim, in tailored suits and a small Lincoln badge pin in his lapel, and speaking in impeccable, complete sentences. (The Continental concept in 2015.Newspress) But the 2015 Continental concept was, no question, something. It was blue — very blue — inside and out. It was also big. Lincoln had brought what was effectively a limo to New York, to fulfill the demand that the brand bring back its most famous nameplate and signal that it was ready to move aggressively into the China market, where affluent car owners don’t drive but are driven. For Galhotra, it must have been a difficult car to stand next to and talk up the virtues of quiet luxury. So far the new Continental — and the new Lincoln — had conveyed anything but quiet. For one thing, a group of television spots for Lincoln, meant to showcase the carmaker's compact crossover, the MKC, had gone massively viral. They starred Matthew McConaughey, fresh off his stint on HBO’s “True Detective” series and just before he won a best actor Oscar for his performance in "Dallas Buyers Club." Directed by the legendary indie-film auteur Gus Van Sant, the spots featured a trippy stream-of-consciousness voiceover by McConaughey, blending the gauzy existential musings of his “True Detective” character with borderline hallucinogenic meditations on the nature of moving forward and backward in time. Strange soliloquies of revival. It didn’t seem to matter whether or not, strictly speaking, they made sense. Parodies were swiftly created by Ellen DeGeneres and “Saturday Night Live,” massively intensifying the spot’s coolness credibility and almost overnight transforming McConaughey into one of the most influential celebrity pitchmen for a car company. These new Lincoln commercials had a subtle power in spite of their pretense. They demonstrated, almost subliminally, that quiet luxury was a preoccupation of the contemporary thinking person. And they memorably served up the idea that Lincoln was on the road to someplace different, even if initially, as Galhotra seemed to know, the destination wasn’t entirely certain. (Matthew McConaughey got behind the wheel of a Lincoln for some memorable ads.Lincoln Media) The actor and the role A year after the Continental debut, Galhotra was fully inhabiting his role, preparing to unveil Lincoln’s second show-stealing concept at the 2016 New York Auto Show: the new Navigator. The Continental had been spectacular, but the Navigator was over the top, with its pair of massive gullwing doors swung up, concertina steps unfolded, and an interior inspired by luxury yachts, complete with nautical teak details. The old Navigator was large and in charge, one of the most impressive vehicles on the road. But the fact was that the SUV had become somewhat undermined in its premium identity by its association with car services. It was the SUV you rode in to the airport, not the SUV you parked in front of your vacation house. The immense form of the Navigator was retained in the revised model, but this one was quite literally a land yacht. Galhotra was more than up to the task of standing next to it when its turn to roll up onto the dais arrived, right after the production version of the Continental had left the stage. I’d met with Galhotra earlier in the day, for a mellow preview of the Navigator. He was tie-less, sitting with his lead engineer and Lincoln’s designer, David Woodhouse. The wary executive I’d encountered a year earlier, clearly feeling the pressure of a job he’d been in for only a few months, had been transformed into an almost Zen-like raconteur, a man whose neat gray hair cast him as a distinguished leader who didn’t need to seek the spotlight. The spotlight sought him. In 2015, his chief competition had been Johan de Nysschen, the South Africa-born president of Cadillac, which had just moved its sales and marketing operations to New York City to merge GM’s own top brand with the world of global luxury. De Nysschen is a tall, booming guy, a lordly towering strategist who reminds one of the men who built the airline business in the '50s and '60s, like Pan Am’s Juan Trippe. He gives the impression that he’s always working, and with his two-tone Breitling watch and clipped mustache, it seems as though he was built to lead Cadillac into battle against BMW and Mercedes. I interviewed him at the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show, in a massive Cadillac booth outfitted with an ersatz office suite that replicated his space in Manhattan. As I watched him stand up from behind his desk, rising from an ever-present sheaf of work, it reminded me that some executives need a gigantic office simply to suit the scale of their expectations. Galhotra is more low-key. He doesn’t exactly speak quietly, but he doesn’t raise his voice, either. Instead, he gradually increases the amplification, depending on the occasion, like a musician slowly upping the volume as a composition heads for its crescendo. De Nysschen is a robust-handshake type, but Galhotra is firm and lingering, drawing you in. He knows the trick of speaking just softly enough to compel you to stand closer, without ever losing a word. He’s like a diplomat, the ambassador from a country called “Lincoln.” He can loosen up a bit, lose the necktie — even though it doesn’t look entirely right — but it’s hard to picture him wearing anything besides a slim, European-cut suit that nevertheless evokes the Detroit of the 1960s. He specializes in sly smiles, while De Nysschen relies on hearty guffaws. If you worked for either man, you wouldn’t want them mad at you, but they’d express their displeasure in diametrically opposed ways. (An amazing follow-up to the Continental: the Navigator concept.Ford) Catching up with Cadillac By early 2016, Galhotra had no meaningful displeasure to express. The Lincoln revival was in full swing, and the automaker was picking up the pace in China. Sales lagged Cadillac by roughly seven to one, but as one of GM’s key China brands (along with Buick), Cadillac had a substantial head start. On balance, Lincoln was making up ground in a hurry, and it had an almost perfect mix of vehicles, unlike Caddy, which in the US was still trying to take it to BMW 3- and 5-Series sedans. In 2015, when Lincoln was breaking out the Continental “quiet luxury” concept, Cadillac had hosted a party of epic scale at a pier in Brooklyn to introduce its CT6 sedan. It was the most extravagant auto-show shindig I’d ever attended. The flower arrangements were as big as the car, and the attendees were representative of the art-and-fashion crowd that Cadillac wanted to associate with the brand. R&B artist Raphael Saadiq provided the entertainment. And there was a distinct absence of the usual bearded middle-aged auto-journalist set. Instead, chic scenesters ruled the bars and gourmet-food lines. It was more like an elite music festival in Monaco. (Cadillac's Johan de Nysschen.David McNew/Getty Images) The BMW fight was an old one — Cadillac had the Bavarians in its sights for decades, trying to prove to customers that Caddys weren’t grandpa cruisers and pimpmobiles. The brand worked hard to shake off its soft, chrome-laden aura of the 1970s for some bold 0-60 mph times and eye-watering engine specs. Cadillacs were even taking it to the racetrack, competing in a sports car class. But as De Nysschen said during our interview, the portfolio was off. He needed crossovers, and although the Cadillac XT5 arrived in 2016, Lincoln had more of these versatile vehicles to sell, at a time when sedan sales were tanking. This was a substantial positive for Lincoln in China, where the market was shaping up to look at lot like it did in the US — just bigger. In 2016, 17.5 million new cars and truck sales in the US was a record, but the China market was already doing 20 million by then, with some very bullish analysts predicted that it could climb as high as 40 million as the vast population began to mirror the rest of the world’s percentages for car ownership. So Galhotra's task was twofold: Revive the Lincoln brand in the US and establish it in China. By 2016, the objectives were in place and the execution phase was underway. The plan called for dozens of new dealerships and a clear canting of Continental and Navigator toward limo duty. The impressive thing about many of the interior features of both vehicles, at the concept stage, was that most would make it to the production versions. There is a difference between the way American and Chinese see large sedans and SUVs. Americans drive themselves. When it comes to big sedans, they want horsepower, comfort, and legroom, but they don’t much care if the back seat emulates their living rooms. On the SUV side, the want all the same, but more, with utility thrown in: room for pets and gear and the ability to facilitate an outdoorsy lifestyle. The Navigator concept may have looked like the sort of thing that Beyoncé would saunter out of in a music video, but Galhotra emphasized that the truck has impressive towing capacity, a land yacht that could tow one intended for the water. Chinese customers haven’t yet crossed that recreational Rubicon — the wealthy rural gentlemen who likes his Navigator because of its style and its ability to transport his horses to dressage competitions hasn’t yet found his counterpart in the Middle Kingdom. Galhotra had every reason to believe that he eventually would, however. That’s why he insisted on the Navigator’s ongoing importance for the brand. Strategically, Lincoln needs a big SUV to go along with the full-size Continental sedan to be fully competitive in the Chinese luxury market. (The Continental in production trim.Hollis Johnson) Getting it right in China Getting the product mix and features right in China is just part of the battle. Unlike GM with Buick, Lincoln is a new arrival in the Chinese market for Ford. There are advantages with this: Lincoln has a blank slate in the country. Luxury-car buyers don’t know the brand, and so Lincoln is free of its stodgy American associations. On the other hand, the Chinese luxury market has been treated as a gold rush by Western carmakers. Lincoln, a near-luxury brand in the US, is billing itself as a true luxury brand in China, taking on the most well-known and established marques in the world, all while lacking Buick’s history. As dowdy as Buick had seemed as a brand before the financial crisis, an “old person's’” car in reputation with a 65-plus ownership base to boot, this was still the car that China’s last emperor, Henry Pu Yi, had owned during his reign from the early 20th century until just before the end of World War I. The brand carries immense weight in China to this day; it punches well above its weight. So the challenge for Lincoln, which lacks Buick’s roots and BMW’s global name recognition, is daunting, but many aspects of Lincoln’s new brand makeup will allow it to ease more seamlessly into the Chinese market than carmakers that have organized their identities around high-performance. High-performance means big engines, for the most part, and big engines are a problem in China. There’s room for 500-plus-horsepower sport sedans, but the bulk of engines produced in the country must be smaller in displacement. Lincoln’s V6s fit better into this paradigm. Lincoln also isn’t marketing itself anywhere as the car for the demanding driver. The “theory,” so to speak, that supports the brand is about comfort, ease, and service — all values that Chinese buyers are looking for. Galhotra is always quick to point out that Lincoln’s customers have little to no interest in the technical specifications that thrill the gearhead readers of Motor Trend. For them, “performance” isn’t measured in 0-60 mph but rather in how smooth and powerful a car feels when accelerating up an on-ramp. And luxury isn’t necessarily measured in how glitzy their car is but rather in how the vehicle envelops driver and passengers and creates a respite from the stresses of everyday life. (Lincoln is playing catch-up in China.Ford) China is a Bizarro World for Western luxury brands in several other respects. For starters, the German carmakers — Mercedes, BMW, Audi — are considered the choice of older people and dreary business types. They’re cursed by decades of success in the luxury realm and serve as brands for younger Chinese buyers to react against. “Mercedes, BMW, even Audi, skew more towards businessmen,” a 26-year-old Chinese buyer, Ge Di, told Reuters in 2016. “The comfort level is a bit higher, but as a young person I care more about performance and design.” So if the luxury market is extremely codified and hierarchical in the US, with Mercedes, BMW, and Toyota’s Lexus at the top, Audi knocking at the door, and everyone else fighting for share in the tiers below, the Chinese luxury market is far more fluid and subject to the changing tastes of a younger population that wants to define itself against expectations. This all serves to give Lincoln plenty of hope in its newest competitive forum. You could easily say that Lincoln’s revival is undergirded by the considerations of the Chinese luxury market first and foremost. Not that it will be easy. Auto sales in China topped 21 million vehicles in 2015, but according to Bloomberg, only about 2 million of those sales are luxury cars and SUVs, versus 12% in the US. Most of the Chinese luxury market in 2016 was divvied up among the Germans, with Audi, BMW, and Mercedes accounting for 75% of annual sales, based on research from Bloomberg Intelligence. Cadillac and Volvo had a combined 4%, and Lincoln was beginning its ascent with a meager 1%. Of course it could be worse. Lincoln could have zero. Will it work? The story of Lincoln is one of the best to emerge in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It has everything: a rich and varied history, a certain amount of Frank and Dino cool mixed with a whiff of sexy Kennedy-era dissoluteness, a near-death experience, a tentative recovery that at first looked unpromising but that took off with the unexpected McConaughey commercials, and finally the suave, low-key sales pitch, a relaxing of muscles when everyone else is flexing. (Lincoln's new customer experience center in California.Lincoln) Ford has abundant confidence that this will work, but Lincoln has more than a mountain to climb. The luxury market in the US is crowded, and even though Lincoln has made admirable progress in reversing its fortunes, most consumers don’t consider it a true contemporary luxury brand, in the vein on its German and Japanese rivals. Lincoln benefits from nostalgia from a time in America before BMW and Mercedes arrived in force, when cars from Germany were considered “imports” and the Japanese hadn’t yet shown up with their small, plucky, fuel-efficient vehicles. Here and there, you had the odd Italian roadster and few Jaguars, Triumphs, MGs, and Aston Martins. Otherwise, as far as the eye could see, it was American iron laying claim to the new interstate highways and the fresh driveways of burgeoning suburban enclaves. A cupholder in 1965 was that space between your legs. More important were the Lincoln Continental’s legion of ashtrays. So the circle that Galhotra and Fields are struggling to square implies a daunting balancing act: preserve that peculiar Lincoln mystique without allowing the brand to be a throwback. The effort comes through every time Lincoln shows a new vehicle. The interior of the Navigator concept that landed in Detroit may resemble something from the sixties, but Lincoln’s designers and executives don’t want to hear you make that observation. They would prefer that the legacy of the brand be as quiet as its take on luxury. So far, so good It’s a fair bet that they’ll succeed. Having seen many leaders of automotive divisions at American car companies over the years, I’d be hard pressed to conjure up someone as ideally suited to his role as Galhotra. He sets a highly cosmopolitan tone for the brand, sacrificing just enough of the traditional car-guy vibe to win over the large number of buyers who find car guys exhausting, with their endless enthusing over the specs and stats and macho aspects of driving. Performance matters more in the luxury market, but not that much more. Galhotra's emphasis is on the Gestalt of his cars and trucks, they way they anticipate owner needs and create a welcoming and calming environment. The man is, by the way, an engineer’s engineer, so he can talk cylinder displacement and compression ratios and torque bands with the best of them. But in an echo of Cary Grant’s definition of a gentleman as someone who could play the bagpipes, but declined, Galhotra can do all that but chooses not to. The big question, of course, is whether Lincoln can achieve the most difficult feat in the auto industry: “conquesting” the loyal customers of less retro brands. As lovely as the Continental is, it doesn’t have an owner base (unless you count the hipsters who are still maintaining a vintage example). Lincoln is starting from scratch, pitching the big sedan at customers who might lean reflexively in the direction of Lexus. By early 2016, the process was moving along nicely. Lincoln’s sales were advancing at an impressive double-digit pace, propelled by the crossovers in the portfolio — the right cars at the right time. The executive team was clearly clicking, and Mark Fields took the occasion of the New York Auto Show to unleash a C-suite Lincoln-palooza, making the brand and its revival one of his central talking points, alongside Ford’s other major initiative, the transformation of the company from a maker of cars to a provider of mobility in all its forms. By the time the New York show rolled around in March 2016, Ford had become an automaker standing on four pillars. The core brand, symbolized by the full-size pickups and Mustang, was strong, a vindication of Mulally’s vision. Ford’s new performance division was taking its GT supercar racing, making sure that the halo car was proving itself on the track. (It would make history with an epic win in its class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, a near-repeat of Ford's legendary 1-2-3 victory in 1966.) A host of transformational programs were also being inculcated, and Ford would boast in early 2016 of having the largest fleet of self-driving cars under testing in the industry. Finally, Lincoln was back in the game. As much as the recovery of the core Ford brand had shown that Mulally was a magician, the Lincoln comeback indicated that Fields could make calls that were risky but right. Perhaps the most important aspect of this complete reinvigoration of Ford and its brands was that the company could shift its rhetoric from that of a slightly shell-shocked but foresighted survivor to that of a proud automaker with more than a century of history under its belt. In 2009 Ford was suffering from being an American company; by 2016 it relished that title. (Lincoln had crossover SUVs to sell at exactly the right time.Bill Pugliano/Getty IMages) Timing is everything, and luck matters Fields also knew that some of the unlikely success that Lincoln was experiencing could be chalked up to timing and luck. When the call was made to keep the brand alive, no one could have foreseen that gas prices would plummet in 2015, boosting the balance sheets of any automaker that had SUVs and crossover to sell. When the first McConaughey ads hit, their druggy, meandering meditations and improvised art-film quality made sense, as a daring bet to kick-start the brand. Once their impact was felt, however, the marketing plan became more conservative. The moodiness was out, and there would be no more seemingly random encounters with wandering bulls on vacant Texas roads, as there had been with the first batch. Later spots that aired in 2015 concentrated on their vehicles and normalized the character McConaughey was playing. He didn’t just drive around aimlessly as a freestyle stoner-philosopher, a spacey specialist in the craft of unearthing deep thoughts that had a sideways relationship to Lincoln and its comeback. Instead, he got dressed for a late-night poker game or took his dogs out for sushi, or found sunwashed vistas in Los Angeles to scrutinize. Some of the evocative danger, the threat that can attach to empty Western landscapes, slipped away, replaced of necessity by a more straightforward sales pitch. In the end, however, the improved sales number and the respectable progress in China spoke for themselves. It could have been that Lincoln had located a sort of inadvertent sweet spot, a lacuna in the luxury market in the US that needed to be filled and an opportunity beckoning in China to introduce a fresh new brand with an identity that differed meaningfully from everyone else. The demographics are in Lincoln’s favor. The biggest challenge for a near-luxury brand, especially one suffering from the lingering hangover of its glory days in the mid-'60s, bigger than taking on the mighty Germans, bigger than overcoming a once-in-a-generation financial crisis, is finding younger customers. Long term, the amusing old observation goes, we’re all dead. This is fine for a brand if your customers are replaced as loyalists head for their final reward. But for Lincoln, the customer base had by the 2000s shifted to a familiar place for big American cars: They were aging fast. By the mid-2010s, however, Lincoln had improved that — dramatically. “Our fastest-growing group is 25 to 44,” Galhotra told me. He chalked this up to an important practical lifestyle change for younger buyers: “They just need more space.” After years of dire prognostications in and around the auto industry about millennials not buying cars — because they had no job, no credit, no families — it now appears that the youngest Americans, as soon as they have any economic power, are taking the car-buying plunge. Typical factors are driving this: They have access to better jobs and an improved credit outlook. As their financial picture improves they are getting busy with family formation and an inevitable move from crowded cities to roomier suburbs. And finally they are showing a rising enthusiasm for car culture. Ford, always a carmaker with a youthful streak – the Mustang was created explicitly for the young people of the '60s — is positioning itself to grab these buyers. And Lincoln is positioning itself to nab them if they think they need a bit more luxury than what the Ford marque has on offer, especially when it comes to crossovers and SUVs. It’s working better that anyone could have expected. By the 2016, Galhotra looked as though he'd hit his stride. And Lincoln, for the first time since the late '90s, looked like it was ready to run.

Photo: AP CHICAGO — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight on a runway at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. Another video pic.twitter.com/jg58N8x3l8 — Jose Castillo 🎃 (@Kryptonlogic) October 28, 2016 “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. “People are yelling, ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door.” Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time … and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It’s mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it’s like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles.

Boeing has been awarded a patent for a tilt rotor Vertical TakeOff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft capable of carrying up to 100 passengers. By combining vertical lift and hover capacity of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional airplane, it could one day turn small airports into passenger hubs. Boeing has had considerable experience with military VTOL aircraft, like the V-22 Osprey and its derivatives, but current tilt-rotor aircraft aren't suitable for civilian use and the few attempts, including the AugustWestland BA609, can only handle six to nine passengers. Part of the problem is the military tilt rotors include many features that make them impractical for civilian use. A quick glance at the V-22 shows where these problems lie. The Osprey and similar aircraft have a high-wing configuration that requires the aircraft to have a heavier construction with extra reinforcements to not only support the engines, but to protect the fuselage from being crushed in the event of a crash. Conventional tilt-rotors, such as the V-22 Osprey are not practical for civilian passenger use(Credit: US Navy) This configuration also makes maintenance and fueling more difficult, and it has safety issues because the plane cannot float in the event of a water landing. In addition, the undercarriage must be installed in the fuselage because the wings are too high for the wheels, and the wings can't be used to store fuel because of the danger of leakage into the fuselage and cabin. And then there's the problem of airports being built for low-winged craft, so taxiing, loading, and unloading aren't easy. Another problem is the engine mounting. Most tilt rotors have two engines – one in each wingtip nacelle right behind the rotors. These may be combined to share the lifting load through a drive shaft, but for safety reasons, each engine must be 50 percent larger than needed in case the other engine fails. If the engines aren't interconnected, they need to be even larger. This means the need for even stronger wing supports with heavier reinforcements to hold the larger engines. According to the patent, Boeing is looking at something more along the lines of a 100 passenger regional aircraft. In the description, the Boeing passenger tilt rotor has low wings set toward the bottom of the fuselage as in a conventional airplane, doesn't need special crash reinforcement, and can float in a water landing. In addition, it can carry fuel in wing tanks, can operate from conventional airfields, and can be equipped with mid-cabin exits without elaborate slides. One way in which Boeing aims to achieve this is by moving the engines away from the rotor nacelles at the tips of the wings to the middle of the wing. This way, each rotor can be powered by two or more engines through a common gearbox in various configurations. This means the individual engines can be less powerful and more compact, yet in combination can provide the necessary power for flight even is one should fail. In addition, the engines are fixed, which simplifies many of the systems and the weight of the wings, as well as improving ground clearance and payload capacity. Also, the wings can be configured so that their power trains are completely independent of one another. Since this is just a patent, there's no indication that this aircraft or any variant is slated for production, but if it were, it could act as a regional passenger aircraft capable of operating from small airfields, city airports that normally couldn't handle such a large passenger craft, and even remote heliports.

The injuries were 'non-critical' and those injured were shifted to Chicago-area hospitals for further evaluation, the American Airlines said in a statement on the company website. Pilots aborted take-off after the right-side engine of the Boeing-767 American Airlines Flight 383 caught fire on the runway, which the airline company attributed to an engine-related issue. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration blamed the problem on a blown tire.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. (CNN) A FedEx cargo plane caught fire on the runway at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Friday afternoon, causing the airport to shut down for several hours, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Video shot by an onlooker at the airport showed a fireball exploding out of the damaged aircraft and recorded the startled cries of people watching. The pilot and copilot escaped harm using a rope ladder on the right side of the aircraft, according to Mike Jachles of Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue. No members of the ground crews were hurt, he added. The fire occurred after the plane's landing gear collapsed as it touched ground, the FAA said. The Boeing MD-10 was operating as Flight 910 from Memphis, Tennessee, where FedEx is based. Most of the fire damage occurred on the plane's exterior near the left wing and engine, Jachles said. The interior of the plane appeared to be undamaged The plane was carrying FedEx shipments and US Mail, he said. FedEx Services Senior Communications Specialist Davina Cole said the company was cooperating with authorities. Boeing has not yet responded to a request for comment. The Florida airport's south runway reopened for air traffic at 7 p.m., according to the airport's Twitter account. The north runway remains closed while the investigation of the FedEx plane fire continues. The accident came hours after an American Airlines Boeing 767 was forced to abort its takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport because of an engine-related malfunction.

(Bill Montgomery, AP) Multimedia   ·   User Galleries   ·   News in Pictures Send us your pictures  ·  Send us your stories What To Read Next {{item.title}} Related Links Fake Germanwings victim relative convicted in Germany Five dead in French reconnaissance plane crash 4 dead, including 2 children, in China air show crash Chicago — Pilots were forced to abort a take-off and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight on Friday on a runway at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn't authorised to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted take-off. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." Video of incident Involving an American Airlines flight at Chicago O'Hare ? pic.twitter.com/k51a0kJ9Jc— Flight Alerts ? (@FlightAlerts777) October 28, 2016 Mechanical issue The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the take-off, according to American Airlines spokesperson Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 14:35 after experiencing a problem during take-off. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. In this photo provided by passenger Jose Castillo, fellow passengers walk away from a burning American Airlines jet that aborted takeoff and caught fire on the runway at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. ( Jose Castillo via AP) Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren't replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Blades ‘like firing a bullet’ Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during take-offs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13 000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it's like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year, the plane had flown more than 47 000 hours and made more than 7 500 cycles — each take-off and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100 000 hours and 18 000 cycles.  Read more on:    american airlines  |  us  |  airplanes Join the conversation! 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Three sources familiar with the unfolding investigation told CNN the General Electric engine suffered an apparent "uncontained" failure. The 161 terrified passengers and nine crew members scrambled to safety Friday afternoon after huge flames erupted on the right side of the plane. Airport fire Chief Timothy Sampey said crews responded to a report of a No. 2 engine on fire. The plane, which had stopped well before the end of the runway, had about 43,000 pounds of fuel. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later," he said. Read More About 20 people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries that occurred during the evacuation down the emergency slides, District Chief Juan Hernandez said. There were people with minor bruising or injured ankles, he said. None of the injuries were caused by the fire. Another video pic.twitter.com/jg58N8x3l8— Jose Castillo 🎃 (@Kryptonlogic) October 28, 2016 American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott said Flight 383 was bound for Miami when it aborted takeoff due to an engine-related issue. The rare, but extremely serious, engine failure sent debris from the engine spewing across the south side of the expansive airfield. Part of the engine's fan disc were found a half mile away on a building used by UPS, two sources said. A passenger who was sitting in the middle of row 31 said he heard a loud clunk, then saw a large ball of flame that he assumed came from the engine area. Gary Schiavone of DeMotte, Indiana, said the captain was able to stop the aircraft quickly, and then it was "coordinated chaos." There wasn't much yelling or screaming, he told reporters, except passengers who shouted at others who were trying to grab their bags from the overhead bins. Schiavone said about 30 seconds into the evacuation, smoke started to pour into the cabin. The difficulty in breathing was the scariest part, he said. Asked whether he was afraid he was going to die, Schiavone said, "Of course. I'm thinking the plane is going to blow up." Schiavone complimented the crew for getting everyone out in what he estimated was about a minute. Video tweeted by a witness on the ground showed an airliner with a large tower of smoke rising from the right side and flames billowing beneath the fuselage. The video showed passengers coming down two of the emergency slides on the 767's left side. A dog also evacuated, officials said. Josiah Ryan, senior producer for Social TV at CNN, was aboard a flight landing at O'Hare. Shortly after their American Airlines flight landed, their captain told passengers over the loudspeaker, "We're near our gate, but there has been an accident on one of the runways." Ryan said he saw emergency vehicles rush to the runway. Four of the airport's runways were closed still late afternoon Friday, but that was not affecting airport operations, said Ginger Evans, the commissioner of the Chicago Department of Aviation.

More than a dozen emergency vehicles surrounded the jet for hours. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. Other Boeing jets have been involved in runway incidents in the past 13 months. A Boeing 777 taxiing for takeoff at Las Vegas International Airport in September 2015 aborted its takeoff roll to London when one of its two engines failed. The following month, passengers aboard a Dynamic Airways 767-200 were forced to evacuate because of a fuel leak that caused a fire while the aircraft was taxiing in Fort Lauderdale. Both incidents are still under investigation by the NTSB. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Braden Walker contributed to this report. Content by LendingTree Rates hit 2.75% APR (15 yr).

(Reuters photo) 6/50 - + CHICAGO - The engine of an American Airlines Group Inc jet caught fire seconds from takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday, prompting the crew to abort its departure and evacuate passengers via emergency chutes, authorities said. No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred hours before an unrelated mishap in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the landing gear of a FedEx Corp cargo plane collapsed on touchdown, sparking a fire that was quickly extinguished. The company later said the FedEx pilots were safe. American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing Co 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down an O'Hare runway at about 2.30pm CDT (2.30am Sunday Bangkok time) when the right-side engine of the twin-engine jet burst into flames, authorities said. Footage from Chicago's ABC News affiliate station, WLS-TV, showed the idled plane on the ground with flames and large clouds of black smoke billowing from its right side and emergency slides deployed on the left side. Passengers milled about watching the blaze as fire trucks pumped water on the flames. Chicago Fire Department assistant deputy fire commissioner Timothy Sampey holds a news conference about an American Airlines jet that caught fire at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, on Friday. (Reuters photo) Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner, said the mishap could have been much worse. The plane was fully loaded with 19,504 kilogrammes of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Mr Sampey told a news conference later. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing," he said. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later." Mr Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. The plane's CF6 engine, the "workhorse" of the commercial aviation industry, was built by General Electric Co, and GE dispatched investigators to the scene, the company said. The Federal Aviation Administration initially said the pilot aborted takeoff after reporting a blown-out tire. But city fire spokesman Larry Langford said he saw no blown tires at the scene. Mr Langford said 19 passengers and one flight attendant were taken to a hospital with minor injuries -- such as bumps, bruises and sprained ankles -- suffered in exiting the plane. There were no burns or cases of smoke inhalation. "The fire never got into the cabin," he said. "This happened so close to one of the airport fire stations that they were on it in a minute." He said the plane was 15 to 20 seconds away from being airborne when the fire erupted. Inside the aircraft after it came to a stop, frantic passengers shouted at each other to hurry while making their way down the aisle to an emergency exit slide, as seen in a video posted on Facebook by passenger Hector Gustavo Cardenas. The incident forced the closure of at least three of the airport's eight runways, the city Aviation Department said. By about two hours after the incident, the airport had experienced 130 delays of departing flights and 170 inbound flights, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. The Fort Lauderdale airport said 29 flights were diverted due to the FedEx plane incident, but the facility was later reopened to air traffic. As the Chicago mishap unfolded, O'Hare's tower controllers began ordering inbound planes to abort landing approaches and "go around," initially closing all runways so emergency vehicles could reach the stricken aircraft, according to audio recordings of the main tower frequency posted by the website liveatc.net. Operations later resumed on the north side of O'Hare airport, one of the world's busiest, according to web tracking sites and a live feed of tower conversations from liveatc.net.

American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an “uncontained engine failure,” in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured while evacuating the plane. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. “People are yelling: ‘Open the door! Open the door!’ Everyone’s screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door,” Ahmed said. “Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it’s melting the windows.” The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American confirmed that figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami on Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked in, and worn parts that aren’t replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don’t necessarily doom a plane even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. “Planes are meant to fly with one engine,” said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. “We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time … and then still successfully take off and land.” One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989 when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken “very seriously” in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It is mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. “It’s something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully,” said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it is like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday’s incident was built in 2003 and is among American’s youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles of takeoff and landing. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles.

Pictured: Smoke emanating from the American Airlines flightReuters An American Airlines plane caught fire at the O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Friday right before take-off. Although the pilot aborted the take-off immediately, at least 20 passengers are said to have sustained injuries as they were evacuated through the emergency chute. There were no serious injuries. The incident occurred at around 2:30am CDT on the American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing B767, which was scheduled to head to Miami, Elizabeth Cory, the spokesperson for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), said.

However, American Airlines in a statement said that the take-off of the flight was aborted "due to an engine-related mechanical issue." The airline said that there were around 161 passengers on board at the time of the incident and a crew of nine members. The Chicago department of aviation also issued a statement saying that the city fire department immediately attended the aircraft fire to douse the flames and that all the passengers were off the plane. The department also added that the fire did not occur because of a crash. The assistant deputy fire commissioner, Timothy Sampey, said in a press conference that the mishap could have been much worse considering the plane was fully loaded with 19,504 kg of jet fuel, which was leaking when the fire officials reached the plane. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing. This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later," Sampey said. He also confirmed that the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. City fire spokesperson Larry Langford said that he did not find any blown tyres at the scene of the incident. "The fire never got into the cabin.This happened so close to one of the airport fire stations that they were on it in a minute," Langford added. He also said that the plane was just 15  seconds away from take-off when the incident occurred.   Post Comment IBT TV Close Anti-Trump protester floored whilst speaking at Ohio rally Why advertise with us?

CHICAGO — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight Friday on a runway at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren't replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane <0x2014> even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it's like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles - each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles.

REUTERS/Jim Young 5/5 By Timothy Mclaughlin | CHICAGO CHICAGO The engine of an American Airlines Group Inc jet caught fire seconds from takeoff at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday, prompting the crew to abort its departure and evacuate passengers via emergency chutes, authorities said. No serious injuries were reported in the incident, which occurred hours before an unrelated mishap in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the landing gear of a FedEx Corp cargo plane collapsed on touchdown, sparking a fire that was quickly extinguished. The company later said the FedEx pilots were safe. American Airlines Flight 383, a Boeing Co 767 bound for Miami with 161 passengers and a crew of nine, was headed down an O'Hare runway at about 2:30 p.m. CDT (1930 GMT) when the right-side engine of the twin-engine jet burst into flames, authorities said. Footage from Chicago's ABC News affiliate station, WLS-TV, showed the idled plane on the ground with flames and large clouds of black smoke billowing from its right side and emergency slides deployed on the left side. Passengers milled about watching the blaze as fire trucks pumped water on the flames. Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner, said the mishap could have been much worse. The plane was fully loaded with 43,000 lbs (19,504 kg) of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Sampey told a news conference later. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing," he said. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later." Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the right-side engine. The plane's CF6 engine, the "workhorse" of the commercial aviation industry, was built by General Electric Co, and GE dispatched investigators to the scene, the company said. The Federal Aviation Administration initially said the pilot aborted takeoff after reporting a blown-out tyre. But city fire spokesman Larry Langford said he saw no blown tires at the scene. Langford said 19 passengers and one flight attendant were taken to a hospital with minor injuries - such as bumps, bruises and sprained ankles - suffered in exiting the plane. There were no burns or cases of smoke inhalation. "The fire never got into the cabin," he said. "This happened so close to one of the airport fire stations that they were on it in a minute." He said the plane was 15 to 20 seconds away from being airborne when the fire erupted. Inside the aircraft after it came to a stop, frantic passengers shouted at each other to hurry while making their way down the aisle to an emergency exit slide, as seen in a video posted on Facebook by passenger Hector Gustavo Cardenas. The incident forced the closure of at least three of the airport's eight runways, the city Aviation Department said. By about two hours after the incident, the airport had experienced 130 delays of departing flights and 170 inbound flights, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. The Fort Lauderdale airport said 29 flights were diverted due to the FedEx plane incident, but the facility was later reopened to air traffic. As the Chicago mishap unfolded, O'Hare's tower controllers began ordering inbound planes to abort landing approaches and “go around,” initially closing all runways so emergency vehicles could reach the stricken aircraft, according to audio recordings of the main tower frequency posted by the website liveatc.net. Operations later resumed on the north side of O'Hare airport, one of the world’s busiest, according to web tracking sites and a live feed of tower conversations from liveatc.net.

All 161 passengers and nine crew members were evacuated from the airplane. American Airlines Flight 383 was departing Chicago for Miami on Friday afternoon when an engine caught fire, prompting the crew to abort the takeoff and evacuate passengers via emergency chutes, authorities said.  Television images showed a large plume of black smoke coming from the Boeing which appeared to be damaged at the rear. The evacuation chutes extended from the plane. "There was substantial fire on the starboard [right] side of the aircraft," said Timothy Sampey, assistant deputy fire commissioner for airport operations. The plane was fully loaded with 43,000 pounds (19,504 kilograms) of jet fuel, which was leaking when fire crews reached the jet, Sampey told a news conference later. "So they had a heavy volume of fire on both the engine and the entire wing," he said. "This could have been absolutely devastating if it happened later." Sampey confirmed the incident began with a fire in the left-side engine. There was no immediate explanation for the cause of the leak. The FAA said it was investigating the incident, and the National Transportation Safety Board had been notified. Minor injuries "We transported about 20 patients with minor injuries to several hospitals," Juan Hernandez of the Chicago Fire Department told a news conference. Seven passengers and one flight attendant were injured and taken to hospitals, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The flight aborted takeoff due to an "engine-related mechanical issue," Scott confirmed. "We are taking care of our customers and crew and are re-accommodating our passengers on another flight to Miami this evening," American Airlines said in a statement. At least three of the airport's eight runways were closed, and more than 300 flights in and out of the airport were delayed in the two hours after the fire. Normal operations have since resumed. FedEx Cargo Boeing catches fire   In a separate incident on Friday afternoon, a FedEx cargo plane caught fire on the runway at Fort Lauderdale Hollywood Airport, on the coast north of Miami in Florida. It caused the airport to shut down for several hours. The south runway reopened to air traffic on Friday evening.  The pilot and copilot escaped from the aircraft using a rope ladder. No members of the ground crew were hurt. Most of the fire damage was near the left wing and engine, according to Mike Jachles of Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue.  FedEx Services spokeswoman Davina Cole said the company was cooperating with authorities. jm/cmk (AP, AFP) DW recommends Pilot dies mid-flight on US airliner An American Airlines jet has made an emergency landing after the captain fell ill and died.

Official: Plane in Chicago had 'uncontained engine failure' Associated Press | CHICAGO (AP) — Pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight Friday on a runway at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after the airliner experienced what a federal official said was a rare and serious type of engine failure. American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine, the official said. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the incident and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The danger of such a failure is that engine pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side of the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway after the aborted takeoff. Officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the plane and the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire, but officials later deleted that information from the statement. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures are unusual thanks to improvements in designs and the metallurgy. There are many possible causes, including overheating, runway debris or large birds that get sucked into the engine or parts that break when they wear out but aren't replaced during maintenance checks. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines report the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. Engines are especially vulnerable to overheating that can cause parts to fail during takeoffs when they are already operating at very high temperatures, said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and expert on aircraft maintenance. The giant blades inside the engines are revolving at about 13,000 rpm, he said. When one comes loose, it's like firing a bullet, he said. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. ___ Lowy reported from Washington, D.C.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Plane in Chicago had 'uncontained engine failure' on takeoff Friday Oct 28, 2016 at 3:17 PM Oct 28, 2016 at 7:46 PM HERBERT G. McCANN, Associated PressJOAN LOWY, Associated Press CHICAGO (AP) — A federal official pointed to a rare and serious engine malfunction after pilots were forced to abort a takeoff and evacuate passengers from a burning American Airlines flight Friday on a runway at ChicagoO'Hare International Airport. The official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation, said American Airlines Flight 383 to Miami experienced an "uncontained engine failure," in which engine parts break off and are spewed outside the engine. The danger of such a failure is that pieces effectively become shrapnel and can cause extensive damage to the aircraft. Flames and heavy black smoke poured from the side the Boeing 767 jet as it sat on the runway Friday afternoon, and officials said the incident left 21 people injured. Footage from the scene showed passengers coming down emergency slides and hurrying across grass next to the runway as emergency vehicles surrounded the plane. The right wing was drooping toward the ground and appeared to have partially melted. Passenger Sarah Ahmed told WLS-TV the plane was speeding down the runway when she heard an explosion and saw flames and black smoke. She said everyone on the right side of the aircraft jumped from their seats and moved to the left side. "People are yelling, 'Open the door! Open the door!' Everyone's screaming and jumping on top of each other to open the door," Ahmed said. "Within that time, I think it was seven seconds, there was now smoke in the planeand the fire is right up against the windows, and it's melting the windows." The pilots reported an engine-related mechanical issue and aborted the takeoff, according to American Airlines spokeswoman Leslie Scott. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the plane made an emergency stop around 2:35 p.m. after experiencing a problem during takeoff. An earlier FAA statement said the plane had blown a tire. Chicago Deputy Fire Commissioner Timothy Sampey said 20 passengers suffered minor injuries as they used the emergency chutes to evacuate. American, which had earlier said eight people were injured, later confirmed the 20 figure and added that one flight attendant was also injured. Buses were sent to pick up the passengers and bring them back to the terminal, Scott said. The passengers were to be placed on another flight to Miami Friday evening. The National Transportation Safety Board will conduct an investigation into the incident, with investigators expected to arrive on the scene Friday evening, spokesman Keith Holloway said. Uncontained engine failures, which the official cited as the cause of Friday's incident, are rare these days due to improvements in design and the metallurgy. They usually are caused by engines sucking in objects like runway debris or a bird, or maintenance crews failing to replace parts that wear out. Tom Walsh, an airline pilot who also works as a security consultant, said that engines that break apart can be especially serious if the parts end up cutting fuel lines or damaging other vital components of the aircraft. But he said even such catastrophic failures don't necessarily doom a plane — even if a pilot runs out of runway and must take off. "Planes are meant to fly with one engine," said Walsh, who has also flown Boeing 767s. "We are trained so that we can lose the engine at the worst possible time ... and then still successfully take off and land." One of the best-known incidents of uncontained engine failure occurred in 1989, when 111 people were killed when a United Air Lines DC-10 crashed while making an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa. There were 185 survivors. Such engine failures are taken "very seriously" in the aviation industry, said John Cox, a former airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. It's mandatory that airlines reports the failures to the NTSB, he said. "It's something everyone in aviation safety tracks very carefully," said Cox, president of Safety Operating Systems. The aircraft involved in Friday's incident was built in 2003 and is among American's youngest planes of that model. According to data from FlightGlobal, an aviation news and industry data company, at the start of this year the plane had flown more than 47,000 hours and made more than 7,500 cycles — each takeoff and landing is one cycle. American is flying 767 aircraft that have more than 100,000 hours and 18,000 cycles. ___ Lowy reported from Washington, D.C.

Welcome back to America...yikes!! #fll #cnnireport A video posted by Jacob Barnes (@jpaulbarnes) on Oct 28, 2016 at 3:05pm PDT Video shot by an onlooker at the airport showed a fireball exploding out of the damaged aircraft and recorded the startled cries of people watching. The pilot and copilot escaped harm using a rope ladder on the right side of the aircraft, according to Mike Jachles of Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue. No members of the ground crews were hurt, he added. The fire occurred after the plane's landing gear collapsed as it touched ground, the FAA said. The Boeing MD-10 was operating as Flight 910 from Memphis, Tennessee, where FedEx is based. Most of the fire damage occurred on the plane's exterior near the left wing and engine, Jachles said.

Tribune Photo/BECKY MALEWITZ SOUTH BEND — Honeywell Aerospace and the United Auto Workers Local 9 have been in a war of wills for the past six months, each side waiting for the other to blink. But one side has an advantage in this standoff: While Honeywell is a multibillion-dollar company and continues to operate during the lockout, 317 union members locked out of the company's South Bend plant are watching their hard-earned savings bleed away. Entering the fifth round of negotiations this week, union members know they might never recoup $22,000 in wages that the average full-time worker has lost since the lockout began on May 9. But they remain united in an effort to preserve a health insurance package and other benefits that are on the chopping block in Honeywell's five-year contract offer. Many call it a "union-busting" offer, contending it would strip benefits the union has fought for decades to protect. And Honeywell, which is using temporary workers to run the plant on the city's west side, says it needs to trim health benefits to put them in line with what other company employees receive, especially as the aerospace industry is facing challenges that have resulted in sliding sales, profits and layoffs. 'Never felt so defeated' The lockout was triggered when union members voted by a 9-to-1 margin to reject Honeywell's five-year contract offer in early May, after the previous five-year contract expired. The typical worker's $22,000 in lost pay is based on an average wage of $22 an hour, which is $45,760 a year. And that doesn’t account for lost benefits and pay from overtime hours that workers often put in at the plant, where airplane brakes and wheels are made. The past half-year has been a struggle for union members, who won't return to work until they approve a new contract with a majority vote. Many have collected unemployment insurance during the lockout, but that peaks at $390 per week and will expire in November. Others have taken temporary jobs to make ends meet, and some have even sold their cars and homes. Union member Stephanie Blakely, a single mother who's worked nine years at the plant, said in an email that her family is “on the verge of being homeless" and blamed the "greedy and cruel" company. “I’ve never felt so defeated in my life," she said. “There’s no worse feeling than not being able to provide for your children." The plant is still operating with about 460 salaried employees, along with 300 temporary workers from Strom Engineering, a Minnesota firm that supplies staff for strikes and lockouts nationwide. ‘Getting close to that point’ From a strictly financial standpoint, do workers think they’ve already lost more than they could gain from benefits at stake in contract talks? “Not yet, but I think we’re getting close to that point,” said Robert Beduhn, who was among a handful of workers at a picket post outside the plant on a weekday in late October. To continue receiving union benefits, workers are required to staff posts for a total of eight hours per week or to fulfill other duties. Beduhn, 58, said he still thinks the union could make up the $22,000 in lost wages by retaining a portion of the health benefits that Honeywell wants to cut. Even so, he said the lockout is about more than dollars and cents. “It’s a matter of principle almost at this point,” Beduhn said. “We can’t keep continuing to give up our right to steady employment and job security over and over, contract after contract.” The union’s main objection is with the health care proposal, which would increase insurance costs and allow Honeywell to make changes without union approval at any time. Honeywell says it’s offering the same benefits available to most of its employees — union and nonunion — in the United States. "It's an increase compared to what they're used to, but for the last five years they haven't gone through health care increases that everyone else has," Honeywell spokesman Scott Sayres said. Cost breakdown Under the proposal, union employees would enroll in a new health plan and begin next year to get the same insurance as nonunion employees. Many employees have family insurance plans. Compared to the old contract, the weekly premium for such a plan would increase in 2017 by 68 percent to $114.80 from $68.34. Over five years, that's an increase of about $12,000 — and it doesn’t account for deductibles or co-payments. Premiums would jump again in 2018, but Honeywell hasn't said by how much. Members are also concerned about the annual out-of-pocket maximum cost. That is the maximum amount paid in deductibles and co-payments — but not premiums — before the plan covers all expenses. In 2017, that cost would more than double for plans under the proposal. And members are worried about higher deductibles that would need to be paid before co-insurance kicks in. Deductibles would more than quadruple in 2017. In 2018, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums would increase even more. How much is at stake? Compared to the old contract, The Tribune estimates that a worker on a family plan could pay up to about $55,000 more in health-care costs over the five-year proposal. John Hamilton, 57, who has Type 2 diabetes, said he fears his health insurance costs would skyrocket under the proposal. “I use one drug that would be $3,000 a month if I had to pay for it. That’s out of my pocket the first month before they pay a dime,” he said. Though Hamilton said the lockout has been a struggle, he hopes the union membership won’t approve a contract that sacrifices a lot of benefits. "To be truthful, I think their strategy is working because you have a lot of members who are really hurting and suffering. They would vote to go back to work," he said. Workers also have other concerns about the contract offer. Among other things, it calls for removing paid absence allowance days to curb absenteeism, and freezing contributions to a long-standing “legacy” pension plan. Sayres, of Honeywell, said the company's offer comes as "the global aviation industry has lost nearly 35,000 jobs" in the past year. Sales and profits for Honeywell's Aerospace segment are down and a pair of the company's major customers — Boeing and Bombardier — have recently announced layoffs. Union members would get an 8 percent raise over five years under the proposal — except for those hired before 2006, who would receive lump-sum payments totaling $3,000. Sayres said the average total compensation of a union employee, including benefits and overtime, is more than $80,000. ‘Tail between their legs’ Local 9 officials have encouraged workers to maintain solidarity until a fair contract is negotiated. “We continue this fight to keep good-paying jobs with decent benefits,” said Bryan Rodgers, the union’s recording secretary. Though progress was made when the two parties met in October, “there are still a number of items that need to be addressed, and hopefully that happens in November.” Rallies outside the plant have been held to keep union members motivated. One of the speakers at a community rally in October was Daniel Graff, director of the Higgins Labor Program at the University of Notre Dame. Graff said lockouts often are used as a tool by corporations such as Honeywell to break the will of unions. Roughly 150 members of the United Steelworkers were locked out of a Honeywell plant that processes uranium in Metropolis, Ill., for eight months before ratifying a contract in March 2015. Workers at the South Bend plant, meanwhile, aren’t the only ones affected by the lockout. Forty-one UAW members at a Honeywell plant in Green Island, N.Y., also have been locked out because the union operates under the same master agreement as the one in South Bend. "I think union-busting is the right term," Graff said of the lockout. "They can't break the union and eliminate the bargaining relationship through a lockout, but they want to weaken the union so that it might result in things like electing new leaders who are much more pliable. … It's an attempt to bleed out the workers until they come back with the tail between their legs."

Transatlantic flights operated by Norwegian Air, Iceland's Wow air, Canada's WestJet and Morocco's Royal Air Maroc have multiplied in recent years as jet fuel has grown cheaper. Frequently offering fares less than half that of major airlines, low-cost carriers have quickly attracted travelers. Traditional players have seen their collective market share decline, dropping from 75 percent in the summer of 2014 to 72 percent this summer, according to the air travel data company OAG. While low-cost carriers remain small players, larger airlines "are looking over their shoulders," said George Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. "They could be a growing threat as they add more seats," he told AFP. "Currently, if you look at the percentage of seats they have compared to major airlines, it's very small." - Half-price flights - Booked in advance, a round-trip flight between London and New York currently runs an average of $398 on the low-cost carriers, according to Hobica, compared to more than $600 with the major airlines. WestJet even has flights linking Canada and London at $149 (CAN$199). Even with other costs added in, such charges for meals, luggage and headphones, passengers can get a good deal, according to Hobica. Aware of the threat, the larger companies have not wasted time, offering cheaper seats, more direct flights and new connections. British Airways recently began serving a route between London and San Jose, California. Delta Air Lines, United and American, the three largest U.S. companies, recently said they saw a drop in transatlantic traffic due to Britain's vote to quit the eurozone, terrorist attacks in Europe and overcapacity. Revenues could fall as a result. Transatlantic flights have long been the preserve of major airlines, protected by the Open Skies agreements between the United States and Europe. The agreements allowed these companies to form three partnerships -- SkyTeam, Atlantic and OneWorld -- and charge whatever rates they wanted. The first attempts at low-cost travel in this area were failures. Laker Airways, a 1970s forerunner, lasted less than 10 years after starting flights across the Atlantic. The game changed with the emergence of a new, more fuel-efficient generation of aircraft, such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX and Airbus's Neo and A350. "It is not sustainable to operate a low-cost model using old aircraft," Anders Lindstrom, communications director for Norwegian Air, said by email. The company, which posted third quarter earnings of $122 million, made its first transatlantic flight in 2013. - Cheaper fuel, cheaper tickets - The collapse of oil prices two years ago persuaded other companies to get in the game given that fuel is air carriers' greatest expense. WestJet spokesman Robert Palmer said by email, "Clearly there is a strong demand for low-cost, long-haul service in this country." Having battled for supremacy with major airlines in the United States, JetBlue and Southwest Airlines are no longer hiding their ambitions.  The market for transatlantic flights suffers from the same lack of competition that transcontinental flights once did, JetBlue spokeswoman Tamara Young said. The company has purchased Airbus A321 aircraft that could link the U.S. East Coast and Europe.  "We will consider opportunities in Europe against other opportunities we are looking at," she said. While their attractive prices have opened doors, low-cost carriers still have to establish their good names, said Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. "Are they safe? Are they reliable?" he said. "All they have is low fares. They don't have a reputation." SourceAgence France Presse Business Comments 0 Comment

Rubins and her crewmates Anatoly Ivanishin of the Russian space agency Roscosmos and Takuya Onishi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, touched down in their Soyuz MS-01 at 11:58 p.m. EDT (9:58 a.m. Oct. 30, Kazakhstan time) southeast of the remote town of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan. Rubins, who has a degree in molecular biology, contributed to several new studies taking place for the first time aboard the space station, including the Biomolecule Sequencer experiment. The ability to sequence the DNA of living organisms in space could enable astronauts to diagnose an illness, or identify microbes growing in the space station and determine whether they represent a health threat. During her time on the orbiting complex, Rubins ventured outside the confines of the station for two spacewalks. During the first one on Aug. 19, she and NASA astronaut Jeff Williams installed the first international docking adapter. Outfitted with a host of sensors and systems, the adapter’s main purpose is to provide a port for spacecraft bringing astronauts to the station in the future. Its first users are expected to be the Boeing Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft now in development in partnership with NASA's Commercial Crew Program. During her second spacewalk Sept. 1, Rubins and Williams retracted a spare thermal control radiator and installed two new high-definition cameras. Together, the Expedition 49 crew members contributed to hundreds of experiments in biology, biotechnology, physical science and Earth science aboard the world-class orbiting laboratory during their 115 days in space. The trio also welcomed three cargo spacecraft delivering several tons of supplies and research experiments. Rubins was involved in the grapple of Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft to the station in October, the company's sixth contracted commercial resupply mission, and SpaceX’s Dragon ninth contracted mission in July. One Russian ISS Progress cargo spacecraft also docked to the station in July. Rubins and Onishi have each spent a total of 115 days in space during their first mission. Ivanishin now has 280 days in space from two flights. Expedition 50, with Shane Kimbrough of NASA in command and his crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko of Roscosmos, will operate the station for three weeks until the arrival of three new crew members. Peggy Whitson of NASA, Thomas Pesquet of ESA (European Space Agency) and Oleg Novitskiy of Roscosmos are scheduled to launch Nov. 17 from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

Low-cost air carriers spreading wings over the Atlantic | Bangkok Post: news Top sections News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning More NEWS Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive Today's paper DIGITAL VERSION SIGN IN About E-Newspaper Subscribe Report problem Free Trial HOME DELIVERY NEWS Homepage MOST RECENT Top stories POLITICS Crime General ASEAN ASIA WORLD SPORTS More WEATHER FORECAST HOT TOPICS SPECIAL REPORT SECURITY Transport Environment News > World Low-cost air carriers spreading wings over the Atlantic 30 Oct 2016 at 09:45 117 viewed0 comments WRITER: AFP - + NEW YORK - Low-cost air carriers are spreading their wings across the Atlantic, much to the chagrin of the major airlines now forced to serve new destinations and cut fares. Low-cost airlines such as Norwegian Air have eaten into the market share of larger transatlantic carriers as fuel prices have dropped Transatlantic flights operated by Norwegian Air, Iceland's Wow air, Canada's WestJet and Morocco's Royal Air Maroc have multiplied in recent years as jet fuel has grown cheaper. Frequently offering fares less than half that of major airlines, low-cost carriers have quickly attracted travelers. Traditional players have seen their collective market share decline, dropping from 75 percent in the summer of 2014 to 72 percent this summer, according to the air travel data company OAG. While low-cost carriers remain small players, larger airlines "are looking over their shoulders," said George Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. "They could be a growing threat as they add more seats," he told AFP. "Currently, if you look at the percentage of seats they have compared to major airlines, it's very small." - Half-price flights - Booked in advance, a round-trip flight between London and New York currently runs an average of $398 on the low-cost carriers, according to Hobica, compared to more than $600 with the major airlines. WestJet even has flights linking Canada and London at $149 (CAN$199). Even with other costs added in, such as charges for meals, luggage and headphones, passengers can get a good deal, according to Hobica. Aware of the threat, the larger companies have not wasted time, offering cheaper seats, more direct flights and new connections. British Airways recently began serving a route between London and San Jose, California. Delta Air Lines, United and American, the three largest US companies, recently said they saw a drop in transatlantic traffic due to Britain's vote to quit the eurozone, terrorist attacks in Europe and overcapacity. Revenues could fall as a result. Transatlantic flights have long been the preserve of major airlines, protected by the Open Skies agreements between the United States and Europe. The agreements allowed these companies to form three partnerships -- SkyTeam, Atlantic and OneWorld -- and charge whatever rates they wanted. The first attempts at low-cost travel in this area were failures. Laker Airways, a 1970s forerunner, lasted less than 10 years after starting flights across the Atlantic. The game changed with the emergence of a new, more fuel-efficient generation of aircraft, such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX and Airbus's Neo and A350. "It is not sustainable to operate a low-cost model using old aircraft," Anders Lindstrom, communications director for Norwegian Air, said by email. The company, which posted third quarter earnings of $122 million, made its first transatlantic flight in 2013. - Cheaper fuel, cheaper tickets - The collapse of oil prices two years ago persuaded other companies to get in the game given that fuel is air carriers' greatest expense. WestJet spokesman Robert Palmer said by email, "Clearly there is a strong demand for low-cost, long-haul service in this country." Having battled for supremacy with major airlines in the United States, JetBlue and Southwest Airlines are no longer hiding their ambitions. The market for transatlantic flights suffers from the same lack of competition that transcontinental flights once did, JetBlue spokeswoman Tamara Young said. The company has purchased Airbus A321 aircraft that could link the US East Coast and Europe. "We will consider opportunities in Europe against other opportunities we are looking at," she said. While their attractive prices have opened doors, low-cost carriers still have to establish their good names, said Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. "Are they safe? Are they reliable?" he said. "All they have is low fares. They don't have a reputation."

Posted 30 Oct 2016 10:18 Low-cost airlines such as Norwegian Air have eaten into the market share of larger transatlantic carriers as fuel prices have dropped AFP/JOHAN NILSSON Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Low-cost air carriers are spreading their wings across the Atlantic, much to the chagrin of the major airlines now forced to serve new destinations and cut fares. Transatlantic flights operated by Norwegian Air, Iceland's Wow air, Canada's WestJet and Morocco's Royal Air Maroc have multiplied in recent years as jet fuel has grown cheaper. Frequently offering fares less than half that of major airlines, low-cost carriers have quickly attracted travelers. Traditional players have seen their collective market share decline, dropping from 75 percent in the summer of 2014 to 72 percent this summer, according to the air travel data company OAG. While low-cost carriers remain small players, larger airlines "are looking over their shoulders," said George Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. "They could be a growing threat as they add more seats," he told AFP. "Currently, if you look at the percentage of seats they have compared to major airlines, it's very small." HALF-PRICE FLIGHTS Booked in advance, a round-trip flight between London and New York currently runs an average of US$398 on the low-cost carriers, according to Hobica, compared to more than US$600 with the major airlines. WestJet even has flights linking Canada and London at US$149. Even with other costs added in, such as charges for meals, luggage and headphones, passengers can get a good deal, according to Hobica. Aware of the threat, the larger companies have not wasted time, offering cheaper seats, more direct flights and new connections. British Airways recently began serving a route between London and San Jose, California. Delta Air Lines, United and American, the three largest US companies, recently said they saw a drop in transatlantic traffic due to Britain's vote to quit the eurozone, terrorist attacks in Europe and overcapacity. Revenues could fall as a result. Transatlantic flights have long been the preserve of major airlines, protected by the Open Skies agreements between the United States and Europe. The agreements allowed these companies to form three partnerships -- SkyTeam, Atlantic and OneWorld -- and charge whatever rates they wanted. The first attempts at low-cost travel in this area were failures. Laker Airways, a 1970s forerunner, lasted less than 10 years after starting flights across the Atlantic. The game changed with the emergence of a new, more fuel-efficient generation of aircraft, such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX and Airbus's Neo and A350. "It is not sustainable to operate a low-cost model using old aircraft," Anders Lindstrom, communications director for Norwegian Air, said by email. The company, which posted third quarter earnings of US$122 million, made its first transatlantic flight in 2013. CHEAPER FUEL, CHEAPER TICKETS The collapse of oil prices two years ago persuaded other companies to get in the game given that fuel is air carriers' greatest expense. WestJet spokesman Robert Palmer said by email, "Clearly there is a strong demand for low-cost, long-haul service in this country." Having battled for supremacy with major airlines in the United States, JetBlue and Southwest Airlines are no longer hiding their ambitions. The market for transatlantic flights suffers from the same lack of competition that transcontinental flights once did, JetBlue spokeswoman Tamara Young said. The company has purchased Airbus A321 aircraft that could link the US East Coast and Europe. "We will consider opportunities in Europe against other opportunities we are looking at," she said. While their attractive prices have opened doors, low-cost carriers still have to establish their good names, said Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. "Are they safe? Are they reliable?" he said. "All they have is low fares. They don't have a reputation." - AFP Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Business Home LBoard COMMENT Is Zaid angling for a run as MP? Scott Ng Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Low-cost air carriers spreading wings over the Atlantic AFP | October 30, 2016 Frequently offering fares less than half that of major airlines, low-cost carriers have quickly attracted travelers. NEW YORK: Low-cost air carriers are spreading their wings across the Atlantic, much to the chagrin of the major airlines now forced to serve new destinations and cut fares. Transatlantic flights operated by Norwegian Air, Iceland’s Wow air, Canada’s WestJet and Morocco’s Royal Air Maroc have multiplied in recent years as jet fuel has grown cheaper. Frequently offering fares less than half that of major airlines, low-cost carriers have quickly attracted travelers. Traditional players have seen their collective market share decline, dropping from 75 percent in the summer of 2014 to 72 percent this summer, according to the air travel data company OAG. While low-cost carriers remain small players, larger airlines “are looking over their shoulders,” said George Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. “They could be a growing threat as they add more seats,” he told AFP. “Currently, if you look at the percentage of seats they have compared to major airlines, it’s very small.” Half-price flights Booked in advance, a round-trip flight between London and New York currently runs an average of $398 on the low-cost carriers, according to Hobica, compared to more than $600 with the major airlines. WestJet even has flights linking Canada and London at $149 (CAN$199). Even with other costs added in, such charges for meals, luggage and headphones, passengers can get a good deal, according to Hobica. Aware of the threat, the larger companies have not wasted time, offering cheaper seats, more direct flights and new connections. British Airways recently began serving a route between London and San Jose, California. Delta Air Lines, United and American, the three largest US companies, recently said they saw a drop in transatlantic traffic due to Britain’s vote to quit the eurozone, terrorist attacks in Europe and overcapacity. Revenues could fall as a result. Transatlantic flights have long been the preserve of major airlines, protected by the Open Skies agreements between the United States and Europe. The agreements allowed these companies to form three partnerships — SkyTeam, Atlantic and OneWorld — and charge whatever rates they wanted. The first attempts at low-cost travel in this area were failures. Laker Airways, a 1970s forerunner, lasted less than 10 years after starting flights across the Atlantic. The game changed with the emergence of a new, more fuel-efficient generation of aircraft, such as Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX and Airbus’s Neo and A350. “It is not sustainable to operate a low-cost model using old aircraft,” Anders Lindstrom, communications director for Norwegian Air, said by email. The company, which posted third quarter earnings of $122 million, made its first transatlantic flight in 2013. Cheaper fuel, cheaper tickets The collapse of oil prices two years ago persuaded other companies to get in the game given that fuel is air carriers’ greatest expense. WestJet spokesman Robert Palmer said by email, “Clearly there is a strong demand for low-cost, long-haul service in this country.” Having battled for supremacy with major airlines in the United States, JetBlue and Southwest Airlines are no longer hiding their ambitions. The market for transatlantic flights suffers from the same lack of competition that transcontinental flights once did, JetBlue spokeswoman Tamara Young said. The company has purchased Airbus A321 aircraft that could link the US East Coast and Europe. “We will consider opportunities in Europe against other opportunities we are looking at,” she said. While their attractive prices have opened doors, low-cost carriers still have to establish their good names, said Hobica of airfarewatchdog.com. “Are they safe? Are they reliable?” he said. “All they have is low fares. They don’t have a reputation.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

SpaceX stated shortly after the explosion that it happened during fueling of the launch vehicle before a routine static fire test rather than during the test itself, and that the "anomaly" was likely caused by a breach in the rocket's cryogenic helium system. In the latest statement, the company said that the investigation has zoomed in on a specific pressurized helium container located in the second-stage oxygen tank. "Attention has continued to narrow to one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the LOX tank," the release read. © Photo: PIxabay Star Wars: Arms Trade Giant Boeing to Rival Musk's SpaceX Race to MarsIn recent testing at the company's facilities in Texas, experts have managed to recreate the exact conditions that caused the COPV to fail. According to SpaceX, the failure can occur "entirely through helium-loading conditions" mainly affected by the helium's temperature and pressure. The company intends to continue to probe for the "exact root cause" of the eruption and to develop improved helium loading conditions to make sure there's no repeat of the failure. But given that the incident likely was caused by helium handling issues rather than a design issue with the rocket itself, SpaceX expects to return to flight operations before the end of 2016. ...

Rough Cut (no reporter narration) ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Manufacturing and efforts to support clean energy dominated talks between President Barack Obama and new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday (September 30). Obama noted that the U.S. and India are two of the world's largest democracies adding, "We have so much in common, it is important for us to continue to deepen and broaded the existing framework of partnership and friendship that already exists." This is Modi's first to the United States since taking office in May. The meeting in the Oval Office, which came on the heels of a White House dinner and New York meetings with power players including Bill and Hillary Clinton and chief executive officers from Boeing and GE. It is something of a reversal of fortune for the 64-year-old politician who nearly a decade earlier, was banned from coming to the U.S. In 2005, Modi, then the chief minister of Gujarat was denied a U.S. visa over rioting in his home state that killed more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, three years before. Modi, who denies wrongdoing, has been exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court probe. During the meeting, Modi told reporters he sought Obama's support for continuing to create access to Indian service companies. In addition to trade issues, the two leaders also discussed efforts to promote clean energy. Security issues were also touched on including efforts to fights ISIL as well as regional security with Afghanistan and Pakistan. On Tuesday, Modi scheduled to meet with other U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner. Modi is also scheduled to visit a number of memorials in Washington devoted to former Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, President Abraham Lincoln and civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Press CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the code http://reut.rs/1wbMHfn <iframe class="reuters-vidembed" width="700" height="394" src="http://www.reuters.com/assets/iframe/yovideo?videoId=346381046"></iframe> Close Once banned from US, Modi meets Obama at White House Wednesday, October 01, 2014 - 01:15 Top News » NYC builds sticky notes wall in defiance of... 3:02am IST - (1:31) Breakingviews TV: A makeup upstart Tue, 15 Nov, 2016 - (2:27) India seeks to quell public anger by raising...

Indian embassies overseas are getting in touch with major aircraft manufacturers for detailed information on the aircraft they can offer as well as the quantum and mode of technology transfer, a top defence ministry source told this newspaper. “It is understood Indian embassies have been instructed to conduct information-gathering through military attaches posted there. This is not a Request for Information (RFI) proposal as of now. In a few cases, requests have already gone, in some they are about to be sent,” the source said. “There have been a few unsolicited offers from major aircraft makers (recently). But we will be looking at the offers from the ‘Make in India’ perspective,” he added. At present, the Indian Air Force, the world’s fourth largest, has 33 fighter squadrons, far short of its critical strength of 42 squadrons. While the source did not detail which companies are being approached, the likely list will include Dassault Aviation, Boeing (US), Lockheed Martin (US), Saab (Sweden) and BAE (UK). The aircraft in contention are expected to be Rafale, F-18, F-16, Grippen and the Eurofighter. A Reuters report claimed that the value of the deal may go up to $15 billion (around `1 lakh crore), making it one of the biggest military aircraft deals in the country’s history. In June, Saab proposed to set up a huge establishment in India that will make fighters and other defence products. In August, Lockheed Martin made an offer to move its sole production line of the latest version of F-16-Block 70 to India from Texas to meet Indian and global needs. But both proposals are subject to the IAF choosing its fighter aircraft for its fleet. The source also said the hunt is at a very initial stage. As Jan Widerstrom, chairman and managing director of Saab India Tecnologies, told this newspaper in an interview recently: “Any fighter aircraft acquisition programme is going to be very complex in nature, given the number of parameters to be taken into consideration. In addition, a new programme would involve the establishment of a large aerospace ecosystem in India.” Location: India, Delhi, New Delhi MOST POPULAR 1 Varun Dhawan is now a self-confessed 'nudist'! 2 Ranveer and Ranbir shoot for their Koffee with Karan episode 3 Can Dwayne Johnson pull a Donald Trump and become American President? 4 Man accidentally gets 7-inch chopstick stuck in penis 5 Did Parineeti just crush someone's debut dream? more Columnist Parsa Venkateshwar Rao Jr Note ban economic quackery by govt?

Bill Shuster of being “too cozy” with America’s airline industry, and with one of theindustry’s female lobbyists in particular. “I’ve addressed this months ago,” Shuster said recently. “We were straightforward. … I, a single male, dated a woman who is a government affairs person. I put in place in my office a policy that she can’t lobby me or my congressional staff and I didn’t have to do that under the ethics rule but I did it anyway because I wanted to make sure we protected the integrity of the office and protected my integrity and made sure the voters of the 9th District knew about it.” Shuster said “Art Halvorson people” keep bringing up the issue, but Shuster contends it’s more serious that Halvorson was cited by state police with harassment, for allegedly grabbing and holding the wrist of a Shuster female campaign worker at a booth at the Fayette County Fair on Aug. 6. Halvorson pleaded not guilty to the citation. “That, to me, seems like a bigger issue than if I date somebody or not,” Shuster said. “I’m not cozy with any industry,” Shuster continued. “If you look at my record, on the legislation I’ve passed through my committee, which passed Congress and become law, it passes by wide margins, bipartisan. It’s not one side or the other. It’s a broad piece of legislation that’s supported by Democrats, Republicans and all kinds of industries. I think my record speaks loud and clear for itself. I’ve played by the rules and I pass legislation that gets tremendous support.” One of Shuster’s campaign fliers states that for him, job No. 1 is protecting jobs. He said he’s been doing that in part by voting for policies that led to “lowering taxes, reducing regulations and, of course, under Obama, we’ve been fighting him every step of the way to stop him from continuing to expand on these regulations that don’t make it any safer out there for the environment or workers. They just add costs and they hurt jobs. “Also, passing legislation on the highway bill and other infrastructure legislation … to reduce regulation, to get these dollars flowing out there to rebuild our infrastructure,” he said. Shuster said his role as chairman of the Transportation Committee gives the 9th District “a louder voice in Washington.” “I have been able to successfully pass transportation infrastructure legislation which is not only good for the district but good for America, and have done it on a bipartisan basis with broad support … doing what’s right for America … and for the people of the 9th Congressional District.” He said more could be done to reinvigorate the natural gas industry. “In the last 7ﾽ years, this administration has had 19 permits — and they’ve only approved two, maybe three — to allow for the construction of a liquefied natural gas facility at our ports to get this stuff into the worldwide market,” Shuster said. “This administration has sat on those permits. One has been approved and is built and is now shipping gas to other parts of the world. But we should have been at breakneck speed, been getting these facilities built because, if you go to Europe, while we’re getting $2 or $3 per unit for gas in the United States, Europeans are paying $12, $13 or $14 a unit. So sending it over there helps us get our gas industry going, creates jobs for Americans, helps our economy and it helps us internationally by helping our friends in Europe and helping us cut the legs out from under Putin and Russia. They hold Europe hostage over their gas.” Shuster chaired an Armed Forces Committee panel looking at the challenges small- and medium-size businesses face when trying to get contracts with the Department of Defense. “There’s quite a number of them, several in Indiana County … that are trying to do business with DOD,” Shuster said. “The problem of doing business with the Department of Defense is it’s so complicated and we’ve got to reduce the complications. … They are treated like a Boeing or a Lockheed, a big corporation. And some of these only have 10 or 15 employees and are producing some of the things that … are really on the cutting edge to help our soldiers and our war fighters, to help keep America safe. Reducing that complexity and encouraging these businesses to continue to go after government business is important.” America’s national debt — approaching $20 trillion — has to be a priority for Congress, according to Shuster. “We’ve got to stop the debt from growing, and the way you do it is you control government spending. You can’t cut your way out of it, but you can control it. … You’ve got to get this economy growing at 3 and 4 and 5 percent. That will create the economic activity to create the jobs. … That helps bring dollars into the federal government, to help us balance the budget while we’re trying to control spending.” Shuster said America’s debt could become a national security risk if the nation can’t pay its bills and can’t continue to build a strong military. In the spring, Shuster expressed concern about terrorists entering America from foreign lands, and the situation has not improved, in his opinion. “No, America has become more dangerous, I believe, with the Obama administration allowing refugees from broken countries, failed states to come into this country,” he said. “We don’t know where they’re from. We should put a pause on that, to make sure we know where people are coming from and who they are. “Also what we have now is home-grown terrorism, people who were born here in this country and have become radicalized. … It’s not just the government that has to do it. It’s every citizen’s responsibility to make sure they’re paying attention to what’s going on in their neighborhood and their community. … We’ve got to make sure that as citizens we’re vigilant because the police, the FBI, our intelligence community can’t see all these people all over the place. It takes Americans to be vigilant.” Shuster said Congress needs to do more to stem the opioid epidemic. “The federal responsibility is, first and foremost, to stop these drugs from coming into the United States and into Pennsylvania,” Shuster said. “Indiana County has seen a tremendous increase (in drug overdose deaths), it’s the fourth worst in the state.” Congress needs to work with law enforcement at all levels and make sure needed resources are available to help stop the unintentional overdose deaths, he said. Shuster also offered some advice to 9th District voters on the presidential race. “These two presidential candidates are going to have vastly different appointments to the Supreme Court,” he said. “And I, for one, believe the 11 judges Donald Trump put forward are the kind of justices we need on the Supreme Court. You can disagree with Donald Trump on this, that or the other thing, but … the Supreme Court should be the No. 1 issue going into the voting booth. (The new president) will get an appointment on the first day … probably two more appointments and maybe a fourth appointment. It will change the makeup of the court for a generation, two generations.” Print Comments() Email Next Article Photos of the Week, Oct. 23 - 29, 2016 October 29, 2016 10:51 AM by TERI ENCISO by KAYLA GRUBE by KEVIN STIFFLER Each week, the Gazette presents the people and places of the Indiana County area through the eyes of Gazette photographers and our readers.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Society Defence India ready to buy over 200 combat jets, but they have to be 'Made in India' Indian Air Force needs to make for sharply declining combat squadron strength, from the sanctioned 45 to current 32. Aditya Bhat   October 29, 2016 20:34 IST 11 Shares 11 Shares SAAB is ready to make Gripen in India.Creative Commons/US Air Force photo by 1st Lt. Christopher Mesnard The Narendra Modi government is ready to buy single-engine combat jets that can give fillip to its fast depleting combat fleet strength, but they must toe the Prime Minister's pet project Make in India, where a foreign manufacturer will have to tie-up with a local partner and make the jets in India. India could buy as many as 200 jets, which could eventually rise to 300 if the foreign manufacturer makes it in India, Reuters quoted IAF officials as saying. The deal, one of the biggest for the country, could be worth $13-$15 billion. Why advertise with us? Related India to take time in accessing F-16 and F/A-18 production line; technology transfer and job creation a priority for them, says Pentagon official Pentagon gives nod to proposal by Boeing, Lockheed to make frontline fighter jets in India India faces trouble from two neighbours, China and Pakistan, though the sanctioned strength in case of two-pronged attack is 45 squadrons of fighters, its current combat squadron has come down to 32 squadrons of fighters, which is the lowest in a decade. The IAF is also dealing with the phasing out of Russia-made MiG 21 squadrons, which is expected to bring it down to 31 squadron strength. So, in order to give impetus to the fighter squadron, the Central government signed a deal with France in August to buy high-end Rafale twin-engine jets from Dassault, worth $8.8 billion. The Rafale deal also include weapons package Meteor radar-guided Beyond Visual Range (BVR) missile and Scalp long-range air to ground missiles. But the 36 jets fall short of its required strength to counter any threat from two theatres. PM Modi is, however, looking to kick-start India's nascent defence manufacturing industry by making foreign companies build in India. Two companies have shown interest -- US aerospace major Lockheed Martin and Swedish aerospace major Saab. Lockheed Martin has said that it is ready to set up production line for its single-engine F-16 fighter jets in India. The US giant has also said that it is also ready to export the jets that are made in India. Similarly, Saab has said that it is also ready to set up production line for single-engine Gripen fighter jets. "The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at," an officer was quoted as saying by Reuters. Building in India also implies transfer of technology, something that many have detested from. Defence Ministry Manohar Parrikar has written to companies asking them if they are ready to set up shop and the extent of transfer of technology, said a government source. The Modi government had to cancel the previous government's MMRCA deal, known as the mother of the deals for 126 Rafale fighters being made in India after the two sides could not agree on the terms for producing them in India. The government instead had to go in for only 36 of them, which will be arriving in fly-away conditions. Moreover, the indigenously made LCA Tejas, is further being delayed with only two aircraft being handed over to Indian Air Force and its maker, HAL, still conducting tests on several prototypes. Saab's Gripen offer Saab on the other hand is not only ready to set up Gripen fighter jet production line but is also ready to help build the local aviation industry. "We are very experienced in transfer of technology – our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line," said Jan Widerstrom, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. Widerstrom also confirmed of receiving a letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. The facility needs to produce at least 100 planes, said a source close to company. Lockheed Martin's F-16 offer Lockheed Martin too confirmed of getting a letter from defence ministry and said that it offered F-16 fighter jets. It also said that it offered to transfer the entire production line of F-16 to India. "Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world's only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world's largest fighter aircraft supply chain," said Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India. Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet offer Earlier this year in March, reports emerged that Boeing has offered twin-engine F/A-18 Super Hornets under the "Make in India" framework of the Indian government. The F/A-18 jets were also competitors at the previously cancelled MMRCA deal. US defence cooperation US dislodged India's traditional military supplier, Russia as the top arms supplier in recent years. India and US are also fast expanding their military ties with India ordering military hardware like Apache and Chinook helicopters. India is also looking to buy BAE Systems' M777 Howitzers. "We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development," said M Matheswaran, a retired Indian air marshal and former adviser at HAL to Reuters.

A deal for 200 single-engine planes produced in India — which the Air Force says could rise to 300 as it fully phases out ageing Soviet-era aircraft — could be worth anything from $13-$15 billion, experts say, potentially one of the country's biggest military aircraft deals. After a deal to buy high-end Rafale planes from France's Dassault was scaled back to just 36 jets last month, the Indian Air Force is desperately trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength, now a third less than required to face both China and Pakistan. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration wants any further military planes to be built in India with an Indian partner to kickstart a domestic aircraft industry, and end an expensive addiction to imports. Lockheed Martin said it is interested in setting up a production line for its F-16 plane in India for not just the Indian military, but also for export. And Sweden's Saab has offered a rival production line for its Gripen aircraft, setting up an early contest for one of the biggest military plane deals in play. "The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at," said an air officer briefed on the Make-in-India plans under which a foreign manufacturer will partner local firms to build the aircraft with technology transfer. India's defence ministry has written to several companies asking if they would be willing to set up an assembly line for single-engine fighter planes in India and the amount of technology transfer that would happen, another government source said. "We are testing the waters, testing the foreign firms' willingness to move production here and to find out their expectations," the person said. Operational Gaps India's air force originally planned for 126 Rafale twin-engine fighters from Dassault, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of local production with a state-run Indian firm and settled for 36 planes in a fly-away condition. Adding to the military's problems is India's three-decade effort to build a single-engine fighter of its own which was meant to be the backbone of the air force. Only two of those Light Combat Aircraft, called Tejas, have been delivered to the air force which has ordered 140 of them. The Indian Air Force is down to 32 operational squadrons compared with the 45 it has said are necessary, and in March the vice chief Air Marshal B S Dhanoa told parliament's defence committee that it didn't have the operational strength to fight a two front war against China and Pakistan. Jet Makers Respond Saab said it was ready to not only produce its frontline Gripen fighter in India, but help build a local aviation industry base. "We are very experienced in transfer of technology - our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line," said Jan Widerström, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. He confirmed Saab had received the letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. A source close to the company said that while there was no minimum order set in stone for it to lay down a production line, they would expect to build at least 100 planes at the facility. Lockheed Martin said it had responded to the defence ministry's letter with an offer to transfer the entire production of its F-16 fighter to India. "Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world's only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world's largest fighter aircraft supply chain," Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India said in an email. US Top Supplier Lockheed's offer comes on the back of expanding US-India military ties in which Washington has emerged as India's top arms supplier in recent years, ousting old ally Russia. Earlier this year Boeing also offered India its twin-engine F/A-18 Hornets, but the level of technology transfer was not clear. India has never previously attempted to build a modern aircraft production line, whether military or civilian. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has assembled Russian combat jets including the Su-30, but these are under licensed production. "We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development," said retired Indian air marshal M. Matheswaran, a former adviser at HAL.

The injuries were 'non-critical' and those injured were shifted to Chicago-area hospitals for further evaluation, the American Airlines said in a statement on the company website. Pilots aborted take-off after the right-side engine of the Boeing-767 American Airlines Flight 383 caught fire on the runway, which the airline company attributed to an engine-related issue. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration blamed the problem on a blown tire. Following the incident at 2.35 pm local time, an emergency rescue operation took place and the 161 passengers and 9 crew members were evacuated safely using a chute within a few minutes. The fire was also brought under control swiftly. The FAA is investigating the incident.

Cascadia Advocate Offering daily news and analysis from the majestic Evergreen State and beyond, The Advocate is the Northwest Progressive Institute's unconventional perspective on world, national, and local politics. « Liveblogging the 2016 vice presidential debate from the great Pacific Northwest Frankie’s Pizza and Pasta closing after over two decades in Redmond: An appreciation » Friday, October 7th, 2016 Poll Watch: Tina Podlodowski narrowly ahead of Kim Wyman; I-732 well under fifty percent With November 8th only a month away, we’re starting to see new polling released on a near-daily basis. Today, KOMO TV and Strategies 360 released a new set of results from a recent poll they collaborated on, while Tina Podlodowski’s campaign distributed findings from a poll showing Podlodowski narrowly ahead of incumbent Republican Kim Wyman in the contest for Washington Secretary of State. With Governor Jay Inslee and U.S. Senator Patty Murray widely expected to cruise to new terms, and Attorney General Bob Ferguson without a Republican opponent this year, the marquee matchups are further downballot. Perhaps no contest is considered to be as close as that for Secretary of State. Incumbent Kim Wyman is the only Republican currently serving in the executive department, and faces an incredibly strong Democratic challenger in former Seattle City Councilmember and experienced business leader Tina Podlodowski. In the August Top Two election, Wyman garnered 47.9%. Podlodowski finished only 23,882 votes behind, capturing 46.13% of the vote. Democrats are fired up about Podlodowski’s chances, while Republicans are increasingly nervous about Wyman’s. Podlodowski’s campaign has just given them another reason to be concerned by releasing fresh polling that shows Podlodowski ahead. Normington Petts — which also counts Hillary Clinton, Jason Kander, and Tammy Duckworth as clients — reports that in a survey conducted from September 27th-29th of six hundred likely November voters, 35% of respondents said they planned to vote for Podlodowski, while only 31% planned to vote for Wyman. “Podlodowski leads despite the fact that nearly twice as many voters know Wyman,” noted NP’s Jill Normington in a memo prepared for public distribution. “Not only is Podlodowski already ahead of Wyman, the majority of undecided voters are Democrats. Of the 34% who are currently undecided, 53% are Democrats, while 25% are Independents and 22% are Republicans. Moreover, the undecided voters at the Secretary of State level are voting for Governor Jay Inslee for reelection 51%-21%. If Podlodowski has the necessary resources to persuade these undecided voters, she will be in a strong position to win in November.” The Normington Petts survey has a margin of error of ±4.0% Meanwhile, Strategies 360 and KOMO TV have released results that show U.S. Senator Patty Murray with a comfy lead over Republican challenger Chris Vance. “In this poll of 500 likely voters interviewed statewide, 57% said they would vote for Murray, as opposed to 36% for Vance,” reported KOMO’s Robert Mak. “Murray, first elected to the Senate in 1992, maintains a high approval rating with 57% viewing her favorably, and 30% having an unfavorable impression.” KOMO/Strategies 360 also released results for three of the six initiatives that are appearing on Washington’s ballot. They found: 62% support for Initiative 1433 (minimum wage and paid leave); 79% support for Initiative 1491 (extreme risk protection orders); 42% support for Initiative 732 (CarbonWA’s tax swap scheme). Back in June, NPI and Public Policy Polling asked a sample of likely voters about these same initiatives, and found the following: 58% support for Initiative 1433 (minimum wage and paid leave); 73% support for Initiative 1491 (extreme risk protection orders); 52% support for Initiative 732 (CarbonWA’s tax swap scheme). I-1433 and I-1491 polled 4% and 6% higher, respectively, in the KOMO/Strategies 360 poll than in our poll, which suggests that voters are actually becoming more enthused about these progressive ideas, not less. That’s encouraging. The same cannot be said about CarbonWA’s I-732, a proposal to levy a tax on pollutants and use the revenue to cancel out sales and B&O taxes — including much of what’s left of Boeing’s already-reduced tax obligations. With a month left to go, I-732 is under water. Only 42% of respondents surveyed by KOMO/Strategies 360 indicated support for I-732. 37% indicated opposition, and 21% reported that they are undecided. Undecided voters can swing yes or no, as CarbonWA pointed out several weeks ago after Stuart Elway published research showing lackluster support for I-732 and a high number of undecided voters. However, it is more common for undecided voters to break no than yes when a strong opposition campaign is in place to effectively make the arguments against. When in doubt, people tend to vote no. I-732 arguably faces stronger opposition than any of the other initiatives on the ballot this year. Though NPI would very much like to put a price on pollution, we oppose I-732 because we believe it is fatally flawed. So does the labor community and progressive organizations like OneAmerica. KOMO/Strategies 360 appear not to have polled on I-1501, I-1464, or I-735, which are also on Washington’s November 2016 statewide ballot. Like what you just read? Or found it thought-provoking?

Much of what you say is demonstrably inaccurate. Polling is increasingly favorable for I 732 In August it was 34% for, 37% against, 30% undecided The last poll is 42% for, 37% no, 21% undecided I 732 is now ahead and undecideds are moving towards it as they learn more about it. I 732 is the most progressive, pro-environment measure in decades and it is stunning you folks are not supporting it. A carbon tax is supported widely as the most effective way to reduce carbon usage. The funds are used to make our state tax system less regressive, something all progressives support. The revenue-negative estimates have been proven to be in error (check Sightline) and I732 is very, very close to neutrality. You can’t do any better. Do you folks want to end up like the Nader supporters who helped elect Bush? Do you want to have the responsibility of defeating the most progressive, effective means of reducing carbon usage available? You are working against facts and your own interests. Can you reconsider?…cliff mass Andrew Posted October 8th, 2016 at 12:38 PM | Permalink Cliff, it’s October. Ballots are about to drop. An initiative that’s well under fifty percent is in bad shape — period. Below fifty percent is a place that a Yes campaign does not want to be. Are the numbers for I-732 in the Strategies 360 poll better than the August Elway poll? Sure… but they’re also worse than NPI’s own poll back in June, which I referenced above and which you omitted in your comment. Add in our research, and you can’t say “polling is increasingly favorable for I-732”. We found I-732 with 52% support statewide in June. Best showing we’ve seen for it. KOMO/Strategies 360’s research puts I-732 at 42% support. And keep in mind that on the other initiatives they tested (I-1433, I-1491), they found higher support than we did. Those campaigns are clearly in a position to win. How the undecided voters break will certainly matter. But as I said above, when in doubt, people tend to vote no. We disagree with your characterization of I-732. There is very little about it we find progressive. Yoram Bauman has admitted that CarbonWA crafted I-732 in order to go chasing after Republican voters, who polling consistently shows are simply not interested in putting a price on pollution. As he said: I am increasingly convinced that the path to climate action is through the Republican Party. Yes, there are challenges on the right — skepticism about climate science and about tax reform — but those are surmountable with time and effort. The same cannot be said of the challenges on the left: an unyielding desire to tie everything to bigger government, and a willingness to use race and class as political weapons in order to pursue that desire. We can do so much better than I-732. I-732 dedicates no money to tackle our massive infrastructure deficit and ease our transition to a clean energy economy. Instead, revenue would be used to cancel out other taxes, including much of what is left of Boeing’s tax obligations. I advise you to stop trying to shame people into supporting I-732 by telling them that if they don’t vote for I-732, they will be akin to Nader supporters/Bush enablers. You’ve been saying this a lot, Cliff, and it’s not helping your cause. We’ve been discussing I-732’s flaws here on the Cascadia Advocate periodically for over a year. Our assessment is that I-732 is bad policy. NPI therefore recommends a NO vote on I-732. The real climate action plan on the ballot this year is Sound Transit 3, which we strongly support. In the words of Michael Brune: Sound Transit estimates that if Proposition 1 passes, the entire Sound Transit system by 2040 would reduce an estimated 793,000 tons of greenhouse-gas emissions annually and cut vehicle miles traveled by nearly 300 million to 400 million miles as people switch from sitting in traffic to riding on transit. If Washington state is going to do its part to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to the levels called for in the recently ratified Paris climate agreement, it needs an ambitious investment in rapid-transit like Sound Transit 3. We agree and we urge a yes vote on Regional Proposition 1. Christopher E Greacen Posted October 15th, 2016 at 5:29 PM | Permalink Andrew writes that Sound Transit Proposition 1 would reduce an estimated 793,000 tonnes of GHG annually. I-732, if approved, is expected to lead to a 10% reduction in WA’s annual emissions of 83 million tonnes of GHG. Do the math… that’s 8.3 million tonnes annually, or more than 10X what Proposition 1 hopes for. https://yeson732.org/plain-language/ While I think that Proposition 1 is worthy to vote for, it’s no substitute for a carbon tax. While I would also vote for a carbon tax that provides lots of revenues for crumbling infrastructure and green jobs, the fact is that a) tax increases are a tough sell in our state; and a) no such alternative initiative exists on the ballot — nobody but CarbonWA i732 managed to get off their butts to write one. We can’t afford to wait another 4 years. I urge a “yes” vote on i732. Drew Mahedy Posted October 17th, 2016 at 12:51 PM | Permalink I have to agree with Cliff on your opposition to I-732. It doesn’t make sense. I recently just registered in Clark County after living in Clackamas County, OR specifically to vote ‘YES’ on this proposition. As a former Oregonian (no sales tax) and someone who is currently unemployed, I can tell you how shameful it is for organizations purporting to be concerned about climate change AND low-income/minority communities to be actively telling Washingtonians to vote against this measure in the hopes that, someday in the future, we will have a ‘divine’ carbon tax scheme that exacerbates this state’s already horribly regressive tax system. It’s a sleight of hand and nakedly political agenda. British Columbia passed a revenue neutral carbon tax in 2008 or 2009 and it has been successful. The entire country of Canada will now have carbon tax as well. Washington State now has that opportunity and you’re telling us ‘NO’ because it would cost the state of Washington $800 million over 3 bienniums? Did you forget to tell voters what Washington’s annual revenue generation is and what percent that new shortfall would be? Did you forget to tell voters that fixing the budget shortfall prior to putting it on the ballot was not politically feasible and that any changes to the tax system, including what Boeing pays, can be made after it passes? Did you forget to tell voters that if it wasn’t revenue neutral or close to revenue neutral, as you have proposed, than you would be adding an additional sales tax to a state that has no income tax, thereby hurting low income communities not helping them? Did you forget to tell voters that Washington’s true budget shortfall is the result of relying predominantly on a sales tax in the age of the Internet and that this new tax shift was never designed to fix that problem? Did you forget to tell voters that Washington’s initiative process is governed by the single-subject rule and any alternative proposal including spending collected tax from a carbon tax on a host of environmental group’s wish list items could be open to legal challenge? Did you forget to tell voters that Republicans and conservatives are also people, that their voices matter, that they vote, and that your Yoram Bauman quote is ironically apt? Did you forget to tell voters that if they pass this measure now, it becomes more politically feasible for other states including Oregon and California, should its cap and trade system be deemed a tax and scrapped, to implement their own carbon tax schemes thus snowballing the movement to mitigate increasing global temperatures in a country with the technology and GDP to do it? Did you forget to tell voters what the current costs and trends are for the price of renewable energy and that further subsidizing those industries runs the risk of entrenching corporate interests and idiosyncratic lobbying efforts for decades to come as was the case for fossil fuels? Did you forget to tell voters that Washington’s energy production portfolio is already majority renewable when including hydroelectricity and that a carbon tax in this state is designed to mitigate transportation sector carbon emissions not energy production unless you think EV’s and vehicle automation are already mature and fully adopted technologies? …And who in their right mind (out of all the things written in this post) thinks that Sound Transit 3 is the ‘REAL’ climate action plan compared to I-732? Every transportation engineer would find that claim laughable. You want to wait until 2040 with all the known issues and uncertainties surrounding large transportation projects projected decades in advance to see which one reduced CO2 emissions more up to that point in time? Bye bye coastal Florida. For the record, Seattle is not the entire state of Washington. Just, you know, FYI. You aren’t telling voters these things because, like the lobbying groups, you have a narrow focus and mindset on what is right and what isn’t. Frankly, I’m glad economists at UW and not environmental and labor groups wrote this proposition because they’re not up to the task. They miss the forest for the trees on issues of the gravest importance. If you’re going to wait around to mitigate fossil fuel use by not compromising when the opportunity presents itself, your shooting yourself (and everyone else including Earth) in the foot (read: face). Get your act together. This is editorialized nonsense! Jason Hodin Posted October 17th, 2016 at 7:17 PM | Permalink Dear Andrew and all My personal and professional opinion is that some progressive groups like NPI who are opposed to I-732 are clearly making perfect the enemy of good. Andrew, I respect your opinion about I-732 not putting the taxes towards infrastructure and other climate mitigation (or climate reduction) strategies, but I respectfully disagree that it is “fatally lawed”.. Just look at what you said about ST3 (which I also support): “…the entire Sound Transit system by 2040 would reduce an estimated 793,000 tons of greenhouse-gas emissions annually…” The operative part of that sentence is 2040! That’s 25 years from now, a time when scientists tell us that we will have already blown past the ability to keep warming to 2°C and ocean acidification will by some estimates have already doomed most of the world’s coral reefs. That is unless we drastically reduce carbon pollution now, something which many economists and scientists alike agree that a carbon tax has the best chance of accomplishing. Just as many of us in WA state voted for I-502 despite its flaws, I would likewise suggest a vote on I-732 even if you think it doesn’t go far enough. You all know full well that taxes are VERY difficult to pass in this state, hence the revenue neutrality of this initiative. This is the same approach currently working well in British Columbia for the past seven years, and it is the strategy advocated by one of the leading (and original) voices in the USA arguing for urgent action on climate change: Dr. James Hansen. As for the B&O tax credit, this is a drop in the bucket compared to the tax breaks that Boeing already gets, so I think this is a distraction from the real issue at hand. The bigger issue is this tax credit addresses a very valid concern with raising a statewide carbon tax: manufacturers may decide to relocate. The key is this: polluters will pay more, thus incentivizing lower carbon manufacturing and other lifestyle choices throughout the state. On such an urgent issue like climate change, we do not have the luxury to wait when we are so clearly long overdue addressing it. We need to act now and act boldly. Any slight variations from revenue neutrality in I-732 can be fixed legislatively, but extinct animals and flooded islands can’t. Please vote YES on I-732. Sincerely Jason Hodin, Ph.D. Senior Research Scientist UW Friday Harbor Marine Laboratory Friday Harbor, WA Andrew Posted October 28th, 2016 at 9:29 PM | Permalink Drew, Jason, thanks for stopping by and sharing your thoughts. I’m disappointed to hear proponents of CarbonWA’s I-732 continue to hold up British Columbia’s experience as some kind of a success story, when it’s nothing of the sort. Drew, you wrote: British Columbia passed a revenue neutral carbon tax in 2008 or 2009 and it has been successful. The entire country of Canada will now have carbon tax as well. And Jason, you wrote: You all know full well that taxes are VERY difficult to pass in this state, hence the revenue neutrality of this initiative. This is the same approach currently working well in British Columbia for the past seven years, and it is the strategy advocated by one of the leading (and original) voices in the USA arguing for urgent action on climate change: Dr. James Hansen. Your comments lead me to wonder just how familiar you both are with the politics of British Columbia. I have been up there to cover their elections for NPI. I’ve met with activists and candidates; I’ve attended campaign events held by both of the main political parties (the BCNDP and the B.C. Liberals). The reality is that B.C.’s emissions have been going up, not down. The province is simply not the climate action leader it claims to be, as the B.C. Sierra Club will tell you. The carbon tax they have is not keeping emissions in check. On Monday of this week, Food & Water Watch released a report examining B.C.’s carbon tax, concluding it has been a failure. They note: The Canadian province of British Columbia implemented a carbon tax on certain fossil fuels in July of 2008. Some experts and pricing proponents are using the British Columbia carbon tax example to promote carbon taxes and other market mechanisms as a way to purportedly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address our climate problem. Unfortunately for these free-market proponents, the real-world record fails to demonstrate that British Columbia’s carbon tax reduced carbon emissions, fossil fuel consumption or vehicle travel. Most of the modest and short-term reductions in emissions seem to be related primarily to the 2008 global recession, not to the carbon tax. More recently, British Columbia’s emissions have resumed their rise. This report examines the British Columbia program and finds that this type of pricing approach is not going to save the planet or safeguard our communities. A more straightforward approach of regulating emissions would be significantly more effective at curbing climate change. The full report is here. When I was up in B.C. in 2013 for the provincial election, Christy Clark (who’s still in charge of the province) was boasting about how liquefied natural gas (LNG) was the future — and the key to financing B.C.’s schools. I was horrified. She and her party pay lip service to the idea of climate action, but they seemingly haven’t met a pipeline or export terminal project they don’t like. The B.C. Liberals are gophers for the fossil fuels industry north of the border. In NPI’s view, they are one of the biggest groups of greenwashers in history. To slow down our planet’s fever, we MUST abandon fossil fuels. We have to ban fracking (a position Bernie Sanders spoke to during his campaign and thankfully pressed Hillary Clinton to adopt), we need a moratorium on oil/coal trains, we need to put the kibosh on all proposed coal/oil/LNG export terminals — we need to take aggressive action to stop perpetuating our dependence on fossil fuels. We can’t wait to do this. Under Christy Clark and the not-liberal B.C. Liberals, British Columbia is going in the WRONG DIRECTION. (Canada as a whole is having problems ending its fossil fuel dependency too.) Yet, merely because B.C. has a carbon tax it imposed years ago under a different government, it’s misleadingly being held up as this shining role model, again and again, by CarbonWA representatives in presentations they’ve given across this state, as a validation of the approach they’ve chosen. The Yes on 732 camp is not telling people the whole story about what’s going in British Columbia. That upsets me. The team at NPI stands in solidarity with the tribes and progressive activists in B.C. who are fighting every day to stop bad projects like the Kinder Morgan pipeline. We do not want to follow B.C.’s lead on energy and pollution pricing — they are the poster child for what NOT to do! If we’re going to implement a pollution tax here in Washington State, then let’s do it thoughtfully and let’s raise some revenue to address our infrastructure deficit. Instead of I-732, NPI would like to see us come together as a state to craft a policy that has near unanimous support from progressives and also earns the support of biconceptuals and reasonable, environmentally-conscious conservatives. We reject as totally false the contention that it’s 732 or nothing.

(April 2015) Travis Heying File photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story ORLANDO Honeywell Aerospace’s new forecast is a mixed bag for business jet manufacturers in Wichita and elsewhere. Honeywell’s 2016 Global Business Aviation Outlook, released Sunday, projects 8,600 business jet deliveries valued at $255 billion over the next decade. That’s 600 fewer jets and $25 billion less than its 2015 forecast, which is in its 25th year. It’s the second time in as many years that Honeywell has lowered its 10-year forecast projections from the prior year. In 2015, it lowered its forecast projections from 2014 by 250 jets and $10 billion. Slow and struggling economies in parts of the world are among the factors behind this year’s lower forecast projections, which over the length of the forecast average out to a 3 to 4 percent average annual growth rate for the industry, Honeywell officials said. “We continue to see relatively slow economic growth projections in many mature business jet markets,” said Brian Sill, president of commercial aviation for Honeywell Aerospace. “While developed economies are generally faring better, commodities demand, foreign exchange and political uncertainties remain as concerns.” Midterm interest But the forecast – released in advance of the National Business Aviation Association Convention & Exhibition that starts Tuesday in Orlando – does show some improved interest in new aircraft purchases in the midterm, especially between 2018 and 2019, Sill said. And North America – with historically the highest global demand for the light and midsize jets Bombardier Learjet and Textron Aviation build in Wichita – will continue to be a primary driver for new jets, representing nearly two-thirds of projected demand. The forecast is developed from sources such as aircraft manufacturers, macroeconomic analyses and interviews with more than 1,500 business jet operators, Honeywell said. Honeywell’s short-term projections call for deliveries of between 650 and 675 jets in 2016. Last year, the forecast projected business jet deliveries of between 675 and 725 new jets. According to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the industry delivered 654 jets in 2015. Waiting to take delivery In 2017, the forecast expects deliveries to be slightly lower than in 2016, though it didn’t quantify how much lower. The lower deliveries that year will partly reflect customers waiting to take delivery of new jet models slated for production in late 2017 and 2018, the forecast said. Twenty-one percent of new business jet purchase plans are expected to made by 2017, while 18 percent are expected to be made in both 2018 and 2019, the forecast said. In other words, more than half of new aircraft purchases over the forecast period will be made in a three-year window. The forecast projects only new business jet demand regionally over its first five years due in part to fluctuating currency values, slower global economic growth projections and political uncertainty, the forecast said. “What’s different here is we’ve still got really high exchange rates against our trading partners, we have not seen a rapid increase in commodity prices, and there’s no real change in geopolitical (circumstances),” said Charles Park, Honeywell Aerospace’s director of market analysis. Bulk in North America During the period, North America will account for the bulk of the demand at 65 percent, the forecast said, which is up from 61 percent in last year’s forecast. It’s followed by Europe at 14 percent, Latin America at 12 percent, Asia Pacific at 6 percent and Africa and the Middle East at 3 percent. Of those regions, Europe and Africa and the Middle East are flat, Latin America is down 6 percent, and Asia is up 3 percent compared with last year’s forecast. As with last year’s forecast, most business jet operators prefer big business jets, from super midsize to business liners such as Boeing Business Jets. “This is not a change,” Park said. “The operators have been very consistent in their preference.” Those aircraft are expected to account for more than 85 percent of expenditures in the next five years, the forecast said. That could be a positive for Textron Aviation, which expects to certify its super midsize Cessna Citation Longitude next year. It also plans to develop the large-cabin Citation Hemisphere in time for a 2019 first flight. But the preference for large jets does not signal the beginning of the end for small and midsize business jets. “That’s not to say the light jets and medium jets are fading away,” Park said. “They both physically expand in terms of units and dollar value” over the period.

A deal for 200 single-engine planes produced in India — which the air force says could rise to 300 as it fully phases out ageing Soviet-era aircraft — could be worth anything from $13- $15 billion, experts say, potentially one of the country’s biggest military aircraft deals. After a deal to buy high-end Rafale planes from France’s Dassault was scaled back to just 36 jets last month, the Indian Air Force is desperately trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength, now a third less than required to face both China and Pakistan. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration wants any further military planes to be built in India with an Indian partner to kickstart a domestic aircraft industry, and end an expensive addiction to imports. Lockheed Martin said it is interested in setting up a production line for its F-16 plane in India for not just the Indian military, but also for export. Offered Sweden’s Saab has offered a rival production line for its Gripen aircraft, setting up an early contest for one of the biggest military plane deals in play. “The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at,” said an air officer briefed on the Make-in-India plans under which a foreign manufacturer will partner local firms to build the aircraft with technology transfer. India’s defence ministry has written to several companies asking if they would be willing to set up an assembly line for single-engine fighter planes in India and the amount of technology transfer that would happen, another government source said. “We are testing the waters, testing the foreign firms’ willingness to move production here and to find out their expectations,” the person said. India’s air force originally planned for 126 Rafale twin-engine fighters from Dassault, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of local production with a state-run Indian firm and settled for 36 planes in a fl y-away condition. Adding to the military’s problems is India’s three-decade effort to build a single-engine fighter of its own which was meant to be the backbone of the air force. Only two of those Light Combat Aircraft, called Tejas, have been delivered to the air force which has ordered 140 of them. The Indian Air Force is down to 32 operational squadrons compared with the 45 it has said are necessary, and in March the vice chief Air Marshal B.S. Dhanoa told parliament’s defence committee that it didn’t have the operational strength to fight a two front war against China and Pakistan. Saab said it was ready to not only produce its frontline Gripen fighter in India, but help build a local aviation industry base. “We are very experienced in transfer of technology — our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line,” said Jan Widerstrm, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. He confirmed Saab had received the letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. A source close to the company said that while there was no minimum order set in stone for it to lay down a production line, they would expect to build at least 100 planes at the facility. Lockheed Martin said it had responded to the defence ministry’s letter with an offer to transfer the entire production of its F-16 fighter to India. “Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world’s only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world’s largest fighter aircraft supply chain,” Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India said in an email. Expanding Lockheed’s offer comes on the back of expanding U.S.-India military ties in which Washington has emerged as India’s top arms supplier in recent years, ousting old ally Russia. Earlier this year Boeing also offered India its twin-engine F/A-18 Hornets, but the level of technology transfer was not clear. India has never previously attempted to build a modern aircraft production line, whether military or civilian. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has assembled Russian combat jets including the Su-30, but these are under licensed production. “We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development,” said retired Indian air marshal M. Matheswaran, a former adviser at HAL. He said the Indian government would be looking at producing at least 200 fighters, and then probably some more, to make up for the decades of delay in modernising the air force.

A deal for 200 single-engine planes produced in India — which the air force says could rise to 300 as it fully phases out ageing Soviet-era aircraft — could be worth anything from $13-$15 billion (Dh47.7 billion-Dh55 billion), experts say, potentially one of the country’s biggest military aircraft deals. After a deal to buy high-end Rafale planes from France’s Dassault was scaled back to just 36 jets last month, the Indian Air Force is desperately trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength, now a third less than required to face both China and Pakistan. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration wants any further military planes to be built in India with an Indian partner to kick-start a domestic aircraft industry, and end an expensive addiction to imports. Lockheed Martin said it is interested in setting up a production line for its F-16 plane in India for not just the Indian military, but also for export. And Sweden’s Saab has offered a rival production line for its Gripen aircraft, setting up an early contest for one of the biggest military plane deals in play. “The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at,” said an air officer briefed on the Make-in-India plans under which a foreign manufacturer will partner local firms to build the aircraft with technology transfer. India’s defence ministry has written to several companies asking if they would be willing to set up an assembly line for single-engine fighter planes in India and the amount of technology transfer that would happen, another government source said. “We are testing the waters, testing the foreign firms’ willingness to move production here and to find out their expectations,” the person said. Operational gaps India’s air force originally planned for 126 Rafale twin-engined fighters from Dassault, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of local production with a state-run Indian firm and settled for 36 planes in a fly-away condition. Adding to the military’s problems is India’s three-decade effort to build a single-engine fighter of its own which was meant to be the backbone of the air force. Only two of those Light Combat Aircraft, called Tejas, have been delivered to the air force which has ordered 140 of them. The Indian Air Force is down to 32 operational squadrons compared with the 45 it has said are necessary, and in March the vice chief Air Marshal B.S. Dhanoa told parliament’s defence committee that it didn’t have the operational strength to fight a two front war against China and Pakistan. Jet makers respond Saab said it was ready to not only produce its front line Gripen fighter in India, but help build a local aviation industry base. “We are very experienced in transfer of technology — our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line,” said Jan Widerström, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. He confirmed Saab had received the letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. A source close to the company said that while there was no minimum order set in stone for it to lay down a production line, they would expect to build at least 100 planes at the facility. Lockheed Martin said it had responded to the defence ministry’s letter with an offer to transfer the entire production of its F-16 fighter to India. “Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world’s only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world’s largest fighter aircraft supply chain,” Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India said in an email. US top supplier Lockheed’s offer comes on the back of expanding US-India military ties in which Washington has emerged as India’s top arms supplier in recent years, ousting old ally Russia. Earlier this year Boeing also offered India its twin-engined F/A-18 Hornets, but the level of technology transfer was not clear. India has never previously attempted to build a modern aircraft production line, whether military or civilian. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has assembled Russian combat jets including the Su-30, but these are under licensed production. “We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development,” said retired Indian air marshal M. Matheswaran, a former adviser at HAL. He said the Indian government would be looking at producing at least 200 fighters, and then probably some more, to make up for the decades of delay in modernising the air force.

A deal for 200 single-engine planes produced in India - which the Air Force says could rise to 300 as it fully phases out aging Soviet-era aircraft - could be worth anything from $13-$15 billion, experts say, potentially one of the country`s biggest military aircraft deals. After a deal to buy high-end Rafale planes from France`s Dassault was scaled back to just 36 jets last month, the Indian Air Force is desperately trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength, now a third less than required to face both China and Pakistan. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi`s administration wants any further military planes to be built in India with an Indian partner to kickstart a domestic aircraft industry, and end an expensive addiction to imports.  Lockheed Martin said it is interested in setting up a production line for its F-16 plane in India for not just the Indian military, but also for export. And Sweden`s Saab has offered a rival production line for its Gripen aircraft, setting up an early contest for one of the biggest military plane deals in play. "The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at," said an air officer briefed on the Make-in-India plans under which a foreign manufacturer will partner local firms to build the aircraft with technology transfer. India`s defence ministry has written to several companies asking if they would be willing to set up an assembly line for single-engine fighter planes in India and the amount of technology transfer that would happen, another government source said. "We are testing the waters, testing the foreign firms` willingness to move production here and to find out their expectations," the person said. OPERATIONAL GAPS India`s air force originally planned for 126 Rafale twin-engine fighters from Dassault, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of local production with a state-run Indian firm and settled for 36 planes in a fly-away condition. Adding to the military`s problems is India`s three-decade effort to build a single-engine fighter of its own which was meant to be the backbone of the air force. Only two of those Light Combat Aircraft, called Tejas, have been delivered to the air force which has ordered 140 of them. The Indian Air Force is down to 32 operational squadrons compared with the 45 it has said are necessary, and in March the vice chief Air Marshal B.S. Dhanoa told parliament`s defence committee that it didn`t have the operational strength to fight a two front war against China and Pakistan. JET MAKERS RESPOND Saab said it was ready to not only produce its frontline Gripen fighter in India, but help build a local aviation industry base. "We are very experienced in transfer of technology – our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line," said Jan Widerström, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. He confirmed Saab had received the letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. A source close to the company said that while there was no minimum order set in stone for it to lay down a production line, they would expect to build at least 100 planes at the facility. Lockheed Martin said it had responded to the defence ministry`s letter with an offer to transfer the entire production of its F-16 fighter to India. "Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world`s only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world`s largest fighter aircraft supply chain," Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India said in an email. US TOP SUPPLIER Lockheed`s offer comes on the back of expanding U.S.-India military ties in which Washington has emerged as India`s top arms supplier in recent years, ousting old ally Russia. Earlier this year Boeing also offered India its twin-engine F/A-18 Hornets, but the level of technology transfer was not clear. India has never previously attempted to build a modern aircraft production line, whether military or civilian. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has assembled Russian combat jets including the Su-30, but these are under licensed production. "We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development," said retired Indian air marshal M. Matheswaran, a former adviser at HAL. He said the Indian government would be looking at producing at least 200 fighters, and then probably some more, to make up for the decades of delay in modernising the air force.

Picture: Munish Sharma Thomas Malthus was wrong for one simple reason. Humans have survived his 1798 forecast that growing populations wouldn't be able to feed themselves because innovation and productivity gains allowed them to produce more and more with the same amount of labour and capital: Irrigation, fertilizers, higher-yielding plant species and mechanisation have enabled farmers to grow 5 to 6 times the amount of grain from the same piece of land as a century ago. The problem is that similar productivity gains may no longer be possible -- or effective. There's general agreement about the factors that improve productivity. Investment in machinery and equipment increases production levels and quality. Education and training improve worker skills. New products, technologies, organisational structures and work arrangements - in other words, innovation - raise efficiency. A healthy climate for entrepreneurship and competition encourages the creation of faster, smarter businesses. Unfortunately, there's also general agreement that productivity gains are flatlining. In advanced economies, productivity growth has fallen below 1 percent annually, significantly lower than the 3 to 4 percent common in postwar decades and even less than the 2 to 2.5 percent of the last decades of the 20th century. Similar trend lines are beginning to appear in developing nations. Combined with stagnant or declining workforces, slowing productivity gains are a key factor suppressing growth worldwide. What no one can agree on is why this is happening. Some economists think traditional measures designed for manufacturing-heavy economies simply aren't detecting productivity gains in services, or the effect of newer, information-intensive technologies. There's also a natural lag between the introduction of new technologies and their full effect. It may simply be too soon to see productivity improvements. Fundamental issues Yet such factors have always been present to some degree; they'd also have affected earlier productivity estimates. The real issues are more fundamental - and intractable. Take the shift from manufacturing to services. The latter may not lend themselves to improvements as easily as industrial processes. They can't all be automated. Many are local and not globally traded, and so don't benefit from international supply chains. It's hard to improve on certain personal services. A one-hour massage always takes one hour. The non-routine and non-repetitive tasks involved in, say, healthcare and aged care can't easily be sped up. The immense gains in education and skills over the last 50 years may not be repeatable. Rising costs have placed higher education beyond the reach of many. They've also forced graduates to start their working lives with significant debts, undercutting the attractiveness of going to college. The rise in contract or part-time jobs has contributed to de-skilling, since workers have little incentive to invest in training. A lack of retraining means that the skill levels of older workers -- a rising share of the workforce - quickly become dated. Many "new" manufacturing technologies are already being extensively exploited. New energy technologies, such as fracking and renewables, aren't breakthroughs comparable to the discovery of hydrocarbons or electricity itself; they require certain conditions, such as high oil prices, to be efficient. Many biotech, IT and financial innovations are focused on lifestyle, longevity, consumption and entertainment -- all of which have limited productivity benefits. In many ways and many places, it's becoming harder to start and grow businesses. Regulations and class-action lawsuits have made doing business more complex and expensive. Anti-competitive behaviour makes life tough for would-be disrupters, even in the technology sector. There's now one major chipmaker (Intel), a few hardware makers, two dominant computer operating systems (Microsoft's Windows and Apple), two dominant mobile operating systems (Android and iOS) and one major suite of business software (Microsoft's Office). Cloud computing is the preserve of Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The internet is dominated by Google (search), Amazon (e-commerce) and Facebook (social networks). Among established companies, the frequently short tenures of chief executives and pressure to show short-term results work against productivity gains. Financial engineering to boost share prices is favoured over risky, longer-term initiatives such as research and development or staff training. And finally, since 2008, unconventional monetary policies have clearly distorted the economy. Low interest rates have impeded the shift of capital from inefficient to more efficient enterprises or industries, allowing unproductive businesses to live on. This has left capital tied up in marginal firms and restricted the supply of credit to smaller, often more innovative companies. Any benefit? Even if productivity growth could be revived, it's not clear those gains would have as much of an impact on living standards as in the past. Simply being able to make more stuff isn't terribly helpful in an era of excess capacity and also weak aggregate demand. Many innovations actually eliminate jobs and depress wages. They allow a few creators to capture large benefits but don't aid the majority of the population. A much-quoted study from Oxford University found that 47 percent of all jobs are threatened by automation. In 1967, Boeing employed 400 workers per each aircraft produced. By 2015, that number had dropped to 113 workers per aircraft, a decline of 72 percent. The company believes that the worker-to-aircraft ratio can be reduced another 60 percent in the next 20 years. Fewer workers mean even less demand. Given that consumption makes up 60 to 70 percent of economic activity in developed economies, productivity gains may thus depress rather than boost growth. Even if the world can solve this one conundrum, plenty more questions -- about employment, income and inequality - await. - Das is a former banker, whom Bloomberg named one of the world's 50 most influential financial figures in 2014.

(Photo: PTI) The Indian Air Force is trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength. New Delhi: India is offering to buy hundreds of fighter planes from foreign manufacturers - as long as the jets are made in India and with a local partner, air force officials say. A deal for 200 single-engine planes produced in India - which the air force says could rise to 300 as it fully phases out ageing Soviet-era aircraft - could be worth anything from $13-$15 billion, experts say, potentially one of the country's biggest military aircraft deals. After a deal to buy high-end Rafale planes from France's Dassault was scaled back to just 36 jets last month, the Indian Air Force is trying to speed up other acquisitions and arrest a fall in operational strength, now a third less than required to face both China and Pakistan. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration wants any further military planes to be built in India with an Indian partner to kickstart a domestic aircraft industry, and end an expensive addiction to imports. Lockheed Martin said it is interested in setting up a production line for its F-16 plane in India for not just the Indian military, but also for export. And Sweden's Saab has offered a rival production line for its Gripen aircraft, setting up an early contest for one of the biggest military plane deals in play. "The immediate shortfall is 200. That would be the minimum we would be looking at," said an air officer briefed on the Make-in-India plans under which a foreign manufacturer will partner local firms to build the aircraft with technology transfer. The defence ministry has written to several companies asking if they would be willing to set up an assembly line for single-engine fighter planes in India and the amount of technology transfer that would happen, another government source said. "We are testing the waters, testing the foreign firms' willingness to move production here and to find out their expectations," the person said. Operational Gaps India's air force originally planned for 126 Rafale twin-engine fighters from Dassault, but the two sides could not agree on the terms of local production with a state-run Indian firm and settled for 36 planes in a fly-away condition. Adding to the military's problems is India's three-decade effort to build a single-engine fighter of its own which was meant to be the backbone of the air force. Only two of those Light Combat Aircraft, called Tejas, have been delivered to the air force which has ordered 140 of them. The Indian Air Force is down to 32 operational squadrons compared with the 45 it has said are necessary, and in March the vice chief Air Marshal B.S. Dhanoa told parliament's defence committee that it didn't have the operational strength to fight a two front war against China and Pakistan. Jet Makers Respond Saab said it was ready to not only produce its frontline Gripen fighter in India, but help build a local aviation industry base. "We are very experienced in transfer of technology – our way of working involves extensive cooperation with our partners to establish a complete ecosystem, not just an assembly line," said Jan Widerström, Chairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. He confirmed Saab had received the letter from the Indian government seeking a fourth generation fighter. A source close to the company said that while there was no minimum order set in stone for it to lay down a production line, they would expect to build at least 100 planes at the facility. Lockheed Martin said it had responded to the defence ministry's letter with an offer to transfer the entire production of its F-16 fighter to India. Also In Top News "Exclusive F-16 production in India would make India home to the world's only F-16 production facility, a leading exporter of advanced fighter aircraft, and offer Indian industry the opportunity to become an integral part of the world's largest fighter aircraft supply chain," Abhay Paranjape, National Executive for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Business Development in India said in an email. US Top Supplier Lockheed's offer comes on the back of expanding U.S.-India military ties in which Washington has emerged as India's top arms supplier in recent years, ousting old ally Russia. Earlier this year Boeing also offered India its twin-engine F/A-18 Hornets, but the level of technology transfer was not clear. India has never previously attempted to build a modern aircraft production line, whether military or civilian. State-run Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) has assembled Russian combat jets including the Su-30, but these are under licensed production. "We have never had control over technology. This represents the most serious attempt to build a domestic base. A full or a near-full tech transfer lays the ground for further development," said retired Indian air marshal M. Matheswaran, a former adviser at HAL. He said the Indian government would be looking at producing at least 200 fighters, and then probably some more, to make up for the decades of delay in modernising the air force.
