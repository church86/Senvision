AutoZone operates seven stores in Hamilton County, two in Cleveland, two in Dalton, Ga., and others in Ringgold, Ga., Fort Oglethorpe, Athens, Tenn., Etowah, Tenn., and Pikeville, Tenn. The retailer said most of the new hiring will be at stores in Atlanta, Dallas, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio, New York City, New Orleans, Pittsburg and Oakland, Calif. AutoZone is the latest U.S. business to tout its hiring plans as Donald Trump becomes president. Trump has praised General Motors, Ford, Carrier, Wal-Mart and other businesses that also have announced expansion or hiring plans in the past month. AutoZone said it will be hiring sales representatives, delivery drivers, parts sales managers, commercial sales managers, store managers and hub specialists. Applications must be submitted online at the AutoZone careers site, www.autozone.com/careers. AutoZone said it has hired more than 10,000 current and former U. S. Military Service members since 2015 and has a goal of hiring more than 15,000 additional transitioning service members and military veterans by 2020. Boeing workers vote on Charleston union The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) filed petition Friday with the National Labor Relations Board to hold a union election for approximately 2,850 production employees at the Boeing Co. in North Charleston, S.C. The filing comes after the IAM postponed a scheduled April 22, 2015, union election amid political criticism of organized labor at the plant. "Boeing workers just want to be treated with the respect they deserve," said IAM Boeing SC Lead Organizer Mike Evans. "Why should they be subject to a different set of standards and rules than folks building the exact same plane in Seattle?" Evans said "it was impossible to hold a free and fair election" in 2015, but he thinks the union is now ready for a union certification election. Workers have remained in contact with IAM organizers in recent months regarding numerous workplace concerns that remain unaddressed, including subjective raises, inconsistent scheduling policies and a lack of respect on the shop floor, Evans said. The NLRB is expected to issue election dates and locations in the coming weeks. The IAM already represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 locations nationwide. China's growth slows as trade war looms BEIJING — China's economic growth sank to a three-decade low in 2016 as its struggling exporters brace for a possible trade battle with President-elect Donald Trump. Growth in the quarter ending in December ticked up to 6.8 percent over 2015, supported by government spending and a real estate boom, a gain from the previous quarter's 6.7 percent, government data showed Friday. Still, for the full year, growth came in at a lackluster 6.7 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2015 and the weakest since 1990's 3.9 percent. That temporary upturn is unlikely to last, economists said. 'Net neutrality' foe named to head FCC President Donald Trump has reportedly picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era "net neutrality" rules to be chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and internet connections. Citing unidentified people, Bloomberg and Politico both reported Friday that the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission will be Ajit Pai, an old hand at the agency. Pai's chief of staff, Matthew Berry, declined to comment. FCC spokesmen did not immediately reply to emails. Pai is one of the two Republican commissioners on a five-member panel that regulates the country's communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service. Las Vegas Sands pays to end probe Las Vegas Sands Corp. will pay almost $7 million to U.S. authorities to end a more than five-year corrupt practices investigation, company and federal officials said Thursday. With the agreement, the company resolved twin probes over more than $60 million paid to an unnamed agent retained in 2006 to acquire a Chinese basketball team, plus other business dealings that include a Beijing real estate deal to promote casinos on the Cotai Strip of Macao. The company wasn't charged with a crime and did not admit guilt in either case. Apple depicts Qualcomm as a shady monopolist SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. Mars Skittles to be used for cattle feed Mars Inc. says it doesn't know why Skittles found on a rural Wisconsin highway might have been headed to become cattle feed. The case began when a Wisconsin sheriff posted on Facebook this week that "hundreds of thousands of Skittles" had been found spilled on a highway. Later, he updated the post to say the candy had fallen off a truck on its way to be cattle feed. A variety of food byproducts are commonly used for animal feed, and Skittles maker Mars says it has procedures for discarding foods for that purpose. However, the company said the Skittles in question came from a factory that doesn't sell unused products for animal feed. AT&T adds 200,000 DirectTV subscribers AT&T beat analysts' expectations and signed up new pay-TV customers for the first time in seven quarters with its new online video streaming service, DirecTV Now. The streaming service offers a lineup that's similar to cable TV but doesn't require a cable box, satellite dish or annual contract. The Dallas-based company reported that at least 200,000 video subscribers signed up in the fourth quarter, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts were expecting 61,000, according to a Bloomberg report. AT&T launched the new service in late November and pushed a promotional offer for early subscribers of $35 a month for 100-plus channels. That same channel lineup is now $60 a month. AT&T is the largest pay-TV provider in the U.S. with more than 25 million subscribers but it faces a more competitive and fragmented TV landscape. Cable and satellite subscribers are on the decline. The company must fend off new rivals like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. AT&T's answer is its own video streaming service: DirecTV Now. The streaming service includes a more traditional cable lineup but is missing the CBS network and features such as DVR. Customers must pay extra for premium channels, HBO and Cinemax.

Carolina plant By Dominic Gates, The Seattle Times Published: January 20, 2017, 3:58 PM A   A The Machinists union announced Friday that it will file for a new vote to organize production workers at Boeing’s manufacturing complex in North Charleston, S.C., according to a person familiar with the plans. Detailed arrangements for the vote among roughly 3,000 eligible workers must be agreed on by the union and company through the National Labor Relations Board, a process that typically takes three to five weeks. The union filing will trigger a fresh wave of impassioned propaganda from both the International Association of Machinists and Boeing as each tries to sway the workforce during the run-up to the vote. The union had indicated in November that a vote would come soon and that it expects this time to be successful after a failed attempt to organize in 2015. In anticipation of the IAM announcement, Boeing issued a statement Thursday suggesting that the union’s primary focus is preserving jobs in the Puget Sound region, not North Charleston. “We’ve said consistently over the past several years, and we continue to believe, that a union is not in the best interest of our teammates, our business, our community or our state,” Boeing said. “Our position has not changed.” Boeing sent mailings to the homes of its South Carolina employees in November aimed at convincing them to resist the union’s overtures. However, the IAM’s move to file for a vote indicates it has managed to get more than 30 percent of the workers to sign cards requesting union representation. The union called a previous vote in March 2015, but canceled it a month later before the vote actually took place when it sensed a lack of majority support. It’s likely union officials wouldn’t file again now unless feedback from workers has given them more confidence about the outcome. With President Donald Trump taking office on the same day as the IAM announcement, the vote in South Carolina will likely stoke political fires. Trump will immediately be able to appoint two new members to the NLRB, which could mark a shift in future rulings. The labor-secretary nominee — Andrew Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which owns the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. restaurant chains — has been critical of the NLRB. And South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a fierce opponent of the IAM organizing Boeing, will also be a Cabinet member as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations. The total workforce at Boeing South Carolina now stands at just over 7,600 people, down more than 600 jobs since the peak last March.

The latest addition, the Arrow 3, became operational on Wednesday. The system has a range up to 2,400 km and can be used as an anti-satellite weapon.

TRANSCRIPT This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. It’s "War, Peace and the Presidency." We’re broadcasting on this Inauguration Day special live from WHUT on the campus of Howard University here in the nation’s capital. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. NERMEEN SHAIKH: We’re less than four hours away from the inauguration of Donald Trump. Protests have already begun here in the streets of Washington. To talk more about the inauguration of Trump, we’re joined now by two guests. AMY GOODMAN: Naomi Klein is the author of This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate. And Lee Fang is with us, the investigative journalist at The Intercept covering the intersection of money and politics. His latest piece, "Who’s Paying for Inauguration Parties? Companies and Lobbyists with a Lot at Stake." Naomi, let’s start with you. You’ve come here to Washington, D.C. You’ve been following the election and what’s taken place. Your thoughts? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, it’s—I mean, I think there’s a few things we need to remember this morning, which is certainly a destabilizing day for a lot of your viewers and listeners and for all of us, really. You know, as we’ve already heard—right?—he did not win the popular vote. And I think, in addition to that, and I know this is maybe not the most popular thing to say when everyone is calling for unity among progressives, you know, I think even within this rigged system that suppresses so many votes, he didn’t win it. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party establishment lost it. It was low enthusiasm, low voter turnout on their side that gave the election to Trump. And I think that’s important to understand even amidst these calls for unity, because if that truth gets buried, then the mistakes will be repeated. The other thing that I think is really important, and it’s—I think it’s fantastic that people are on the streets last night, today all day—it is so important to push back in these early days, when they’re going to be throwing a whole lot at us. We’re seeing talk of a shock-and-awe budget. By the way, let’s not call it a "skinny budget." This is another rebranding campaign, like "alt-right." This is a savage budget that would cut $10 trillion, they’re talking about, that would attack programs targeted towards violence against women, renewable energy, environmental justice. I mean, they’re going after everything. But the point is, is that Trump—I mean, we know the transition is in disarray. And it seems as if they’re outsourcing the whole thing to the Heritage Foundation, which is what they’re there for, right? They have this infrastructure. They’ve got all of these policies and budgets ready to go. But this is going to be incredibly unpopular. And so, if people push back really hard, and it sees Trump’s approval rating drop even more—one thing we know about Donald Trump: He likes firing people. This we know. And I think that the people who he has outsourced to right now could get blamed very early on and pushed out, and I think that would be very important, because I think when it comes to economics, there’s a fair amount of evidence that he’s not an ideologue. But this is—but I think we’re headed for a very, very ideological push. AMY GOODMAN: Last night at the Peace Ball, you called this a corporate coup d’état. What do you mean? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, I think one of the things that’s remarkable about his appointees is just how many—you know, how many CEOs are going into these positions, and just this process of kind of cutting out the middleman, right? Exxon running the State Department. AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask: Where were you when you heard that Rex Tillerson, at the time the current CEO of ExxonMobil— NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: —the largest private oil company in the world, was nominated? NAOMI KLEIN: And not just any oil company. You know, this is a company that is the main target of the climate movement, that is under investigation by multiple states’ attorneys general and the SEC for its various deceptions, financial and climate deceptions, the target of a huge campaign, because this is a company that was doing really some of the most important research into the reality of climate change back in the 1970s and then bankrolled the deceptions that lost us decades of climate action in the 1990s, and really up into the present day. So, I don’t know—I don’t remember exactly where I was. But in some ways, you know, to echo something Bill McKibben has said, my colleague at 350, you know, it takes the mask off, right? Because these companies, as Lee well knows, I mean, they already had a huge amount of influence, but now it’s almost like they’re tired of playing the game, they’re tired of the cajoling and the bankrolling and the legalized bribery, and they’re just going to do the job themselves—you know, cut out the middleman. And so we see that with Tillerson. We see that with labor, as well. AMY GOODMAN: Whether Puzder makes his way to actually being labor secretary is very interesting. NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah, yeah. But, I mean, one thing I would say about both these cases is—and I think this is, once again, important to remember on a day like today, when a lot of people feel so demoralized—these guys are panicked because of the power of rising social movements. Right? I mean, why is Puzder so panicked? Because of the Fight for 15. Because of the wave of victories for a living wage. Because of the—because of the very real possibility that Bernie Sanders could have won, and he would have taken that movement demand and brought it to the federal level, to federal policy. That was his campaign promise. And Tillerson, I mean, the biggest threat he faces is the goals that are enshrined in the Paris Accord, these hard-won goals to keep temperatures below 1.5 to 2 degrees. That would be the end of his business model, right? So this, you know, what I called a corporate coup, is really—it’s really about panic as much as anything else, and holding back these tides of progress on multiple fronts. You know, Steve Mnuchin and his friends are also worried about their business model and about the—about Occupy, about the Sanders campaign, about the regulation that they would face. So, you know, I think we should see this in some ways as sort of a panicked last gasp. But that doesn’t mean we don’t need to confront it with everything we have. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, let’s go to what’s going on today in Washington, D.C., the inauguration. Lee, your piece, most recent piece, out yesterday, is called "Who’s Paying for Inauguration Parties? Companies and Lobbyists with a Lot at Stake." So tell us: Who is paying? LEE FANG: Well, we don’t know the full list of sponsors of the different inauguration festivities, but there are private events and, of course, the official inauguration events associated with the Trump transition. And these are all festivities that are privately financed. And according to some reports, we know that the official Trump inauguration events are sponsored by companies like AT&T, Boeing. And they’re offered these special packages where if they provide a certain amount to finance these parties that are going on all over Washington, they get private meet and greets with the incoming a administration and the nominees for Cabinet. They get to party with the leadership of the congressional GOP. And, you know, these companies have tens of billions of dollars, if not more, at stake over the next four years. Boeing, for example, has lots of military contracts. They rely on government subsidies through the Export-Import Bank. AT&T would like a repeal of net neutrality, the rules won by the Obama administration over the last four years. And, of course, we might see another era of mergers and acquisitions, which, of course, need regulatory approval. So, the swamp, as it were, is welcoming the Trump administration, and they’re hoping to get in early to win access. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, is it unusual, though? Who typically pays for inauguration parties? Like, what happened in previous elections? LEE FANG: No, and I think that’s an important point to make. From, you know, Bill Clinton to Reagan to Obama, a lot of candidates campaigned to throw the bums out and challenge the establishment. But too often, you know, this city, Washington, D.C., is run by lobbyists. They control the most powerful institutions. They set the parameters of the debate. And when candidates, like Donald Trump, who promised to take on the establishment, to challenge these elites, as he’s getting to Washington, he’s being quickly coopted. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I mean, that’s one of the striking things about his appointments, the fact that there’s so many people from Goldman Sachs, when he spent so much of his time campaigning criticizing Clinton for her ties to Goldman Sachs. LEE FANG: Yeah, no, and I think that’s important to realize. You know, if you look at this Cabinet, it’s filled with CEOs and other elites. And I think in the next hundred days, we will actually see a kind of a class war. Trump promised to take on these globalists, these— NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. LEE FANG: —economic elites. But we will see, the next hundred days, a ruthless agenda on behalf of these same elites against worker protections, climate regulations. It’s very likely that some of the very first executive orders that come out of the Trump administration are attempts to repeal much of the Obama legacy. You know, Obama only had control or a friendly Congress for two years of his administration. Most of his legacy were administrative rules, agency action. And those reforms are very fragile. It’s very easy to repeal those type of rule makings. So we’ll see an attempt to chip away at everything, from the Clean Power Plan to protections for retirement security, protections for workers trying to organize at fast-food restaurants—there’s a recent joint employer rule from the Labor Department—everything from those rules to more obscure rules that govern food safety. AMY GOODMAN: I was watching Fox News yesterday, and one of the hosts said that Donald Trump has three balls, and Obama had many more balls, which was a very interesting comment he made. But he actually was talking about these events that are taking place. The number of people who’ve come out, far, far fewer, to say the least. I think at the big concert last night, there were something like 10,000 people, compared to 400,000 people for Obama. But, Lee, you write about the Black Tie & Boots Inaugural Ball, a party by—for Texas lawmakers. Explain who is funding it. LEE FANG: Yeah, I mean, this is an event—you know, many of these parties that go on outside the kind of official inauguration ball schedule—I mean, there are parties all over Washington. They’re attempting to influence the lower-level administrative staffers, to get congressional members kind of on board with the corporate agenda. And so, you know, the Texas delegation, that’s the Black Tie & Boots Ball, they’re throwing a big party in Prince George’s County near Washington, D.C., and it’s sponsored by a number of corporate interests that are going to be pushing very hard on the issues we just mentioned, many different oil companies, firms like ExxonMobil and Koch Industries, that would like to see more fracking on federal lands, a repeal of many of the different EPA rules and the methane rule that came out very recently from the Obama administration. They’ve got very clear motives here. But for the time being, they’re going to be paying for the hors d’oeuvres and the festivities all weekend. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Lee Fang, can you tell us a little bit—you talked about what Trump might do in his first hundred days. There are limits on certain things he can do, because he requires congressional approval. But some of the things you mentioned, he doesn’t require congressional approval for at all, so he may well succeed in doing that in the next just slightly over three months— LEE FANG: Right. NERMEEN SHAIKH: —including cuts on, you know, climate payments and the federal regulations you spoke of. LEE FANG: Yeah, I mean, he’s going to go after these rules in a number of ways. One way is through a fairly obscure law called the Congressional Review Act. That’s a special law that allows a resolution of disapproval, and that can affect regulations passed over just the last few months, not the last few—last six years. Still, many of those rules came out late in the Obama administration. And Democrats cannot filibuster a Congressional Review Act resolution. So, with Republican majorities in Congress, there’s nothing stopping them from passing a CRA resolution of disapproval to roll back many of those rules, potentially hundreds. And, of course, there are executive orders that he can take to revoke Obama’s executive orders. And once he fills these agencies with his staff, they can carve out exceptions to the rules and make them, even if not officially repealed, effectively useless. AMY GOODMAN: Before we wrap up this hour—we’re actually broadcasting for seven hours through the inauguration, bringing it to people live, as well as going to the streets with our reporters on the scene where protests are happening. Thousands of activists are already out this morning. Naomi Klein, tomorrow, a massive march is planned right here in Washington, D.C., Women March on Washington, D.C. Hundreds of thousands are expected, if not more. NAOMI KLEIN: Mm-hmm, yeah. And I think, once again, these—you know, we know he understands numbers, and, as we heard from Michael Moore, we know he’s very thin-skinned and is thrown by a few hundred. So, you know, close to a million people or however many people are on the streets tomorrow, I think it’s going to be destabilizing. And this sort of show of force is tremendously important. It is significant that it seems that he’s going after programs for violence against women, as perhaps one of his first acts. And frankly, you know, misogyny is a thread that connects so many of his appointments, this drive to denigrate women. And I think just showing that we’re not afraid is going to be incredibly important. And I think it’s also important that the march is as diverse as it is, that it is going to be led in many ways by women of color, and I think that this is part of not repeating the mistakes of the campaign. AMY GOODMAN: And your thoughts on the number of congressmembers who are boycotting the inauguration? NAOMI KLEIN: You know, I think it’s all good. I mean, all these acts of courage in standing up to a bully is incredibly important. But, you know, I think there’s every reason to believe that he’s going to employ a strategy of trying to overwhelm people. This has been a strategy just in terms of confusion and distraction, this sort of shock-and-awe approach. And so, staying unified, staying focused, having each other’s backs, this is all going to be tremendously important in the weeks to come, because, you know, I think that if we win a few key victories in the early days, it’s going to be very destabilizing, and it may lead to a reassessment because of the chaos in there. But if we lose those, you know, they’ll taste blood. AMY GOODMAN: Well, Naomi Klein, we hope you will stay with us. We’re broadcasting throughout the day today. For those who are leaving us now, if your station is leaving us, you can go to democracynow.org. Lee Fang, thanks so much for being with us. LEE FANG: Thank you for having me. AMY GOODMAN: You’re going out in the streets—of The Intercept. We’ll link to your piece. And we will be broadcasting for seven hours on this Inauguration Day. Saturday from 10:00 Eastern Standard Time in the morning to 3:00, we’ll be broadcasting from the main stage at the Women’s March on Washington. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

Expectations are high for a flurry of excitement and activity from Washington in the week ahead as President Trump gets to work. But markets probably will not yet get much in the way of clues on how quickly the new administration will push the tax and growth policies that have driven both stocks and interest rates higher. Trump is expected to make the repeal of Obamacare a priority. He is also seen moving quickly on the topics of trade with Mexico, immigration and regulations in areas like energy. However, it's less likely that there will be much new on the programs markets care about most since they also must wind through Congress. As traders fixate on Washington, there are also about 20 percent of the S&P 500 companies reporting in the coming week, including Alphabet, Boeing, Caterpillar, Microsoft and McDonald's. Of the S&P companies already reporting, 65 percent have beaten earnings estimates, and earnings growth based on the reports and estimates looks to be 6.5 percent for the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Traders had hoped Trump would play up the pro-growth agenda during his inaugural address Friday. Instead, he focused on the theme of putting America first in a speech that had a strong protectionist ring. "I expect volatility to be a little bit higher in the first 100 days than it was in the last part of 2016, when there was a sigh of relief and focus was more on the macro and the hopes for the macro," said Kate Moore, BlackRock chief equity strategist. "We're going to have a lot more volatility, as some of this policy gets ironed out and we get more clarity." She said it could take a while to see what tax reform will look like. "I think we will get a little more clarity and then it's very likely we will have a slightly better road map when it comes to taxes over the next two months. I think that's going to be hugely important. We will have more comments and certainly more sense of the road map when it comes to trade," she said. Moore said one of Trump's most important comments in the past week was that the dollar is too strong. A strong dollar hurts corporate profits and hurts emerging markets. "The main takeaway I had from Trump and his comments on the dollar … was an acknowledgment that we don't want the dollar to be too strong, going into trade negotiations," said Moore. She said long dollar is a very crowded trade and she does not believe it will appreciate as much as many expect. That's simply because the global is improving and differences in monetary policy and growth between the U.S. and other regions won't be as great. Moore said she's neutral on U.S. stocks and would become more bullish if earnings continue to improve and there's more clarity around policy from Washington. She said there is a lot of reason for more dispersion on stock performance. "It's going to be from growth, inflation, policy and [Trump's] tweets and very likely how effective companies have been in containing their costs and managing to maintain their margins at this point," she said. "It seems to me there are a lot of reasons for differentiation at this point." Stocks in the past week were flattish, with the S&P 500 down 0.2 percent at 2,271, and the Dow was about 0.3 percent lower at 19,827. Treasury yields had a big move in the past week, with the 10-year nearly touching 2.30 percent and rising to 2.50 percent by Friday. Moore likes small caps and also emerging markets. "I think the fears of a trade war are overblown. It's one of the reasons we continued to be maintaining a constructive outlook for emerging markets," she said. She said Trump's inaugural comments Friday were "downbeat" and it was disappointing that he pointed to problems in the economy when there is near full employment and earnings growth is picking up. The fact Trump's comments sounded protectionist unsettled some in the markets who were hoping he would sound more traditional and not as if he could start a trade war. Economists put trade concerns at the top of the list of what could change the growth outlook. "By far the number one issue on the global economy in the next year is how far down the path of trade tensions do we go here, and mixed into those is also geopolitical tensions as well. So do we have a gradual process, where there's some concession on all sides and things will move smoothly, or do things get very heated and people start to worry about serious back-and-forth tariffs?" said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Trump is expected to open talks with Mexico and Canada on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in place since the 1990s. He has called for tariffs on Mexican produced goods though he is not expected to take any action yet. Mexico's president called a press conference on Monday at which he is expected to discuss trade with the U.S. Harris said it will be important to see how Trump deals with China. Trump in the past week said he would not label the country a currency manipulator right away, as he threatened, and that he would speak to Chinese officials first. Harris said China has been trying to prevent its currency from falling, not pushing it lower. "Certainly Trump is going to want to do something that gets China's attention … something that kind of jolts the negotiating process," he said. "I don't know whether that will be what he does out of the gate. It could be after he waits for some of the other stuff like the Affordable Care Act to go through. I think it's a first 100 days story." For the U.S. markets next week, Harris said fourth-quarter GDP released on Friday will be important. He expects growth of 2.4 percent, a bit higher than consensus. "Basically if you look at the broad data story right now, the economy is showing a little sign of picking up. Confidence is picking up. Some of this is optimism is about fiscal policy and deregulation, and some of this was already happening in the data before the election," said Harris. He said Trump has so far been a positive for the economy and now risks being negative if he is too aggressive on trade. "He's taking over at a pretty good time. The economy is at full employment, wages are beginning to accelerate. You're not in a world where the Fed has to tighten too quickly. It is a positive way to start," Harris said. "Right or wrong, a president gets credit for the economy. He is inheriting a good economy. Obama inherited a disaster." Moore also said the economy was already kicking in to a better gear before the election. "We actually think growth and reflation and momentum started before the U.S. election. The market acknowledged the momentum, and that turning point was super charged by the U.S. election," she said. She's looking to hear more from Trump on his plans. "It was not perhaps the most optimistic presidential speech I've heard. I think the real key is how Trump and his cabinet pivot to be truly looking forward instead of just criticizing what has and hasn't' happened and perceived weakness in the U.S. economy," she said.

Linda Feldmann Staff writer | @linda_feldmann Francine Kiefer Staff writer | @kieferf Story Hinckley Staff writer | @storyhinckley January 20, 2017 Washington—“We all want the same thing,” President Donald Trump said Friday to members of Congress and other dignitaries. “We're all good people, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, it doesn't make any difference. We're going to get along.” President Trump’s message of goodwill at the traditional post-inaugural congressional luncheon seemed more an expression of hope over reality, in a political system that has grown increasingly polarized over the years. And as violence broke out on the streets of Washington Friday – away from the inaugural festivities but aimed at marring an otherwise orderly transfer of presidential power – it was clear that words alone will not be enough to heal the nation’s divisions. Protesters threw rocks, smashed windows, and lit small fires; police deployed tear gas and flash bangs. Six officers were injured, and 217 protesters were arrested. The last time there was large-scale unrest at an inauguration was in 1969, when antiwar protests led to dozens of arrests. In all, it made for moments of anger and frustration, but violence didn’t typify the day. Groups of people wearing “Make America Great Again” caps walked by anti-Trump groups wearing pink knitted hats – the headgear of choice for Saturday’s big women’s march – and seemed to largely ignore each other. Could you pass a US citizenship test? Find out. Inauguration Day, of course, brings many who wish to celebrate and support the man they sent to Washington. Theirs were expressions of joy on a day meant to celebrate a hallmark of American democracy – the peaceful transfer of power. From left, Amy Kelash, Ann Kelash, and Jeb Strehlo call family members from National Mall after arriving on a bus from Gilman, Minn., for the 58th Presidential Inauguration on Friday in Washington. Ann Hermes/The Christian Science Monitor | Caption The Graham family – mom, dad, and college student son – drove in overnight from Bristol, Tenn., to show their support for the new president, waving Trump flags and wearing Trump hats and T-shirts. None had ever attended an inauguration before. So why now? “Because I’m a huge supporter of Donald Trump, and I think he’ll make America great again,” said Steve Graham, an electrician. How? Mr. Graham has a ready list: fixing the economy, securing the border, strengthening the military. “I think he’s a man of his word, and he’ll hold true to it.” His wife, Darlene Graham, a realtor, says her No. 1 reason for supporting Trump is “his stand with Jesus Christ and his support for the state of Israel.” Mr. Graham expects quick action, and quick results. Ms. Graham gives Trump a year to improve the nation. And son Justin says he’ll assess Trump’s performance by the midterm elections in 2018. Everybody, it seemed, was eager to express their opinions – with both supporters and detractors expressing outsize views about the man and what he can accomplish. Polarized opinions Mary Moga did not vote for Trump. Nor did she vote for Hillary Clinton. And yet, standing before the festooned Capitol as the seated inaugural audience began to break up, she described the experience as “electric” and “surreal.” She came, she said, because “it’s about the US.” But she also came to march. Ms. Moga, who is from Seattle, and her cousin, Debby Burger of San Diego, both plan to take part in the Women’s March on Washington Saturday. Ms. Burger campaigned for Hillary Clinton. Just as a reporter asked what they thought of the speech, Moga’s daughter – one of five children she’s raised – passed by answering, “It was a joke.” Cousin Burger chimed in. “He’s promising all these things he never could do.” “I just hope and pray he surrounds himself with quality people,” added Moga. Spectators wait in the rain on the National Mall in Washington Friday before the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. John Minchillo/AP | Caption Chad Suenram, standing rows away from where Donald Trump had just given his inauguration speech, came away feeling completely the opposite. He says he was “blown away.” What he really liked was Trump’s message about “the positivity of the US prospering, of everyone growing together and just bringing back America.” The promise of prosperity was the main reason Mr. Suenram, who has four kids, voted for Trump. The Kansan, wearing an “All Lives Matter” button on his sweatshirt, says he came from “a struggle,” growing up in a trailer park. He started his own business in landscaping and has combined it with a foreclosure business. Through that, he’s seen a lot of families get kicked out of their homes. “Like Barack Obama said, ‘It’s time for change,’ ” Suenram grinned. The businessman, who jumped on a plane at the last minute to get to Washington, echoed much of what Trump said in his inaugural speech. His greatest hope for the years ahead is that America prosper, “and for the wealth to come back to the common people.” For Gordon Swanson, a retired Boeing employee from Everett, Wash., who flew in two days ago to celebrate, the joy of watching Trump came with a bitter note. He hadn’t put on his crisp, red “Make America Great Again” cap until he arrived at Union Station that morning, when inauguration revelers began to arrive. “I knew I potentially would be challenged by somebody” who didn’t agree with Trump, he said. “It didn’t used to be this way,” he lamented, saying that the country had turned too far to the left under President Obama, whom he described as “negligent.” This day was about the future, he said. “I hope his nominee for the Supreme Court will have a big effect. I’m not so worried about myself, but I’ve got three grandkids,” he said, perched on a stool beside an eatery at Union Station, Washington’s main train station. Beyond the pageant Outside the secure inauguration area, the scene was dramatically different. By early afternoon, thousands of protesters walked down I Street toward Franklin Square waving posters for Black Lives Matter, Dakota Access Pipeline resistance, and lesbian, gay, transgender, and bisexual rights. The march seemed orderly enough – thousands of people sticking to the streets while pedestrians took pictures from the sidewalks, some of them wearing "Make America Great Again" hats. But an undercurrent of hostility eventually broke through. A nearby Starbucks and Bank of America ATM station had their glass windows shattered by protesters. Armed guards stood nearby to prevent looting, and stores put up makeshift “closed” signs – though customers were still inside. Pro- and anti-Trump chants sprang up, with one protester telling a young man in a red hat, "Join us. We are doing this for you, too." Protesters burn trash outside the offices of The Washington Post as they react to the swearing in of President Donald Trump in Washington Friday. James Lawler Duggan/Reuters | Caption Eventually, some of the demonstrators began throwing rocks and bottles at police officers. Newspaper vending machines outside The Washington Post were tipped over and set on fire. At other locations around the city, protesters tried to block access to various inaugural events, though there were no other reports of violence. Beneath the tension was a sense of determination. Hillary Klein was at the protests with her sister, who was dressed as Lady Liberty with a red sash reading “RESISTANCE.” To her, the day reinforced a sense of community. “The one thing that has given me a real sense of hope since the election is the real sense that we do have each other's backs – people saying that to me, and me saying that to other people. [We’re] saying, 'I've got your back, and I've got your back, and we're going to get through this together,” Ms. Klein said. “It’s about making sure nobody feels alone in these moments.” Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 20, 2017 at 6:52PM Friday was a positive day for the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrials climbed by 95 points and there were similarly modest advances for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The inauguration of the 45th president of the U.S. commanded the attention of many, both on and off Wall Street today, but many market participants pointed to the day's gains as a natural bounce after five straight days of losses for the Dow. With the broader market waiting for more clarity on the political and economic outlook looking ahead to the rest of the year, many investors looked to individual stocks rather than the market, as a whole. Among the worst performers today were Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Image source: Rite Aid. Rite Aid investors fear FTC rejection Rite Aid plunged 13% in the wake of reports that the Federal Trade Commission might oppose its proposed merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). Rite Aid had hoped that its proposal to sell 865 of its drugstore locations to Fred's (NASDAQ:FRED) would be enough to satisfy the FTC, but skeptics are concerned that Fred's might not have the capacity to provide ample competition to Walgreens and CVS Health if the Rite Aid merger happens. After today's drop, Rite Aid trades at a 17% discount to the proposed $9 per-share buyout price, and that shows just how scared investors are that the deal won't go through as planned. Bristol-Myers Squibb slows down Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 11% after saying late Thursday that it would not seek an accelerated regulatory review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its proposed combination therapy for lung cancer. Many investors had hoped that the combination of its Yervoy and Opdivo drugs would prove effective enough to spur Bristol to look for fast-track approval, especially in light of the FDA approval of a key competitor's drug for lung cancer. Nevertheless, Bristol didn't give details in its release, leaving many to speculate that the treatment's effectiveness might not have been as high as they had hoped. Now, investors will have to wait to see Bristol's next move. TransDigm loses altitude Finally, TransDigm Group lost 10%. The aerospace components and systems supplier found itself the target of short-selling research firm Citron Research and analyst Andrew Left, whose report suggested that the company might be "the Valeant of the aerospace industry." In particular, the report capitalized on criticism that President Trump has attributed to Boeing and Lockheed Martin, suggesting that the pricing practices that TransDigm uses could be even more egregious. Citron's valuation of the stock wasn't quite as dire as some of its past calls have been, suggesting that the shares might be worth $166. Yet that's still more than 25% lower than where TransDigm closed today, and it will be interesting to see if the new president takes note of the attack from Left. Dan Caplinger owns shares of Boeing.

The ULA Atlas V launching. Image: united launch alliance By Miriam Kramer2017-01-21 02:02:43 UTC The day Donald Trump was sworn in as president, this rocket was busy ditching Earth.  The rose gold-hued Atlas V lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 7:42 p.m. ET on Friday.  SEE ALSO: This rocket company clearly wants to be as cool as SpaceX The rocket's payload — the Air Force's Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) GEO Flight 3 satellite — is designed to help detect missile launches worldwide. The SBIRS mission is "considered one of the nation's highest priority space programs," according to the United Launch Alliance (ULA), which sent the rocket into space.  While the ULA launch and the presidential inauguration weren't related, it didn't stop people (including this reporter) from making jokes about the timing of the two events.

SAVE YOURSELF! GET AWAY WHILE YOU STILL CAN! — Alex Parker (@Alex_Parker) January 21, 2017 You can kind of think of ULA as the stodgy uncle to Elon Musk's SpaceX.  The joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin is one of the most consistent companies in the rocket launching game.  The company prides itself on reliability, whereas SpaceX is more interested in disrupting the way that rockets have been launched for years. You can check out the full launch webcast in the window below. This launch was the Atlas V's 69th mission in total, and ULA's first of 2017. The company is expected to launch 11 rockets this year.

Scott Applewhite-Pool/Getty Images President Donald Trump Andrew Left of Citron Research, the short seller that helped bring Valeant Pharmaceuticals down to its knees, has chosen to make a very specific Trump trade public on the day of the president's inauguration: Bet against airplane parts manufacturer TransDigm Group. Quotes in the article TransDigm Group Inc TDG ▼ 219.00 -0.90 -0.41% Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX ▼ 13.47 -0.15 -1.10% Boeing Co BA ▼ 167.70 -1.42 -0.84% Credit Suisse Group AG CSGKF ▼ 15.28 -0.48 -3.05% After Left published a paper Friday predicting that President Donald Trump will crack down on the prices of aerospace industry goods, shares of $13 billion TransDigm plunged as much as 13%. That made the stock the worst performing on the S&P 500 around noon that day. It also caused the company to shed $1.4 billion in market cap by the market's close. President Trump has become to aerospace what Hillary was to pharmaceuticals, Left wrote. He has already made lowering prices for military aircraft a pillar of his transition into office. Left pointed to two of Trump's tweets as a sign that the president won't be soft on aerospace and defense. On Dec. 6, Trump wrote that the cost of a Boeing Air Force One is out of control. Roughly a week later, he called out the cost of Lockheed and Martin's F-35, writing that billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20. The short seller argues that Trump should target TransDigm in the future because the company appears to have arbitrarily hiked the price of its goods. TransDigm is also highly susceptible to Trump's influence because the Department of Defense is TransDigm's single largest customer. Later on Friday, Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn defended the company. While he conceded that TransDigm's goods are expensive, he added that the company has a higher growth rate and profitability than its peers. Additionally, if Trump tried to lower the prices, investors would see the warning signs. If the government were to pursue lower prices from TransDigm, we would expect this to be a lengthy process, Spingarn wrote. One thing we can't account for is 'tweet risk,' but we think the likelihood of this making it to Trump's tweet desk is low, and the likelihood of singling out a single aerospace parts supplier is even lower. On the same day, the S&P 500 rose 0.34%. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem. Please try again.

From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world's largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President Donald Trump's demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. By JOSH BOAK, Associated Press Published: January 20, 2017, 4:12 PM A   A WASHINGTON — From Wal-Mart to General Motors to Amazon, a growing number of the world’s largest companies appear to be trying to get in step with President Donald Trump’s demand that employers hire and keep jobs at home. Trump, in response, has taken to Twitter to signal his approval. “Thank you to General Motors and Walmart for starting the big jobs push back into the U.S.!” he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. Yet it’s unclear just how many jobs are actually being saved or created as a result of Trump’s push or whether his administration will hold companies accountable for their pledges. In a solid job market with just 4.7 percent unemployment, hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs are added all the time for a broad range of reasons. Trump has boasted that he deserves the credit based on what chief executives have told him, despite evidence to the contrary provided by those same companies. “Ask top CEO’s of those companies for real facts. Came back because of me!” the then-president-elect declared on Twitter on Wednesday. GM announced Tuesday that it was creating or keeping 7,000 jobs, while Wal-Mart said it planned to hire 10,000 and support an additional 24,000 construction jobs with store openings and expansions. Those announcements followed Amazon’s commitment to add 100,000 workers through mid-2018 and a bold claim by the Chinese online retailer Alibaba that it would create 1 million U.S. jobs over the next five years. That extravagant pledge would make Alibaba alone responsible for over 10 percent of all jobs added each year — an unheard-of feat in the modern economy. Many economists say the hiring being celebrated by Trump reflects, more than anything, the health of the $18.7 trillion economy he is inheriting. “Between the election and today, unless you work on Capitol Hill in D.C., nothing fundamental has changed in the U.S. labor market,” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the jobs site Glassdoor. To these economists, the latest high-profile hiring announcements suggest that companies are capitalizing on the politically charged climate. Trump has berated companies such as Nabisco for shuttering domestic plants in order to open factories in Mexico, while celebrating companies that publicly commit to hiring in the United States. What’s more, nearly every major U.S. employer has tax and regulatory issues before the government. To that end, a sympathetic ear in the White House could be helpful. ‘Opportunism’ The heads of German chemical company Bayer and seed-and-herbicide-maker Monsanto met with Trump last week to pitch the benefits of a planned-for merger of the two companies that requires antitrust clearance. And Trump proudly tweeted reports Wednesday that Bayer would add U.S. jobs. By announcing new jobs, companies can use any existing hiring plans to ingratiate themselves with Trump by hitching their plans to his economic agenda, noted Patrick O’Keefe, director of economic research at the consultancy and accountant CohnReznick. “There is a degree of opportunism — in a positive way,” O’Keefe said. GM plans to invest $1 billion in its U.S. factories and to create or keep 7,000 jobs — moves that the company had said were being planned well before the election. Trump had drawn attention to GM this month by threatening on Twitter to tax the automaker for selling Mexican-built cars in the United States. That set up GM’s jobs announcement as a coup for Trump, even though the investment was already in the works. A GM spokesman said it was “good timing for us to share what we are doing.” Wal-Mart’s hiring similarly seems somewhat independent of Trump. The jobs stem largely from plans to open and remodel stores — work that would not be outsourced overseas. Wal-Mart is the nation’s largest private employer, with 1.5 million workers in the United States, and its hiring rate this year will be similar to prior years, said Lorenzo Lopez, a company spokesman. These announcements follow hiring plans announced by Ford and Fiat Chrysler, among others. The auto executives were willing to let Trump promote their hiring plans, even though their decisions involved other market forces, including increased demand for SUVs as gasoline prices have dropped. Market matters Hyundai said Tuesday that it plans to invest $3.1 billion by 2021 on research and development at its factories in Alabama and Georgia. Chung Jin Haeng, chief executive of the South Korean automaker, said the decision had little to do with Trump. “The U.S. market is strategically important,” he said. At the same time, Trump has also talked with companies about cutting their costs — a move that often involves slashing jobs. He met Tuesday, for example, with the CEO of Boeing, a company he had criticized in December over Twitter for the “out of control” price of two new planes for the Air Force One fleet. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he chatted with Trump about how to lower the costs for the presidential planes as well as fighter aircraft. “I think Mr. Trump is doing a great job with engaging the business,” Muilenburg said afterward. “We’re all on the same page here.” Not all the job announcements will necessarily come to fruition. Alibaba has said it expects to add a million U.S. companies to its online retail platform in the next five years. It asserted that sales to Chinese consumers would lead each of those companies to add, on average, one job each. This would translate into an astounding 250,000 a jobs a year in an economy in which every employer, combined, added 2.2 million jobs in 2016. “It’s not rocket-science math,” said company spokesman Brion Tingler, who nevertheless cautioned that the 1 million jobs being publicized were an “aspiration.” Other than his social media megaphone, Trump doesn’t appear to have the means to hold companies accountable for their jobs pledges. His transition team didn’t respond to questions about how it planned to ensure that CEOs’ promises to create U.S. jobs were fulfilled.

ASL-interpreted performance 2:30 p.m. Feb. 18. How much: $22-$58 for previews, $30-$84 for regular performances Call: 714-708-5555 Online: scr.org With the vast ocean as a setting, a colossal whale as a character and more than 130 chapters to the storyline, it is a risky venture to adapt Herman Melville’s infamously long novel “Moby-Dick; or, The Whale” to the stage. But much like hunting for a solo creature in the sea, director David Catlin looks to achieve the impossible. “I was drawn to this story on so many levels, but the challenges it entails made me want to adapt it even more,” Catlin said. “How do you put something this large onstage? The sensation of drowning, and bounding across billows on a ship; the theater is the only place where you could do that, and that challenge became a thrill.” Produced by Chicago’s Lookingglass Theatre Company, the stage adaptation of the 1851 American novel is presented at South Coast Repertory through Feb. 19. The Tony Award-winning company is known for its use of acrobatics and harnesses. The cast of “Moby Dick” will include circus-trained artists and aerialists, making the story come to life both onstage and in the air. The flying and acrobatics help to accommodate the massive storytelling the large production demands, said Catlin. The stage is framed by arches that suggest the curved ribs of a whale or the hold of a ship, and the floor and rafters are filled with interlocking ropes, cables and wires, with blue silk that represents the water. “We took advantage to choreograph from the traditional stage into the air in the vertical space, to create a sense of being under the water,” said Catlin. “We wanted a sense of boats rocking through space or sailors being pulled down by mermaids to their doom, and we’ve been able to do that with the ropes and the rigging that we have.” Melville’s story tells the tragic and – at times – comedic tale of the madman Captain Ahab and his crew, who embark on a vengeful search for a white whale. The story is narrated by the character Ishmael, who joins the crew aboard the Pequod whaling ship. The cast includes Kelley Abell, Jamie Abelson, Walter Owen Briggs, Cordelia Dewdney, Christopher Donahue, Micah Figueroa, Anthony Fleming III, Kasey Foster, Raymond Fox and Javen Ulambayar. All the actors make their SCR debut with this production. Catlin said the cast does a brilliant job of not only depicting the larger-than-life characters, but using stage tools to create the illusion of the story’s elements, including the ocean and the ships. As for the iconic whale, Catlin said he does not want to reveal exactly how Moby Dick is portrayed, but he hopes the audience will appreciate the symbolic representation of it, which includes the book’s theme of fate. “It is a bit of a surprise, but through movements, sound effects and choreography, we create the whale,” said Catlin, “There is a stagecraft to give the audience a sense of what the crew felt like. … There is even a moment when Moby Dick breaches over our heads, then disappears into the water.” Catlin’s inspiration behind adapting the novel came from a collaboration he had in 2011 with two Chicago-based theaters: Blair Thomas and Company, which uses puppetry in its productions, and The House Theatre of Chicago. After Thomas received a grant from the Boeing Co., the three theater companies began the collaboration. “We would meet at this little pie shop in Chicago five to six weeks, eat pie, discuss the book, pollinate energy and exchange ideas to create three distinct productions,” said Catlin. “Shawn Pfautsch of the House Theater in Chicago did a modern telling of the story, while Blair did a puppetry production, and we brought ours in the air.” Catlin said it felt like it took longer to adapt the novel than it took Melville to write it, because he meticulously read through and chose the excerpts he felt were most vital for theater. The dialogue is inspired by Melville but rewritten for the stage as well. The production also features music, with songs that score the action and the actors singing some of the dialogue to express their emotions. Catlin said he hopes fans of the novel will appreciate his interpretation of Melville’s words. “I will take pieces from the descriptions of the sea from one chapter and reorder to another chapter. There may be some purists that cringe, but I hope they see it more as a dramatic medium rather than a literary one; there’s a little transformation that must happen to give it dramatic integrity.” Though the story is known for its heavy themes such as fate and free will, life and death, heaven and hell, Catlin said, he hopes the audience will also see the lightheartedness behind it as well. “When we think of ‘Moby Dick,’ we often think of the book we didn’t want to read in school, but it’s actually very funny and thought-provoking,” said Catlin. “Bringing it to theater is really a communal experience, where we can create the impossible.” Contact the writer: jmoe@scng.com Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Why Heather Dubrow is leaving 'Real Housewives of Orange County' After 25 years at MainPlace, Olive Garden plans to close and relocate Man stabbed multiple times at Lake Forest apartment complex; suspect at large How Big 5 Sporting Goods is succeeding where other sporting goods stores have failed Drought no more?

"The...pro-business tripod are potent as we hit the heart of earnings season. But so are actual numbers. Be ready for real opportunities next week," the "Mad Money" host said, referring to President Donald Trump's platform of deregulation, repatriation of money overseas and lower corporate taxes. Cramer believes those elements will be good for the stock market in the long-run. With this in mind, he outlined the stocks on his radar next week. Getty Images A man named Ben, who chose not to give his last name, dressed as the McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald, participates in a protest for higher wages for fast food workers in New York City. Monday: Halliburton, McDonald's Halliburton: As a classic Trump stock, this oil service company is primed for Trump's presidency. However, Cramer warned that it could report a less-than-perfect quarter. McDonald's: With a huge foreign business, Cramer fears that McDonald's could be impacted negatively by Trump's pro-growth policies that will strengthen the dollar. That means earnings estimates may need to come down. If CEO Steve Easterbrook focuses on technology, loyalty and luring in customers, Wall Street's reaction could be OK. Tuesday: 3M, Lockheed Martin 3M: Voted by Cramer as one of the stocks that could help the Dow reach 20,000, he recommended buying shares both before and after it reports. Lockheed Martin: Cramer is interested in seeing if Lockheed will trim its forecast because of the price cut to the joint strike fighter, which was done to concede with Trump's wishes. If it doesn't guide down, Cramer said the stock could fly high. Wednesday: Norfolk Southern, Boeing, Freeport-McMoRan Norfolk Southern: With the stock performing strongly, Cramer wants to be careful going into the quarter. When stocks run up into earnings, it is very difficult for them to rally afterwards, even if they deliver terrific numbers. He suggested selling the stock beforehand. Freeport-McMoRan: Copper, gold and oil play Freeport could benefit from acceleration in the global economy. This stock has also run up dramatically, but Cramer blessed it for buying if you believe that both America and China are headed higher. Thursday: Caterpillar, Alphabet Caterpillar: Deemed one of the infrastructure plays that will last through the early days of Trump's administration, Cramer warned that Caterpillar has been hurt by the strong dollar. If Trump picks a bone with the Chinese on trade, it could be a double-whammy. With so many cross-currents, he didn't recommend it. Alphabet: Cramer called this one controversial because it needs to rein in costs from other bets, or find a way to generate accelerated revenue. It could also be a winner in Trump's administration because it has lots of cash overseas. "I would buy Alphabet aggressively if the stock comes down after the quarter precisely because of that cash hoard's possibilities," Cramer said. Friday: Honeywell With Dave Cote as the outgoing CEO, Cramer thinks he will want to go out on a high. However, the last few conference calls have sounded more downbeat than Cote may have wanted them to be. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:50 AM, January 21, 2017 Updated: 10:40 AM, January 22, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is only hours old, but already a small parade of S&P 500 companies' chiefs have voiced optimism that his promised tax cuts, stimulus spending and deregulation will boost corporate profits. In the days ahead of Friday's inauguration, senior executives from Morgan Stanley <MS.N>, Delta Air Lines <DAL.N> and other major U.S. corporations said the Trump White House has already sparked a brighter outlook for business. "There is certainly more reason to be optimistic as we enter 2017 than there was at the beginning of 2016," Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said on Tuesday after his bank said profit doubled in the fourth quarter. He pointed to factors including a surge in consumer confidence after the Nov. 8 election and lower taxes promised by Trump. Just under way, fourth-quarter earnings reporting season is providing a glimpse of what major large companies expect under Trump, and their take is largely positive so far. Over a dozen S&P 500 companies reporting results in the last week have signaled optimism about potential tax cuts, infrastructure spending, employee benefit costs and reduced regulation. With corporate earnings already on the mend after a slump in oil prices and a strong dollar last year, S&P 500 companies are expected on average to grow their earnings by 6.3 percent in the December quarter and 13.6 percent in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Since the November election, the S&P 500 has rallied 6 percent to record highs, in part due to expectations Trump will pass policies that stimulate the economy. Banks have led gains, with investors betting Trump will roll back regulations passed by President Barack Obama following the 2008 financial crisis, which many investors say went too far. After United Continental Holdings <UAL.N> on Tuesday posted lower December-quarter profits, airline President Scott Kirby told analysts on a call, "It feels like we are on a really good path. It felt to me like there was an inflection point after the election for business demand." An also upbeat Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian told analysts this month that he was excited about potential infrastructure spending promised by Trump, as well as a chance to make his case about unfair competition from Middle Eastern airlines heavily subsidized by governments. Vince Delie, Chief Executive of F.N.B. <FNB.N>, which own First National Bank, said on a quarterly conference call on Thursday that he was saw more confidence among commercial customers and a potential pickup in lending. "There are at least conversations occurring about larger capex opportunities within our customer base, which didn't happen before," Delie said. Not everyone is over the moon, however. Kansas City Southern's CEO <KSU.N> bemoaned an uncertain environment on Friday after the cross-border railroad reported lower quarterly profits, hurt by a slump in Mexico's peso since Trump's election. "Obviously the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds, and the irony of us reporting earnings on the Inauguration Day of the 45th President is not entirely lost on us," Chief Executive Patrick Ottensmeyer told analysts. Indeed, some business leaders and lobbyists in Washington who were initially enthusiastic about Trump's victory have begun to exhibit some hesitance over his agenda amid confusing messages on healthcare, taxes and trade. SURGING CONFIDENCE Still, while Trump's views on immigration and a range of other issues are at odd with many Americans, most small businesses and consumers do see a brighter future as he launches his presidency. An index of small business confidence in December hit a 12-year high, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. The U.S. consumer confidence index in December hit its highest level since August 2001, a month before the Sept. 11 attacks. Following strong stock gains in November and December, many on Wall Street are concerned that Trump may fail to deliver on all of his promises. A Republican-controlled Congress might balk at infrastructure spending or tax reductions that significantly widen the federal budget deficit. Other investors worry that Trump could follow through on campaign-trail threats to tear up global trade deals and crack down on illegal immigrants from Mexico who provide low-wage labor in agriculture, restaurants and other industries. "Folks are potentially underestimating the degree to which Trump is serious about real reform on trade an immigration," warned Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. "Investors, in general, are hopeful Trump will take a more pragmatic approach on those issues." Over the past two months, Trump has publicly targeted and threatened a range of multinationals, including Ford Motor <F.N>, General Motors <GM.N>, Boeing Co <BA.N> and Lockheed Martin <LMT.N>. That may have left CEOs wary of publicly disagreeing with his policies. "You don't want to step on a mine. So the best course of action is to be somewhat optimistic, positive but also somewhat noncommittal so you're not trapped one way or another," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York. Trump's frequent use of Twitter to single out companies for criticism or praise has created volatile spikes in trading of their shares, which is good for online brokers including Charles Schwab <SCHW.N> and TD Ameritrade <AMTD.O>. "Each time, it's a new market event and a potential trading opportunity for our clients. Like everyone else, we're watching it with interest," TD Ameritrade Director of Finance Jeff Goeser said on a conference call on Wednesday after the company reported an increase in quarterly profits.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jan 20, 2017 at 6:52PM Friday was a positive day for the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrials climbed by 95 points and there were similarly modest advances for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The inauguration of the 45th president of the U.S. commanded the attention of many, both on and off Wall Street today, but many market participants pointed to the day's gains as a natural bounce after five straight days of losses for the Dow. With the broader market waiting for more clarity on the political and economic outlook looking ahead to the rest of the year, many investors looked to individual stocks rather than the market, as a whole. Among the worst performers today were Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Image source: Rite Aid. Rite Aid investors fear FTC rejection Rite Aid plunged 13% in the wake of reports that the Federal Trade Commission might oppose its proposed merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA). Rite Aid had hoped that its proposal to sell 865 of its drugstore locations to Fred's (NASDAQ:FRED) would be enough to satisfy the FTC, but skeptics are concerned that Fred's might not have the capacity to provide ample competition to Walgreens and CVS Health if the Rite Aid merger happens. After today's drop, Rite Aid trades at a 17% discount to the proposed $9 per-share buyout price, and that shows just how scared investors are that the deal won't go through as planned. Bristol-Myers Squibb slows down Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped 11% after saying late Thursday that it would not seek an accelerated regulatory review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its proposed combination therapy for lung cancer. Many investors had hoped that the combination of its Yervoy and Opdivo drugs would prove effective enough to spur Bristol to look for fast-track approval, especially in light of the FDA approval of a key competitor's drug for lung cancer. Nevertheless, Bristol didn't give details in its release, leaving many to speculate that the treatment's effectiveness might not have been as high as they had hoped. Now, investors will have to wait to see Bristol's next move. TransDigm loses altitude Finally, TransDigm Group lost 10%. The aerospace components and systems supplier found itself the target of short-selling research firm Citron Research and analyst Andrew Left, whose report suggested that the company might be "the Valeant of the aerospace industry." In particular, the report capitalized on criticism that President Trump has attributed to Boeing and Lockheed Martin, suggesting that the pricing practices that TransDigm uses could be even more egregious. Citron's valuation of the stock wasn't quite as dire as some of its past calls have been, suggesting that the shares might be worth $166. Yet that's still more than 25% lower than where TransDigm closed today, and it will be interesting to see if the new president takes note of the attack from Left. Dan Caplinger owns shares of Boeing.
