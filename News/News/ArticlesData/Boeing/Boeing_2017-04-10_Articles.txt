Photo by Danorton, Wikipedia Commons. 1 Business Opinion  Robert Reich: The Truth About Trumponomics – OpEd April 11, 2017 Robert Reich 0 Comment Donald Trump, Economics, Politics, United States By Robert Reich When Donald Trump spoke at Boeing’s factory in North Charleston, South Carolina – unveiling Boeing’s new 787 “Dreamliner” – he congratulated Boeing for building the plane “right here in the great state of South Carolina.“ But that is pure fantasy. Trump also used the occasion to tout his “America First” economics, stating “our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made here in the U.S.A.” Trump seems utterly ignorant about global competition – and about what’s really holding back American workers. Start with Boeing’s Dreamliner itself. It’s not “made in the U.S.A.” It is assembled in the USA. Most of the parts and almost a third of the cost of the entire plane come from overseas. For example: The center fuselage and horizontal stabilizers came from Italy. The aircraft’s landing gears, doors, electrical power conversion system – from France. The main cabin lighting came from Germany. The cargo access doors from Sweden. The lavatories, flight deck interiors, and galleys from Japan. Many of the engines from the U.K. The moveable trailing edge of the wings from Canada. Notably, the foreign companies that made these parts don’t pay their workers low wages. In fact, when you add in the value of health and pension benefits, most of these foreign workers get a better deal than do Boeing’s workers. These nations also provide most young people with excellent educations and technical training, as well as universally-available health care. To pay for all this, these countries also impose higher tax rates on their corporations and wealthy individuals than does the United States. And their health, safety, environmental, and labor regulations are stricter. Not incidentally, they have stronger unions. So why is so much of Boeing’s Dreamliner coming from these high-wage, high-tax, high-cost places? Because the parts made by workers in these countries are better, last longer, and are more reliable than parts made anywhere else. There’s a critical lesson here. The way to make the American workforce more competitive isn’t to build an economic wall around America. It’s to invest more in the education and skills of Americans, in on-the-job training, in a healthcare system that reaches more of us. And to give workers a say in their companies through strong unions. In other words, we get a first-class workforce by investing in the productive capacities of Americans  – and rewarding them with high wages. Economic nationalism is no substitute for building the competitiveness of American workers. ← A Journey In Azerbaijan’s Coin Minting House – OpEd United Airlines Violence Illustrates Problem With Government Monopolies – OpEd → Robert Reich Robert B.

Click here to see suggestions from google Money NAC Boeing 757 for sale, minimum offer $1.71 million Send Off - Post Report, Kathmandu Apr 11, 2017- Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) has put one of its two Boeing 757s up for sale. On Monday, the national flag carrier issued an auction notice setting a minimum sale price of $1.71 million for the 30-year-old Karnali bearing registration number 9N-ACA. The aircraft has been sitting outside the NAC hangar at Tribhuvan International Airport since April 2016 following the corporation’s policy to phase out Boeing aircraft, the airline said.  “We have decided to retire the aircraft after conducting a cost-benefit analysis. Based on the operational cost analysis, it does not make sense to fly the aircraft,” said Rabindra Shrestha, spokesperson for NAC.  He added that the Boeing 757 burns 4 tonnes of fuel per hour compared to 2.5 tonnes for new aircraft. The move is also part of the national flag carrier’s plan to have an all-Airbus fleet for its international operations.  The corporation has given a May 24 deadline for the submission of tender documents by interested parties. The corporation plans to retire its second Boeing 757 by 2019.  The 9N-ACA arrived in Nepal in 1987 and flew on long-haul routes, displaying the national flag at world airports. The 757 holds 190 passengers. The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized, narrow body twin engine jet built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It debuted in the late 1980s and was in production until 2004. NAC moved to sell off its two 757s as it is no longer profitable to fly them due to their high maintenance costs compared to the revenue they bring in. Each of NAC’s Boeings earns about Rs2 billion annually, and it costs the carrier almost the same in maintenance expenses, according to the carrier.  As per the notice, the successful bidder shall have to bear insurance charges after 90 days from the signature date of the binding contract. All charges for deregistration and applicable taxes on the sale shall be borne by the buyer, and the sale of aircraft does not include any spare parts. NAC recently announced that it would be launching four new long-haul routes besides resuming its London service after acquiring two wide body jets in 2018.  Last Friday, the NAC signed a $209.6 million deal to purchase two Airbus A330-200 long-range jets from US-based AAR Corp, marking the largest ever jet purchase deal in Nepal’s aviation history. The national flag carrier plans to connect Kathmandu with Seoul in South Korea, Tokyo in Japan, Dammam in Saudi Arabia and Sydney in Australia. It has also announced increasing flight frequencies to key destinations like Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Doha.   Nepal Airlines has taken the top spot in international passenger carriage for the first time in years, flying 275,701 travellers during the first nine months of 2016. It began flying high after inducting two new Airbus A320 aircraft into its fleet in 2015. It resumed flights to Dubai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi soon after acquiring the new jets, and now serves eight international destinations.

I was disappointed by the remarks and rhetoric from newly appointed District Attorney Faith Johnson and her staff at a community forum last week in southern Dallas. When prosecutors use the terms monsters and lost souls to refer to criminal defendants, they are participating in the same shameful and dehumanizing behavior that has plagued the Dallas County district attorney's office for decades. This ideology has led to wrongful convictions, blatant racism, failure to indict officers who murder, and the targeting of mentally ill persons. In addition, this rhetoric and the policies it represents do little to reduce or deter real violence. We need a district attorney who can lead Dallas in the 21st century and address all of the historical flaws and habits of the office, not one who perpetuates them. MarySue Foster, Dallas PC speech Re: "Lost souls, not monsters" by Rick Halperin, Friday Letters. Just when I thought that PC speech policing by college officials could not possibly get worse, here it is from a Southern Methodist University administrator. Halperin objects to calling the worst violent offenders monsters and claims, "There is no such thing as a lesser person." The dictionary defines a monster as one who is morally wicked, and threatening or terrifying. Nowhere does it say a monster is a lesser person, although that would appear obvious to those who believe moral behavior is a measure of our humanity. Ken Ashby, Dallas Big D street life vs. Chicago Re: "Boeing unit landed -- New global services division with ambitious plans putting HQ at Plano's Legacy West," Thursday Business story. Years ago, Boeing turned down downtown Dallas for its world headquarters, moving management from Seattle to Chicago. That struck hard at Dallas' self-esteem. Boeing complained that Dallas' downtown streets were empty, while Chicago had street life. Now Boeing is coming around to Legacy West, even one relatively small division. Thank you. Meanwhile Uptown, largely undeveloped then except for Caroline Hunt's Crescent, has become so highly developed that even vacant cemetery space is being reclaimed for buildings. Major money in Dallas got behind completion of the Arts District. The central Dallas complex would be a much stronger competitor for Chicago today. Development is spreading south from the Arts District into the older downtown in a way that Boeing could have found a place, but street life is hard to build. We're grateful for the Boeing division moving to Legacy West. With Chicago's high murder rate, maybe Chicago's street life isn't as alluring. Dallas could get another bite at the Boeing apple. Frederick W. Fraley, Dallas Pro-law, not anti-immigrant Re: "Rallying for rights -- Thousands turn out to support immigrants," Monday news story. There is no anti-immigrant feeling in the country or the Trump administration There is a definite pro-law mood in the country as it sees an invasion of illegal immigration continue to tear down our infrastructure, culture and education. Coddling and enabling illegal aliens is an insult to the many who have come to this country legally. It can be an arduous process, and it is frustrating for those who follow the rules to see line-jumpers be not only accommodated but lionized. Stop repeating talking points that are basically lies. The country and the Trump administration are not anti-immigrant. They are pro-law. Tom Huber, Irving Prioritize Texas resources Re: "Proposed cuts take many by surprise -- House amendment would strip money, but state budget isn't final yet," Saturday Business story. I'm glad the Legislature is debating the necessity and effectiveness of the Texas Enterprise Fund in the face of fiscal shortcomings and potential cuts to the state's social safety net, such as Texas' Medicaid program. I agree with Rep. Angie Chen Button on the efforts to diversify the state's economy away from one solely based on oil production as being crucial to Texas' future prosperity. However, Rep. Sergio Muñoz Jr. has won the debate in pointing out that this debate should be one based on how the state prioritizes its limited resources and funding. While luring business to the Lone Star State reaps many benefits, the well-being of Texas' most vulnerable must take precedent over economic development. Texas' families with children with special needs should not live in fear of their physical therapy and rehabilitation services being cut in the face of a projected revenue shortfall. Michael Clarke, Far North Dallas Promises to government workers As president of Chapter 254 of the National Treasury Employees Union, I represent a group of middle-class Americans who are proud to work for the U.S. government but are concerned about some of the talk in Washington about budget cuts. Many of us choose to work for the government because of the professional challenge and the opportunity to serve the public, sometimes at salaries lower than we could receive in the private sector, particularly for scientists, engineers and medical professionals. Part of that decision was to work in exchange for a modest retirement provided by the fully funded and financially sound Federal Employees Retirement System. Since 2010, Congress has twice increased employee contributions to the fund, essentially cutting the take-home pay of federal employees. Those pensions are part of our employment contract with Congress and the American people we serve. The members of NTEU Chapter 254 who work in the Food and Drug Administration urge Congress to respect that contract and allow federal employees to retire with the security they have been promised. David Arvelo, Dallas Nuclear-option madness Both Democrats and Republicans have to remember that any use of the nuclear option, whether military or political, is accompanied by mutually assured destruction. The same nuclear option you used against your opponent, no matter how much you justify its use at the time, will be used against you when the opportunity presents itself. John A. Bianchi, Wylie Is Bannon an anarchist? Re: "Bannon loses NSC insider spot," Thursday news story. This article says that Steve Bannon describes himself as "virulently anti-establishment" and a revolutionary out to destroy the "administrative state." How does this description differ from that of an anarchist? If not, please explain, and also tell me why Bannon should retain any position in this administration.

Elaine Thompson, AP Iranian airline signs $3.4b deal with U.S. plane manufacturer Boeing Analysis Trump's real target in Syria strike wasn't Assad Iran's exiled prince wants a revolution - even with the help of Israel or Trump WASHINGTON - Congressman Peter Roskam (R-IL) and Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) sent a letter to President Donald Trump on Monday urging him to suspend a number of multi-billion dollar deals between Boeing and airlines in Iran. The two legislators warned in their letter that the Iranian airlines involved in the deals have been used by the Iranian regime "for illicit military purposes, including to transport troops, weapons and cash to rogue regimes and terrorist groups around the world."  The deals in question are reportedly worth $25 billion dollars. They were announced by the Iranian government in June, and include the sale and lease of more than 100 Boeing aircraft to Iranian companies. USA Today reported at the time that the deals would be "the first time new American aircraft have been sold to Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution," and the largest commercial agreement between a U.S. company and Tehran since the lifting of sanctions from Iran as a result of the 2015 nuclear deal.  Last November, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would prohibit selling jetliners to Iran. The Obama administration threatened to veto the legislation if it passed the Senate, and so far, the bill hasn't progressed further on Capitol Hill. Now, the letter by Rubio and Roskam urges Trump to stop the Boeing deals himself.  The downside for the administration in taking such a step is that the jetliners in the Boeing deals are made in the United States, and the company could blame the administration for hurting American production and workers. Supporting American manufacturing and bilateral trade relations were major themes of Trump's election campaign. skip - The letter On the other hand, the Trump administration has taken a tough line on Iran, at one point even warning the Islamic Republic that it was "on notice" for conducting ballistic missile experiments. In their letter to the president, Roskam and Rubio specifically mention the involvement of Iranian commercial airlines in supplying and supporting the Assad regime in Syria, perhaps hoping to build on the momentum from the Trump administration's strike against the Syrian air force last week.    "Iran has consistently used commercial aircraft to transport the weapons and troops that have fueled the conflict in Syria which has claimed the lives of 500,000 people," the two legislators wrote to Trump. They added that "Iran's airlines also continue to play a major role in supplying Hezbollah - the Iranian terror proxy that is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans over the years - with the rockets and missiles that now put Israelis at risk, too."  Keep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email* Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

As a part of the Navy’s Joint Strike Fighter program, the F-35Cs would replace the popular-but-aging fleet of Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, carrying with it a cost of roughly $400, a figure that drew criticism from Trump.  © Lockheed Martin US Pays $372M to Cover Correcting ‘Deficiencies’ in F-35 Jets Sold to Allies In December the president wrote on Twitter, "The F-35 program and cost is out of control," and vowed to save billions of dollars in military purchases by the time he took office in January, though he didn’t provide details. Following Trump’s tweet, Lockheed Martin, which manufacturers the F-35, saw their shares drop as much as 5 percent. Lockheed’s F-35 Program Manager Jeff Babione said in a statement that he would "certainly welcome the opportunity to address any question that the president-elect would have about the program," and that "Lockheed Martin and its industry partners understand the importance of affordability for the F-35 program."  © Boeing Boeing Pitches ‘Super’ Super Hornets to Replace F-35 Politico quoted Navy Adm. Bill Moran at Tuesday’s Navy League Sea Air Space symposium saying, "The Navy still plans to procure two squadrons of Boeing’s F/A-18 and two squadrons of Lockheed Martin’s F-35C variant, which can take off and land on the deck of an aircraft carrier." The stealth fighter’s future seemed uncertain, as US Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a comparison of the F-35 and the F/A-18 not long after Trump was inaugurated. Around the same time a document from Boeing, which manufacturers the F/A-18, was making the rounds suggesting that the Navy had a "significant capability gaps against emerging threats" with the F-35, according to the Navy Times, and that updating the F/A-18 was more efficient that buying new F-35s. Bloomberg News reported that Trump’s tone on the aircraft shifted, as he later claimed to have slashed $600 million from the price tag of 90 F-35s, telling Congress that he "saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter."   Previous annual contracts ran about $102 million, but the last contract, signed in February, came to $94.6 million, it’s lowest cost yet. Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon are reportedly working to make costs even lower than that, with plans to drop the number at least 16 percent, to less than $80 million.  A statement emailed to Newsweek stated that in February Navy Rear Admiral DeWolfe Miller told Congress, "The Navy remains dedicated to a capabilities-focused approach as we evolve the carrier wing and carrier strike group of the future. The dynamic security environment requires the speed, endurance, flexibility and autonomous nature of the carrier strike group." ...

The contract announced on Monday is a major step in Boeing's effort to boost the profitability of the 787 and a sign of growing industrial acceptance of the durability of 3-D printed metal parts, allowing them to replace pieces made with more expensive traditional manufacturing in demanding aerospace applications. Advertisement Strong, lightweight titanium alloy is seven times more costly than aluminium, and accounts for about $17-million of the cost of a $265-million Dreamliner, industry sources say. Boeing has been trying to reduce titanium costs on the 787, which requires more of the metal than other models because of its carbon-fibre fuselage and wings. Titanium also is used extensively on Airbus Group SE's rival A350 jet. "This means $2-million to $3-million in savings for each Dreamliner, at least," starting in 2018 when many more parts are being printed, Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium's VP of marketing, said in a telephone interview. Boeing builds 144 Dreamliners in a typical year. The company declined to comment on the estimate but said Norsk's technology would help reduce costs. The Dreamliner turned profitable last year after racking up nearly $29-billion in production-related losses. Norsk worked with Boeing for more than a year to design four 787 parts and obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification for them, Yates said. Norsk expects the US regulatory agency will approve the material properties and production process for printed parts later this year. That will "open up the floodgates," Yates said, by allowing Norsk to print thousands of other parts for each Dreamliner, without each part requiring separate FAA approval, resulting in the millions in expecting savings per plane. "You're talking about tons, literally," on the 787 that would be printed instead of made with traditional, expensive forging and machining, he said. General Electric Co is already printing metal fuel nozzles for aircraft engines. But Norsk and Boeing said the titanium parts are the first printed structural components designed to bear the stress of an airframe in flight. Norsk said it will print initially in Norway, but aims to have nine printers running by year-end at a 6 220 m2 facility in Plattsburgh, New York.

Combined, Wal-Mart and Boeing's share gains were adding about 16 points to the blue-chip index , which was aiming for a close in positive territory for the day and week. However, Goldman Sach Group's 0.7% decline was helping to drag the gauge lower, cutting about 10 points from the price-weighted benchmark. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index was up less than a point at 2,357, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was trading flat at 5,881. Cautious trading Friday comes as disappointing March employment data and President Donald Trump's late Thursday airstrike against Syria weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Trump also is holding diplomatic talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Mar-a-lago, Fla., which is being closely followed for signs of geopolitical tensions. The U.S. strike against Syria and jobs report initially knocked stocks around but the market has shown an uncanny degree of resilience, hovering in the green, however slight.

The company signed a tentative agreement with Iran Aseman Airlines to sell 30 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in a deal valued at $3 billion. It was preceded by the sale of 80 aircraft to Iran Air under the Obama administration for $16.6 billion. Boeing's success in Iran has created a major headache for President Donald Trump who has consistently criticized the nation for being a destabilizing force in the Middle East and a state sponsor of terrorism, though he has never publicly voiced his opposition to aircraft sales in Iran.  He also denounced the 2015 nuclear agreement which opened the door for western aviation companies to sell their jets to Iran's airlines. Due to sanctions, the country's airlines struggled for years with outdated and rusty planes, leading to a fleet requiring a $20 billion investment. Boeing and European competitor Airbus have both sealed massive deals in Iran but that success is almost certainly proving bittersweet for Trump, given his hostile stance on the country.  Tuesday's agreement still requires government approval but it marks the first big business deal announced by any U.S. company in Iran since Trump became president. Boeing said in a statement earlier this week that "an aerospace sale of this magnitude creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States". That means that the stakes are high for Trump. Blocking Boeing's sales in Iran would put his policy of protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs into direct conflict with his administration's hostile stance towards Tehran. The president certainly has a dilemma on his hands. This chart shows Boeing and Airbus sales in Iran after the 2015 nuclear agreement.

The PBS NewsHour Published by The PBS NewsHour Trump’s transition team claims he sold all his stocks but provides no proof Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email a Friend Dec 7, 2016 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at election night rally in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump sold all of his stocks in June as he plunged into the costly general election campaign, his transition team abruptly announced Tuesday. His advisers provided no proof of the transactions and would not explain the apparent sell-off. The announcement comes amid swirling questions about potential conflicts of interest between Trump’s expansive financial holdings and the decisions that will reach his desk as president. Some details of Trump’s finances are unknown given that he never released his tax returns during the presidential campaign, breaking decades of precedent. The announcement comes amid swirling questions about potential conflicts of interest between Trump’s expansive financial holdings and the decisions that will reach his desk as president. Some details of Trump’s finances are unknown given that he never released his tax returns during the presidential campaign, breaking decades of precedent. On Tuesday, Trump said the government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order with Boeing for new Air Force One presidential planes. Asked on a conference call with reporters whether Trump had investments in Boeing, spokesman Jason Miller said the president-elect had sold all of his stocks in June. Trump’s campaign did not announce the sell-off at the time, despite the fact that it could have been politically advantageous for the businessman to be seen taking steps to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Miller, as well as other transition officials and lawyers from the Trump Organization, did not respond to requests from The Associated Press to provide evidence of the transactions. As of May, Trump reported owning millions of dollars’ worth of individual stocks, though he had more money in company specific investments through bonds, mutual funds and private equity investments, according to his 104-page public financial disclosure, which all presidential candidates are required to file. It’s not clear whether the comments Tuesday referenced Trump’s nonstock holdings. Trump reported in May an investment in Boeing worth between $50,000 and $100,000. Other investments were in companies — such as Ford Motor Co., V F Corp. and Thermo Fisher Scientific — that in recent years have moved jobs outside the U.S., a practice that Trump heavily criticized during the campaign. The disclosure also showed Trump held a small amount of stock in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners and at least $100,000 in the energy company Phillips 66, both of which are involved in the disputed Dakota Access oil pipeline. Earlier this week, the Army declined to issue a permit for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. Trump supports construction of the pipeline, and aides say he will review the project after taking office. All presidents since Ronald Reagan have filed public financial disclosures in their first year in office, though they weren’t required to do so until their second year. For Trump, that means he won’t have to file another disclosure until mid-2018 unless he chooses to file earlier. All presidents since Ronald Reagan have filed public financial disclosures in their first year in office, though they weren’t required to do so until their second year. For Trump, that means he won’t have to file another disclosure until mid-2018 unless he chooses to file earlier. At the time of Trump’s apparent June stocks sell-off, the businessman was immersed in the expensive general election campaign. He’d poured more than $47 million of his own money into the primary campaign through a series of loans. But in June, he adjusted his self-investment strategy, according to federal campaign finance filings. That month, Trump slowed his giving, making monthly campaign donations of about $2 million as his campaign came to rely more heavily on outside donations. He made a late $10 million investment in the final days leading up to the election. During the first general election debate in September, Trump took a decidedly bleak view of the stock market and the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising short-term interest rates. “We’re in a bubble right now,” he said. “And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that’s going to come crashing down.” Market watchers expect the Fed to raise rates next week in recognition of the improving job market.

Iran had been expected to receive the first of 80 aircraft ordered from the US planemaker in April 2018, but at least one brand-new aircraft is reported to be sitting unused because it is no longer needed by the Turkish carrier. Industry sources said Boeing was in negotiations to release at least one 777-300ER originally built for Turkish Airlines, which is deferring deliveries due to weaker traffic following last year's failed coup attempt in Turkey. Boeing said it never comments on talks with customers. The airlines involved were not immediately available for comment. Iran's Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan told the semi-official Mehr news agency the first Boeing 777 aircraft would reach Tehran within a month. It would be the first new US-built jet delivered to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The long-haul 777 is worth $347 million at list prices but is likely to have been sold for less than half that, according to industry estimates. IranAir has also ordered 100 aircraft from Europe's Airbus under a deal to lift most sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme. Its return to the aviation market after decades of sanctions comes at a time when airlines elsewhere are having second thoughts about purchases due to concerns about the economy and looming over-capacity among wide-body jets. That trend has made a number of unused jets available for quick delivery at competitive prices, including three Airbus jets recently delivered to Iran, and has allowed IranAir to jump the usual waiting list of several years. The government of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani is seen as keen to showcase results from the sanctions deal ahead of a May election at which challengers include Ebrahim Raisi. Aviation sources say the first aircraft were paid directly from Iranian funds, but doubts remain over credit financing needed to secure almost 180 jets still on order. Western banks continue to shy away from financing deals between IranAir and Western companies, fearing US banking sanctions that remain in force or a new chill in relations between Tehran and the West under US President Donald Trump. Boeing has stressed the benefits to US jobs of the plane deals. Fakhrieh-Kashan was meanwhile quoted on Monday as saying IranAir had reached a long-awaited agreement to buy 20 European turboprops from ATR. Talks over maintenance with engine maker Pratt & Whitney Canada had delayed a final deal. It was not immediately clear whether the official was referring to an earlier deal for the planes or the final contract including engine overhaul. IranAir ATR deal IranAir has signed a contract to buy 20 planes from turboprop maker ATR, Iranian deputy transport minister was quoted as saying on Monday. The deal comes after Iran, which had not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, signed contracts with Europe's Airbus and US rival Boeing last year to purchase about 180 jets. That became possible after an agreement between Iran and six major powers lifted most international sanctions imposed on Tehran, in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear programme. ATR is joint-owned by France-based Airbus and Leonardo of Italy. "The contract between IranAir and ATR to buy 20 ATR 72-600 aircrafts has been signed by the officials of both countries," Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan was quoted as saying by ISNA. A basic deal for the purchase of 20 airplanes, with options for another 20, was reached several weeks ago but negotiations dragged on over an agreement for maintenance and spare engines between IranAir and engine supplier Pratt & Whitney Canada, owned by US aerospace group United Technologies. It was not immediately clear whether Fakhrieh-Kashan was referring to the underlying aircraft contract or the final package including the engine deal. ATR was not immediately available for comment, but on Sunday a spokesman said, "We are still working on finalising the deal." < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

"The two 777 Boeing passenger planes will be delivered to Iran's national flag carrier Iran Air in the coming weeks," the Islamic republic news agency quoted an informed source as saying. The Boeing 777 passenger plane is a two-engine wide-body aircraft and is suitable for long-distance journey of over 17,000 kilometers. “Since 30 out of 80 passenger planes purchased from Boeing are 777 model, the giant aviation company has announced that it will deliver two of the same model to Iran,” the source added. He noted that 15 of the 777 model will be 350-seated and the remaining 15 will be 390-seated aircraft. In a relevant development last week, Iran signed a new agreement with the giant aviation company Boeing to purchase several twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. The agreement was signed between Iran's Aseman Airlines and Boeing and involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes. The agreement came after almost a year of negotiations between Aseman Airlines and Boeing. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran’s flag-carrier airline Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. The planes are expected to be delivered to Aseman Airlines from 2019. The Iranian airline is expected to receive at least five of the purchased aircraft during the same year. Boeing 737 MAX planes - that would enter service in the second half of 2017 – have a passenger capacity of 130 people and are specifically adequate for domestic and regional flights. The planes that Aseman Airlines has purchased from Boeing would increase the company’s passenger transportation capacity to above 8,000 seats. Iran Air said in December 2016 that it had finalized an agreement with Boeing to buy 80 new planes. The company accordingly announced that Boeing would start to deliver the planes in 2018 and the deliveries would be completed within 10 years. Iran has already received the first three of a total of 100 Airbus planes that it has purchased from the European company through an agreement worth around $18 billion. More deliveries are expected to take place over the next months.         Related News Iran Inks New Deal with Boeing to Buy 30 Passenger Planes  Iran Announces Deal with Foreign Financier on Purchase of 77 New Boeing, Airbus Planes  Minister: Trump Not Able to Annul Boeing Contract with Iran  Iranian Experts Build Boeing 737 Simulator  Iran’s Aseman Airlines to Get 7 New Airbus planes  Iran Air Signs Contract with US Boeing to Buy 80 Passenger Planes  Official: Airbus, Boeing Grant Iran Maintenance, Repair Rights  Boeing: No Problem Hindering Sales of Passenger Planes to Iran  Japan's Mitsubishi Emerging as New Rival for Boeing, Airbus in Iran's Aviation Industry  LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Intensifies Anti-Terrorism Operation in Northern Hama Over 10 Terrorists Killed or Injured in Syrian Army's Roadside Bomb Blast, East of Daraa Iraqi Forces Continue Fight to Retake Mosul from Terrorists Palestinians, Syrian Expats Protest against US Strike in Syria Syrian Warplanes Continue Counter-Terrorism Sorties from Shayrat Airbase Syria: Al-Shayrat Villagers Say US Missiles Hit Their Homes Six Civilians Killed, 50 Injured by Indian Forces in Kashmir Syria's Shayrat Air Base Resumes Operation against Terrorists Anyone Who Supports US Strikes in Syria Has to Account for Civilian Casualties Iraqi Volunteer Forces Destroy ISIL's Large Arms Cargo in Mosul ISIL Suffers Heavy Casualties in Deir Ezzur Analyst Blames Turkey, Al-Nusra for Chemical Attack in Syria Commander: Yemen to Turn into Big Missile Power in 10 Years Terrorists' Operation Room Commander in Dara'a Killed in Syrian Army Attack UK Calls for Tough New Sanctions on Russia over Syria Syrian Army Intensifies Anti-Terrorism Operation in Northern Hama TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian Army troops, backed up by the country's Air Force, launched a fresh round of attacks on the defense lines of the Al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front or the Levant Liberation Board) in Northern Hama, killing tens of terrorists, including a notorious field commander, on Monday.

PARIS/DUBAI, April 10 (Reuters) - IranAir may get its first new Boeing jetliner a year earlier than expected under a deal to take jets originally bought by cash-strapped Turkish Airlines, Iranian media and industry sources said. Iran had been expected to receive the first of 80 aircraft ordered from the U.S. planemaker in April 2018, but at least one brand-new aircraft is reported to be sitting unused because it is no longer needed by the Turkish carrier. Industry sources said Boeing was in negotiations to release at least one 777-300ER originally built for Turkish Airlines, which is deferring deliveries due to weaker traffic following last year's failed coup attempt in Turkey. Boeing said it never comments on talks with customers. The airlines involved were not immediately available for comment. Iran's Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan told the semi-official Mehr news agency the first Boeing 777 aircraft would reach Tehran within a month. Advertisement It would be the first new U.S.-built jet delivered to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The long-haul 777 is worth $347 million at list prices but is likely to have been sold for less than half that, according to industry estimates. IranAir has also ordered 100 aircraft from Europe's Airbus under a deal to lift most sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme. Its return to the aviation market after decades of sanctions comes at a time when airlines elsewhere are having second thoughts about purchases due to concerns about the economy and looming over-capacity among wide-body jets. That trend has made a number of unused jets available for quick delivery at competitive prices, including three Airbus jets recently delivered to Iran, and has allowed IranAir to jump the usual waiting list of several years. The government of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani is seen as keen to showcase results from the sanctions deal ahead of a May election at which challengers include hardline Shi'ite cleric Ebrahim Raisi. Aviation sources say the first aircraft were paid directly from Iranian funds, but doubts remain over credit financing needed to secure almost 180 jets still on order. Western banks continue to shy away from financing deals between IranAir and Western companies, fearing U.S. banking sanctions that remain in force or a new chill in relations between Tehran and the West under U.S. President Donald Trump. Boeing has stressed the benefits to U.S. jobs of the plane deals. Fakhrieh-Kashan was meanwhile quoted on Monday as saying IranAir had reached a long-awaited agreement to buy 20 European turboprops from ATR . Talks over maintenance with engine maker Pratt & Whitney Canada had delayed a final deal. It was not immediately clear whether the official was referring to an earlier deal for the planes or the final contract including engine overhaul. ATR said on Sunday it was still in talks with IranAir.

If for no other reason than his assault during the election on the cost of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program created an opening for Boeing to put a lower-cost alternative back on the table. Lockheed Martin’s F-35C won’t be ready in time, enter Boeing and an F/A-18 Super Hornet upgrade. Source: Adobe Stock/Spacekris. At the same time, the U.S. military, particularly the Navy, are facing a bit of a problem with their older F/A–18 Super Hornets. As an article in Sea Power magazine notes, after 16 years of nearly constant combat in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria the F/A–18 Super Hornet is in danger of exceeding it’s 6,000 hours of operational life way before it had been expected in the next decade. Benchmark Your Current Metal Price by Grade, Shape and Alloy: See How it Stacks Up Meanwhile, the Navy variant of the F-35, the F-35C is still a long way from being finished and ready for service. Largely because of the compromises Lockheed Martin has had to incorporate into the F-35 program for the Marine Corps’ F-35B vertical-landing jet, the program is way over budget, running late and, still, according to Bloomberg has major operational capability shortcomings to overcome. This opened the door for Boeing to offer an enhanced Super Hornet providing “complementary capabilities” to the Lockheed Martin F-35s, but at a cheaper price. Even Boeing does not pretend that the enhanced Super Hornets, termed the Block III upgrade, would have the full-stealth capability of the F35, but crucially — both new production variants of the aircraft and eventually retrofitted versions of those currently in service — would have an extended operational life from 6,000 to 9,000 hours plugging the gap for the Navy until, and if, the F-35 is fully operational. The Navy recently revealed that 62% of its strike fighters were out of service awaiting repairs according to a Defense News report. Need a fighter that can launch off carriers from a catapult? The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, with some new upgrades, is there for the taking. Source: Adobe Stock/AdobeStock_npologuy. Boeing’s Block III upgrade would do more with than simply extend the operational life of the Super Hornet. The company is no doubt approaching this opportunity with an eye to poaching F-35 sales. Boeing is proposing many enhanced features including an extended range, and the incorporation of the “distributed targeting network” and the “tactical targeting technology system,” two official programs of record, said crudely to be a big computer and a big data pipe. Two-Month Trial: Metal Buying Outlook Needless to say, any major upgrade is going to incorporate more advanced cockpit technology, sensors such as infrared tracking and search systems, and even improving the F/A–18’s stealth capability, providing Boeing suggests “complimentary capabilities” to the F-35. Boeing is suggesting, and the Navy seems in agreement, that the F/A-18 will remain a key part of a Carrier group’s aircraft fleet well into the 2030s. But appealing for the attention of a president keen on capturing headlines over cost savings, Boeing is pushing for all they are worth to suggest more Block III F/A-18 Super Hornets would make better financial sense than the full complement of F-35’s. {0 comments add one now} Leave a Comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

April 10 (Reuters) - IranAir may get its first new Boeing jetliner a year earlier than expected under a deal to replace cash-strapped Turkish Airlines, Iranian media and industry sources said. Iran had been expected to receive the first of 80 aircraft ordered from the U.S. planemaker in April 2018, but at least one brand-new aircraft is reported to be sitting unused because it is no longer needed by the Turkish carrier. Industry sources said Boeing was in negotiations to release at least one 777-300ER originally built for Turkish Airlines, which is deferring deliveries due to weaker traffic following last year's failed coup attempt in Turkey. Boeing and the airlines involved were not immediately available for comment. Iran's Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told the semi-official Mehr news agency the first Boeing 777 aircraft would reach Tehran within a month. Advertisement It would be the first new U.S.-built jet delivered to Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The long-haul 777 is worth $347 million at list prices but is likely to have been sold for less than half that, according to industry estimates. IranAir has also ordered 100 aircraft from Europe's Airbus under a deal to lift most sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme. Its return to the aviation market after decades of sanctions comes at a time when airlines elsewhere are having second thoughts about purchases due to concerns about the economy and looming over-capacity among wide-body jets. That trend has made a number of unused jets available for quick delivery at competitive prices, including three Airbus jets recently delivered to Iran, and has allowed IranAir to jump the usual waiting list of several years. The government of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani is seen as keen to showcase results from the sanctions deal ahead of a May election at which challengers include hardline Shi'ite cleric Ebrahim Raisi. Aviation sources say the first aircraft were paid directly from Iranian funds, but doubts remain over credit financing needed to secure almost 180 jets still on order. Western banks continue to shy away from financing deals between IranAir and Western companies, fearing U.S. banking sanctions that remain in force or a new chill in relations between Tehran and the West under U.S. President Donald Trump. Boeing has stressed the benefits to U.S. jobs of the plane deals. IranAir is meanwhile negotiating the purchase of 20 European turboprop planes from ATR.

The long-haul 777 is worth $347 million at list prices but is likely to have been sold for less than half that, according to industry estimates. IranAir has also ordered 100 aircraft from Europe's Airbus <AIR.PA> under a deal to lift most sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear program. Its return to the aviation market after decades of sanctions comes at a time when airlines elsewhere are having second thoughts about purchases due to concerns about the economy and looming over-capacity among wide-body jets. That trend has made a number of unused jets available for quick delivery at competitive prices, including three Airbus jets recently delivered to Iran, and has allowed IranAir to jump the usual waiting list of several years. The government of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani is seen as keen to showcase results from the sanctions deal ahead of a May election at which challengers include hardline Shi'ite cleric Ebrahim Raisi. Aviation sources say the first aircraft were paid directly from Iranian funds, but doubts remain over credit financing needed to secure almost 180 jets still on order. Western banks continue to shy away from financing deals between IranAir and Western companies, fearing U.S. banking sanctions that remain in force or a new chill in relations between Tehran and the West under U.S. President Donald Trump. Boeing has stressed the benefits to U.S. jobs of the plane deals. Fakhrieh-Kashan was meanwhile quoted on Monday as saying IranAir had reached a long-awaited agreement to buy 20 European turboprops from ATR. Talks over maintenance with engine maker Pratt & Whitney Canada had delayed a final deal. It was not immediately clear whether the official was referring to an earlier deal for the planes or the final contract including engine overhaul. ATR said on Sunday it was still in talks with IranAir.

The first versions of the plane were feeble by today's standards: the 737 100 “boasted” a range of just 1,150 miles (1,850km) and offering just 107 seats. Both of those features were, however, a little better than rival planes of the time like the DC-9. Also saving money was a design that pinched elements of Boeing's 707 and 727 while allowing the plane to operate with a flight crew of just two. The first models were also easily adapted to fly people, cargo, or both. The design also called for low maintenance so that the plane could be used to reach destinations where ground support was minimal. Boeing even offered a “gravel kit” to allow use of unpaved runways. The plane was not a big hit in its early years: for four years in the 1970s Boeing shipped fewer than 30 planes. But it - pardon the pun – took off in the 1980s as airline deregulation and rising middle class incomes increased demand for air travel. 5 perfect 10's! #OTD 50 yrs ago, the 737 made its first flight. Learn more about where we are today: https://t.co/vyP7I31hGz #avgeek #Boeing pic.twitter.com/P6PXTXyy8q — Boeing Airplanes (@BoeingAirplanes) April 9, 2017 Early in the 1980s decade Boeing refreshed the plane, adding the 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500 to the range and adopting a distinctive non-circular engine inlet. Range and capacity increased, as did fuel economy, and the plane started selling a hundred or more units a year. In the early 1990s another round of updates produced the “Next Generation 737”, complete with distinctive winglets, seat counts of 149 on the model -600 and 700, 189 on the 737-800 and a whopping 220 seats and 5,400km range for the top-of-the-range model 737-900ER. It's a versatile craft: your correspondent has flow in them for 35-minute commuter hops, the five-and-a-half-hour Sydney-to-Perth slog and on the three-and-a-half hour Sydney-to-Auckland ride that shows off its 180-minute ETOPS rating. The plane soon won a reputation for reliability and became a favourite of low-cost airlines. The two paragons of that model, Southwest and Ryanair, made a virtue of operating all-737 fleets, further accelerating demand for air travel and for more 737s. Boeing can therefore now deliver 737s at a rate of more than one a day and has unfilled orders for more than 4,500 of the planes on its books. Many of those orders are for the new “737MAX” variant, sporting the X-wing - officially the “Advanced Technology Winglet” - that will again reduce fuel consumption and noise. Boeing will start shipping the new variant in May 2017 and they'll start to appear at the world's airports not long afterwards.

There's also a “business jet” variant for those who can afford their own plane. All those variants have added up to 9,448 shipments, making it the world's most popular airliner. It's also been involved in 168 accidents that have seen the aircraft written off as a result, and over 3,000 fatalities. ® Tips and corrections 62 Comments MORE Aviation More from The Register Boeing's X-Wing 737 makes first flight British-made winglets debut on new version of world's most popular airliner 19 Comments Pilot posts detailed MS Flight Sim video of how to land Boeing 737 Vid This'll come in handy if the pilots are unconscious AND you have Wi-Fi 108 Comments NASA books second Boeing space taxi CST-100 Starliner to lift more 'nauts to ISS 26 Comments Did you almost prang a 737 jet with a drone over Dallas?

Boeing is one of several large businesses that would see a property tax cut under Republican lawmakers’ plan to fix how Washington state pays for schools. Drew Perine Staff file, 2009 Politics & Government April 08, 2017 4:14 PM Boeing, other corporations would get big property tax cuts under GOP schools plan By Melissa Santos msantos@thenewstribune.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When it comes to taxing businesses to pay for schools, state lawmakers in Olympia remain of two minds. While Democrats are proposing business tax hikes, a Republican plan would give many of Washington’s largest corporations a sizable property tax cut. Those breaks would include a $7.4 million annual reduction for Boeing, a $6 million cut for Puget Sound Energy and a $1.8 million break for Alaska Airlines, according to new estimates from the state Department of Revenue. Other corporations projected to receive property tax breaks topping $1 million a year under the Republican plan include Walmart, CenturyLink, Avista, BNSF Railway Co. and Weyerhaeuser. Some other big Washington businesses, including Microsoft and Amazon, would see their property taxes go up under the Republican plan. Still, statewide the GOP proposal would result in a net tax decrease of $92 million a year for owners of nonresidential parcels worth $5 million or more. Costco, Comcast and the owners of the Tacoma Mall are among those that would see property tax cuts of several hundred thousand dollars a year if the Republican plan becomes law. I have a retired grandmother in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle who’s going to see hundreds of dollars in tax increases so that Walmart can receive millions of dollars in tax reductions.span State Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle Democrats say the tax breaks show that the Republican plan is unfair, because it simultaneously would raise taxes for property owners in high-cost areas such as Seattle and Bellevue. “What that means in real-people language is I have a retired grandmother in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle who’s going to see hundreds of dollars in tax increases so that Walmart can receive millions of dollars in tax reductions,” said state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle. Republicans who control the state Senate say companies in rural and suburban areas could use the extra help, and that lowering their taxes is simply a byproduct of fixing how the state pays for schools. “It’s by no means the point of our bill, but it goes toward the inherent inequity in the levy system,” said state Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, referring to disparities in how much money rich and poor school districts can raise in local property-tax levies. “If we can not only fix the underlying levy system, but also bring our overall state economy closer together so we don’t have these two economies that change at the Seattle city line, then that’s a good thing for all of us,” said Braun, the lead Senate budget writer. In the McCleary school-funding case, state lawmakers are working to comply with a court order to fully fund basic education. To do that, the state must take on the full cost of teachers’ and other school employees’ salaries, part of which now are being paid unconstitutionally through local school district property-tax levies. Republican Senate leaders aim to solve that problem by enacting a new statewide property tax of $1.55 per $1,000 in assessed property value, while eliminating local school district levies starting in 2019. That means property taxes in some areas, including many rural and suburban school districts, would go down, because right now their local levy rates are higher than the GOP’s proposed flat rate. For that reason, Boeing’s facilities in and around Everett would get a cut in property taxes of about $2.9 million annually under the Republican plan, according to the Revenue Department’s estimates. The aerospace company already benefited from more than $300 million in tax breaks from the state in 2015. It goes toward the inherent inequity of the levy system.span State Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia At the same time, areas with high property values and low levy rates — such as Seattle, Mercer Island and Redmond — would see big tax increases under the Republican proposal. That’s why companies in those areas, including Amazon and Microsoft, would see their taxes rise. David Schumacher, the budget director for Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, said others besides tech giants would have to pay more under the GOP plan. “The problem is that in Seattle, Mercer Island and Bellevue, you don’t have to be rich to see your property taxes going up,” he said. “Every business in Seattle is not Amazon.” The Revenue Department analysis didn’t consider the potential effects of new, more modest local levies that school districts could enact starting in 2020 under the GOP plan. If school districts enact those additional taxes, large companies in their boundaries wouldn’t necessarily see the same tax breaks. Democrats who control the state House are largely looking at options other than property-tax changes to solve the McCleary problem. Their budget proposal would raise about $3 billion in other taxes, without substantially altering local school-district levies. Under the House Democrats’ proposal, businesses with a taxable revenue of more than $250,000 would see a 20 percent hike in their business and occupation tax rates, a change that would bring the state about $1.2 billion in revenue every two years. While the Democratic plan would exempt many small businesses from paying B&O taxes and allow others a $100,000 deduction, about 72,000 companies that bring in more than $500,000 a year would feel the full brunt of the 20 percent tax increase. House leaders also want to enact a new tax on capital gains, such as income from the sales of stocks and bonds, which Republicans have sharply criticized as the first step toward enacting a general income tax in Washington. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the $7.4 million property break the company would receive under the Senate GOP plan, or which approach the company favors to solve McCleary. The Washington Roundtable, a business group, hasn’t taken a position on the House and Senate tax proposals, either, said Steve Mullin, the organization’s president. The roundtable’s members include executives from several businesses that would see property-tax reductions under the Senate Republican plan. Mullin said that although his group hasn’t weighed in on either tax package, he sees the Senate GOP’s plan as being more progressive than Democrats give it credit for. In promoting some of their tax proposals this year, including the capital gains tax, Democrats have talked about the need to make wealthy individuals pay their fair share. “When you look at the whole Washington system, this change would make it more progressive on average,” Mullin said of the GOP’s property tax plan. “Wealthy individuals and businesses in high-value areas are going to proportionally pay more taxes.” Melissa Santos: 360-357-0209, @melissasantos1 Tax changes for businesses under GOP plan An analysis by the state Department of Revenue looked at how a Republican plan to fix funding of Washington’s schools would affect nonresidential taxpayers with parcels valued at $5 million or more, based on the companies’ tax bills from 2016. The analysis looked at the effects of imposing the GOP’s proposed statewide property tax of $1.55 per $1,000 in assessed value, while eliminating local school district property tax levies starting in 2019. The analysis doesn’t account for potential tax increases that could come from districts enacting new, more modest local levies starting in 2020, as the GOP plan allows.

Boeing’s new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners. It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp. Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co’s venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014. Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX. “These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies,” he said. Upskill’s software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers’ tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company’s revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters. “Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual,” Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production. Boeing declined to specify investment amounts, “but this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts,” spokesman Chaz Bickers said.

Vice-chancellor Francis Aduol praised the partnership and said the donation will provide practical and research skills needed. Advertisement By PAULINE KAIRU More by this Author Aviation students at Technical University of Kenya will now receive training on Airbus and Boeing aircraft engine. The students will train on an engine manufactured by General Electric. The engine, books, training aids, used aircraft parts and manuals were donated Monday by Kenya Airways, General Electric and Boeing as part of a joint plan to improve aviation studies in the region. Regional sales director for General Electric Aviation in Africa, Dr Rajiv Bissessur, said the need for skilled aviation professionals in the region was on the rise as the industry continued to grow. “The donated CF6 engine will enable aeronautical engineering students to experience hands-on learning with one of the most popular wide body aircraft engine in service today and increase the pool of talented aviation experts that will be needed to service the needs of the airlines in Africa and around the world,” Dr Bissessur said during the handover ceremony at the institute. KQ’s strategy and performance management director Thomas Omondi said the donation will ensure a stronger foundation of aeronautical skills. Vice-chancellor Francis Aduol praised the partnership and said the donation will provide practical and research skills needed by students and, therefore, increase the university’s competitiveness. email print In the headlines Address hacking fears, CoG tells IEBC Lusaka says there should be a manual back up that is credible and cannot be manipulated.

California. Second to that is Washington State, the home of Boeing and Microsoft, and then last but never least, Oregon. Sandwiched in between two huge attention-getters like Washington and California, Oregon never seems to get the press it deserves. However, there is much to offer in this state besides the capital city of Portland, and Oregon is steadily staking its claim to fame in a number of areas. Whether you are a resident or a venture capitalist, you may be looking at solid investments in this beautiful Pacific Northwest state. Here are five industries to consider investing in. 1. Hospitality While this subject may still be taboo in many circles, the fact is that cannabis is now legal for recreational use in the State of Oregon. As a result, increasing numbers of tourists are hitting the west coast instead of states like Colorado where there really is little to offer but lovely scenery and some of the world’s finest ski resorts. Oregon, on the other hand, has so much more to offer than recreational cannabis and the lovely Siskiyou, Cascade, and Olympic mountain ranges. There are major medical universities here and miles and miles of coastline that offers a breathtaking view of the Pacific Ocean. During the summer season, there are literally hundreds of thousands of visitors traveling up and down the I-5 or the 101 and these travelers need to rest and recharge somewhere. Hospitality is a growing industry in Oregon, not only due to recreational pot but also because there is a real need to cater to travelers going up and down the coast all months of the year. From bed and breakfast facilities to dining and entertainment, this is a key time to get into the hospitality industry in God’s Country, as the Pacific Northwest has been called for many, many years. 2. Aviation Repair and Maintenance When you think of airports in Oregon, what comes to mind? Of course, you will think of Portland International Airport, PDX, which has literally hundreds of flights into and out of major domestic and international airports. But there are actually six different airports in the state, many of which offer connecting flights so that visitors don’t need to travel far by car once arriving in, or departing from, PDX. The six airports that handle commercial passenger flights are: 1. Portland International Airport – PDX 2. Eugene Airport – EUG 3. Medford Airport – MFR 4. North Bend Airport – OTH 5. Pendleton Airport – PDT 6. Redmond – RDM The only two actually on the coast are Portland and North Bend, but you will find that Portland really is inland by a bit and why they list it as coastal is anyone’s guess! The closest anyone can come to understanding this is the fact that Portland has a direct route on a highway to the coast whereas the others on the I-5 corridor have rather tangled approaches west of the shoreline. If you are interested in a business that will quickly grow based on current industry information, you might want to set up shop as an aviation mechanic, as you will almost certainly receive more work than you can handle at any given time. Bear in mind that those smaller regional airports probably don’t have carrier mechanics on duty, so even the larger airlines are likely to outsource many of their repairs and overhauls to you – a lucrative venture if ever there was one. 3. Fishing Excursions With a coastline that is 363.1 miles in length, how many fishing excursions do you think could possibly be run on a daily basis? If you only had one fishing boat per mile, that would be 363 at a bare minimum! Of course, there aren’t docks on every inch of the coast, but you get the picture! Leaving from any point on the coast of Oregon you can go fishing, but there are also crabbing and clamming excursions that are netting a huge profit each and every year. The State of Oregon could do with more fishing excursions to facilitate a growing number of visitors each year and so it is safe to say that you could net a tidy profit investing in fishing excursions off the coast that are open to the hobbyist sports fisherman and woman. 4. Real Estate With much of the interior of the state still highly untapped, this would be the time to buy up some prime real estate that had previously been unattractive due to the real estate mantra – location, location, location. After all, who would want to live in a huge area of the country where there is little to offer but simply that, country? With the cannabis industry taking off to such a great extent in Oregon, now would be the time to buy up some of this key real estate. No, you don’t need to be a commercial pot farmer, but eventually one will come along willing to pay almost any price for some prime real estate and wouldn’t it be nice if you held title to a big chunk of that land? 5. Home Healthcare Finally, this should come as no surprise. Did you think Oregon was excluded from the states with growing numbers of Baby Boomers reaching their senior years? Home healthcare is a growing industry that is in great demand in every corner of the nation. Whether you are a trained nurse or medical professional isn’t really important if you intend to invest in a home healthcare startup. Your venture capital is what’s needed. Hire nurses and administrators to run the agency for you, but this is one investment that will most certainly pay off – especially within the next couple of decades. So there you have five industries that are set to explode in the State of Oregon. Are you looking to invest in this often overlooked beautiful Pacific Northwest state? If so, any of the above industries can yield a tidy profit and each bears closer scrutiny. Which appeals most to you? Believe it or not, you won’t go wrong. Share.

Iran had been expected to receive the first of 80 aircraft ordered from the US planemaker in April 2018, but at least one brand-new aircraft is reported to be sitting unused because it is no longer needed by the Turkish carrier. Industry sources said Boeing was in negotiations to release at least one 777-300ER originally built for Turkish Airlines, which is deferring deliveries due to weaker traffic following last year’s failed coup attempt in Turkey. Boeing said it never comments on talks with customers. The airlines involved were not immediately available for comment. Iran’s Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan told the semi-official Mehr news agency the first Boeing 777 aircraft would reach Tehran within a month.

Fifty Years and Counting, the Boeing 737 Remains One of the Safest Ways to Travel “I flew the 737 for 18 years and can honestly say that it was a superbly capable and safe aircraft." I was reminded of just how many people are petrified of flying on a recent flight from Inverness to London Gatwick. The guy sat next to me, a man I had just spent the weekend with climbing the side of icy mountains—untethered to anything but our crampons—crushed his armrests through fear at the slightest notion of turbulence. We all know air travel is the safest kind of travel. "The numbers are on your side," we'll say. Or a favourite of mine, "It's actually more dangerous driving to the airport." That doesn't help the slightest bit though when you're at 36,000 feet. The huge numbers involved in the game of odds are intangible, mostly, for the human brain. But on Sunday, the 50th anniversary of the Boeing 737, the numbers come up clearly in the favour of survival. Since 1967, Boeing has delivered 9,448 of the aircraft, in some variant or another, and there are still 4,506 more on order. But there have been only 196 complete hull losses. Production photo of first Boeing 737-100. Image: Gordon Werner/Flickr Just over 100 of those losses were original 737-100 or 737-200 variants, of which only 1,144 were built in the 1960s. They're old news, you don't have to worry about them anymore. The later 737 variants, known as 737-300, 737-400, and 737-500s, only saw 49 losses out of a production run of 1990. Today's newer, next generation 737s, classed as 737-6/7/8/900, have only suffered 12 complete write-offs, out of more than 5,600 built, according to British 737 pilot Chris Brady, who has compiled a list of 737 incidents. "The 737 has proven itself to be an immensely safe airliner," Brady told Motherboard. "It is recently reached the incredible milestone of 50 years of operation with almost 10,000 aircraft delivered and over 4,000 more on order. This is by far the most of any airliner ever built surpassing the previous record holder, the venerable DC3 Dakota." Minus the ground incidents, rejected takeoffs, and minor landing gear issues that only result in passenger hospitalization at worst, actual catastrophic and fatal 737 crashes are even rarer. Multiple hijackings and one bomb account for many deaths, with bad weather on approach accounting for most of the others. The advanced cockpit instrumentation and improved air traffic control eliminates this today. So, while in may not be entirely fatality free, like the Airbus A340, there's almost absolutely no need to panic next time you're on a Boeing 737. "I flew the 737 for 18 years and can honestly say that it was a superbly capable and safe aircraft. This in my view came from its perfect balance of technology, automation and relatively simple human-machine interface which always kept 737 pilots in the loop as to what the aircraft was doing," Brady said to Motherboard. Correction: This article originally stated the 737 had suffered 169 complete hull losses. Up to data data from the Aviation Safety Network claims the 737 has suffered 196 hull-loss occurrences.

The three passenger aircraft, 767-300ERs that will be converted to carry freight, were bought “within the past couple of days,” UPS spokesman Jim Mayer said April 7. He declined to identify the seller or the cost and couldn’t say when the new planes will begin flights for the Atlanta-based courier. The company has 59 of the model now, all ordered from Boeing in January 1993. UPS ranks No. 1 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest U.S. and Canadian for-hire carriers. The 767, which debuted in 1982 as Boeing’s first twin-engine wide-body, has enjoyed a resurgence as a freighter as the passenger version loses popularity. Boeing plans to speed output by 25% later this year as it juggles contracts to build the first of potentially 400 aerial tankers for the U.S. Air Force and 50 freighters for FedEx Corp. “It’s simply a plan for investment in capacity we need for growth,” Mayer said of the 767 purchase. The planes will be deployed “pretty much anywhere we operate.” The price of used aircraft vary widely depending on age, condition and other factors. Consulting firm Avitas gives the 767-300ER a book value of between $9 million for a 20-year-old plane to $20 million for one that’s a decade old. UPS in October ordered 14 larger Boeing 747 jumbo jets valued at $5.3 billion amid strong package-volume growth in China and Hong Kong. Mayer didn’t know if UPS had sought to order new 767s before buying the used ones. Air Transport Services Group Inc. and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. have been acquiring used 767s to operate for Amazon.com Inc.’s nascent air-cargo service. Each will operate 20 of the planes for the online retailer. Cargo Facts reported earlier that UPS purchased a 767 from Japan Airlines Co.

Quiet Logistics, which ships apparel out of its Devens, Mass., warehouse, had been using robots made by a company called Kiva Systems. When Amazon bought Kiva in 2012, Quiet hired scientists. In 2015 it spun out a new company called Locus Robotics, which raised $8 million in venture capital. Last year, Locus unveiled its own warehouse robotics solution called the LocusBot — first using it for its own business, then selling them to other companies. Amazon.com boxes are shown stacked near a Boeing 767 Amazon "Prime Air" cargo plane on display in a Boeing hangar in Seattle. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge Now, Locus has landed a bigger fish: It’s selling its robots to DHL Worldwide Express, the world’s largest third-party logistics company. DHL will use the machines at a Southhaven, Miss., location to help ship surgical devices to operating rooms across the country. To do that, Locus’s software directs a LocusBot to a shelf where the specific item is located. A human worker meets it there, reads a description of the item off an iPad, and drops it into a plastic bucket mounted on the machine. The idea is that the robot does the majority of the traveling, while the worker simply patrols a specified zone. “The first trend was to try to replace humans,” said Rick Faulk, chief executive of Locus. “Now it’s about humans and robots working collaboratively.” Locus isn’t alone. Amazon’s acquisition of Kiva set off an arms race among robot makers and shippers across the United States who scurried to keep up with the e-commerce giant. That includes 6 River Systems, a Waltham, Mass.-based company founded by former Kiva employees, which this week is showing its robot at ProMat, an industry trade show in Chicago. The big changes in warehouse robotics, said Adrian Kumar, vice president for solutions design at DHL, come in response to the rise of e-commerce. For decades, operators were focused on the task of loading pallets and shipping them to retailers, who broke up the shipments and routed them to retail locations. Fulfilling online orders, on the other hand, requires shippers to pack boxes with a diverse set of individual items and route them on to customers’ homes. That shift has given way to what people in the business call collaborative robotics, in which a human warehouse worker toils alongside an autonomous machine. At the Quiet Logistics warehouse, the robots shorten the distance a warehouse worker travels on a typical day from 14 miles to less than 5 miles, Mr. Faulk said. The robots, meanwhile, park themselves directly in front of the shelf that the worker is supposed to pick from, decreasing the risk the human will pick the wrong item. That makes the job easier, and is appealing to employees. “Working with robots is a fun thing to do,” Mr. Faulk said. What that means for warehouse humans is an open question. There were 939,000 people working in the industry in February, up 44 percent over the past 10 years, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Our deep understanding of our customers’ applications allows us to develop solutions that create substantial value for them. Our innovations drive performance and, paired with our focus on cost effectiveness, have allowed us to successfully build long-term customer relationships. Today, our hard-working and talented employees make the products that are mission critical to some of the world’s leading companies, including GE, United Technologies, Boeing, Airbus, Ford and PACCAR; these customers believe in what we are doing. Don’t just take our word for it. Here’s what our customers have to say: “Arconic has become a key partner to Airbus for new technologies. What I particularly value is Klaus’ deep understanding of the critical levers to support OEM goals. As CEO of Airbus, I fully support his continued leadership of Arconic.” – Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus Group, March 2017 “In a technology-driven sector like aerospace…we need our top-tier suppliers operating as true business and industry partners. Klaus Kleinfeld and his team have…improved our business relationship by focusing in the right areas, increasing our collective competitiveness and delivering innovation and greater value to the customers we serve together in global markets.” – Dennis Muilenburg, Chairman, President & CEO, The Boeing Company, March 2017 “Klaus Kleinfeld and his team have been among our most valuable partners in the development of some of the most complex parts that make up Pratt & Whitney’s Geared Turbofan Engine… [we] support Klaus and the rest of Arconic management as they remain focused on the investments that will secure sustainable, long-term growth for UTC, for Arconic, and for our entire industry.” – Greg J. Hayes, Chairman, President & CEO of United Technologies Corp., March 2017 “Investments in technology and rate readiness are more important than ever within the supply chains of our growing aviation industry. GE supports Klaus and the Arconic commitment to those priorities and the long-term future of our industry.” – David Joyce, GE Vice Chair and GE Aviation President & CEO, February 2017 Shareholders should ask themselves: if Elliott has credible ideas about how to strengthen Arconic’s business, improve operating performance and build long-term value, why haven’t any of our key customers endorsed Elliott? ELLIOTT’S IDEAS WOULD DAMAGE OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND RISK OUR FUTURE Unfortunately, Elliott fails to understand that the success of our business requires close, collaborative partnerships with our customers that have been built over many years and even decades. By successfully shifting to higher-value, less commoditized products, we have doubled the profitability in Arconic’s businesses over the last eight years. At Arconic, we believe that pricing should reflect the value we bring to our customers – and the greater value we create for them, the greater profitability for our shareholders. In contrast, rather than maintaining or strengthening our close customer ties and innovation edge, Elliott has proposed that Arconic cut R&D spending and “utilize its pricing power with customers”2* – otherwise known as price gouging. These short-sighted ideas might be good for an activist hedge fund investor in the near term. But, they would put our critical customer relationships at significant risk, and potentially lead to the loss of their business altogether – significantly damaging our future. Arconic’s Board and management have a strong, clearly defined three-year plan that focuses on delivering value to you, our shareholders. Elliott has no clear plan.         Arconic’s Value-Enhancing Path     Elliott’s Value-Destroying Ideas • Focus on sustained profitable growth in       X No operational plan presented attractive markets X Likely near-term plan of cutting R&D, which • Deliver value to customers through   would risk losing the innovative edge that unique technology and material science is critical to Arconic’s customers and future • Continuously invest in innovation for profitable growth new products and better processes X Indicated plan of price gouging, which • Disciplined focus on cost efficiencies in   would alienate customers and potentially the businesses as well as in corporate lead to loss of business • Increase capital efficiency with a focus X Recommending a CEO candidate who has   on both short- and long-term returns   reportedly had a difficult relationship with • Maintain a high-performance team valued Arconic customers; is in breach of his non-compete contract; and has financial arrangements with Elliott X Removal of critical and necessary skills from               the Board of Directors   ELLIOTT’S PROPOSED CEO IS WRONG FOR ARCONIC AND IS NOT INDEPENDENT Elliott has proposed that Larry Lawson, a former Spirit AeroSystems CEO and currently Elliott’s consultant, should replace Mr. Kleinfeld, our CEO. In our view, Mr. Lawson is not the right person to lead Arconic. There are significant doubts about his ability to maintain the customer relationships that are an essential element of our future success. Shareholders should ask themselves: Why did Mr. Lawson depart from both Lockheed Martin and Spirit AeroSystems so abruptly? And what issues did he leave behind? Here’s what independent third parties had to say about Mr. Lawson’s customer relationships:* In relation to Mr. Lawson serving as CEO of Spirit AeroSystems: “Industry executives and government officials who worked with Lawson said he might not be best suited for often tense negotiations with both Boeing and Airbus about large supply agreements…” (Reuters, 1/27/16) Following Mr. Lawson’s departure from Lockheed Martin: “‘The change in leadership could pave the way for better relations with the Pentagon…There’s just been a very bad dynamic established by current [Lockheed] leadership and the customer [the Pentagon]…’” (Richard Aboulafia, aerospace industry analyst, quoted in Fort Worth Star-Telegram, 3/20/13) …and Mr. Lawson’s mysterious exits from Spirit AeroSystems and Lockheed Martin: Regarding his departure from Spirit AeroSystems: “‘His sudden decision to go with contract negotiations with Boeing and Airbus unresolved is puzzling.’” (Cai von Rumohr, aerospace analyst at Cowen & Co., quoted in the Wall Street Journal, 6/8/16) Regarding his departure from Lockheed Martin: “The departure of Lawson is especially intriguing, because he took over as head of aeronautics only 12 months ago, and he is leaving to lead a second-tier company that has a fraction of the sales his Lockheed unit did.” (Forbes, 3/19/13) Shareholders should also ask themselves whether Mr. Lawson is a viable CEO candidate given that he is subject to a non-compete agreement with Spirit AeroSystems; Spirit AeroSystems has said Mr. Lawson is already in violation of that agreement as a result of his involvement with Elliott. And, finally, shareholders must wonder how Elliott’s proposed compensation arrangements with Mr. Lawson would influence his actions if he were to become CEO. Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification payments. In total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years, so that if Mr. Lawson became Arconic’s CEO, he would nevertheless continue to be on Elliott’s payroll. This compensation arrangement creates conflicts of interest. Mr. Lawson is getting paid by Elliott. How will he be objective and act in the best interests of all our shareholders? Elliott should not be permitted to “buy” the next CEO in hopes of influencing him to implement its short-sighted plan. THE BOARD RECOMMENDS SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” ARCONIC’S INDEPENDENT NOMINEES AND GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS Your Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote “FOR” Arconic’s five highly qualified candidates – Amy E. Alving, David P. Hess, Klaus Kleinfeld, Ulrich Schmidt and Ratan N. Tata – which is a vote in favor of the Company’s strategic plan and a Board that is committed to creating value for all shareholders. Elliott has no experience operating a business like ours, and the election of its nominees would remove critical skills from your Board and jeopardize our future. Elliott has no fiduciary responsibility to Arconic shareholders. They have misled and manipulated the facts. And they have no plan to deliver value. After careful study, your Board believes that Arconic has the right strategy and the right team to drive future value. We ask for your support. PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENT. KEEP ARCONIC ON A STRONG PATH.

Additional information, including the letter to shareholders, is available at www.arconic.com/annualmeeting. The full text of the letter follows: Dear Fellow Arconic Shareholder: Over the past eight years, your management team, under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld, has executed a highly successful transformation and built Arconic into a global leader in precision engineering and advanced manufacturing. Elliott Management ("Elliott) agrees: "Arconic possesses a world class asset base, and in some cases, one of a kind assets.1* Arconic was created through years of deliberate investments developing cutting-edge technology, material science and advanced manufacturing. This, along with managements focus on strong cost control, has enabled Arconic to very successfully develop long-term customer partnerships and profitably grow. Your Board and management team have a clear plan to continue the progress we have already made: continue to invest in innovative and high-value solutions for our customers and ensure that customers continue turning to Arconic to help them solve their most critical technological and manufacturing challenges. ARCONIC CUSTOMERS SUPPORT THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT TEAM AND STRATEGY OF INVESTING IN INNOVATION WHILE ENSURING COST EFFECTIVENESS Arconic has a best-in-class technology portfolio with more than 2,000 pending and granted patents. This includes game-changing innovations: bonding technology that helps automakers build better-performing, stronger, lighter cars and trucks, like the Ford F-150; high temperature blades for jet engines made by Pratt and Whitney and GE that make airplanes fly more efficiently; and 3D printed parts for aerospace giants like Airbus that push the reaches of current technology. We have a proven 128-year heritage of innovation born in places like Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Davenport. Our deep understanding of our customers applications allows us to develop solutions that create substantial value for them. Our innovations drive performance and, paired with our focus on cost effectiveness, have allowed us to successfully build long-term customer relationships. Today, our hard-working and talented employees make the products that are mission critical to some of the worlds leading companies, including GE, United Technologies, Boeing, Airbus, Ford and PACCAR; these customers believe in what we are doing.

Photo / Zunum Aero Imagine taking your next trip of a couple hundred miles. New York City to Boston, for example. Or Houston to Dallas. Tampa to Miami. The obvious choice now might be to drive. But what if you could show up at an airport at one of those cities, bypass security checkpoints, board a small hybrid-electric plane with luggage in hand, and be on the ground at your destination in about an hour - all for US$25 (NZ$36) each way? A company called Zunum Aero hopes to make that a reality, so that future travelers who normally take a car, bus or train for regional trips won't think twice about flying. The Washington state-based start-up says that since 2013, it has been developing a fleet of hybrid-electric planes that would make those kinds of inexpensive, short-haul flights possible. The company has some heavyweight investor partners, including Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures, subsidiaries of their respective companies. It also faces a number of competitors and obstacles, particularly battery limitations. But if successful, it could significantly change regional air travel, where options have shriveled and costs have crept up in recent decades. "Think of it as Tesla of the air," said Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures. "[Or] think of it as an electric bus in the air." Zunum Aero emerged from "stealth mode" on Wednesday to announce its ambitious goals: to be flying routes of up to 700 miles (think Atlanta to Washington, DC) by the mid-2020s and then routes of up to 1,000 miles (think Los Angeles to Seattle) by 2030. The start-up also laid out an array of promises: Door-to-door travel times cut in half. Lower operating costs. Airfares that would be 40 to 80 percent lower. All on quiet hybrid aircraft that would produce 80 per cent less emissions. Indeed, part of the company name was inspired by "tzunuum," the Mayan word for the hummingbird, for the bird's speed and efficiency. Continued below. Related Content Jane Kelsey: Governments in denial of a world changing around them Your Views: Readers' Letters John Drinnan: When does plain talk become hate speech? "To be perfectly honest, we've been wanting to tell the story for four years," Zunum Aero chief executive Ashish Kumar told The Washington Post. "What we've been building towards is really exciting and we believe fundamentally is going to change the shape of regional aviation." Kumar thinks operating costs for the company's hybrid-electric planes could be 40 to 80 per cent lower than for conventional aircraft. A small range-extending generator would be integrated into early planes, kicking in on longer flights where battery power isn't enough. The eventual goal would be for battery technology to become advanced enough to have planes relying entirely on electricity, eliminating fuel costs altogether, Kumar said. There are several reasons that people rarely choose to fly for short regional trips. Flying often means allotting extra time for getting to the airport, going through security and then boarding. Also, the airline industry's shift to larger planes and big-city hubs created what Kumar calls a "regional transport gap." Flights from midsize cities are now often routed through hubs, meaning door-to-door times for those trips are no better than they were 50 years ago, Kumar said. And air options for smaller communities have been dwindling or disappearing, he added. Today, 97 per cent of US air traffic comes from 2 percent of the more than 5,000 airports in the country, according to the 2014-2034 FAA Aerospace Forecast. About 95 per cent of trips under 500 miles are taken by car, according to the US Department of Transportation's National Household Travel Survey. For trips between 500 and 750 miles, about 61 per cent of travelers drive and 34 per cent fly. For trips between 750 and 1,000 miles, a little more than half of travelers fly and 42 per cent drive. Kumar and his team think this is where electric-hybrid planes can step in. Whereas a Boeing 737 today seats anywhere from 85 to more than 200 passengers, a Zunum plane would have from 10 to 50 seats. Because the Transportation Security Administration imposes fewer regulations on smaller aircraft, those passengers would likely be able to skip long security lines. Removing luggage check-in options also would save on time on the ground, he said. The resulting trip would feel more like a cross between private corporate air travel and hopping on a bus. Still, the company is not without its competitors and detractors. This year, a Massachusetts-based start-up called Wright Electric announced similar plans to roll out "zero-emissions electric airliners designed to save money and our planet" within a decade. The Y Combinator-backed company, however, told BBC News that it was relying on continued advances in battery technology. "The battery technology is not there yet," Graham Warwick, technology editor of Aviation Weekly, told the BBC. "It's projected to come but it needs a significant improvement. Nobody thinks that is going to happen anytime soon." It remains too early to tell what the commercial aviation industry will look like by the mid-2020s and whether one-way fares in the US$25 range would be feasible then. Even now, it is not unheard of for low-cost carriers such as Frontier or Spirit to offer double-digit airfares on domestic routes. That hasn't stopped others from diving into hybrid-electric aerospace projects. Airbus has also been developing its "E-Fan" hybrid electric aircraft since 2014, and in 2015 it became the first all-electric twin-engine plane to cross the English Channel. Though the "E-Fan" has only two seats, Airbus is hoping the technology will lead to a regional airliner or helicopter. Plans for helicopter-esque electric "VTOL" (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft have also been emerging from Silicon Valley lately. The Verge's Andrew J. Hawkins reported that Uber, Airbus, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and Google co-founder Larry Page are all working on developing their own VTOLs. "Because nothing says 'I'm very rich and I hate traffic' like a flying car project," Hawkins wrote for the technology site. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX said it was confident in investing in Zunum Aero "because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space." Simi compared the push for hybrid-electric planes to the airline industry's advancement from strictly propeller planes to jet aircraft. "It's that type of transformation," Simi said. "We're very excited about where this is going. It's still very early, of course. We now have a seat at the table at what we believe is going to be an amazing change." - Washington Post By Amy B Wang Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The airline moved to allay concerns after its CEO, Bjorn Kjos, said the runway is too short to accommodate the take-off of a fully-laden New York-bound Boeing 737MAX aircraft. Norwegian will use the aircraft on its Providence (Boston) route from July — Cork Airport’s first direct transatlantic service. But despite always insisting it planned to launch a Cork-New York route in 2018, Mr Kjos told the Irish Examiner on Friday calculations show Cork’s runway is just too short for a MAX aircraft to take off for New York’s Stewart Airport a further 250km south of Providence. “The problem in Cork is the runway. If it was longer it is highly likely we could have done Stewart,” he said. “Normally Boeing end up producing a better aircraft than the prototype but it remains to be seen if it is possible to fly to Stewart. If possible, we will do it. As it looks with the figures we have so far, it’s a little bit too far.” But a spokesman for the airline said last night: “The door remains open to a potential Cork-New York route once we take delivery of the new Boeing 737MAX aircraft this summer and learn more about its operational capabilities. "For now, our priority is to deliver the first ever transatlantic flights from Cork Airport, with the new Boston-Providence service, and we are delighted that the route is already proving to be one of our fastest selling.” Aviation sources suggest the airline could use the European-made Airbus 321LR — it has 30 on order — on the New York route. But Norwegian said they have to use US-made Boeing. “Mr Trump wants American jobs and we are flying Boeing aircraft. We’re setting up a lot of American jobs and also a lot of bases. So we are doing exactly what the president wants,” Mr Kjos said.

Lightsabers — the favored weapon of the Jedi in “Star Wars” films — will remain in the fictional realm for now, but after decades of development, laser weapons are here and are being deployed on military vehicles and planes. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon — all the big defense players — are developing prototypes for the Pentagon. The navy has since 2014 been testing a 30-kilowatt laser on one of its warships, the USS Ponce. Lockheed Martin has just announced a 60-kilowatt laser weapon that soon will be installed on an army truck for operational testing against mortars and small drones. The weapon can take out a drone from a distance of about 460 meters by keeping its beam locked onto the target for a few seconds, Jim Murdoch, an international business development director at Lockheed, told reporters this week. But unlike in the movies, the laser beam is invisible to the naked eye. By focusing the beam on a target, the technology rapidly heats the inside of an incoming mortar round, causing it to explode midair. An impressive feat considering the round is moving at hundreds of miles per hour. The laser weapon can also pierce the outer skin of a drone, taking out key circuits and making it crash. For the moment, the lasers being tested are all of about this same power. Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, sees that relatively small output increasing rapidly. Within just a few years, he expects far more powerful prototypes of more than 150 kilowatts. Such a laser could knock out a missile from the side, where it is most vulnerable. He said special operations forces want to test such a system by 2020 on an AC-130 gunship that specializes in ground support for troops. And within six to eight years, U.S. forces could begin using laser systems of more than 300 kilowatts, he added. That degree of power could knock out an incoming missile head-on. Eventually, reality will increasingly catch up with fiction. The U.S. military is also weighing the possibility of mounting lasers on drones flying at very high altitudes, making them capable of shooting down ballistic missiles shortly after launch. Another bonus for the military from lasers is the promise of seemingly unending and cheap firepower. Unlike conventional canons that need shells, laser canons are limited only by the amount of electricity that can be generated. Gunzinger deems lasers as especially promising on warplanes, which could potentially get an unlimited reservoir of firepower to defend against adversaries’ missiles. “An aircraft doesn’t have to return to base to upload more weapons. It could refuel and continue to operate with its nearly unlimited magazine,” he said. But before laser technology can be integrated into combat planes, it must first be shrunk in size. Currently engineers are running into physical limitations on how much portable power can be produced and ways of cooling the technology. Lockheed wants to increase the power of its truck-mounted laser. “For a vehicle like this, there will be some engineering limits,” said Murdoch. “We will run out of space … that’s the kind of challenge we are working.” But industry reps and military officials say there’s only one thing stopping lasers from garnering widespread operational use: government funding. Congress is cautious. Lawmakers recall a lengthy program that cost more than $5 billion in which a Boeing 747 was retrofitted to carry a laser gun supposedly capable of shooting down enemy missiles. The program was scrapped in 2012 over concerns it could never be operationally viable. The laser beam used in that technology was generated by chemicals and was not strong enough to take out a missile.

[Photo/China Daily]  The rapid growth of China's business aviation market has attracted aircraft makers to increase their service offerings tailored for the country, where more than 600 business jets, worth $18 billion, are being operated. "China has become the second-largest business jet market, and it also enjoys the fastest growth in the world," Liao Xuefeng, chairman and CEO of China Business Aviation Group, said while attending the annual three-day Asian Business Aviation Conference & Exhibition, which opens on Tuesday in Shanghai. To boost their market share, major aircraft manufacturers are rolling out new plans to upgrade their services and offer products tailored for the Chinese market. At ABACE 2017 on Monday, Airbus Corporate Jets announced a new initiative, or Easystart, to offer tailored support to buyers of its corporate jets already in service. There are more than 180 Airbus corporate jets in service globally, with about 20 in China, according to Airbus chief operating officer of customers John Leahy. Easystart will help buyers understand how an Airbus corporate jet can perform on their key missions, how it can be an attractively affordable upgrade, and how services, such as training, support and upgrades, are available to ensure a smooth entry into service. Similarly, Boeing Business Jets recently signed an agreement with Aircraft Maintenance & Engineering Corp Beijing to serve as an official BBJ warranty service center. The BBJ and Ameco agreement allows BBJ customers based in China customized and fast support for their aircraft. Boeing Business Jets is seeing unprecedented growth in China, where the fleet size has tripled over the past five years, having 29 BBJ aircraft in operation. Also on Monday, Malta-based VistaJet, a company specializing in premium long-range private jet travel, launched its sales platform on WeChat, a popular social media platform in China. The launch of this service stems from the 11 percent year-on-year passenger growth in China last year, and 17 percent of its global customer base is represented by China, according to Ian Moore, chief commercial officer of VistaJet. Bombardier Tianjin service center was launched on Friday, marking the operation of Bombardier Business Aircraft's first service center in China, and its eighth globally. "With a growing fleet of more than 110 aircraft in China out of 280 in Asia, Bombardier Business Aircraft's Service Centers offer comprehensive capabilities and flexibility to our customers. Our priority is to ensure that we are ready to support our customers wherever their needs arise," said Lanny Schindelmeiser, general manager of Bombardier Tianjin Aviation Services Co Ltd. "In a number of ways, business aviation is evolving and growing in Asia, just as ABACE continues to evolve and grow as an Asian show," said National Business Aviation Association President and CEO Ed Bolen. "The industry is becoming ever-more established in this region, and that means it will continue to become increasingly important in China, across the Asia-Pacific and around the world," added Bolen. ABACE 2017 has more than 170 exhibitors, the largest number ever at the event, and showcases 35 aircraft. Follow China.org.cn on Twitter and Facebook to join the conversation.

The anti-border tax coalition, known as Americans for Affordable Products, includes large corporations that require imports like automakers and retail giants like Target , Best Buy and Walmart. The tax opponents will target 40 members of Congress in 11 states, said coalition spokesman Joshua Baca. "We're talking to businesses, local associations, having a frank conversation with them about how dumb this idea is," Baca said. His group argues the proposal will raise consumer prices. As part of a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed lowering the corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, imposing a 20 percent tax on imports and excluding export revenue from taxable income. The proposal has some strong corporate backers who say it will boost American jobs and not raise prices, including companies that do considerable amount of exporting, such as Boeing, Caterpillar and Pfizer. The anti-border tax group is planning to host a town hall meeting next week in Nevada with Republican Senator Dean Heller, which will also be co-sponsored by local business groups and Americans For Prosperity, the conservative group funded by the Republican Koch brothers which also opposes the border tax. Town hall meetings have gained more attention recently as events featuring Republican lawmakers have been targeted by activists to voice their opposition to several proposals, including repealing the Affordable Care Act which widened health insurance coverage for about 20 million Americans. Additionally, the anti-tax group will hold a discussion in Ohio with Republican Representative David Joyce, where he will hear from local furniture store owners who would be affected by a border tax, Baca said. Concurrently, members of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which is comprised of large retailers like Autozone , Walgreens Boot Alliance, Inc. and J.C. Penny Company, are using the recess to give members of Congress behind-the-scenes tours of both their headquarters and stores in an effort to persuade them against the tax, spokesman Brian Dodge said. Both groups are hoping to make more voters aware of their position and are armed with an opinion poll by a pollster who also works for several Republican members of Congress. The poll, shared first with Reuters and which was conducted with funding from opponents of the tax, found 63 percent of voters are against the tax, including 70 percent of women. Additionally, the poll makes the case that 56 percent of voters say they would be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who supports the tax proposal.  © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it April 10 at 6:13 PM automakers Toyota Kentucky plant to get $1.33 billion Japanese automaker Toyota Motor said it is spending $1.33 billion in its Kentucky plant as part of a plan to invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. The investment in the plant, Toyota’s largest, comes amid uncertainty over President Trump’s trade policies that could affect certain Japanese firms’ capital expenditure plans. Trump criticized the automaker earlier this year and said he would impose a hefty fee if it built its Corolla cars for the U.S. market at a plant in Mexico. Toyota joins a host of automakers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Honda Motor and Daimler that have announced investments in the United States since Trump won the U.S. election. Even U.S. car manufacturers Ford Motor and General Motors have announced plans to spend more domestically. “Toyota’s decision to invest $1.3 billion in their Kentucky plant is further evidence that manufacturers are now confident that the economic climate has greatly improved under my administration,” Trump said in the statement issued by Toyota. Toyota said that the investment would help in its new production process that would allow for a more flexible production environment, helping it build better cars and respond quicker to customers. The plant employs about 8,200, and Toyota recently boosted the count by more than 700 ahead of the launch of the new version of the Camry. — Reuters airlines Quality has improved, annual report says Airlines are getting better at sticking to their schedules and are losing fewer bags. Their customers seem to be complaining less often. Those are the findings of an annual report on U.S. airlines’ quality released Monday by researchers at Wichita State University and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Many passengers may have trouble believing those conclusions, however. In the past few days, Delta Air Lines suffered a multiday meltdown — canceling more than 3,000 flights after a one-day storm in Atlanta. And on Monday, United Airlines was in the spotlight after a video showed security agents dragging a man off a plane; he had refused to give up his seat on a flight that United overbooked. “People don’t look at the numbers,” admitted Dean Headley, a marketing professor at Wichita State and co-author of Monday’s report. “They just know what happened to them, or they hear what happened to other people.” The researchers used information compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation to rate the airlines for on-time performance, baggage handling, bumping passengers off oversold flights and complaints filed with the government. They judged Alaska Airlines to be the best U.S. carrier, followed closely by Delta. Frontier Airlines ranked last, followed by another discount carrier, Spirit Airlines. — Associated Press Also in Business Taiwan’s Foxconn has indicated that it may pay as much as 3 trillion yen ($26.99 billion) for Toshiba’s chip business, Bloomberg News reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. South Korea’s SK Hynix and chipmaker Broadcom have submitted preliminary bids for the business, valued at $17.98 billion or more, according to the report. Toshiba, the second-biggest NAND chip producer after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, is considering selling the majority — or all — of its marquee flash-memory chip business, as it seeks to make up for a $6.3 billion write-down from its U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse. Boeing hired Norsk Titanium to print the first structural titanium parts for its 787 Dreamliner, the Norwegian 3-D printing company said Monday, paving the way to cost savings of $2 million to $3 million for each plane. The contract is a major step in Boeing’s effort to cut the cost of its barely profitable 787 and a sign of growing industrial acceptance of 3-D printing technology, which is replacing more expensive traditional ways of manufacturing components. Strong, lightweight titanium alloy is seven times more expensive than aluminum and accounts for about $17 million of the cost of a $265 million Dreamliner, people in the industry say. Comcast plans to introduce an online video service offering hit shows from its NBCUniversal TV networks in the next 12 to 18 months, an effort to compete with rivals Netflix and CBS, people familiar with the matter said. The new service will include programs from the NBC broadcast network, and could include shows from Comcast cable channels Bravo, Syfy and USA, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Comcast is still determining many of the particulars of the service, including whether it will have a live feed of the broadcast network and whether it will include sports, the people said. Whole Foods Market shares surged the most in more than two years after activist investor Jana Partners acquired a stake of 8.3 percent and suggested that the organic-food grocer may want to put itself up for sale. The investment firm announced the holding in a filing Monday, saying it would seek talks with management and push for a review of Whole Foods’ strategic alternatives. Jana also may nominate at least three directors in a bid to help foster a turnaround. Whole Foods shares gained as much as 11 percent to $34.40 in New York, the most since November 2014. The stock had been up 1 percent this year through the end of last week. — From news services Coming today 10 a.m.: Labor Department releases job openings and labor turnover survey for February. business economy true Please provide a valid email address.

Town hall meetings have gained more attention recently as events featuring Republican lawmakers have been targeted by activists to voice their opposition to several proposals, including repealing the Affordable Care Act which widened health insurance coverage for about 20 million Americans. Additionally, the anti-tax group will hold a discussion in Ohio with Republican Representative David Joyce, where he will hear from local furniture store owners who would be affected by a border tax, Baca said. Concurrently, members of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which is comprised of large retailers like Autozone , Walgreens Boot Alliance, Inc. and J.C. Penny Company, are using the recess to give members of Congress behind-the-scenes tours of both their headquarters and stores in an effort to persuade them against the tax, spokesman Brian Dodge said. Both groups are hoping to make more voters aware of their position and are armed with an opinion poll by a pollster who also works for several Republican members of Congress. The poll, shared first with Reuters and which was conducted with funding from opponents of the tax, found 63 percent of voters are against the tax, including 70 percent of women. Additionally, the poll makes the case that 56 percent of voters say they would be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who supports the tax proposal.

The anti-border tax coalition, known as Americans for Affordable Products, includes large corporations that require imports like automakers and retail giants like Target , Best Buy and Walmart. The tax opponents will target 40 members of Congress in 11 states, said coalition spokesman Joshua Baca. "We´re talking to businesses, local associations, having a frank conversation with them about how dumb this idea is," Baca said. His group argues the proposal will raise consumer prices. As part of a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed lowering the corporate income tax to 20 percent from 35 percent, imposing a 20 percent tax on imports and excluding export revenue from taxable income. The proposal has some strong corporate backers who say it will boost American jobs and not raise prices, including companies that do considerable amount of exporting, such as Boeing, Caterpillar and Pfizer. The anti-border tax group is planning to host a town hall meeting next week in Nevada with Republican Senator Dean Heller, which will also be co-sponsored by local business groups and Americans For Prosperity, the conservative group funded by the Republican Koch brothers which also opposes the border tax. Town hall meetings have gained more attention recently as events featuring Republican lawmakers have been targeted by activists to voice their opposition to several proposals, including repealing the Affordable Care Act which widened health insurance coverage for about 20 million Americans.

(AP Photo/Mic Smith) Lawmakers to Trump: Cancel Obama-backed Boeing sales to Iran By Joel Gehrke (@Joelmentum) • 4/10/17 5:06 PM Joel Gehrke Foreign Affairs Reporter The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/headshot-joelgehrke.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More President Trump should cancel airplane sales to Iranian airlines that facilitate terrorism, a pair of Republican lawmakers urged Monday. "Iran's commercial airlines have American blood on their hands," Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., wrote in a letter to Trump. A government decision to block the aircraft sales would provoke an uproar at home and abroad. It would cost Boeing, which has inked a pair of deals to sell 110 to Iran-based airlines, about $20 billion. It could deter American and European businesses from investing in Iran, which the regime's leaders have argued amounts to violation of the nuclear agreement that former President Barack Obama's team negotiated. "The possibility that U.S.-manufactured aircraft could be used as tools of terror is absolutely unacceptable and should not be condoned by the U.S. government," Rubio and Roskam wrote. "The United States should revoke authorizations and re-impose sanctions on Iranian airlines found guilty of such support, and should bar U.S. companies from selling aircraft to Iran until the Iranian regime ceases using commercial airliners for illicit military purposes." The Obama administration granted a license authorizing Boeing to strike the deals last fall, following Iranian complaints that they were not receiving the expected economic benefit of the sanctions relief provided by the nuclear pact. "We are going to do what we can to meet our commitments as long as Iran continues to meet their nuclear-related commitments," then-State Department spokesman John Kirby said. The Obama administration did far too much to help Iran, Republican lawmakers maintained, and they responded with legislation that would bar U.S. banks from financing the deal. "Why should U.S. banks and their customers be implicated in Iranian atrocities?" Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., said in November. Democrats countered that attempts to undermine the Boeing sales would 'unravel' the nuclear agreement. "I'm going to bet that under the Trump administration, Republicans will not be so eager to move legislation to unravel this agreement because, like the rest of us, they do not know how Mr. Trump will govern and because they know there is no other reasonable approach to curbing Iran's nuclear ambition short of military intervention," Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said at the time. Trump has sent mixed messages on the Iran deal, by turns denouncing it and complaining that Iran wouldn't spend the money received through the nuclear deal with U.S. companies. "I think it is an imperfect arms control agreement," Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said during his confirmation hearings in January. "When America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies." Roskam and Rubio should have at least one ally in the Trump adminstration, in the former of current CIA director Mike Pompeo. "It is not your role to act as agents of the Iranian Chamber of Commerce," then-Congressman Pompeo wrote to the Obama administration in protest of the airplane sales last year. "America's security depends on you acknowledging that this agreement has not changed Iran's behavior in any material way." Also from the Washington Examiner North Korea warns it will make US 'fully accountable' for moving ship to region Korean leaders said their potential response would be justified in light of the "current grim situation." By Anna Giaritelli • 04/11/17 12:06 AM Trump's decision to attack Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is being supported in his ongoing civil war by Russia and Iran, might give Iran hawks such as Rubio and Roskam a chance to press their case. "As the main benefactor of Bashar al-Assad—whose regime has once again used chemical weapons to kill scores of men, women and children—Iran has consistently used commercial aircraft to transport the weapons and troops that have fueled the conflict in Syria which has claimed the lives of nearly 500,000 people," they observed in Monday's letter. "We therefore strongly urge you to prohibit U.S. companies from selling aircraft to Iran until Iran stops using commercial aircraft to advance its terror campaign around the world."

Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne with Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner in Chicago: Ontario is the largest export market for Illinois, which sends $10 billion a year in goods and services to the province. Every month, $233 million in auto parts flow back-and-forth between the two jurisdictions.   (HANDOUT PHOTO)   By Rob Ferguson Queen's Park Bureau Mon., April 10, 2017 Premier Kathleen Wynne went to Chicago with a bottle of ice wine and a message: let’s keep the Canada-U.S. border open and Great Lakes water quality top of mind. Wynne met Monday with Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner amid continuing concerns the Trump administration will bring in a border tax and gut $300 million in funding for lakes that are a source of drinking water to millions. Fresh from her weekend win against a “Buy American” provision dropped from the New York state budget, Wynne said she was pleased to sense Rauner is not signalling any similar policies. “Nothing he said to me suggests that he’d be interested in going there. He really sees the strong connection,” she told the Star in a telephone interview from the Windy City. Ontario is the largest export market for Illinois, which sends $10 billion a year in goods and services to the province. Every month, $233 million in auto parts flow back-and-forth between the two jurisdictions. Article Continued Below “We see an open border and our integrated economy, which has been built up over decades, as a strength,” she said after presenting her host, a wealthy former businessman, with a bottle of Ontario ice wine. “Governor Rauner gets that. He wants to find ways to work with us.” Rauner did not issue a statement on the meeting. Wynne also talked to executives at airliner giant Boeing Corp., warning of the perils of a border tax given that Ontario is a major part of the company’s supply chain, with landing gear and other parts made here. As Ontario did through lobbying efforts at the New York legislature against the proposed “Buy American” provision for state contracts of more than $100,000 — it warned the province would respond in kind — the premier cautioned a U.S. border tax would likely prompt retaliation from Ottawa. “It’s hard to imagine these things happening on only one side of the border, and, if they happen on both sides of the border, then there’s real damage done to the supply chain,” she said. Illinois is one of 28 states that count Ontario as their best or second-best export market. The provincial government notes that business with Canadian companies accounts for 340,000 jobs there, including 26,000 people directly employed by Canadian companies. Wynne has been meeting and speaking with governors of Great Lakes and other states in recent weeks to make sure Ontario gets out in front of any potentially punitive U.S. measures from Washington. “What’s really clear is there’s enormous uncertainty about exactly what the national government is going to do on any of these files and what they’re actually going to be able to accomplish,” said Wynne, who was joined in Chicago by Ontario’s representative in Washington, Monique Smith. “That’s not a particularly new piece of information, but it certainly underpins all these conversations . . . . I’m staking our interest and making it clear what we’re going to do in the face of whatever changes come forward.” On the environmental front, Wynne met with leaders of the Conference of Great Lakes & St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative and the Alliance for the Great Lakes. She is concerned that cuts to Great Lakes funding from the U.S. side will make it harder to maintain the health of the lakes amid threats from the Asian carp, other invasive species and algae blooms. “I’m very worried about it. I raised it with Gov. Rauner. I told him I was going to continue to be an advocate. We see it as very much a part of our relationship, our interconnectedness, this stewardship of the Great Lakes.” Read more about: United States, Kathleen Wynne, Great Lakes, Donald Trump Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Now it needs another. Advertisement Jet Aviation is expanding its Asia-Pacific maintenance base in Singapore with a third hangar at Seletar Aerospace Park. When completed late this year the 3,850 square meter building, which can hold two Boeing Business Jets or five Gulfstream G650s, will boost Jet’s hangar capacity there to 11,650 square meters. “We were quickly running out of space” as the fleet of ultra-long range, large-cabin aircraft in Asia-Pacific continues to grow, says John Riggir, Vice President and General Manager of Jet Aviation’s MRO and FBO facility in Singapore. “We consider Singapore our major Asia-Pacific service hub, supporting heavy maintenance and large refurbishment projects, while our facilities in Hong Kong and (soon) in Macau offer immediate maintenance services right at the doorstep of the region’s largest market. We are certainly open to considering new locations in China and other places, where and when the right elements are presented,” says Riggir. While several Chinese B-registered aircraft are coming to Seletar every month for maintenance, growth in demand for Jet’s services there is primarily from the rest of Asia-Pacific. “We support 13 different country registration requirements,” notes Riggir. The new hangar will also double the space of Jet Aviation’s interiors shop to 860 square meters.  Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

(Supplied photo)   HI-TRAC The author's shorthand for Happiness Index, Infrastructure, Talent, Regulations, Access and Capital. The six pillars that make UAE a great place for a startup. This week, the focus is on the Capital available in the UAE. It is often said that the fastest way to make a million dollars is to invest a billion in an airline. Perhaps no other industry embodies inherent contradiction as much as the airline industry. Despite its RoI challenges, some of the world's most celebrated entrepreneurs have invested in airlines. It is cutting edge technology spliced with massive romanticism. The high cost of operations, wafer-thin margins, massive competition, strong regulations and operating envelopes have made airlines the most brutally efficient business machines. A quick look at statista.com shows that commercial airlines carried more that 3.5 billion passengers and generated a revenue of $518 billion in 2015. According to Boeing's report 'Long-term market: Current market outlook 2016-35, the number of jet airplanes in service in 2015 was 22,510. It is expected to double over the next 20 years to 45,240 airplanes. That's the thing about the airline industry. It envelopes and engages the left-brain and right-brain in equal measure. Jump on the airliners.net and you are immediately in a candy store full of statistics and the most amazing pictures possible. Of course, if you want to enter the manufacturing side of the business, you need to be in a niche. Either become a segment challenger like Embraer or a specialist in critical components. Part of the reason for the actual manufacture of aircraft being concentrated in the West is that the accepted aircraft certification bodies, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are in the US and Europe, respectively. However, there is tremendous opportunity for Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) including component manufacturing in Asia. It makes sense because Asia's share of commercial aviation is now upwards of 40 per cent. DP World's Turn8 knows well about investing in infrastructure. The parent organisation thinks very big and is great at spotting opportunities at the right time. Enter a company that Turn8 has invested in - AirGo (www.airgodesign.com). A company that specialises in the most important experience of flying in a commercial plane - the seat. It is amazing that when you enter most aircraft today, the seats are visually indistinguishable from what they looked like 60 years ago. With the odd exception of adding on a small display unit on the back of the head-rest and you are lucky if you have an in-built USB charging socket. Dr Ali Jahanshahi is COO of AirGo, a company that is set to change the status-quo. Two revolutionary seat designs from AirGo - Draco for short-haul and Orion for long-haul, could help save the massive airline industry billions of dollars in fuel, paving the way for lighter and greener air-travel. Multiple patents and industry award winners, AirGo is based out of Singapore. The key focus of AirGo is on ergonomics and massive weight reduction. When it comes to comfort AirGo uses multi-density foam to address the variations in pressure, the seats have a 12 per cent wider backrest and are capable of a 30 per cent recline within the standard 32-inch pitch. To improve the passenger experience, the AirGo team uses VR simulation to create a life-like cabin situation to test the seats with volunteers. The company was established in 2013 by Ali and Maziar Jahanshahi, Alireza Yaghoubi and Mikko Alanko. The company is tapping in to the $8.74 billion (2016) annual aircraft seat industry volume, which projected to reach $16.94 billion by 2021 (CAGR of 14.15 per cent during the forecast period), according to Marketsandmarkets analysis. Till date, AirGo has showcased the seats at AIX Asia 2016 in Singapore and LIMA 2017 in Malaysia. Jahanshahi is a Swedish national of Middle Eastern origin and holds a PhD degree from University of Oxford. While teaching at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, he came in to touch with Yaghoubi, a brilliant undergraduate student who had come up with an impressive innovative design concept a.k.a. AirGo for economy class passenger seats. The design had received the James Dyson Award Malaysia in 2012. They decided to start a company based on the concept and brought on-board Alanko and the elder Jahanshahi brother, Maziar. The elder Jahanshahi brother had recently sold his former company Scalado to Nokia. This startup experience from inception to exit, has really helped the company take-off with minimum turbulence. Shortly thereafter, Jere Tala, an experienced management level aviation expert from Qatar Airways and Finnair joined the team. The future is extremely interesting. India is the fastest growing aviation market at 14 per cent year-on-year growth. China is a little slower 11 per cent growth. China is likely to order over 6,800 planes over next 20 years. This is reflected in AirGo's pipeline. It has an LoI from a low-cost Chinese carrier. This is for retrofitting their aircraft. Retrofitting is essentially replacing old components with new. There is also serious interest for the AirGo seats from one of India's largest low-cost carriers. This is for a line-fit i.e. fitting the aircraft with the new seats at the manufacturing stage. The next time you board a plane and see a completely new seat design, it could well be from AirGo. The writer is a director at Vyashara.

Reporters traveling with the president spotted a Boeing C-17 Globemaster — a gray, four-engine military transport aircraft — through their windows at 6:23 p.m. as Air Force One was descending toward its home base at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. “Air Force One took no evasive measures and there was no indication it was in any danger,” according to Voice of America. Trump's  plane landed six minutes later, it added. ADVERTISEMENT A White House pool report Sunday said the aircraft appeared to come "within about 1,000 feet" of Air Force One. The Globemaster reportedly veered to Air Force One’s starboard side as the presidential aircraft traveled north from Florida. “Veterans in the press cabin remarked they had never seen anything come that close,” according to the report. “I would say beyond all doubt that this is a strange occurrence,” a retired air force lieutenant colonel said of the incident. Other White House officials on the flight included chief strategist Stephen Bannon, adviser Stephen Miller, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Joe Hagin, the White House deputy chief of staff for operations. The White House provided no immediate comment on the incident.   View the discussion thread.

Manufacturers, including Airbus, Boeing and Canada’s Bombardier, will display 35 planes at the 2017 Asian Business Aviation Conference and Exhibition, which opens today at the Hongqiao International Airport. “We’re seeing China’s business jet market evolve, and it’s expanding to various types of aircraft and operations,” said Ed Bolen, president and CEO of the US National Business Aviation Association, which organizes the annual event with the Shanghai Airport Authority. China has become the world’s major business jet market, Brazilian manufacturer Embraer said at a preview of the exhibition yesterday. Shanghai’s two airports handled 6,136 business jets last year, up 10 percent from 2015, according to the airport authority. To meet rising demand, the airport authority will expand its Hongqiao facilities to serve the business aviation market. A new second-phase hangar is likely to open in April 2018, said Lu Xun, deputy general manager of Shanghai Hawker Pacific Aviation Service Center.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Tue, Apr 11, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp World Business Quick Take Agencies AIRLINES Iran to buy planes from ATR IranAir has signed a contract to buy 20 planes from turboprop maker ATR, Iranian Deputy Minister of Roads and Urban Development Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan was quoted as saying yesterday. The deal comes after Iran, which had not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, signed contracts last year with Europe’s Airbus and its US rival Boeing to purchase about 180 jets. A basic deal for the purchase of 20 airplanes, with options for another 20, was reached several weeks, ago but negotiations dragged on over an agreement for maintenance and spare engines between IranAir and engine supplier Pratt & Whitney Canada, owned by US aerospace group United Technologies. SPACE Avio first to go public Italian space launcher company Avio SpA has become the first in its category to go public, seeking to boost its growth ambitions. Avio, the largest satellite launcher in Europe, yesterday opened its initial public offering at a share price of 13.88 euros. The company makes engines for rockets that are used to put small satellites into low orbit in a joint venture with the Italian Space Agency. As part of the moves to help Avio grow, Italian defense contractor Leonardo has increased its stake in Avio from 14 percent to 28 percent. EGYPT Consumer prices stabilize Egyptian consumer prices showed some signs of stability last month, signaling that the surge in inflation triggered by the central bank’s decision to abandon currency controls five months ago could be easing. Annual inflation in urban areas accelerated to 30.9 percent compared with 30.2 percent in February, according to data released yesterday by Egypt’s Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics. The increase in prices has raised concerns about stability in Egypt, which is also struggling with a wave of Islamist militant attacks undermining efforts to attract investments and tourism. INDIA Steel output hits record high India, set to become the world’s largest steel producer after China, churned out a record amount in the year through last month to feed rising local demand, while boosting exports to the highest ever. Output jumped 11 percent to 101.3 million tonnes and the nation was a net exporter for the first time in three years, doubling shipments to 8.2 million tonnes, according to provisional steel ministry data. The nation’s output is to rise from 103 million tonnes this year to 110 million next year, and 118 million by 2019, matching the output of Japan, according to projections from Australia’s Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. PHARMACEUTICALS Stada to back acquisition Stada Arzneimittel AG said it would back an acquisition offer from private equity firms Bain Capital and Cinven for a deal that values the German drugmaker at about 5.32 billion euros (US$5.6 billion), putting an end to lengthy negotiations for one of the last independent generic-drug businesses in Europe. The firms are offering 65.28 euros plus a dividend of 0.72 euros per Stada share, the drugmaker said yesterday in a statement, about 20 percent higher than the company’s volume-weighted average share price over the past three months. The deal would give the two private equity firms access to German and Russian markets for over-the-counter and copycat medicines, and marks another step in the consolidation of the generics industry.

Springfield, NJ (PRWEB) April 10, 2017 Valcor Engineering is proud to announce that Yuri Gerasimov, Chief Engineer, has been awarded NASA’s Silver Snoopy Award. Yuri is being recognized for his outstanding support to the Human Space Flight Program, especially the key role he played in helping develop the oxygen Tank Pressurization Assembly which is a Main Propulsion System component within the Core State oxygen pressurization system. The Silver Snoopy Award is given to candidates who have significantly contributed to the human space flight program to ensure flight safety and mission success. Less than 1 percent of the aerospace program workforce receive it annually, making it a special honor to receive this award. “Valcor is so proud for having been able to participate in space flight since this nation’s very first ventures into space,” stated Tom Iervolino, Vice President of Business Development and Corporate Strategies. “We are proud and honored to be a supplier to Boeing and member of the Space Launch System (SLS) Team. As a company, we are inspired every day by the importance of the mission and also the work performed by talented Scientists and Engineers making this happen. Yuri Gerasimov, Silver Snoopy Award recipient, is one of those inspirational Engineers. From his early days as a Design Engineer, it was clear that Yuri would be turning out some incredible valve designs. Two decades later, as Chief Engineer for Valcor’s Aerospace Engineering Product Group, he and his team are still turning out some very cool designs; most recently for the SLS Program. We are so very proud of Yuri and NASA awarding him a Silver Snoopy Award.” The award itself is a sterling silver Snoopy lapel pin, designed by “Peanuts” cartoonist Charles Schulz, and has flown on a Space Shuttle mission. This particular Silver Snoopy lapel pin has flown aboard Expedition 25 to the International Space Station on October 27, 2010. Yuri’s Silver Snoopy Award, along with a certificate of appreciation and commendation letter, was presented on March 27th, by NASA Astronaut Colonel Douglas H. Wheelock. To date, the retired Colonel has logged more than 178 days in space. He flew on STS-120 and served as a Flight Engineer for Expedition 24 and commander for Expedition 25. During the last mission, Wheelock conducted three unplanned spacewalks to replace a faulty ammonia pump module. Congressman Leonard Lance was in attendance and gave his remarks on this wonderful accomplishment for Yuri and the entire Valcor team. State Senator Tom Kean was also present for the ceremony, along with Springfield Deputy Mayor Maria Vassallo and Springfield Police Chief John Cook.

Rose Blake By Sandra Block, Senior Associate Editor From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, May 2017 After grappling with your own tax return, you probably haven’t given a lot of thought to how much Apple and ExxonMobil pay Uncle Sam. But a Republican plan to reengineer the corporate tax code could have a direct impact on your bottom line. How much? That depends on whom you talk to and where they stand on the border adjustment tax. See Also: Kiplinger's Economic Outlooks — Trade Deficit The border adjustment tax would eliminate taxes on income from products sold outside the U.S. while removing tax deductions for the cost of imported goods, which would effectively impose a 20% surcharge on imports. Proponents say the change would encourage companies to make products in the U.S., thus generating more jobs. The tax on imports would raise an estimated $1 trillion over 10 years, enabling the government to cut corporate tax rates—currently, the highest in the world—from 35% to 20%. Chief executives of companies that are big exporters, such as Boeing, Caterpillar and Pfizer, are big fans of the BAT. They say the current business tax code gives an unfair advantage to foreign competitors and foreign-made goods. But chief executives from Wal-Mart, Target, Macy’s and dozens of other retailers contend that the BAT would increase the cost of just about everything by up to 20%. For most consumers, switching to items made in the U.S. isn’t an option. About 97% of the clothes and 98% of the shoes sold in the U.S. are made overseas, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. “Whether it’s the automobile you drive, the gasoline you use, the groceries you put on the table, or the shoes and the clothes you put on your feet and back, the prices of all of those things will get driven up by the border adjustment tax,” says National Retail Federation chief executive Matthew Shay. The BAT has strong support from House Republican leaders but faces headwinds in the Senate, where some Republican lawmakers have expressed concern about how it will affect big retailers. The plan’s supporters argue that a sharp increase in the value of the dollar would help offset any price hikes. Here’s how: The tax break for U.S. exporters would allow those companies to lower prices initially, which would increase demand for their products overseas. That, in turn, would boost demand for dollars, driving up the value of the greenback by 20% or more. A stronger dollar would increase purchasing power for U.S. companies and consumers who buy materials or products from overseas, thus offsetting the higher tax on imports. Advertisement Because a BAT has never been tried, it’s unknown how long it would take to reach that kind of equilibrium. Currency traders might buy dollars in anticipation of a policy change, hastening the greenback’s rise. But economists at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group, say the adjustment overall could take years, and in the meantime, at least some portion of the tax would be passed on to consumers. If you’re planning a trip to Paris, a stronger dollar is great news, but it has its pitfalls, too, particularly where your portfolio is concerned. As the dollar rises, it depresses returns from investments denominated in foreign currencies. One way around that problem is to look for funds that hedge their currency exposure, such as FMI International (symbol FMIJX), a member of the Kiplinger 25, the list of our favorite funds.

By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter The stock rally’s not done yet, and there’s another 15% pop ahead, according to strategists at one big bank. That would be good news for those who saw April — a historically good month for stocks — get off to a lackluster start, not helped by downbeat jobs data and geopolitical headlines. So our call of the day from Morgan Stanley says there’s more upside to this equity market, and this is not the time for bulls to falter. As the team, led by Michael Wilson, explains, the economy is in the late stages of an upturn that started a year ago, which got turbocharged by the U.S. election. Stocks got a boost as a result. “The end of the cycle is often the best. Think 1999 or 2006-07. In a low-return world, investors cannot afford to miss it,” say Michael J. Wilson and the team at Morgan Stanley. “It has taken eight long years to get here, but Wall and Main Street are finally starting to feel better about the future,” they add. Among the reasons they say it’s a good time for stocks: equity valuations are undemanding with borrowing rates low; so-called secular stagnation, or a no-growth period for the economy, is over; and very loose financial conditions are encouraging a shift toward investor euphoria. Morgan Stanley’s base-case 12-month target for the S&P 500 is 2,700 — 15% above current levels — while their bull case stretches up to 3,000. As for what to buy in the last throes of this cycle, Wilson says they like financials, industrials, energy and telecoms, but are less keen on real estate, telecom and staples. They prefer small and mid-caps. Check out their heat map for more on that: As for risks, the Morgan Stanley team says commercial real estate and autos both show “serious signs of distress” regarding credit exposure. They could be the canaries in the coal mine for a downturn. And if oil prices fail to recover, that could mean energy companies — the single biggest driver of S&P 500 earnings this year — cut guidance.

By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter The stock rally’s not done yet, and there’s another 15% pop ahead, according to strategists at one big bank. That would be good news for those who saw April — a historically good month for stocks — get off to a lackluster start, not helped by downbeat jobs data and geopolitical headlines. So our call of the day from Morgan Stanley says there’s more upside to this equity market, and this is not the time for bulls to falter. As the team, led by Michael Wilson, explains, the economy is in the late stages of an upturn that started a year ago, which got turbocharged by the U.S. election. Stocks got a boost as a result. “The end of the cycle is often the best. Think 1999 or 2006-07. In a low-return world, investors cannot afford to miss it,” say Michael J. Wilson and the team at Morgan Stanley. “It has taken eight long years to get here, but Wall and Main Street are finally starting to feel better about the future,” they add. Among the reasons they say it’s a good time for stocks: equity valuations are undemanding with borrowing rates low; so-called secular stagnation, or a no-growth period for the economy, is over; and very loose financial conditions are encouraging a shift toward investor euphoria. Morgan Stanley’s base-case 12-month target for the S&P 500 is 2,700 — 15% above current levels — while their bull case stretches up to 3,000. As for what to buy in the last throes of this cycle, Wilson says they like financials, industrials, energy and telecoms, but are less keen on real estate, telecom and staples. They prefer small and mid-caps. Check out their heat map for more on that: As for risks, the Morgan Stanley team says commercial real estate and autos both show “serious signs of distress” regarding credit exposure. They could be the canaries in the coal mine for a downturn. And if oil prices fail to recover, that could mean energy companies — the single biggest driver of S&P 500 earnings this year — cut guidance.

Iran’s national flag-carrier airline Iran Air has signed a contract to buy 20 turboprops from the French-Italian aircraft manufacturer ATR, an official says. "The contract between IranAir and ATR to buy 20 ATR 72-600 aircrafts has been signed by the officials of both countries," Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhriyeh Kashan said on Monday. ATR is jointly-owned by France-based Airbus and Leonardo of Italy. The development comes after Iran struck deals with European aviation giant Airbus and the US aviation company Boeing in 2016 to purchase about 180 jets. The agreements came after the restrictions imposed on Iran’s aviation industry were lifted following a nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The JCPOA was signed between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia -- plus Germany on July 14, 2015. The Islamic Republic and the six world powers started implementing the JCPOA on January 16, 2016. Under the deal, limits were put on Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for, among other things, the removal of all nuclear-related bans against the Islamic Republic. Loading ...

By BarbaraKollmeyer Markets reporter The stock rally’s not done yet, and there’s another 15% pop ahead, according to strategists at one big bank. That would be good news for those who saw April — a historically good month for stocks — get off to a lackluster start, not helped by downbeat jobs data and geopolitical headlines. So our call of the day from Morgan Stanley says there’s more upside to this equity market, and this is not the time for bulls to falter. As the team, led by Michael Wilson, explains, the economy is in the late stages of an upturn that started a year ago, which got turbocharged by the U.S. election. Stocks got a boost as a result. “The end of the cycle is often the best. Think 1999 or 2006-07. In a low-return world, investors cannot afford to miss it,” say Michael J. Wilson and the team at Morgan Stanley. “It has taken eight long years to get here, but Wall and Main Street are finally starting to feel better about the future,” they add. Among the reasons they say it’s a good time for stocks: equity valuations are undemanding with borrowing rates low; so-called secular stagnation, or a no-growth period for the economy, is over; and very loose financial conditions are encouraging a shift toward investor euphoria. Morgan Stanley’s base-case 12-month target for the S&P 500 is 2,700 — 15% above current levels — while their bull case stretches up to 3,000. As for what to buy in the last throes of this cycle, Wilson says they like financials, industrials, energy and telecoms, but are less keen on real estate, telecom and staples. They prefer small and mid-caps. Check out their heat map for more on that: As for risks, the Morgan Stanley team says commercial real estate and autos both show “serious signs of distress” regarding credit exposure. They could be the canaries in the coal mine for a downturn. And if oil prices fail to recover, that could mean energy companies — the single biggest driver of S&P 500 earnings this year — cut guidance.

The flight is operated by a state-of-the-art 254 seat Boeing 787 Dreamliner – representing a capacity of over 3,500 seats and over 110 tonnes of cargo carrying capacity per week to and from Birmingham. Morena Bronzetti, Qatar Airways’ Country Manager UK & Ireland, said: “Just a year on from the start of our service from Birmingham, levels of both passenger and cargo demand are strong and exceeding our expectations. “It’s clear that business and leisure travellers and cargo shippers from the Midlands have recognised the benefits of being able to travel from their local airport to the huge choice of destinations we serve across the globe.” To celebrate the anniversary, Qatar Airways offered passengers flying out of Birmingham Airport last Thursday the chance to win prizes including two free flights for their next holiday and a selection of luxury gifts. The airport hosted a treasure hunt for passengers booked on the afternoon flight to Doha. Passengers who found special anniversary paper aeroplanes hidden in the airport terminal claimed their prizes before boarding the flight. David Winstanley, Chief Operating Officer, Birmingham Airport, said: “We are delighted to celebrate this anniversary with Qatar Airways. The airline gives passengers from our region a great product and an extensive route network in the Gulf and beyond.”     In addition to its existing network of over 150 destinations worldwide, Qatar Airways is due to launch a range of new destinations in 2017 and 2018 which broaden the choices available to travellers from the Midlands. These include Auckland, New Zealand, Canberra in Australia, Chiang Mai in Thailand, Yanbu and Tabuk in Saudi Arabia, Medan in Indonesia, and Libreville in Gabon. On board the Boeing 787, Qatar Airways’ passengers have a choice of 22 seats in Business Class and 232 Economy Class seats. All seats include individual television screens, with Economy Class customers benefitting from a screen 10.6-inches wide, offering the latest inflight entertainment with up to 2,000 options while experiencing the airline’s award-winning service. Every seat is an aisle seat in Business Class where passengers can catch up on sleep in a fully-flat bed or make productive use of their time utilising the large work surface area. Passengers can also stay connected while travelling with the option of Wi-Fi which is available throughout the aircraft.

Turkish Airlines cabin crew along with some passengers helped deliver a baby girl, named Kadiju, at 42,000ft shortly after take-off from Conakry in Guinea to Istanbul. (Turkish Airlines) The baby and her mother were taken to hospital in Ouagadougou, the Burkina Faso capital, after the Boeing 737 airliner landed. Both are reportedly in good health. Turkish Airlines said in a statement: “The cabin crew, who saw a woman passenger named Nafi Diaby, 28-week-old pregnant traveller flying with Turkish Airlines’ TK538 Conakry (Guinea)-Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) flight, was suffering child-birth pains, promptly responded to her in order to assist her childbirth during the flight. (Turkish Airlines) “After the smooth landing of Boeing B737-900 type aircraft to the Ouagadougou Airport, the mother Nafi Diaby and her newborn baby girl were taken to the hospital in order to be kept under observation for a while.” (Turkish Airlines) Most airlines allow would-be mothers to travel until they are 36 weeks pregnant, with some requiring a letter from a doctor or a midwife for those who are in their 28th week of pregnancy.

The deal comes after Iran, which had not directly purchased a Western-built plane in nearly 40 years, signed contracts with Europe's Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing last year to purchase about 180 jets. That became possible after an agreement between Iran and six major powers lifted most international sanctions imposed on Tehran, in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program. ATR is joint-owned by France-based Airbus and Leonardo of Italy. "The contract between IranAir and ATR to buy 20 ATR 72-600 aircrafts has been signed by the officials of both countries," Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan was quoted as saying by ISNA. A basic deal for the purchase of 20 airplanes, with options for another 20, was reached several weeks ago but negotiations dragged on over an agreement for maintenance and spare engines between IranAir and engine supplier Pratt & Whitney Canada, owned by U.S. aerospace group United Technologies. It was not immediately clear whether Fakhrieh-Kashan was referring to the underlying aircraft contract or the final package including the engine deal. ATR was not immediately available for comment, but on Sunday a spokesman said, "We are still working on finalizing the deal."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 6.85 points at 20,656.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 1.14 points at 5,877.81. The S&P 500 declined 1.95 points to close at 2,355.54, with six out of the index's 11 sectors finishing lower as utilities, consumer-discretionary, and financials led decliners. For the week, the Dow industrials declined less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.6%. Wal-Mart Stores and defense contractor Boeing led gainers, while DuPont and Walt Disney weighed on the average. Overnight, the U.S. Navy launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat base in Syria. The news of missile strikes weighed on equity futures, but a swift rebound took place in time for the release of the Employment Situation report for March. Latest employment report stated that the U.S. economy created just 98,000 new jobs in March, well below the 185,000 consensus figure that was forecast. The unemployment rate, however, fell to 4.5% from 4.7% as the number of people who found work outstripped the labor force. Bullion prices ended mixed at Comex on Friday, 07 April 2017 at Comex. Gold futures finished with gains on Friday, but ended well off a five-month high set earlier in the session, as strength in the U.S. dollar and a rebound in stocks cut into the rally that followed U.S. airstrikes on Syria. A much weaker-than-expected March jobs report had helped the yellow metal to extend gains, but the yellow metal pulled back later as the dollar rose. Gold for June delivery rose $4 or 0.3%, to end at $1,257.30 an ounce. For the week, gold advanced 0.5%, while May silver SIK7, gave up earlier gains to end at $18.151 an ounce, down 9.5 cents, or 0.5%. Silver booked a weekly decline of 0.5%. Oil futures ended at a one-month high on Friday, 07 April 2017 after a U.S. airstrike on Syria, though gains were capped by expectations risks to Middle East output would be limited. Crude held gains after data from oil-field services firm Baker Hughes showed U.S. producers added 10 oil rigs this week, bringing the total number to 672. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in May finished at $52.24 a barrel, a gain of 54 cents, or 1.04%. Oil had jumped 2.4% in electronic trade following the strikes. For the week, the U.S. benchmark rose 3.2%. June Brent crude on London's ICE Futures exchange rose 35 cents, or 0.6%, to close at $55.24 a barrel after briefly dipping into negative territory after U.S. jobs data. Brent rose 3.2% for the week. Treasuries spiked to highs immediately after the release of the jobs report, but reversed in short order and continued sliding into the close. The 2-yr yield (1.27%) and the 10-yr yield (2.37%) jumped three basis points apiece while the long bond resisted the pressure. The 30-yr yield increased one basis point to 3.00%. Investor participation was a bit below average as 935 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Investors will not receive any economic data on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 6.85 points at 20,656.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 1.14 points at 5,877.81. The S&P 500 declined 1.95 points to close at 2,355.54, with six out of the index's 11 sectors finishing lower as utilities, consumer-discretionary, and financials led decliners. For the week, the Dow industrials declined less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 shed 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.6%. Wal-Mart Stores and defense contractor Boeing led gainers, while DuPont and Walt Disney weighed on the average. Overnight, the U.S. Navy launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at the Shayrat base in Syria. The news of missile strikes weighed on equity futures, but a swift rebound took place in time for the release of the Employment Situation report for March. Latest employment report stated that the U.S. economy created just 98,000 new jobs in March, well below the 185,000 consensus figure that was forecast. The unemployment rate, however, fell to 4.5% from 4.7% as the number of people who found work outstripped the labor force. Bullion prices ended mixed at Comex on Friday, 07 April 2017 at Comex. Gold futures finished with gains on Friday, but ended well off a five-month high set earlier in the session, as strength in the U.S. dollar and a rebound in stocks cut into the rally that followed U.S. airstrikes on Syria. A much weaker-than-expected March jobs report had helped the yellow metal to extend gains, but the yellow metal pulled back later as the dollar rose. Gold for June delivery rose $4 or 0.3%, to end at $1,257.30 an ounce. For the week, gold advanced 0.5%, while May silver SIK7, gave up earlier gains to end at $18.151 an ounce, down 9.5 cents, or 0.5%. Silver booked a weekly decline of 0.5%.

Bjorn Kjos, chief executive of Norwegian, speaks after receiving the Irish Aviation Authority's award for outstanding contribution to aviation. The naysayers are wrong, according to founder and chief executive of Norwegian Air Bjorn Kjos. It is possible to make low-fare journeys from Europe to the US commercially viable, smaller airports are the future for passengers, and Cork is strategically one of the most important airports in Norwegian’s plans, he insists. Despite the disappointing confirmation that Cork to Stewart International Airport in New York is currently not viable for its mooted 2018 takeoff, Mr Kjos says the airline has not totally given up on the idea. Meanwhile, he says, it is in the hands of Cork people to make their first transatlantic flight to TF Green Airport in Providence, Rhode Island, this summer a surefire success. He categorically rejects the notion that Cork was used as a sentimental pawn in Norwegian’s campaign to get a licence to fly from Ireland to the US. Critics said Cork did all the running and campaigning, even enlisting Taoiseach Enda Kenny to lobby then-US president Barack Obama directly, yet received just three flights, while Dublin, Belfast, and even Shannon did considerably better. What does Mr Kjos say to the people of Cork who feel aggrieved? “Cork was one of the first cities I ever looked at because a lot of people in the New York area originate from this area. It is a lot of Irish-Americans who have very close ties with that part of Ireland. It was no coincidence. "We could have flown everything out of Dublin. I would reject that criticism because we are looking at catchment areas. We are looking at areas close to the Atlantic. Cork met that criteria and so did Shannon. Dublin is a large catchment area. We actually looked first at the cities outside Dublin,” he said. Cork to Providence is vital to Norwegian, he said. Far from being the poor relation, he says Norwegian will provide more flights than the three weekly in the summer if the demand is there. It is the winter schedule that Cork people need to get behind, he adds. “This route will do very well. Obviously it will do fine in the summertime but the question is whether it is possible to fly it year-round. We haven’t looked at that yet, we have to look at the bookings. The passengers will always decide the number of flights. If we have enough passengers to fly daily, then we will fly daily. "These people really deserve it. We could never have done this without fantastic support from people like IAA chief executive Eamonn Brennan, the Taoiseach, three transport ministers, and not least the people in Cork Airport. They have done an incredible job. Everyone supported us,” he said. Donald Trump’s presidency is already impacting Ireland and especially the people of Cork. Norwegian is compelled to use American-made Boeing aircraft for its US routes to keep on good terms with the Trump administration. The Boeing 737MAX aircraft is not able to make it to New York from Cork as Cork’s short runway, by international standards, means it can only carry so much fuel. European maker Airbus claims its anticipated A321Neo aircraft will make further journeys with less fuel. Cork Airport insiders insist a Cork-NYC flight will happen sooner rather than later with the Neo, whomever the carrier is. In the meantime, Norwegian has to play ball with the White House. “Mr Trump wants American jobs and we are flying Boeing aircraft. We’re setting up a lot of American jobs and also a lot of bases. So we are doing exactly what the president wants,” says Mr Kjos. Smaller airports are much more attractive, insists Mr Kjos. Far from the hustle and bustle of JFK in New York, O’Hare in Chicago, or Logan in Boston, airports like TF Green will be far more appreciated by Cork passengers, he says. “Providence is near Cape Cod, it is probably one of the most beautiful areas in the US. You have a lot of people living there and you can reach Boston easily. It is a very good start at the beginning of your vacation. It is very expensive to fly into New York, and very difficult to get slots. That was the main reason we picked TF Green because you can fly much cheaper. You cannot do €69 fares at JFK,” he said. Norwegian founder Bjorn Kjos rejects the notion that Cork was used as a sentimental pawn in the airline’s campaign to get a licence to fly from Ireland to the US. Bringing in US visitors to Cork is just as vital to make it viable year-round, he adds. “As a general rule, it is a lot of Americans that book with us. They fly to Ireland. More than 50% are booked from the US. Providence has 4m people in the catchment. It is fairly huge. The bookings have been very good actually. They have exceeded expectations. Now it is more to see if it is possible to fly on a year-round basis,” he said. If Boeing’s testing of its new 737MAX aircraft exceeds expectations, Cork to New York will be back on for 2018, he says. “As it looks with the figures we have so far, it’s a little bit too far. But the first prototypes Boeing produce are normally heavier than the actual production. So normally the aircraft they can fly better. We have to see the performance of the aircraft — is it doable with that type of aircraft. If Cork to New York is possible, we will do it.” READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS norwegian air, business, finance, economy, travel, bjorn kjos, cork, new york © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Robert Bentley makes a formal statement about his resignation at the Capitol Monday, April 10, 2017, in Montgomery, Ala. (Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) (Julie Bennett) Print Email Lucy Berry | lberry@al.com By Lucy Berry | lberry@al.com AL.com Follow on Twitter on April 10, 2017 at 5:52 PM, updated April 10, 2017 at 5:57 PM comments The pulse of Alabama is changing, but one of the state's top job producers isn't concerned about the future. As Gov. Robert Bentley prepared to resign following a year of controversy surrounding his relationship with former political adviser Rebekah Caldwell Mason, leaders announced Aerojet Rocketdyne will bring hundreds of jobs to Huntsville for rocket engine production. Dale Strong, chairman of the Madison County Commission, said the area's economic development success is not based on any one individual. The key to landing new industry is "a great team ... and a regional approach" that is respected not only within the state but also in Washington, D.C., he said. Strong feels confident the Huntsville area will continue to shine with Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey leading the state through the remainder of Bentley's term. "The big thing is Alabama moves forward," he said. "This will be a part of our history that is something we're not going to be proud of, but the big thing is we move forward and I promise you I will be working as hard tomorrow to recruit new jobs and industry into North Alabama as I was today or the day before. I trust Kay Ivey understands there's a lot of things going for Madison County right now." Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle has played an integral part in several key economic development projects in recent years. Under his leadership, Polaris, Remington, GE Aviation, Boeing and other companies have announced expansion plans in the community. Battle, who is considering a run for governor next year, said Bentley stepping down raises questions about the future administration and its commitment to Huntsville. "From our side, it is very sad that today is overshadowed by events that happened in Montgomery, which shouldn't have happened," he said. "We, as a community, we're used to picking ourselves up and moving forward. We'll continue to move forward and I'm sure the state will do the same thing." He believes Huntsville's partnership with the governor's office, Alabama Department of Commerce, Department of Transportation and state Legislature will not flounder under Ivey. "We've known Gov. Ivey for a long time," he said. "She has been up here time and time again and shown support for the community." Chip Cherry, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of Huntsville/Madison County, said Ivey understands the role of the military and federal infrastructure in Huntsville's economy. Ivey, 72, will be only the second female governor in Alabama when she is sworn in. Although losing the state's top officer causes some uncertainty, Cherry said it's the long-term, local relationships that make a difference in recruiting new industry to Huntsville. "The governor's position has been very supportive of us in the past and I think it will continue to be under Gov. Ivey's leadership, he said.

news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video news tech spaceflight science & astronomy search for life skywatching entertainment video Space.com Spaceflight Reference: X-37B: The Air Force's Mysterious Space Plane By Mike Wall, Senior Wrtier | April 10, 2017 02:30pm ET MORE The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown four clandestine missions to date, carrying secret payloads on long-duration flights in Earth orbit. The robotic vehicle resembles NASA's famous space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29 feet (8.8 meters) long and 9.5 feet (2.9 m) tall, with a wingspan just less than 15 feet (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000 lbs. (4,990 kilograms). The X-37B's payload bay (the area in which the cargo is packed) measures 7 feet long by 4 feet wide (2.1 by 1.2 m) — about the size of a pickup truck bed. Just what the X-37B carries in there is unclear, however. Air Force officials generally comment only on the overall goals of the program, stressing that each payload is classified. [Photos: The X-37B Space Plane] "The primary objectives of the X-37B are twofold: reusable spacecraft technologies for America's future in space and operating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth," states an X-37B fact sheet produced by the Air Force. Like the space shuttle, the solar-powered X-37B space plane launches vertically, with the aid of a rocket, and cruises back to Earth for a runway landing. The diminutive space plane is designed to operate at altitudes ranging from 110 to 500 miles (177 to 805 km). A Brief History of the X-37B The X-37 program started in 1999 with NASA, which initially planned to construct two vehicles: an Approach and Landing Test Vehicle (ALTV) and an Orbital Vehicle. NASA transferred the project to the U.S. military in 2004 — specifically, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). At that point, X-37 became a classified project. DARPA finished the ALTV part of the program in 2006, conducting a series of captive-carry and free-flight tests. NASA's envisioned Orbital Vehicle was never built, but it served as the inspiration for the space plane that came to be called the X-37B. The X-37B program is now run by the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office, with mission control for orbital flights based at the 3rd Space Experimentation Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado. The space planes are built by Boeing's Phantom Works division.  What do you think the U.S. Air Force's robotic X-37B space planes are doing on their months-long mystery missions in orbit? Space weapon tests: It's a secret project to make war in space. Space surveillance: It's the world's best spysat platform. Space tech tests: The U.S. military is pushing the robotic spaceflight frontier. Peaceful uses in space: The X-37B is quiet because it's a robot and doesn't talk. Get Results Share This Orbital Experience Two different X-37B vehicles have flown a total of four missions, which are known as OTV-1, OTV-2, OTV-3 and OTV-4 (short for Orbital Test Vehicle). All four flights have reached space with the help of United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rocket. OTV-1 blasted off in April 2010 and stayed aloft for 224 days. OTV-2 stayed in space for more than twice as long, launching in March 2011 and returning to Earth 468 days later, in June 2012. OTV-3, which uses the same vehicle that flew the OTV-1 mission, began on Dec. 11, 2012, and ended 674 days later, in October 2014. The ongoing OTV-4 mission marks the second flight for the X-37B that flew OTV-2. OTV-4 began on May 20, 2015, and broke OTV-3's duration record on March 25, 2017.   "The X-37 is a technology testbed, and as such, pushing the envelope is the mission," Joan Johnson-Freese, professor of national security affairs at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., told Space.com, referring to OTV-3. "Endurance is one of several X-37 profile parameters that are being tested, along with others, such as in-flight capabilities and turnaround time for use." All X-37B missions to date have launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base in Florida and touched down at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. But future missions may land at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, right next door to Cape Canaveral, officials have said. Space weapon? The secrecy surrounding the X-37B and its payloads has spawned rumors that the vehicle could be a space weapon of some sort, perhaps tasked with capturing or damaging other nations' satellites. But the space plane is likely too small and not maneuverable enough for such work, experts say. Instead, its chief mission is likely what Air Force officials have claimed all along: to test out new sensors and other next-generation satellite technologies, to see how they perform and hold up in the space environment. "I absolutely think that's the primary mission," former Air Force orbital analyst Brian Weeden, who now works as a technical adviser for the nonprofit Secure World Foundation, told Space.com just before the launch of OTV-2. Various other aspects of the X-37B's design would make it a less-than-ideal space weapon, he added — including the craft's shuttle-style runway landings, which leave it vulnerable to attack by hostile forces. "It can be tracked, so it's going to be hard for it to sneak up on anything," Weeden said. "And when it comes down itself, it's a very ungainly, slow-moving glider."

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Justice and Public Safety Earthquake Warning System Extends to Washington Though the ShakeAlert system is not yet ready for public use, it could offer as much as two or three minutes’ warning to the Puget Sound region for a quake offshore. by Sandi Doughton, The Seattle Times / April 10, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- Dan Ervin knew this day would come. He just didn’t think it would be so soon. “I never thought I would actually see this in my career,” said Ervin, chairman of the board of a Bothell engineering firm that’s the first company in Washington to begin using earthquake early warning. The breakthrough came last week, when the prototype ShakeAlert system in California was fully extended to include Washington and Oregon. RELATEDMyShake Earthquake-Detection App Could Save LivesFracking Earthquakes Cause Headache in Oklahoma   That means all three states are now operating with the same technology, said Doug Given, project coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey. And while the system isn’t yet ready for public use, organizations like Ervin’s can start figuring out to what to do with a few seconds or minutes of warning before the ground starts shaking. For Ervin, whose company RH2 Engineering designs municipal water and sewage plants, the answer is clear: Close valves. When water mains break in earthquakes, the water in storage tanks can drain away at a time when it’s most needed, he explained. RH2, which designed water systems in Renton and Kirkland, already installs special tank valves that can be closed remotely and are designed to shut automatically when the ground shakes. “But there’s no guarantee you can get the valve fully closed before the shaking causes damage,” Ervin said. “The advantage of earthquake early warning is that it gives us forewarning that the shaking will occur, and we can be sure the valve is fully closed by the time the shaking starts.” The ShakeAlert system relies on a dense network of seismometers and the fact that the initial seismic waves from an earthquake travel quickly through the ground but don’t cause much damage. The first sensors to detect those waves can beam warnings to populated areas before the dangerous seismic waves arrive. For nearby earthquakes, the warning may be only seconds. But for a quake on the offshore Cascadia Subduction Zone, the Puget Sound region could get as much as two or three minutes’ warning. The technology is widely used in Japan, where people receive warnings on their cellphones and bullet trains are wired to come to a stop. “We’re talking about literally saving lives here,” said U.S. Rep. Derek Kilmer, whose district includes Tacoma and the Olympic Peninsula. A surgeon performing an operation could put down her scalpel, while a longshoreman hauling containers could get to a safe spot, said Kilmer, who along with other members of Washington’s congressional delegation has strongly advocated for ShakeAlert. But future funding is uncertain, with President Donald Trump’s proposed budget calling for a 15 percent cut for agencies like the USGS, Kilmer pointed out. “I hope that once we can make the case for how these investments will pay off, they will understand the importance of maintaining support for this important program,” he said.   The USGS hopes to roll out a limited, public version of ShakeAlert next year, Given said. But the agency estimates it will take $38 million more to add enough instruments for a highly reliable network. For example, several more sensors are needed around the Seattle Fault, said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. California recently allocated $10 million to strengthen its network. Oregon is spending $1 million for new instruments. Washington hasn’t earmarked any money for the project. Organizations in California, from school districts to amusement parks, have already been testing the alerts, Given said. NBC Universal is programming fire-station doors at its studio lots and theme park to open automatically. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab is exploring ways to quickly secure large telecommunications dishes. In the Northwest, Boeing, Intel and many public agencies are all trying to figure out how they might use the warnings, Given said. Since the project is still a prototype, companies that want to participate must sign “pilot user” agreements with the USGS. “We’re not quite ready to go full throttle with an operational mode,” Given said. “But we are pursuing these specific pilot applications to show the proof of concept and develop the technology.” One of the top concerns is the possibility of false alarms. That’s not an issue for the types of applications RH2 is interested in, Ervin said. A valve that’s needlessly closed can be quickly reopened with no harm done. As the regional pioneer, the company already is working on software and hardware to process the warning signals and automatically close valves. They’ve developed a virtual water system to practice with. The company also wants to shut down power to pump stations before a quake, to prevent electrical damage that could spark fires. “For the last 30 years, we have been anticipating that someday this technology would be available,” Ervin said. “This is pretty exciting for us.” ©2017 The Seattle Times Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF climbed 1.1% toward a record high, with 37 of 39 components trading higher. Trump said he would seek $54 billion in extra spending on defense, to be offset by decreases elsewhere, which he didn't mention. Among the ETF's most heavily weighted components, shares of Boeing Co. rallied 1%, of United Technologies Corp. tacked on 0.4%, of Lockheed Martin Corp. rose 1.5%, of General Dynamics Corp. gained 0.5% and of Raytheon Co. tacked on 1.4%. Of those five stocks, only United Technologies' wasn't trading in record territory. The biggest gainer within the ETF was Triumph Group Inc.'s stock , which shot up 3.4%. The only components not gaining were ManTech Interational Corp. , which was down 0.5%, and TransDigm Group Inc. , which eased less than 0.1%. The sector ETF has now run up 17% since the election while the S&P 500 has rallied 11%.

EngAGE is a nonprofit providing life-enhancing arts, wellness, learning, community building and intergenerational programs and events to thousands of seniors and their families in Southern California. Additionally, Carpenter serves on the board of the National Center for Creative Aging and presented a TED Talk titled, “Thriving as We Age,” at a Southern California affiliate event. His breadth of knowledge and unique perspective on aging will offer dynamism to the day’s scheduled panel discussions and presentations. The full day of educational and engaging sessions will begin with welcome remarks from Monica Lounsbery, dean of the College of Health & Human Services at Long Beach State University and SCAN CEO Chris Wing. Both Lounsbery and Wing will describe for attendees their respective organizations’ commitment to supporting community and senior health. They will also set the stage for closer collaboration on various community initiatives, which will be discussed in more depth in the subsequent panel sessions. A video message from Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia will convey the City’s vision to establish Long Beach as a laboratory for best practices supporting senior health and independence. Anne Tumlinson, CEO of Tumlinson Innovations, LLC and founder of Daughterhood, and Dr. Romilla Batra, chief medical officer of SCAN Group, will present “Seniors Today & Communities Reimagined.” In this session, they will review recent research to identify key trends and dynamics that are shaping the future of senior health and independence. Dr. Batra will also discuss how SCAN has spearheaded several innovative programs to align with these trends and better support seniors and their caregivers. Kelly Colopy, director of City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services; Marie Knight, director of City of Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine; and Tara Gruenewald, associate professor of gerontology and interim director of the Center for Successful Aging at Long Beach State University, will present a session titled, “Long Beach: A Laboratory for Senior Best Practices.” In addition to her teaching and research career in the field of aging, Gruenewald is the president of the California Council on Gerontology and Geriatrics and is a fellow of the Gerontological Society of America. Leveraging her distinguished experience and expertise, she will address needed changes in the age structure of today’s society, as well as innovations needed in social, physical, medical and technological environments in Long Beach and beyond. Colopy and Knight combined have more than three decades of experience in public service, and will present the City of Long Beach’s initiatives to create a stronger support system for local seniors. Initiatives discussed will include the delivery of evidence-based classes for seniors, the establishment of a senior coordinator for the public library system, research into the needs of the older adult population and progress on the Older Adult Strategic Plan and the current and evolving programs and resources offered at the City’s six senior centers. Delivering the keynote presentation is John Keisler, director of Economic and Property Development with the City of Long Beach. In this role, Keisler seeks to increase economic opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors in Long Beach. His keynote will discuss how innovation and economic development impacts seniors; the innovation incubators that already exist in Long Beach and new networks that may be established in the future; and how the City of Long Beach plans to better serve seniors through economic development. Participating in a panel discussion titled, “Technology: The Future of Aging,” are Long Beach State University representatives Brian Budzinski, cofounder of the College of Business Administration Incubator, and Dr. Linna Li, assistant professor in the Department of Geography. Budzinski is a structural engineering manager at The Boeing Company, and founded the business incubator along with three colleagues while earning his MBA at Long Beach State University. The incubator serves to foster innovation, as well as inspire and support ideas that provide a positive environmental or social impact on the community. Budzinski will share with attendees details of several incubator initiatives that are staged to help seniors live healthier and more independent lives. Dr. Li’s research includes geographic information science theories and applications in public health and urban development, and she will present implications from her work that can be leveraged to eliminate social isolation and its debilitating impact on seniors. To close out the day, Carpenter and Knight will lead an interactive session to encourage all speakers as well as attendees to share insights and ideas for supporting seniors in today’s society, and in the future. Event hosts SCAN, Long Beach State University and City of Long Beach hope to take away concrete suggestions for strengthening the network of programs and resources available to seniors to help all lead more enriching and empowered lives. “Aging Reimagined will be an expansive and valuable event focused exclusively on the needs of today’s seniors and their caregivers,” said Wing. “Together with our partners at the City of Long Beach and Long Beach State University, we look forward to bringing this constructive information to the community and identifying opportunities to collaborate to improve the lives of our oldest residents.” Attendance at the colloquium is by invitation only. Additional information and key takeaways will be made available to the public following the event. To learn more, please visit rebrand.ly/AgingReimagined.

He just didn’t think it would be so soon. “I never thought I would actually see this in my career,” said Ervin, chairman of the board of a Bothell engineering firm that’s the first company in Washington to begin using earthquake early warning. The breakthrough came last week, when the prototype ShakeAlert system in California was fully extended to include Washington and Oregon. That means all three states are now operating with the same technology, said Doug Given, project coordinator for the U.S. Geological Survey. And while the system isn’t yet ready for public use, organizations like Ervin’s can start figuring out to what to do with a few seconds or minutes of warning before the ground starts shaking. For Ervin, whose company RH2 Engineering designs municipal water and sewage plants, the answer is clear: Close valves. When water mains break in earthquakes, the water in storage tanks can drain away at a time when it’s most needed, he explained. RH2, which designed water systems in Renton and Kirkland, already installs special tank valves that can be closed remotely and are designed to shut automatically when the ground shakes. “But there’s no guarantee you can get the valve fully closed before the shaking causes damage,” Ervin said. “The advantage of earthquake early warning is that it gives us forewarning that the shaking will occur, and we can be sure the valve is fully closed by the time the shaking starts.” The ShakeAlert system relies on a dense network of seismometers and the fact that the initial seismic waves from an earthquake travel quickly through the ground but don’t cause much damage. The first sensors to detect those waves can beam warnings to populated areas before the dangerous seismic waves arrive. For nearby earthquakes, the warning may be only seconds. But for a quake on the offshore Cascadia Subduction Zone, the Puget Sound region could get as much as two or three minutes’ warning. The technology is widely used in Japan, where people receive warnings on their cellphones and bullet trains are wired to come to a stop. “We’re talking about literally saving lives here,” said U.S. Rep. Derek Kilmer, whose district includes Tacoma and the Olympic Peninsula. A surgeon performing an operation could put down her scalpel, while a longshoreman hauling containers could get to a safe spot, said Kilmer, who along with other members of Washington’s congressional delegation has strongly advocated for ShakeAlert. But future funding is uncertain, with President Donald Trump’s proposed budget calling for a 15 percent cut for agencies like the USGS, Kilmer pointed out. “I hope that once we can make the case for how these investments will pay off, they will understand the importance of maintaining support for this important program,” he said. The USGS hopes to roll out a limited, public version of ShakeAlert next year, Given said. But the agency estimates it will take $38 million more to add enough instruments for a highly reliable network. For example, several more sensors are needed around the Seattle Fault, said John Vidale, director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. California recently allocated $10 million to strengthen its network. Oregon is spending $1 million for new instruments. Washington hasn’t earmarked any money for the project. Organizations in California, from school districts to amusement parks, have already been testing the alerts, Given said. NBC Universal is programming fire-station doors at its studio lots and theme park to open automatically. NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab is exploring ways to quickly secure large telecommunications dishes. In the Northwest, Boeing, Intel and many public agencies are all trying to figure out how they might use the warnings, Given said. Since the project is still a prototype, companies that want to participate must sign “pilot user” agreements with the USGS. “We’re not quite ready to go full throttle with an operational mode,” Given said. “But we are pursuing these specific pilot applications to show the proof of concept and develop the technology.” One of the top concerns is the possibility of false alarms. That’s not an issue for the types of applications RH2 is interested in, Ervin said. A valve that’s needlessly closed can be quickly reopened with no harm done. As the regional pioneer, the company already is working on software and hardware to process the warning signals and automatically close valves. They’ve developed a virtual water system to practice with. The company also wants to shut down power to pump stations before a quake, to prevent electrical damage that could spark fires. “For the last 30 years, we have been anticipating that someday this technology would be available,” Ervin said. “This is pretty exciting for us.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Advertisement The Asia-Pacific business jet fleet will likely grow just one percent this year as new aircraft deliveries decline and pent-up demand for the Gulfstream G650/ER recedes, according to the 2015 Asia-Pacific Region Business Jet Fleet Report released yesterday by Hong Kong-based business aviation consultants Asian Sky Group (ASG). The fleet in the region, which includes Greater China, India, Australia and numerous other countries, totaled 1,155 aircraft at the end of 2016, up just three percent from a year before. It will likely be 1,167 at the end of this year, a net growth of just 12 business jets. Overall, the region added 112 aircraft last year – 57 new and 55 pre-owned – but also saw 78 aircraft leave. That net growth of 34 aircraft compares with 58 net additions in 2015. Among the Highlights • Pre-owned acquisitions and sales into and out of Asia Pacific saw a dramatic increase in 2016 from 71 in 2015 to 127. Of the 78 aircraft leaving the Asia-Pacific market, 73% went to the U.S. • The Top Four markets of Mainland China, Australia, India and Hong Kong represent two-thirds of the region’s business jet fleet, with 769 aircraft. • Mainland China remains the largest single market in the Asia-Pacific region with 313 business jets. It also saw the largest number of aircraft added to its fleet in 2016 with a net increase of 13 business jets. • Greater China, which includes Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, holds firm as the leading market in the region with a fleet of 477 aircraft, some 41% of the total for the Asia-Pacific region. • The top three OEMs in the region by market share were Bombardier, Gulfstream and Cessna, with 26%, 24% and 19% of the fleet, respectively. • Gulfstream significantly outperformed all other OEMs, adding a net 20 new and pre-owned aircraft. • The most popular model added across the region was the G650/G650ER, with an incredible 17 new and six pre-owned aircraft, representing 40% of the G650/ER’s worldwide deliveries. ASG Managing Director Jeffrey Lowe noted there are five “attractive, incentivized” G650s on the market at the moment at under $50 million versus their new list price of $66.8 million. “A good airplane at a good price will sell well,” he added. A Dramatic Shift to Pre-Owned The market is seeing a dramatic shift towards pre-owned aircraft, Of all deliveries into Asia-Pacific last year, 51% were new and 49% pre-owned (55 aircraft versus 57). “This is a significant shift towards pre-owned aircraft compared with 2015’s ratio of 62% to 38%,” says Lowe. “Buyers are getting much more value conscious, a lot wiser and price conscious, more value oriented.” At the same time, buyers outside the region are recognizing that there are many low-time, well-maintained business jets available in Asia-Pacific. Just a few years ago buyers in Asia-Pacific predominantly preferred factory-new aircraft. “You can go through the year with a feeling, thinking you known what is going on, but the numbers never lie,” says Lowe. “Half a year ago I would have said most transactions were of aircraft leaving the region.” Angst Amongst Operators The older, traditional aircraft management and charter companies, mostly based in Hong Kong, are seeing their business jet fleets shrink as new, boutique operators are taking market share away from them. “Young upstarts are grabbing their business,” says Jeffrey Lowe, Managing Director of Hong Kong-based business aviation consultancy Asian Sky Group. The traditional companies have a dilemma: how to change their business models from gold-plated, full-service aircraft management to match the nimble, customized pay only-for-what-you want upstarts. And they, too, have their dilemma: How to cope with the growth that comes from success, and execute for their existing customers, without the economy of scale enjoyed by the oldies. Many of the newer competitors operate fleets of six or fewer aircraft; together they now operate 31% of Greater China’s fleet. What’s happening, says Lowe, is that aircraft owners, many on their second or third jet, have come down the learning curve from owning their first jet, when they often wanted everything doing for them. “Now they want to pick and choose the services, not pay for the whole inclusive package.” The top 10 operators in Asia-Pacific operate 26% of the region’s total business jet fleet. However, Hong Kong Jet, Sino Jet and Lily Jet are the only ones in the top 10 that saw growth in 2016, with the rest suffering declines. The highest growth rate was achieved by two-year-old Bellawings (+267%) with a fleet of 11 aircraft and more to come this year, and the largest decline by Metrojet (-23%) to 23 from 35 in 2014. The top operator in Greater China continues to be Mainland-based Deer Jet. In 2014, it had a fleet of 68, which fell to 59 in 2015 and to 47 in 2016 after selling a total of seven, mostly older Hawker models, to buyers in the U.S. Aircraft operator Sino Jet was one of the few based in Hong Kong to see a big increase. In 2015 it had 18 aircraft, and now 30. A Better Year for Some Than for Others Gulfstream: Deliveries included 17 new G650/ER and six pre-owned G650s, four new G550s and four pre-owned, plus one pre-owned G200. Six G450s, five GIV/IV-SPs and four G550s left the region. Gulfstream now has 283 aircraft in the region and 179 in Greater China. Bombardier: Deliveries totaled nine new Global 6000 and two pre-owned, while four Global Express and four Challenger 605s departed. Bombardier’s fleet now comprises 301 in Asia-Pacific, and 138 in Greater China. Boeing: Added four pre-owned BBJs, one new VVIP Boeing 787 Dreamliner, and a new 747-800 for the Sultan of Brunei. It now has 34 BBJs in Asia-Pacific and 17 in Greater China. Embraer: Delivered five new Phenom 300s. Its fleet totals 79 aircraft in Asia-Pacific and 32 in Greater China. Dassault: Delivered two new aircraft, seven pre-owned found buyers, and two departed. Fleet size is 100 in Asia-Pacific and 45 in Greater China. Cessna: Delivered three new aircraft, five pre-owned entered Asia-Pacific, and 10 left. Cessna has 218 aircraft in the region, and 35 in Greater China. Airbus had one pre-owned addition, and lost two. Fleet size in Asia Pacific is 33, in Greater China 19. Three pre-owned Hawkers joined the Asia-Pacific fleet, while another 11 left the region, reducing the Hawker fleet there to 86 aircraft and just 12 in Greater China.

But it’s still unclear whether these young firms can work with big, established players such as Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., or deliver the kind of quick returns that some investors expect. Last month, a few of aerospace startups gathered in El Segundo, Calif., to pitch their ideas to a room of investors and space aficionados at an event co-hosted by Aerospace Corp. and incubator Starburst Accelerator. Some startups said large aerospace companies or investors expressed interest in their proposals; those talks are in early stages. For successful space entrepreneurs with good ideas, “there is more and more money,” said Francois Chopard, chief executive of Paris-based Starburst Accelerator. In the year since its founding, the incubator has worked with more than 150 startups and hosted events in cities such as Berlin, Montreal and Seattle. Starburst Accelerator also has a consulting arm, a venture fund and offices in Los Angeles, Singapore and Munich, Germany. Advertisement Continue reading In one month, college friends Deepak Atyam and Alex Finch will graduate from Purdue University armed with master’s degrees in aerospace engineering and ready to change the dynamics of building rocket engines. The two are co-founders of Tri-D Dynamics, a Cerritos startup that has developed technology and processes that improve on advanced 3-D printing methods for metalworking. Tri-D Dynamics plans to use them to churn out rocket engines of any size in a kind of automated assembly-line process to possibly shave months from the usual production process. As a University of California, San Diego, undergraduate, Atyam led a student group in developing a 3-D printed rocket engine. Its test firing in the Mojave Desert was financed with money from NASA and $2,000 the group made by selling barbecued chicken. Two years later, Atyam and Finch followed that up with a test-firing of a second-generation engine that was about three times larger, with greater thrust. The four-person firm already has a contract to produce a rocket engine by early 2018 for a small-satellite launch vehicle company it declined to name. And it has letters of intent from several small companies. Atyam and Finch estimate they have invested a total of $25,000 of their own money in Tri-D Dynamics. They’re looking for a $1 million seed round this year. “It’s really important to find the right investor who knows exactly what to expect and what’s needed to go into creating the products and services necessary to serve this industry,” Finch said. “That payoff is going to come, but it may not be the two to three years they may have expected from an app or a software company.” Scott Montgomerie knew his startup was on to something when large crowds gathered to watch a demonstration of its augmented reality training program at a 2012 mining industry conference. The Scope AR team showed how a worker wearing special glasses could watch computer-generated animations overlaid on a real-world mining truck fuse box to learn how to make repairs. But when the San Francisco firm started looking for funding in 2015, it was a tough sell since augmented reality wasn’t yet a mainstream concept, said Montgomerie, the company’s chief executive. Advertisement Continue reading That year, Scope AR was accepted into Silicon Valley tech incubator Y Combinator and later raised $2 million in a seed funding round. The company’s two technological platforms — one for remote assistance and another that enables companies to make “smart instructions” for assembly workers — have been used by Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, NASA and Boeing. Scope AR’s technology helps assembly-floor technicians avoid paper instructions by using a more interactive approach. Workers can use a tablet, phone or specialized glasses to see 3-D animations superimposed on real-world parts or vehicles that explain assembly or repair steps. “We’re seeing some real value in terms of business applications,” Montgomerie said. “People see the future.” Seven years from now, Firmamentum hopes to operate 27 “cellphone towers in space” that would beam cheaper broadband Internet service directly to consumers’ smartphones. The company plans to manufacture its satellite antennas in space using technology similar to 3-D printing. Several antennas would be attached robotically to a satellite to increase the amount of data it could transmit for customers, company CEO Rob Hoyt said. Currently, large space antennas are built on the ground and designed to fold up like giant umbrellas to fit inside a rocket. Firmamentum’s antennas — which would look like bigger versions of earthbound satellite dishes — won’t be limited by the rocket’s cargo space. And its process could eventually allow for mass, low-cost antenna production in space — a technology that could be sold to satellite makers, Hoyt said. The idea gained more traction around 2008 after 3-D printing became more popular in the consumer market, he said. From there, the company figured the technology could be used to make large antennas for a widespread broadband service. Advertisement Continue reading Firmamentum was created about two years ago as a division of Tethers Unlimited, a Bothell, Wash., company that’s been making satellite components for 23 years. So far, Firmamentum’s funding has come mostly from government research and development contracts such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. Venture capitalists and other possible investors, however, are holding back for now, convinced the company is too early in the production process to seek funding, Hoyt said. “The timeline for getting new technologies developed, proven and on the market in the space industry is much longer than in many other industries,” he said. “Hopefully at some point … the risk-benefit story will make sense for them to work with us.” When Peter Beck arrived in Silicon Valley in 2013, he gave himself three weeks to secure funding for his small-satellite launch vehicle startup, Rocket Lab. Instead of blanketing area investors with meeting requests, the New Zealand native focused on a select few venture capital firms that were knowledgeable about space. The decision paid off. Rocket Lab secured A-round funding from Khosla Ventures, a firm that previously had invested in Skybox Imaging, which launched small satellites to capture images of Earth. Since then, the Huntington Beach company has raised $148 million, including a $75 million Series D round led by venture capital fund Data Collective. (Rocket Lab did not attend the El Segundo pitch event.) Rocket Lab plans to give small satellites a dedicated ride to space, unlike the usual method of “piggybacking” on launches with larger satellites. That gives customers a more precise launch window and an ability to position the satellite more precisely. The firm has completed construction of its launch pad in New Zealand. The first test flight of Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket is planned for sometime in the next couple of months. Rocket Lab has contracts with NASA and Planet to launch small satellites. Advertisement Continue reading Beck said space is “on the tipping point” of being a more commercial domain, meaning his pitches to investors boil down to the impending normality of conducting business in orbit. “The way I describe Rocket Lab to investors is, yes, there’s fire and there’s rockets,” he said. “But at the end of the day, we’re a glorified freight company.” —— ©2017 Los Angeles Times Visit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. _____ Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: Forum luncheon brings in region's venture investors – Aug 25, 2014 Executive's Desk: Incubators clear away entrepreneur isolation – Jul 6, 2015 Accelerator helping jump-start creative industries – Jul 13, 2015 As more NM startups sprout, funding activity grows – Feb 29, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

"Iran's national flag carrier, the Iran Air, has signed a contract with the ATR company to buy 20 ATR 72-600 planes," Asqar Fakhriyeh Kashan said without further details. In February, Fakhriyeh Kashan announced the talks with ATR officials, saying that after finalizing the deal with ATR, valued at 400 million U.S. dollars, 20 passenger planes will be delivered to Iran in a scheduled manner. In December 2016, Iran sealed a contract with Airbus to buy 100 aircraft worth over 18 billion dollars. Also in December, Iran Air finalized another agreement with the U.S. Boeing to purchase 80 commercial planes. The agreement envisages the purchase of 50 twinjet narrow-body Boeing 737 planes and 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft with a total value of 16.6 billion dollars.

Tech 15:58 10.04.2017Get short URL 8150545 The Moon is home to six US flags, planted by the men who between 1969-1972 risked life and limb to visit the astronomical body. However, once towering totems to US achievement in the space race, today they are ravaged shadows of their former selves, bleached white by ultraviolet radiation and disintegrating due to the hostile local environment. "Old Glory" features heavily in the official photos of every manned lunar landing, and snaps of the billowing flags, taken by telescopes on Earth, are the most effective response to conspiracy theories suggesting humans have never been. Nonetheless, while images taken in 2012 by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter demonstrate at least five out six flags remain standing, the chances the banners still display the stars and stripes are negligible. #DidYouKnow: The American flags astronauts placed on the moon are now white due to radiation from the sun. #SciFactFriday #radiation pic.twitter.com/ey9WF1GqN8 — Astrophysics, Inc (@AstrophysicsInc) April 7, 2017​ Instead, the flags are almost certainly completely white by now — and may even be disintegrating under the strain of constant radioactive onslaught. Each flag is composed of rayon, and cost US$5.50 at the time — around US$32.00 in 2017 — and if they'd been planted on the Earth, sunlight would've faded their vibrant colors within a few years, as ultraviolet light isn't fully absorbed by our planet's atmosphere. On the Moon, the flags enjoy no protection from the elements whatsoever — the Moon lacks an atmosphere, and the barren surface offers virtually no shade. Moreover, a lunar day lasts 28 Earth days, meaning the flags will have been subjected to unrelenting UV. The chances they have been bleached entirely are high. "For 40-odd years, the flags have been exposed to the full fury of the Moon's environment — alternating 14 days of searing sunlight and 100°C heat with 14 days of numbing-cold —150°C darkness. Even more damaging is the intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation from pure unfiltered sunlight on the cloth from which the flags were made. America is left with no discernible space program while the Moon above us no longer flies a visible US flag," said lunar scientist Paul Spudis. Still, it's a wonder they're still standing at all in 2017. The man who made the flags in 1969, Dennis Lacarruba, said in 2008, he didn't believe there'd be anything left even then. "I gotta be honest with you. It's gonna be ashes," Lacarruba surmised. © Photo: Boeing Fly Me to the Moon and Then to Mars, Boeing: Defense Firm Expands Space PlansWhat's more, the ailing ensigns may not be joined by newer, younger partners for some time — NASA has turned its attentions elsewhere, pledging to dispatch astronauts to Mars by 2033. Instead, the Moon may become home to banners depicting the logos of private businesses — many firms and moguls have expressed a desire to visit — or even colonize — the Earth's satellite. For instance, Tesla Motors and SpaceX founder Elon Musk intends to slingshot two tourists to the Moon in 2018. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, owner of rocket company Blue Origin, is likewise planning to offer lunar vacations in future. Boeing have proposed setting up a base on the Moon, which would serve as a launching pad for human visits to Mars.

Even the priciest & best made of flags are not appealing after Year One without at least a good cleaning and perhaps a re-dye.

In January this year, the airline replaced free meals on its short-haul flights by introducing a range of Marks & Spencer's sandwiches and snacks, and the plan could soon be implemented on flights to North America, Australia, Asia and Africa. "We might do it," British Airways boss Alex Cruz told the Sunday Times when asked whether the carrier could consider extending the measure to long-haul economy. Free meals were first ditched on some domestic flights in 2009 but the decision to scrap them from all short-all economy flights was met by criticism, with passengers complaining Britain's flagship carrier was turning into a budget airline. However, Cruz said that after a "rough start", customers have now embraced the change. "It's going great," he said. "Customers say to us: 'Finally, I have good choices. No more chicken or beef'." The "M&S on board" range offers a bag of crisps or a chocolate bar for £1 each, while a tomato and mozzarella focaccia costs £4.95. The carrier has come under intense scrutiny recently, for a perceived no-frills approach which has had a negative impact on the quality of service, but Cruz dismissed the criticism. "I don't engage with running this airline into the ground," he said. However, should the proposal be put in place, British Airways could be in line for a bigger backlash as it would become the first flagship airline to charge passengers for a meal on long-haul flights. Norwegian, which offers flights to California and Florida from £159 from London Gatwick, already charges economy passengers. Meanwhile, Cruz also unveiled plans to increase capacity on its Boeing 777s services from Gatwick to the Caribbean by introducing an extra seat into each economy row and making room for an extra 52 passengers. "We'll start in Gatwick," he said. "We'll see how it goes and then see what comes for Heathrow." In March, the carrier said it would squeeze two more rows onto its Airbus aircraft, meaning the gap between seats in economy class on A320 and A321 planes in its fleet will decline from 30 inches to 29 inches. That means it will offer the same legroom as easyJet on some flights, while Ryanair offers 30 inches.

Stackley told Breaking Defense’s Sydney Freedberg in an interview that he believes the Super Hornet’s payload will be a “good” complement to the stealth and sensor technologies of F-35 jets. A Block III package would update Super Hornet’s data links and cockpit displays as well as integrate the InfraRed Search and Track sensor system that works to detect stealth aircraft through engine heat and without using radar, Freedberg reported. Dan Gillian, a Boeing vice president, said the company also looks to equip Super Hornets with built-in fuel tanks in an effort to match the range of F-35s.

The ad is the latest effort from Americans for Prosperity (AFP) to oppose the proposal. AFP said it is spending six figures on the ad buy and that the commercial will appear nationwide on cable news channels for one week starting on Tuesday. The border-adjustment tax would subject imports to a 20 percent tax and exempt exports. It is a key element of a tax-reform blueprint that House Republicans are using as the starting point for legislation. It has also been the focus of intense lobbying, with supporters and opponents working hard to make their cases to lawmakers. Supporters of the border-adjustment tax say it would take away companies' reasons for moving jobs overseas, while opponents say it would lead to higher prices on consumer goods. AFP’s ad argues that the border-adjustment tax is not in line with the message that voters supported in the 2016 elections. The commercial includes images of a man in a Trump-style red hat in a room that looks like it was the site of an election victory party. “America voted for change, economic growth and to stop wasteful spending,” the narrator in the ad says. “But now, some members of Congress want a new trillion-dollar BAT consumer tax that could drive up your costs and hurt our economy.” The ad also calls the border-adjustment tax a consumer tax hike that’s “as big as ObamaCare.” “Imposing a massive 20-percent import tax is the wrong approach,” AFP President Tim Phillips said in a statement. “A border adjustment tax would harm hard working families that deserve relief from the tax code, not a new consumer tax that would drive up the cost of everyday items. Congress needs to know this is not the change the American people signed up for.” AFP has been advocating against the border-adjustment proposal for the last several months and has used a number of tactics in doing so. Last week, AFP and another Koch-backed group, Freedom Partners, released a report arguing that a border-adjustment tax would hurt every state. Michigan, Louisiana, Tennessee, New Jersey, Kentucky, South Carolina, Illinois, Texas, Georgia and California would be among the states that would be particularly vulnerable, according to the report. Other groups have also run television ads about the border-adjustment tax. The National Retail Federation and the Club for Growth have both run ads against the proposal, while the American Made Coalition — a group of businesses that includes Boeing and General Election — has run a TV ad in favor of the proposal and the House Republicans’ tax blueprint. Leaders of the House Republicans' tax-reform effort are committed to the border-adjustment tax. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin BradyKevin BradyLiberal group: Lawmakers should reject tax cuts for corporations Trump starts over with tax plan: report Koch-backed group unveils TV ad against border tax MORE (R-Texas) told reporters Thursday that “at the end of the day, we’re not going to keep the tax code that favors foreign products.” Brady also pushed back on AFP’s report, saying it “probably fits the definition of fake news.” But the fate of the border tax proposal is uncertain. Many GOP senators have expressed opposition to the border-adjustment tax, and Trump hasn’t provided a clear stance on the matter. Tags Kevin Brady   View the discussion thread.

However, Cruz said that after a "rough start", customers have now embraced the change. "It's going great," he said. "Customers say to us: 'Finally, I have good choices. No more chicken or beef'." The "M&S on board" range offers a bag of crisps or a chocolate bar for £1 each, while a tomato and mozzarella focaccia costs £4.95. The carrier has come under intense scrutiny recently, for a perceived no-frills approach which has had a negative impact on the quality of service, but Cruz dismissed the criticism. "I don't engage with running this airline into the ground," he said. However, should the proposal be put in place, British Airways could be in line for a bigger backlash as it would become the first flagship airline to charge passengers for a meal on long-haul flights. Norwegian, which offers flights to California and Florida from £159 from London Gatwick, already charges economy passengers. Meanwhile, Cruz also unveiled plans to increase capacity on its Boeing 777s services from Gatwick to the Caribbean by introducing an extra seat into each economy row and making room for an extra 52 passengers. "We'll start in Gatwick," he said. "We'll see how it goes and then see what comes for Heathrow." In March, the carrier said it would squeeze two more rows onto its Airbus aircraft, meaning the gap between seats in economy class on A320 and A321 planes in its fleet will decline from 30 inches to 29 inches. That means it will offer the same legroom as easyJet on some flights, while Ryanair offers 30 inches.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 10 April 2017 | MYT 2:30 PM Laptop ban spurred by terror concern raises warning of fire risk Fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety, the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires. — AFP The US order prohibiting passengers from carrying laptops and other electronics into the cabins of some overseas flights is raising concerns about a risk unrelated to terror: the potential for those devices’ lithium-based batteries to catch fire in the baggage hold.  The Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit funded by airlines and other groups to reduce the risk of accidents, on April 7 issued a press release urging the industry to take steps not to “introduce another risk” from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics.  The concern is that passengers are being told to place electronic devices into cargo holds just as international safety agencies have begun barring bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium cells because of evidence that they can spontaneously catch fire and even explode.  “It’s potentially a transfer of consequential risk,” Greg Marshall, vice president of Global Programs at the safety group, said in an interview. “We’re going to see large numbers of these devices carried in the cargo hold of aircraft that would otherwise have been in the cabin.”  The US Federal Aviation Administration logged 31 cases last year in which lithium-based batteries either caught fire or smouldered on airline flights. Three cargo aircraft have been destroyed by fires attributed at least in part to lithium batteries, two of which were fatal accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.  The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the safety foundation’s release.  On March 21, the US notified airlines that it wouldn’t permit passengers on flights headed to the US from 10 Middle Eastern airports – including Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Cairo – to carry any electronic device larger than a smartphone. DHS said the action was the result of new intelligence that terrorists were planning to target airlines by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.”  The UK followed with a similar ban the same day. Representative John Katko, a New York Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Security Subcommittee, said in a speech March 29 that the threat was real and predicted other nations would broaden the ban. DHS Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told Congress the action may be extended to other airports.  However, the fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety, the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires.  The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization last year concluded that lithium-ion cells were too risky to be carried in bulk on passenger flights after manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE advised airlines that existing fire suppression systems weren’t adequate to protect planes against lithium fires.  While the terrorist threats may be real, the government should perform a risk analysis and take steps to reduce the potential for battery fires, said John Cox, a safety consultant who has written on the subject of aircraft fires.  Some carriers have allowed passengers to keep their laptops and tablet computers with them until just before departure, gathering them in a bin to be stowed in the cargo hold, Cox said. Placing the devices in such close proximity to each other increases the potential risks if one catches fire, he said.  “If they are in the cargo hold and one overheats and goes into thermal runaway, you can’t deal with it,” he said.  Pilots and flight attendants are trained to extinguish a battery fire in the cabin, but wouldn’t be able to reach a blaze in a cargo area, he said.  Passengers should be reminded to switch off electronics if they pack them in checked bags, the Flight Safety Foundation’s Marshall said. They also shouldn’t assume it’s now permissible to stow spare batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage bound for the cargo hold. Those items are still prohibited in checked bags, he said. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Google offers at least US$880mil to LG display for OLED investment: report Amazon finds it hard to make friends it will crush later: opinion Twitter pulls lawsuit over anti-Trump account, says summons withdrawn Artificial intelligence to put an end to failed selfies Qualcomm claims Apple made threats and lied to regulators Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Others Also Read DAP rep agrees with Umno proposal that Guan Eng steps down Australia delays axing of Force or Rebels Bargains aplenty at Perfect Livin ’17 expo advertisement Latest News Foxconn could bid up to US$27bil for Toshiba's chip business: Bloomberg Cyberattack on Union Bank of India similar to Bangladesh heist: WSJ France's Macron says would step up security demands on tech firms Battle of billionaires as Son set to clash with Bezos in India BMW, Ford win UK funds for driverless, low-carbon vehicles Most Viewed in Tech Battle of billionaires as Son set to clash with Bezos in India Qualcomm claims Apple made threats and lied to regulators Artificial intelligence to put an end to failed selfies Flipkart raises US$1.4bil in high stakes battle with Amazon BMW, Ford win UK funds for driverless, low-carbon vehicles The Samsung Galaxy S: The evolution year by year LeEco abandons US$2bil Vizio deal, citing ‘Chinese policy factor’ Symantec attributes 40 cyberattacks to CIA-linked hacking tools Facebook's Sandberg says number of monthly advertisers tops five million Cyberattack on Union Bank of India similar to Bangladesh heist: WSJ Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Regular flights to Dushanbe will be carried out twice a week on the A320 airliners, according to the company. The sale of tickets for the specified flight is open. Earlier, an airline representative office was opened in Dushanbe. From the Tajik side, the airline Somon Air will fly to Tashkent. Visa regime currently operates between the two Central Asian countries. Flights between the two countries were terminated in the autumn of 1992, and in 2000, Uzbekistan introduced a visa regime for travel to Tajikistan. The air traffic was interrupted with the beginning of civil war in Tajikistan, there were virtually no commercial, economic and political ties. The relations began to restore in 2016. In autumn 2016, a protocol on cooperation was signed between the civil aviation authorities of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the air transport sector. Uzbekistan Airways performed the first charter flight to Dushanbe in November 2016. Uzbekistan Airways is a monopoly air carrier in Uzbekistan, wholly owned by the state. The aircraft fleet of the Uzbek airline currently has 31 aircraft of western production, including thirteen Boeing passenger aircraft, thirteen airbuses (three A-310 and ten A-320-200), three medium-haul RJ-85s and two cargo planes Boeing-767-300BCF. The Uzbek airline operates flights to over 20 cities in Europe, America, the Middle East, Asia, 22 cities of the CIS countries and 11 destinations on local airlines. --- Kamila Aliyeva is AzerNews’ staff journalist, follow her on Twitter: @Kami_Aliyeva Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz   #AIR FLIGHTS Related News Air Arabia enters Azerbaijan's aviation market 16 March 17:12 Tajikistan, Uzbekistan air traffic resumes after 25 years of halt 10 February 12:57 More flights to be performed between Azerbaijan, Iran 2 February 12:38 Indian air carrier to begin flights to Azerbaijan 16 August 2016 16:24 Russian tourists prefer Azerbaijan 3 August 2016 10:00 More air carriers to operate between Azerbaijan and Russia 29 July 2016 12:52 New Islamabad-Baku-Istanbul air route to open 25 August 2015 13:50 Kazakhstan expands air flights 16 July 2015 09:29 Georgia, Russia to start negotiations on direct air flights 18 June 2013 14:57 Latest Popular 11:00 • Armenian militaries keep high tension on frontline 10:53 • BP names contractor for offshore works in Azerbaijan 10:52 • Kazakhstan to open railway station, air terminal in Astana in May 10:35 • Erdogan: Constitutional reforms key to Turkey's future 10:32 • Minister: Not possible to change TAP landfall 10:29 • Turkey: Over 10,000 PKK terrorists ‘neutralized’ 10:21 • President Aliyev: Azerbaijan ensured rapid development in all areas [UPDATE] 10:15 • Currency rates for April 11 10:00 • Incredible lake in Land of Fire [PHOTO] 09:49 • Rainy weather expected in regions 10 April 18:33 • National judoka wins bronze at Antalya Grand Prix 10 April 18:05 • Direct flight to connect Kazakhstan with Germany 10 April 18:02 • Russian expert: OSCE MG’s mechanisms on Nagorno-Karabakh conflict not workout 10 April 17:53 • Azerbaijan, Russia hold consultations on Caspian Sea status 10 April 17:50 • Baku Shopping Festival solemnly opens with concert in Old City [PHOTO] 10 April 17:46 • Azerbaijani MPs to observe referendum in Turkey 10 April 17:34 • Kazakhstan's FM calls on to support Astana, Geneva processes 10 April 17:22 • CBA announces manat rate for April 11 10 April 17:21 • To Greener shores: More Armenians leave homeland 10 April 17:02 • Winners of Azerbaijan’s first IT-championship named 10 April 16:09 • Vera Brezhneva and her dancers to perform in Baku 10 April 14:00 • List of stores joining Baku Shopping Festival revealed 10 April 12:48 • Putin, Rouhani assess U.S. actions in Syria 10 April 17:50 • Baku Shopping Festival solemnly opens with concert in Old City [PHOTO] 10 April 11:32 • Uzbek airline launches flights en route Tashkent-Dushanbe 10 April 14:38 • Some 100 state objects to be offered for privatization 10 April 15:32 • National judo fighters bring home seven medals [PHOTO] 10 April 12:00 • Dihaj performs in Amsterdam [VIDEO] 10 April 17:53 • Azerbaijan, Russia hold consultations on Caspian Sea status 10 April 17:34 • Kazakhstan's FM calls on to support Astana, Geneva processes 10 April 17:46 • Azerbaijani MPs to observe referendum in Turkey 10 April 14:20 • Kazakhstan Cultural Days due in Baku, Shaki 10 April 11:41 • Meditation: Theory and practice seminar in YARAT 10 April 14:48 • Swiss President hails Azerbaijan’s important role in connecting people from East and West 10 April 13:44 • Azerbaijan, Dagestan plan to create joint tourist routes 10 April 14:56 • Iran, Oman hold joint rescue drills in Indian Ocean 10 April 15:45 • Rouhani spoke about government’s achievements 10 April 16:26 • President Aliyev: OSCE MG must increase pressure on Armenia`s policy of occupation [UPDATE] 10 April 17:22 • CBA announces manat rate for April 11 10 April 18:05 • Direct flight to connect Kazakhstan with Germany AzerNews Newspaper Facebook Twitter Google+ RSS Information About us Contacts Advertising Azernews In Print News Archive © 2017 AzerNews.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: April 10th, 2017 >> Story Satnews Daily April 10th, 2017 Air Force's Space Chief Receptive to Flying on Recycled SpaceX Rockets The US Air Force is open to buying rides on previously flown SpaceX rockets to put military satellites into orbit, a move expected to cut launch costs for the Pentagon, the head of the Air Force Space Command said on Thursday. The idea of flying on recycled rockets became a reality a week ago when privately owned Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, launched a communications satellite on a Falcon 9 booster that previously put a cargo ship into orbit for NASA. SpaceX's Falcon 9. That Falcon main stage had been recovered from a successful return landing on an ocean platform shortly after its maiden flight last April, then was relaunched and salvaged again last Thursday, marking a spaceflight first. “I would be comfortable if we were to fly on a reused booster,” General John "Jay" Raymond told reporters at the USSpace Symposium in Colorado Springs. “They’ve proven they can do it. ... It’s going to get us to lower cost.” SpaceX has so far won three launch contracts to fly military and national security satellites - business previously awarded exclusively to United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. All those flights will take place on new Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions worth more than $10 billion. After last week's landmark launch, Musk said the company planned to fly about 20 more rockets this year, including the debut blastoff of its new heavy-lift vehicle. Up to six of those missions, including the Falcon Heavy, will use previously flown boosters, he said. Speaking at the symposium on Wednesday, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said the cost of refurbishing and reflying the Falcon 9 first stage was "substantially less than half" the cost of manufacturing a new booster - the most expensive part of the rocket. SpaceX’s website lists the cost of a basic Falcon 9 launch at $62 million. SpaceX expects to reduce costs even further. The company’s next goal is to launch and return a rocket and relaunch it within 24 hours. "That’s when we’ll really feel like we’ve got reusability right," Shotwell said. Raymond said the Air Force would need to certify that a used booster could safely deliver its satellites into orbit. "I'm pretty comfortable we'll get comfortable with doing it," Raymond said.

China has become the world’s major business jet market, Brazilian manufacturer Embraer said at a preview of the Asian Business Aviation Conference and Exhibition today. Manufacturers, including Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier, will display 35 planes at the exhibition. Last year, Shanghai’s two airports handled 6,136 business jets, up 10 percent in 2015, according to the Shanghai Airport Authority. To meet rising demand, the airport authority will build a new hanger facility for business jets at Hongqiao airport by April 2018, the authority said today. The three-day event is held at the Shanghai Hawker Pacific Business Aviation Service Center at the Hongqiao International Airport.

Breaking911 Home Contact News Tips Politics Crime Terrorism Video Entertainment Weather Home International Laptop ban spurred by terror concern raises warning of fire risk International Terrorism U.S. Laptop ban spurred by terror concern raises warning of fire risk April 9, 2017 0 200 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet The U.S. order prohibiting passengers from carrying laptops and other electronics into the cabins of some overseas flights is raising concerns about a risk unrelated to terror: the potential for those devices’ lithium-based batteries to catch fire in the baggage hold. The Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit funded by airlines and other groups to reduce the risk of accidents, on Friday issued a press release urging the industry to take steps not to “introduce another risk” from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics. The concern is that passengers are being told to place electronic devices into cargo holds just as international safety agencies have begun barring bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium cells because of evidence that they can spontaneously catch fire and even explode. “It’s potentially a transfer of consequential risk,” Greg Marshall, vice president of Global Programs at the safety group, said in an interview. “We’re going to see large numbers of these devices carried in the cargo hold of aircraft that would otherwise have been in the cabin.” The Federal Aviation Administration logged 31 cases last year in which lithium-based batteries either caught fire or smoldered on airline flights. Three cargo aircraft have been destroyed by fires attributed at least in part to lithium batteries, two of which were fatal accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the safety foundation’s release. On March 21, the U.S. notified airlines that it wouldn’t permit passengers on flights headed to the U.S. from 10 Middle Eastern airports — including Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Cairo — to carry any electronic device larger than a smartphone. DHS said the action was the result of new intelligence that terrorists were planning to target airlines by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.” The U.K. followed with a similar ban the same day. Representative John Katko, a New York Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Security Subcommittee, said in a speech March 29 that the threat was real and predicted other nations would broaden the ban. DHS Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told Congress the action may be extended to other airports. However, the fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety, the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires. The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization last year concluded that lithium-ion cells were too risky to be carried in bulk on passenger flights after manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE advised airlines that existing fire suppression systems weren’t adequate to protect planes against lithium fires. While the terrorist threats may be real, the government should perform a risk analysis and take steps to reduce the potential for battery fires, said John Cox, a safety consultant who has written on the subject of aircraft fires. Some carriers have allowed passengers to keep their laptops and tablet computers with them until just before departure, gathering them in a bin to be stowed in the cargo hold, Cox said. Placing the devices in such close proximity to each other increases the potential risks if one catches fire, he said. “If they are in the cargo hold and one overheats and goes into thermal runaway, you can’t deal with it,” he said. Pilots and flight attendants are trained to extinguish a battery fire in the cabin, but wouldn’t be able to reach a blaze in a cargo area, he said. Passengers should be reminded to switch off electronics if they pack them in checked bags, the Flight Safety Foundation’s Marshall said. They also shouldn’t assume it’s now permissible to stow spare batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage bound for the cargo hold. Those items are still prohibited in checked bags, he said.

Govt on track to rid country of load shedding, says PM 11-Apr-17 725 ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Muha ... Substantive tax reform will pass in 2017. Its outlines are clear and the details are congealing. Keep in mind that the tax-reform package will be passed through the reconciliation process, which requires that changes not increase the deficit in years eleven to fifty. Anything goes in the first ten years, but if the total package is not deficit neutral by year eleven, the legislation expires. This allows the House and Senate to pass fundamental tax reform with only Republican votes. No Democrats’ votes are required—and none is expected. How did we get here? Donald Trump released his tax-reform proposal during the primary campaign a year ago; his most eye-catching goal was to drive the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent. Obama had flirted with 28 percent. House Republicans were proposing 25 percent. The House Republican Blueprint quickly moved their target to 20 percent. Trump had not initially included full and immediate business expensing (to replace long depreciation schedules) in his plan. Every other Republican presidential candidate and the House Republicans led with expensing, which dramatically reduces the cost of capital. Trump adopted full expensing. Trump’s plan reduced individual tax-rate reductions, and his plan merged with the House Republican individual reform, to move the present seven tax rates to three rates: 12, 25 and 33 percent. Capital-gains taxes will be set at 50 percent of the individual rates, for a top rate of 16.5 percent. Corporate capital gains will be reduced from today’s 35 percent to 20 percent. The emerging Trump/House plan abolishes the death tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. The death tax was first imposed to finance the Civil War, and the AMT was imposed to solve a “fairness problem” that was supposed to hit 115 millionaires, and now hits millions of Americans. The United States will move from its present “worldwide” tax system—where Uncle Sam insists on the ability to tax American companies and individuals, regardless of where they work or are located. This puts American firms and American companies at a severe disadvantage. French firms and French citizens earning income in the United States pay U.S. taxes but not French taxes. Americans working abroad pay both French and American taxes (U.S. law allows limited deductibility of taxes paid abroad). The bill would allow the estimated $2.5 trillion of American earnings overseas to be returned, after paying an 8 percent tax on cash and 3 percent on fixed assets. After that, all earnings overseas could be returned tax free, forever into the future. American companies are happy to pay a one-time smaller hit and win permanent territoriality. It is the higher business tax and the worldwide tax system that makes an American company that operates worldwide worth more if it is bought by a Canadian or Belgian company. Corporate inversions are driven, not by wicked foreigners, but by destructive American tax law. The Trump/House plan ends that incentive to invert or move headquarters overseas. To “pay for” some of these tax reductions, business will lose the deductibility of net interest payments and many smaller deductions. The most controversial changes is making the corporate income tax “border adjustable,” so that when Boeing exports a plane worth $100 million it deducts $100 million from its reported income, and reduces its tax liability by $20 million in taxes ($100 million × 20 percent). An importer bringing in a $100 product must add the $100 to its taxable base and pay $20, or $100 × 20 percent. This does raise the cost of imports and reduces the after-tax cost of exports. Manufacturers in the United States like this a lot—importers less so. The border-adjustable feature raises $1 trillion over a decade. Without the border-adjustable feature in the corporate income tax, the tax writers would have to find another $1 trillion in higher taxes somewhere else in the code, reducing spending by $1 trillion in the next decade. The Senate rules insist that the budget changes be deficit neutral (not tax revenue neutral) over years eleven through fifty. If the tax and budget changes in tax reform do not keep the expected deficits from increasing from today’s expectations, then the tax package expires at the end of ten years. This is what happened to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. Both Trump and the House very much want the legislation to be permanent. This is why the fight over repealing Obamacare was, and is, important. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) would have repealed $1 trillion of Obamacare taxes and $1.2 trillion in Obamacare spending over the next decade. It also would have expanded Health Savings Accounts and block-granted Medicaid to the states.

The song has notched up 21 million views on YouTube and Facebook in a week. We caught up with the rapper recently. Ironically, the man who writes rhymes about partying 24x7, candidly admitted that he barely get time to party. Here, he talks about his latest track and about being in every other Bollywood song... Your biggest hits are set in clubs. But you have said in interviews that you were never a party animal. Making up for lost time, even if it’s for show? (Laughs) That’s true. It’s not like I don’t party, it’s just that I don’t get the time. I am always busy making music for others to party to. Now with my album and my other projects, I don’t think I’ll find any time in the near future, too. Which memory will stay with you — shooting on the roof of the O2 arena or on the wing of a Boeing? Actually, we shot Mercy in three locales. Two, you’ve mentioned, the third is a neon shop in London. All the venues will stay with me forever. O2 was unbelievable. After sorting out permissions, the team and I actually took our own gear to the roof, shot the scenes and got down, without help. You can imagine how enthusiastic we were. Shooting on the Boeing wing was another feeling altogether. The wing slants after a point, so I walked around for a while to get comfortable and then, I felt like I owned it. I love this particular shot of me being at the edge of the wing. The neon shop was cool, too. The owner had some really quirky things in the shop… 21 million hits in six days for a non-film track. Do these numbers matter? When I began this project, my label and I discussed this and we were sure that we will not judge the song by the numbers. Our strategy would be to drop the song and video together, spend days talking about it and promoting it. Our other strategy was to involve fans. I got the fan to reveal the album art, then the song. I am just happy that the song is doing well. 21 million or not, my fans love it, are sharing it, owning it. What more can I ask for? Bollywood-wise, you’re in every other film. Don’t you think that is a double-edged sword? You’re going to be envied for being that busy. And get taken for granted for being everywhere. It’s humbling to get so much work. Getting into the industry has been tough. When I released my first song, it was amazing for the reception I got. The only downside I see to this, is that I don’t get any time for myself. Also, am I really in every song? (Laughs) Bryan Durham TOP TOP   Comments   Also Read Entertainment Raveena Tandon BARRED from promoting her film 'Maatr'?

The taxiway is an exclusive lane connecting apron with the runway. With 29 aircraft operating from the airport and international operations set to start from fourth week of April, the airport authorities had appealed to the state government to hand over the land to for expansion. BMC sources said survey for relocating the dwellers has been complete and the families will be shifted to another place land for which has been allotted by the general administration department. Around Rs 6 crore has been estimated to be spent to rehabilitate the families. Due to the slum, acquisition of 47 acres of OUAT is not possible for expansion of the runway. On March 21, the state government asked the airport authorities to make a request to GA department for acquisition of 47 acres. The OUAT will be provided alternative land at Sakhigopal. "The OUAT land will help check bird menace as it is now a wet field and birds flock to it for eating insects," said a senior officer of the airport. Currently, the required 150-metre space towards the north side of the runway is not there. At present, the taxiway category of the airport is 4C. It will be 4D after expansion, which can facilitate movement of Boeing-767 (airbus-321) aircraft. The expansion is required for long-term benefits. After international operations begin, some airlines may like to land big aircraft, said the airport officer.

In the latest monthly update, managers Hamish Baillie (pictured), Steve Russell and Duncan MacInnes said they had increased the interest rate protection on the portfolio by reducing its net duration.  The manager trio are adopting a cautious stance as the Federal Reserve has indicated it could hike rates up to four times this year, while doubts remain about President Donald Trump's proposed fiscal stimulus. Related articles Ruffer trio: We are faced with a conundrum on index-linked bonds Ruffer duo cuts equities as markets await 'proof of Trump's success' Ruffer duo: The 'magical combination' that will boost Japan Ruffer names Vaughan as CEO; Maxey to focus on CIO role BlackRock, Baillie Gifford & JPM: Investment trust winners of 2016 Ruffer names Vaughan as CEO   They said: "We worry about an air pocket in which Trump's reform and fiscal easing remains stymied whilst markets have to start reacting to the first Fed hiking cycle since 2004. "For this reason we have increased our interest rate protection to the extent that we have a negligible net portfolio duration today." Ruffer duo: The 'magical combination' that will boost Japan Despite Trump previously hinting he could remove central bank independence, creating "frosty" relations between his administration and the Fed governors, the trio believe the normalisation process is now underway. "A rate hiking cycle, to the extent one truly emerges, will be a pivotal development. Many stock and bond investors have grown accustomed to justifying paltry yields by comparing them to cash returns. What intellectual gymnastics will be required to explain why stocks go up when rates are both rising and falling? "Despite this, looking further out, we contend the global debt mountain prevails to put a ceiling on where interest rates can go." Meanwhile, the manager said they were not surprised by the waning momentum for the global reflation trade, after Trump failed to push his healthcare reforms through Congress last month. "What we have seen is even a Tasmanian devil such as President Trump cannot transform overnight the gridlock of the political establishment into the promised engine of deregulation and job creation," the trio said. "The lack of tangible and immediate progress has been frustrating for the bulls. It is surprising to us that the market has been surprised - given the disharmony across the aisle it was never going to be easy and the implicit assumption of a roaring S&P 500 was that these policies would be implemented without delay or compromise."  The trust has less than 40% in equities, after the managers trimmed positions in Japan and took profits in some cyclical holdings, such as Boeing. This exposure is primarily concentrated in Japanese equities at 16%, and 9% in UK equities.   Over the year to 7 April, the trust is underperforming its AIC Flexible Investment sector, having returned 18.7% versus an average of 20.4%, according to FE.

A convergence of three trends - ride sharing, autonomous driving and vehicle electrification - will drive the shift, the Boston Consulting Group said in a study released on Monday. The change will be most profound in cities with more than one million people, where consumers will find it more economically advantageous to exit their personal vehicles and start hailing robot taxis. Read more Driverless cars just took a step closer to hitting the roads “The automotive industry is on the brink of a major transformation, and it’ll be here faster than people realise,” Justin Rose, a BCG partner leading its digital efforts for industrial companies, said in a statement. “For millions of Americans living in large cities, the next vehicle they purchase may be the last car they ever own.” Auto companies will face wrenching changes as more than five million conventional cars are replaced by an estimated 4.7 million autonomous electric vehicles by 2030, the consulting company said. A typical Chicago consumer could cut his commuting cost by $7,000 (£5,650) a year by ditching a personal car in favour a shared autonomous electric vehicle, BCG said. That trend will make car dealers “less relevant” and turn “hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of industry assets” into liabilities, BCG said.

The shift will begin gradually in the early 2020s and could happen even faster if innovations in technology and breakthroughs in pricing accelerate. “Automakers and parts suppliers would face the most profound challenge to their business models in a century,” BCG said in a statement. “This shift undermines the current industry business model.” Business picture of the day 34 show all Business picture of the day 1/34 Pret and Paul offer discount to customers who bring their own coffee cup - Monday April 10 French bakery group Paul and sandwich chain Pret a Manger will begin offering discounts to customers bringing in their own reusable cups, yielding to pressure from environmental groups concerned about the mountains of cardboard waste generated in the UK each year. 2/34 Doritos, Coco Pops, Peperami among latest products to be hit by shrinkflation - Thursday April 6 Bags of Doritos, packets Peperami and boxes Coco Pops have become the latest treats to shrink in size as retailers passed on surging costs from the Brexit-hit pound and rising commodity prices. 3/34 Cuban family making their own wine brand using condoms - Wednesday April 5 family wine business in Cuba is thriving thanks in part to an unconventional item being added into the fermentation process – condoms.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.
