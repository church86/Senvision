The internal cabin pressure has been decreased to the equivalent of 1,800m (6,000ft) altitude instead of 2,400m (8,000ft) on conventional aircraft. Furthermore, the humidity level will be set in the 15%~16% range, which will significantly improve passengers’ comfort compared to the maximum humidity of 11% in current aircraft. Korean Air is planning to utilize the aircraft for long-haul routes with high demand for leisure travel. First, the airline is scheduled to launch domestic flights between Seoul’s Gimpo Airport and JeJu Airport for a month as part of the required certification period, before launching long-haul international routes from Seoul’s Incheon Airport to Toronto, Madrid, and Zurich later this year. The interior design of the Dreamliner cabin is quite different from conventional aircraft. The “Premium Cabin Interior” uses the latest LED lighting technology to adjust the color and brightness of lighting based on time and environment. It has five different modes: for take-off, dining, sunset/sunrise, sleeping, and landing. The modes are designed to create a more comfortable atmosphere for passengers. Another noteworthy feature is the size of the cabin windows which are 78% larger than conventional aircraft, allowing passengers to have a better outside view. The manually operated window covers are gone and instead there are buttons to adjust the transparency of the windows in five different levels. A specially developed gel has been inserted within the windowpanes to control the transparency. The aircraft is made of 50% carbon fiber composites along with aluminum alloys for a reduced weight and greater durability, thereby consuming 20% less fuel and generating 20% fewer emissions than the airplane it replaces. Korean Air is scheduled to introduce five 787-9 Dreamliners to its fleet this year, with another five joining the fleet by 2019.

Then ‘Forgemasters toasts turnaround.’ And days later others shouted: ‘City lands first Boeing factory in Europe’. Wherever you go across the region at the moment there is a great sense of pleasure and excitement at these achievements. The achievements exploded into the public domain within a few short weeks – but have taken years of hard work and determination to pull off. And now the region is booming. The achievements are a massive triumph for the partnership between the public and private sectors who worked together to draw first supercar maker McLaren, then aero giant Boeing to the area. Our close partnership with the university, Sheffield City Council, and the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre was fundamental to bringing a global concern such as McLaren here. And our £12m commitment to the £50m project was critical to ensuring McLaren could get the project off the ground. It’s absolutely fantastic to see jobs coming to the North, but none of this would have been possible without our single-minded approach to ensuring we create jobs and boost economic growth. Other benefits likely to follow from McLaren’s move include supply chain opportunities, which are also important in the deal which is set to bring ‘Boeing Sheffield’ to the region once the Combined Authority has approved the funding at its March meeting. Both McLaren and Boeing plan to invest in research and development and subsequently a factory in the region’s Advanced Manufacturing Innovation District making respectively the chassis for their cars, and actuators – the components that move a plane’s wing flaps. Meanwhile, Forgemasters has been enabled, with a grant from the SCR, to go ahead with installing a new milling machine. This will allow the three-dimensional machining of increasingly complicated, ultra-large cast and forged shapes for industries such as civil nuclear power and defence. Further proof that the region is experiencing a boom came this week as we launched our Labour Market Intelligence Report, which shows that locally we trained more apprentices – 20,000 – in the 2014-15 academic year than the rest of England, except London and the South East. And we know that activity led by the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) and Combined Authority has contributed 16,000 new jobs to the economy and leveraged approximately £318m of private sector investment. The ‘let’s get it done’ work ethic in the region harnesses drive and ambition. With everyone pulling together we are building a thriving and successful economy which is helping to attract, retain and develop skills in the region. So we have a great deal of good news to take to MIPIM Cannes next week (March 13 -17) along with £1bn worth of major projects to tell potential investors about. Some of the largest brownfield developments in the country are in the Chesterfield area – the Peak Resort leisure destination and the Waterside mixed development – and got underway last month with the help of funding from our infrastructure fund. Our town centres are being revitalised, and our airport is flying high with new routes and record passenger numbers. We are set to build 13,000 homes in the region over the next few years with our new £20m Housing and Property Fund set to help accelerate new schemes. Former collieries and watersides are being sensitively and strategically transformed so that people can enjoy high value jobs and a good quality of life in the region. Following the news of Boeing’s decision, Professor Sir Keith Burnett, President and Vice Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, has even predicted that the area could play a crucial role in a new revolution for the UK, centred on science and innovation but working hand in hand with industry. We won’t rest on our laurels. We know there is a long way to go to ensure the future for our children and our children’s children. But in the meantime, everyone working so hard in this region should pat themselves on the back. And in the words of the song – let the good times roll. First landing in Europe Boeing Sheffield will be the aero giant’s first site in Europe, although it has 30 locations around the world. McLaren and Boeing will be based close to the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and names such as Rolls-Royce, British Steel, and Siemens. McLaren has already employed its first apprentices. Boeing expects to start recruiting in early 2018.

Ben Kaye, 18, in the main workshop at the AMRC Training Centre. The University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) was set up 16 years ago to combine the city’s industrial expertise with new engineering research. Since then it has grown to include more than 90 partners and was further boosted by Boeing’s recent decision to base its first European factory here. The fact this sprawling manufacturing research park is housed on the site of the former Orgreave Colliery, such a potent symbol of an industrial past that has all but vanished, is a pertinent one. Much has been made of the failure of successive governments to properly stimulate investment in former mining towns and those where traditional manufacturing industries, once the bedrock of so many local communities, have withered and died. So to have such a cutting-edge research and development complex here has been a boon to the local area. Kieran Bartholomew, 23, is one of the older apprentices. The neighbouring AMRC Training Centre is no less important and since opening just over three years ago, the centre has trained nearly 800 apprentices working for engineering and manufacturing firms based in the region. It runs advanced apprenticeships ranging from machining and welding to robot maintenance, as well as degree apprenticeships, and they work closely with employers to ensure the apprentices (everyone who comes here has a job) are getting the practical training and experience they need. Kerry Featherstone, the training centre’s director, says around two-thirds of the apprentices are aged between 16 and 18 and work for a wide variety of firms. “They range from local employers that might have five people working for them right up to companies like Rolls Royce.” Apprentice: Heidi Butterfield, 19, in the robotics room at the AMRC Training Centre. (Pictures: Scott Merrylees). The fact there’s such growing interest in apprenticeships shows just how far attitudes have changed. Even just a decade ago they were sniffily seen as the poor relation next to university degrees, but now they are increasingly being recognised as a mark of excellence with businesses, big and small, queueing up to take on apprentices. The Government has jumped on the bandwagon setting a target of three million apprenticeships by 2020 which is good news for training centres like this. “The perception has changed, we are hearing more about things like degree apprenticeships and this is getting out to young people and parents. Schools are talking about them more as an option whereas in the past they wanted pupils to go on to university,” says Featherstone. However, one area of concern is the lack of female apprentices in the UK, especially in engineering, which was highlighted in a report by the Young Women’s Trust last year. The training centre's director Kerry Featherstone. At the AMRC training centre there’s just four female apprentices, something Featherstone wants to change. “We’d love to get more women into engineering but it’s going to take time to change the perception though we are starting to see more slowly coming through, and that’s positive because it means we are having an impact. “At the moment the girls that come into engineering often have family connections and we need to break down those barriers and get the message out there to a wider audience.” Heidi Butterfield, from Wakefield, is one of the female apprentices training here. The 19- year-old is following in the footsteps of her father who started out as an apprentice. “In school there wasn’t much opportunity to get into engineering, especially for girls, but it was something I was interested in,” she says. Heidi’s spending six months at the centre as a technical support apprentice before returning to her job with manufacturing firm Kostal UK. “What we’re doing is very much about the future of technology. There’ll always be a need for machining and welding but in years to come it will be more about robotics and 3D printing and for us it’s exciting,” she says. Katy Foster, 16, is also a technical support apprentice and has a job with Sheffield-based machine manufacturers DavyMarkham. “I wanted to do something that was hands-on but apprenticeships weren’t really talked about as an option at school. It was only because my form tutor was an ex-engineer herself and she encouraged me to come here,” Katy explains. “When we get school visits we tell the girls that it’s fun and there’s as much opportunity, if not more, as there is for the lads. I think the more schools come here and the more pupils know about the place, the more young people are likely to want to be an engineer.” Many of the apprentices, like 18- year-old Ben Kaye, have some family connection. “My granddad used to be a patternmaker so I’ve always been around engineering and as a kid I loved getting Meccano sets,” he says. Ben, from Sheffield, is a manufacturing apprentice and says he opted to come here rather than going to university. “I did engineering at college and I wanted to go to uni but the money aspect and the amount of debt put me off that. “I want to earn money as well as learn. My goal is go to uni but later in life. I want to use engineering to travel and see places around the world because the skills you learn here are transferable wherever you go.” He disagrees with those who say that apprenticeships are an easy option. “It’s different to a college, it’s a workplace. You’re getting paid while you’re here so you need to be on time. You can have a bit of banter but you’ve also got to get on with your work,” he says. “At school if you got stuck with something the teacher would help you or give you a textbook. But here if you say to a trainer ‘what am I doing wrong?’ They’ll make you work it out for yourself, which is good because that way you learn how to fix things.” At 23, Kieran Bartholomew is a bit older than most of the other apprentices. “I didn’t really know what I wanted to do when I was at school and after I left I did a couple of rubbish jobs in supermarkets and call centres to pay my way. But I knuckled down and came here and I’m finally doing something I want to do.” Kieran, from Rotherham, works for a Hoyland-based firm and believes apprenticeships can give you an edge when it comes to getting a job. “At college they teach you how to be good at a certain job, whereas here you learn how to be good at that job but you also learn how to behave in a workplace environment and the work ethic you need to be successful – so you get the best of both worlds.” Spotlight on apprenticeships It’s National Apprenticeship Week (March 6-10) and a chance to put the spotlight on apprentices working in a range of different industries. But it’s also raises questions about apprenticeships themselves. The Government has set a target of three million apprenticeships by 2020 and is introducing a levy, due to come into force in April, on employers to fund it. Most experts agree that there is a need for better vocational training in this country – and the Government’s industrial strategy has emphasised the need to improve technical education. However, in a report published earlier this year, the Institute for Fiscal Studies questioned how much extra earnings could be generated by the proposed investment in apprentices.

Boeing Suing Denmark Over Fighter Jets It Did Not Buy © AFP 2016/ POOL / Kim Hong-Ji Military & Intelligence 10:21 06.03.2017Get short URL 56948146 Last year, Denmark's quest for updating its air force turned into a thriller. Even if the Nordic kingdom after long deliberations and hot debates settled for the F-35 as a replacement for its ageing fighter jet fleet, some of the contenders are still reluctant to admit their defeat. © Flickr/ US Air Force Technical Foul: Denmark Omits Important Data to Secure F-35 DealUS aircraft manufacturer Boeing, whose Danish bid lost to fellow aircraft producer Lockheed Martin, is suing the Danish government, Danish TV-channel TV2 reported. According to a statement by the Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer, it filed the legal action against Danish Defense officials because it wants to see the documents that compelled the Danish government to choose Lockheed Martin's F-35 over the Super Hornet in a closely watched competition. Boeing is thus making good the threat it made when the Danish decision was announced in mid-2016. Boeing believes the Danish government's choice of Lockheed Martin's F-35 over the Super Hornet was a result of a flawed evaluation process, based on the fact that the Danish military officials have hitherto failed to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision. "For ten years we have been campaigning here in Denmark, talking about the Super Hornet's features in the Danish context. We felt good about the openness and the public discussion. But when the decision was taken in June last year, we expressed our disappointment with the reasons for the decision. Since then, the dialogue has stopped, and we feel that we now have to go to court," Boeing Vice President Tom Bell told TV2, stressing that one cannot expect the Danish decision to be overturned. © Flickr/ Airman Magazine Flying a Kite: Epic F-35 Deal Leaves Denmark Vulnerable and PennilessBoeing is currently vying to strike aircraft deals with Canada and India, and the Danish assessment may prove detrimental for Boeing's chances and financial reputation. In June 2016, Denmark finally put an end to the decade-long debate over the replacement for its current fleet of F-16s. Boeing, however, did not accept the decision to buy 27 F-35s worth 20 billion DKK ($3bln), accusing the Danish government of basing it on flawed information on the Super Hornet's cost and capabilities and thus not giving the American group a fair chance. In September 2016, Boeing submitted a request to Denmark's Defense Ministry for access to the documents used in the procurement evaluation process. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," Boeing Vice President Debbie Rub said at the time. Denmark is one of nine partner countries that are financially involved in the futuristic F-35A fighter jet's development, which may have possibly influenced the government's choice, despite the fact that the F-35 project has been long plagued by technical problems, delays and ballooning costs.   Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...

It plans to induct these four planes — part of the 27 aircraft order placed with the Boeing Inc in 2006 — between July and October this year. Currently, the national carrier has 23 B787-800 planes in the fleet besides other types of Boeing and Airbus planes. To fund the purchase of four more Boeing 787 aircraft, the airline is looking for banks and financial institutions to arrange bridge financing or short term loans for a period of 15 months. The bridge finance would be up to “USD 470 million (approximately USD 117.500 million per aircraft) for partly financing acquisition of four B787-8 aircraft,” as per an Invitation of Offer document. At the current dollar-rupee exchange rate, USD 470 million translates to little over Rs 3,100 crore. For availing the short term loan, the national carrier would provide the aircraft as security. The loan amount would be repaid after it concludes a Sale and Lease Back (SLB) arrangement. Under SLB arrangement, the seller of an asset leases it back from the purchaser for a long term. There would be no government guarantee for the loan, Air India has said in the document. According to the document, Air India has sold 21 planes of the 23 Boeing 787 aircraft that are currently in operations and took them back under SLB arrangement. The SLB of the two remaining planes, which were delivered to the airline between November 2106 and January this year, is under process. Back in 2006, as part of fleet expansion plans, Air India placed orders with Boeing for 68 aircraft — 27 Dreamliners, 15 B777-300ERs, 8 B777-200LRs and 18 B-737-800s. Of these, Boeing has already delivered 61 planes to the the airline.

They need to be. Lifting the plane with the longest range in the world take the most powerful engine in commercial aviation. To cover the ultra-long distances the Boeing 777-LR (which stands for Longer Range) must carry vast quantities of fuel. And to get a fully fuelled and passenger-laden plane of around 350 tonnes off the ground, the two GE90 engines generate close to 110,000lb of thrust or about 100,000 horsepower each. The engines are massive - close to the cabin width of a Boeing 737, weigh more than eight tonnes each and cost around $35m apiece. On a 17-hour flight between Auckland and Doha they will chug up to an estimated 170,000 litres of fuel. At takeoff thrust each engine is reportedly gobbling up to two million cubic feet of air a minute. When GE developed the engines in the 1990s just one of them was able to keep a Boeing 747 (normally a four engine plane) aloft during trials. Rocks weighing 200kg piled up behind the GE90 on the ground were tossed around like pebbles. During stationery test bed work tonnes of water, ice and dead bird carcuses were shot into trial engines to see how they reacted. The GE90 fan blade's curved design makes it larger, lighter and more aerodynamic than traditional titanium blades for reduced engine weight and lower fuel burn. Continued below. Related Content Inside the world's longest flight from Auckland to Doha Video Watch: The giant engine powering Auckland to Doha flights Northland crying out for tradies with building consents boost second-highest in New Zealand The General Electric GE90 is a family of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines. General Electric says one example of the blade from a later model even made it to New York's Museum of Modern Art in 2007, recognised for its "cutting-edge engineering, design and beauty." The Boeing 777-200LR was dubbed the "Worldliner" during its development in the 1990s and established a world record flight of 21,601km between Hong Kong and flying eastbound across the North Pacific Ocean, across North America and then over the Atlantic to London. The 14,535km scheduled flights of around 17 hours northbound to Doha are a bit of a hop compared to the 2005 marathon. The 35 passengers on that trial flight were on board for 22 hours and 42 minutes. General Electric is now developing a new engine for the next model Boeing 777s, the 777-8, a bigger plane capable of flying 16,110km with up to 375 passengers on board. • Aviation writer Grant Bradley will travel on Qatar Airways' longest flight this week.

Picture by Andrew Parsons / i-Images 00:01 Monday 06 March 2017 0 Have your say Boeing, McLaren and now Sheffield tech stars The Floow have announced deals set to pump millions into the city, prompting the Prime Minister to write exclusively for The Star Sheffield can help power a new engineering revolution for the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street, London. Photo credit Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire I know Star readers will be delighted after the spectacular successes of luring McLaren and Boeing investments to South Yorkshire in a matter of weeks. And I want the model being pioneered in the city to be copied across the country. Combining the research expertise of Sheffield University with the craftsmanship and skill of the city’s workforce, along with the drive of local leaders, has created the backdrop to the multi-million pound deals struck with two of the world’s most famous engineering names. It is this ambition and determination that is allowing the world’s first Steel City to forge a new identity. The city’s potential for cutting edge technology and engineering clearly hasn’t been lost on international investors. And it’s not just McLaren and Boeing who have spotted it. Today’s announcement of a £13m investment into Sheffield’s thriving tech sector by three firms, including foreign investors, demonstrates the faith they have in the future of Sheffield. It’s great news for The Floow, which will be able to use the cash to double its workforce and carry on expanding the cutting-edge car safety technology that has seen it create 70 high skilled jobs in the city. But it’s also great news for the rest of Sheffield, as it clearly shows that the city is open for business. McLaren will generate about £100m for the area and create more than 200 highly skilled jobs by 2020. They’ll also be investing in science and research, which is a key target for my government. While Boeing’s plans for a civil aerospace factory mark another £20m of investment. Attracting one of the world’s most famous car brands and one of the leading names in aerospace to Sheffield were deals built on the city pooling its skills and working together. I want to see the prosperity that areas like London and the South East have enjoyed replicated across the country. That means developing and supporting key sectors to inspire an economic revival in places like South Yorkshire, and all our great regions and cities. In providing this support, I will also ask that cities do everything they can to play their part. I’m pleased to say Sheffield is doing that already.

Screen Rant You Are Reading: 15 Things You Never Knew About Bill Nye The Science Guy Share On Facebook Comments (1) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next 127 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment 15 Things You Never Knew About Bill Nye The Science Guy By Jennica Lynn 03.05.2017 1 Comment 127 Shares ShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment Bill, Bill, Bill… Bill Nye The Science Guy was a staple in every ’90s kid’s primary education. The exceptionally brainy kids even made it a part of their regular after-school television viewing schedule. Whenever there was a day with a substitute teacher in science class, it was guaranteed that there would be an episode of Bill Nye The Science Guy or The Magic School Bus… but, c’mon, Bill Nye was way cooler than Ms. Frizzle. And unlike Ms. Frizzle, Bill Nye remained in the media long after the beloved show came to an end. Nye has made a name for himself since as an environmentalist, space enthusiast, and a master debater of creationism. But like any organism, The Science Guy has many layers and there is more than meets the eye. After placing Bill Nye under the proverbial microscope, here are the 15 Things You Never Knew About Bill Nye The Science Guy. 15. He Got His Nickname (“The Science Guy”) From The Television Show Almost Live! Long before Bill Nye had his own show, he was an engineer and a writer/actor on the Seattle-based sketch comedy show Almost Live! in the ’80s and ’90s. Like MAD TV and Saturday Night Live, Almost Live! featured the same actors in various roles, performing improv scenes related to social issues of the time. Knowing that Nye was a super science genius outside of his nightly thespian routine, Almost Live! creator Ross Shafer convinced Nye to take on a new role as “The Science Guy” in a recurring six-minute skit in which Nye would perform scientific experiments. When Bill Nye wasn’t wearing a lab coat on the show, he was sporting hot pants and fighting crime as Speed Walker, a super hero who just walks really fast. Scientists are not exactly known for having a creative brain or a sense of humor but Bill Nye has dedicated his life to splitting atoms and bending the rules. 14. He Won A Steve Martin Lookalike Contest As seen in his skits on Almost Live!, Bill Nye is a man of many talents in both science and entertainment. But before his acting career had completely taken off, he was a young engineer who happened to do accurate impressions of Steve Martin. Shortly after finishing college and still residing in Seattle, Nye decided to enter a Steve Martin lookalike contest hosted by Warner Brothers Records. He won the Seattle regional round of the contest but he failed to move on to the nationals. However, Bill Nye’s success as an impersonator of a comedic icon earned him so many cool points around town that people began asking him to perform his Steve Martin routine at parties and social gatherings. When Nye took notice of the reactions that he received from being Steve Martin, he fell in love with comedy and became inspired to combine laughs and learning into a career. 13. Bill Nye Has Written Several Children’s Books In addition to screenwriting, acting, and basically being one of the smartest men alive, Bill Nye has continued to make science a rad point of interest for kids in his numerous children’s books. And of course he writes all of these fun educational masterpieces under the name, “The Science Guy.” Kids can get in the spirit of science with some of Nye’s most highly rated books on Amazon. In Bill Nye The Science Guy’s Big Blast of Science, kids can take matter into their own hands as Nye covers everything from gravity to radioactivity and provides a wide array of ideas for class projects for the budding scientist. Nye also encourages young minds to become germaphobes– or at least to embrace the good kinds of germs– in his popular book Bill Nye The Science Guy’s Great Big Book of Tiny Germs. Another children’s favorite is Bill Nye The Science Guy’s Consider the Following: A Way Cool Set of Science Questions, Answers, and Ideas to Ponder, which is reminiscent of his hit ’90s TV show. 12. Bill Nye Invented Specialized Ballet Slippers Unsurprisingly, Bill Nye’s name is attached to many patents in the United States. However, perhaps the most unusual patent that Nye holds is for the invention of specialized type of ballet pointe shoes that he likes to call “toe shoes.” Ballet pointe shoes are exactly as they sound. They are the silky baby pink slippers that appear comfortable in theory until you’re spending hours plié-ing across a dance floor. Professional ballerinas are notorious for suffering from damage to their feet and ankles due to the great amount of weight forced onto these parts of their bodies. However, Nye’s newly designed apparatus is built to provide better support for a ballerina’s feet, toes, and ankles as opposed to previous contraptions. More specifically, Nye inserted a padded box-shaped toe ridge in the traditional slippers and added upper and outer soles. Thanks to Bill Nye, there are ballerinas everywhere doing a happy dance in comfort. 11. He Was Rejected By NASA Four Times It’s no mystery that Bill Nye is a bonafide space nut. He played a key role in the construction of a tiny sundial that was implemented in the Mars Exploration Rover missions. Nye was also the CEO of The Planetary Society for five years and is the face of a regular exhibit at the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland, CA. Despite all of these endeavors, Bill Nye has never been launched into outer space… and he’s applied to NASA four times. On top of being a world renowned promoter of space exploration, The Science Guy is also rather athletic and has proven that he can bypass motion sickness unlike many other potential astronauts. So, what is NASA’s deal? In an interview at AOL headquarters, Bill Nye half-jokingly said that the first question NASA asks is “How many Ph.Ds do you have?” Nye may be one of the most celebrated eggheads alive, but he still only holds a Bachelor of Science degree. 10. His First Starring Role Was In A Boeing Training Video After receiving his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the prestigious Cornell University, Bill Nye moved to the Northwest, where he began his career working as an engineer for Boeing. Not only did Nye assist in the development of a tube thingy for a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor on the Boeing 747 (don’t worry, most people don’t have a clue what this is either), he also starred in a number of training videos for the company. Yes, before he was Bill Nye The Science Guy, he was “Bill Nye The Airplane Guy.” It is possible that these training videos are what caused Nye to be bitten by the acting bug. In fact, as he expanded his career to include comedy with Almost Live!, he even performed in a parody video on the TV show in which he poked fun at Boeing contract negotiations and the workload distribution among Boeing employees. 9. Bill Nye Was The Inspiration For The Television Show Numb3rs Bill Nye has encouraged many movements in the realm of science and space exploration, but he has also been an inspiration in the entertainment industry. Specifically, Nye inspired Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton in creating the series Numb3rs. The TV show, which stretched across six seasons, followed a mathematician who helped the FBI solve crime investigations using complex math equations. Nye himself was unaware that he had such an influence on the show until he read an interview with Heuton in Wired Magazine. And then he witnessed his affect on the creators firsthand. After his conversation with Heuton and Falacci about sundials, the duo incorporated the newly learned information into an episode of the show in which the precise location of a basketball goal needed to located. In addition to inspiring entire episodes of the show, The Science Guy has also appeared on the show as an engineering professor and combustion expert, which is not a big stretch from his real life. 8. Bill Nye Created An iPad Game That You Will Never Get To Play All work and no play make Bill a dull boy… so he decided to design a game for the iPad. Fascinated by the concept of flight, Bill Nye partnered up with Gamedesk in 2012 to create AERO 3D. This particular game was specially crafted to teach young children about aerodynamics through animated birds. Gamedesk had already prepared a prototype of AERO 3D through their own partnership with Iridescent Learning and contributions from the National Academy of Sciences and the Office of Naval Research. However, it was up to The Science Guy to reel in the remainder of the funding as well as publicity. So, Bill Nye did what anyone with a bright idea would do: he began a Kickstarter campaign. Nye believes that the best way to teach blossoming minds is through experience and having the point of view of a bird may be the closest that they will ever come to experiencing the physics of flight. Unfortunately, Bill Nye had a learning experience of his own as his project went unfunded, only raising $31,528 out of $100,000. 7. Bill Nye Is Competitive About His Carbon Footprint Most competitive neighbors will buy a fancy car or order the most high-tech flat screen TV, but not Bill Nye. This wizard of science started a friendly cold war with his carbon footprint. Bill Nye has been in a longstanding competition with his Los Angeles neighbor Ed Begley, Jr. to have the lowest carbon footprint. The wager between the two famous environmentalist super nerds began the day after Nye moved to the neighborhood and they have been modifying their homes and lifestyles accordingly for about a decade now. Nye didn’t hesitate to amp up his game by starting a vegetable garden, ordering solar panels– and then came the rain barrels for recycled water (how he pulled off recycled water during the California drought is puzzling, but good job, Bill). The true rivalry between these green machines is believed to have ignited during the filming of an episode of Living With Ed, Begley’s short-lived series about leading an environmentally conscious life. Nye claims that Begley became jealous of the features on his solar panels. That’s so LA. 6. Bill Nye Played Ultimate Frisbee In College If movies and television have driven anything home about science geeks, it’s that they are notorious for being weak and bad at sports. Once again, Bill Nye defies the laws of nature as he is actually quite the athlete. As can be seen from episodes of Bill Nye The Science Guy, Nye is a huge baseball fan. However, this is not his go-to physical activity. Growing up in Washington, D.C., Bill Nye often played frisbee football with his friends and then went on to play ultimate frisbee at Cornell University. After college, Nye became the founder and captain of the first ever men’s ultimate frisbee team in Seattle, which he called the Olympic Windjammers. Bill Nye was a natural at the sport and he is credited as taking part in the early years of the ultimate frisbee rivalry between Seattle and Portland. The Olympic Windjammers traveled to games near and far, occasionally flying on private planes piloted by Nye’s buddies at Boeing. Ultimate frisbee may sound like a goofy sport, but don’t be fooled. The brutality earned Nye a broken nose and a dislocated shoulder that has never fully healed. 5. He’s Technically Never Been Married Bill Nye has a glowing record of successfully predicting experimental outcomes, but such was not the case in his romantic life. In 2005, Nye experienced the rare chemical reaction that is often referred to as love and within five months’ time he was married– or so he thought– to musician, motivational speaker, and author Blair Tindall. Seven weeks after the wedding, Bill Nye left when he received notice from the State of California stating that his marriage to Tindall was invalid. Neither Nye nor Tindall have ever revealed the reason for the invalidity. Of course, like all celebrity couples gone splitsville, the break was not clean. Bill Nye later slapped a restraining order on his “ex-wife” after she had sprayed a toxic chemical on his vegetable garden and fled on foot. Tindall insists that the chemical was merely weed killer. Still, that must have done a number on his carbon footprint competition. 4. Bill Nye Loves Swing Dancing Aside from attempting to save the planet at every opportunity and getting down and dirty on the frisbee field, Bill Nye likes to literally get his kicks on the dance floor, as he is an active swing dancer. In 2013, The Science Guy had the honor to bust a move on the hit TV series Dancing With The Stars with newbie partner Tyne Stecklein. The dance duo swept the floor with numbers to Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky,” Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 5”, and appropriately Oingo Boingo’s “Weird Science.” Unfortunately, they were quickly eliminated from the contest after Nye suffered an injury to a tendon. But that hasn’t kept this jumpin’, jivin’ dance-a-holic from getting back on his feet. Being a man of science, of course, Bill Nye has also advised that there are many health benefits associated with swing dancing. Not only does it make men popular with the ladies, but it also maintains physical fitness and helps keep dementia at bay. 3. Bill Nye Got His Own Show Because Of The Back To The Future TV Series Shortly before The Science Guy became head scientist of his own show, he played assistant to Doc Brown on the live-action Back to the Future TV series from 1991 to 1993. The show followed the adventures of Doc Brown, his family, and his trusted companion Marty McFly. Nye had a recurring role on the show in educational segments in which he would give actual scientific demonstrations in a laboratory while Christopher Lloyd would explain the process. Holding on tightly to his famed nickname, Bill Nye was once again only known as “The Science Guy.” In the three years that Nye worked alongside Lloyd, he built everything from a hot air balloon, to an electromagnet, to a car battery charger using a lemon. The segments featuring The Science Guy reached national popularity in the early ’90s and led to Bill, Bill Bill… hosting his own educational TV show, making Bill Nye The Science Guy a household name. 2. Bill Nye Is A Talented Chef When Bill Nye is hard at work, chemicals are not the only things that he can be found mixing together. As it turns out, Nye is also a crafty cook in the kitchen. After all, putting together a fine meal is all a matter of science in its simplest form… and The Science Guy is quick to turn a culinary experience into an experimental equation complete with a hypothesis as well as dependent and independent variables. For instance, Nye once conducted an experiment for PBS Learning Media to determine whether water boils faster in a pot that is either covered or uncovered. Always eager to give a science lesson, Bill Nye was able turn a pasta recipe into a discussion on energy conservation. Outside of the laboratory, Nye enjoys the leisure of wining and dining guests in both his New York City and Los Angeles homes, his specialties being spinach pizza and salmon. 1. Bill Nye Is Not The Only Brainiac In His Family Bill Nye may be the only famous prodigy in his family, but he had to inherit his gifted mind from someone, right? Skipping the nature versus nurture debate, let’s just say that The Science Guy may have his brainy mother to thank for at least a fraction of his intelligence. Bill’s mother, Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, was a codebreaker during World War II. Jenkins-Nye was studying math and psychology at Goucher College when she was recruited by the U.S. Navy to assist them in decoding cryptic messages used by the Japanese and Germans. But she isn’t the only genius relative in the Jenkins-Nye family tree. Bill Nye’s maternal grandfather was also quite the smarty-pants, as he worked as a professor of chemistry at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. Bill Nye The Science Guy attributes much of his knowledge and success to his family, especially his mother. She even taught him how to make their family’s famous salad dressing, which he has described as being “pure chemistry.” — Did you learn anything new about Bill Nye the Science Guy?

(AFP) Customers asking for - if not demanding - value propositions Against a backdrop of new aeroplane programmes, growing passenger traffic globally, low commodity prices and political uncertainties, the aerospace and defence industry is going through significant changes, particularly in the Middle East. The industry is facing a range of challenges to address environmental and regulatory issues, and an increased dependence on a global supply chain. The network of organisations - including suppliers, distributors, customers, competitors, government agencies and so on - involved in the delivery of passenger jets, defence products and weapons systems are facing these tremendous challenges both at home and abroad through competition and limited resources. Supporting the industry's evolution are countries that are trying to build indigenous aerospace capabilities in exchange for access to markets to help grow economies, gain technologies, provide employment opportunities and eventually to compete on the world marketplace. In barely a decade, the UAE has emerged as a regional leader in aerospace. Leveraging its booming airline and airport companies, the UAE has expanded into manufacturing and servicing aeroplane components, gaining partnerships with the world's biggest aviation players. For example, Mubadala has been supporting the development of a sustainable aerospace industry for Abu Dhabi, forming partnerships and initiating investments with leading companies like Boeing, Lockheed, GE and others. Additionally, exciting opportunities are emerging to create "aerospace ecosystems". In the UAE, you are starting to see Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)-related industries beginning to flourish. To support Stem activities at a grassroots level and help secure the future of science and technology, Boeing has supported many initiatives including research and development, teacher training, primary and secondary school design challenges, internships, mentorship programmes and chartable grants to UAE's top engineering schools. One example is the Boeing-Mubadala Co-Op internship programme, which provides vital aerospace engineering expertise to bolster the UAE's ever-expanding aviation capabilities. Launched in 2015, the programme aims to support the development of a sustainable aerospace industry in the UAE. Customers are asking for - if not demanding - value propositions that include education and training programmes, skills development, technology transfer, industrial partnerships and relationships that provide products and services for the entire product life cycle to keep it relevant for decades. Time and time again, success in aerospace and defence manufacturing compliments efforts in other areas of development and adds to capabilities. Pioneering roles in scientific research and development contribute to building new technologies and capabilities to lay the groundwork for manufacturing, economic growth and employment. Boeing has a number of technical support centres for its customers, industrial and academic partnerships and Boeing's Global Corporate Citizenship programme connects us to community organisations through charitable and business investments and support. Boeing's plan is to continue to expand our presence in the region through partnerships, organic growth and through support to build in-country capabilities. Boeing supports knowledge and technology transfer and investment in the region's human capital. We are committed to partnerships that support regional plans for economic diversification and to become aerospace hubs. We believe in the power of partnerships and leveraging local knowledge to be successful in the market. We are committed to providing the Middle East with key partnership and aerospace development opportunities, and we work closely with Arab governments and defence forces to take a key role in enhancing safety and security in the region. By working together, we can build the aerospace ecosystem for the region. The writer is president of Boeing Middle East, North Africa and Turkey.

Photograph: Mike Elk for the Guardian Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Mike Elk in Canton, Mississippi Sunday 5 March 2017 17.30 EST First published on Sunday 5 March 2017 11.48 EST For a mile outside Canton Multipurpose Complex on Saturday, the road was backed up. Many cars sported bumper stickers, pro-Bernie and pro-union. 'I was naive': after losing healthcare battle, factory workers fear next blow Read more They came in school buses, hot rods, church vans and motorcycles, with license plates from Missouri, Texas, North Carolina, Illinois and Pennsylvania. A delegation of a dozen Nissan workers even came from Brazil, to support United Automobile Workers (UAW) activists who have faced illegal retaliation in a 13-year struggle to unionize the Japanese giant’s 5,000 workers in Mississippi. “I feel their pain because we have been through the same thing with Mercedes,” said Kirk Garner of Vance, Alabama, who has been part of the decade-long UAW effort to unionize there. Two weeks after the defeat of the Machinists Union at Boeing in South Carolina, an estimated 5,000 southern union activists gathered in Canton to lay the foundation of what they hope will be the large-scale community movements necessary to defeat anti-union forces nationwide – and in the White House. Community support is proving essential for union drives, as companies use politicians and expensive media buys to counter such campaigns. In South Carolina, Boeing spent $485,000 on TV ads and politicians warned that a successful union drive would discourage other companies from moving to the region. In 2014, anti-union forces used a similar strategy to defeat a high-profile attempt to unionize Volkswagen in Chattanooga. In Mississippi, as the UAW seeks a vote, Nissan has begun airing its own anti-union ads this week. The UAW claims that the company has told staff that if they unionize, the plant will move to Mexico. The company has denied the charge. In an email to the Guardian on Sunday, the Nissan corporate communications manager Parul Bajaj said “the allegations made by the union are totally false” and accused the UAW of a “campaign to pressure the company into recognizing a union, even without employee support”. High-profile company ad campaigns can turn communities against unions. Workers often face not just intimidation from their bosses but also peer pressure from friends and neighbors, who warn of harm to the local economy. “I don’t think the pressure was as intense as it is now,” said GM worker John W Hill Jr, who was part of the first successful UAW effort to unionize workers in the south, 41 years ago at a GM plant in Monroe, Louisiana. “In 1976, there wasn’t the harsh anti-union sentiment that is so prevalent over the country right now … We didn’t have all the politicians and everybody against us. “I hope whenever the [Nissan] election is that they vote yes. But deep down inside, I think there is so much fear here and disconnect that I just don’t think [they will].” Hill was interrupted by a Nissan worker with a toddler on his shoulders: “Nah, man, we got this, we got this. We are gonna beat them.” As they marched on the plant on an unusually warm March day, workers sang: “We are ready, we are ready, we are ready, Nissan.” They have organized a community coalition, the Mississippi Alliance for Fairness at Nissan, that includes #BlackLivesMatter activists, church groups, the Sierra Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The coalition is calling for a mobilization not seen in the south since the civil rights movement of the 1960s. More than 80% of Nissan’s workers in Canton are black. A win at Nissan could be a game-changer. On Saturday, they had a guest speaker. “If we can win here at Nissan, you will give a tremendous bolt of confidence to working people all over this country,” Bernie Sanders told a crowd of 5,000. “If you can stand up to a powerful multinational corporation in Canton, Mississippi, workers all over this country will say, ‘We can do it, too.’” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders speaks at the March on Mississippi for workers’ rights in Canton. Photograph: Rogelio V. Solis/AP ‘We know a union could help’ Out of 43 of Nissan plants worldwide, 40 are unionized. The only plants that are not are the one in Canton, Mississippi and two in Tennessee. Workers say the lack of a union makes a difference. Bajaj said Nissan “respects and supports” employees’ decisions about who represents them. Many employees in Canton say they make less than $15 an hour, with starting wages for some at $13.46 an hour. Workers say they make $2 less each hour than those in Smyrna, where Nissan faces competition from unionized GM factories. Bajaj countered that the company’s “hourly wages are significantly above the average central [Mississippi] production wage of $16.70 per hour”. Many Canton workers also say they are forced to work for years as temporary employees and complain that they are denied vacation, only allowed to take time off in the last week of June and the first week of July – when the plant shuts down. Without a union, they say, workers are often forced to work in unsafe conditions. Since 2008, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) has cited Canton facilities six times. In February, Osha issued a citation for a failure to have proper safety lights indicating when machines were on and for not instructing workers to turn off machines before fixing them. “I had to call [Osha] twice in the past month,” said Karen Camp, who works in the paint shop. “You couldn’t see 10ft in front of your face because of the ventilation problems. We know a union could help fix it.” In his email, Bajaj said: “The safety and well-being of our employees is always our top priority. We dedicate extensive time and resources to safety programs and training at the plant.” The Canton plant, she added, “has a safety record that is significantly better than the national average for automotive plants”, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Workers say Nissan has fought the union every step of the way. In 2015, the National Labor Relations Board charged that the company and its temporary employee agency provider, Kelly Services, violated workers’ rights, with one manager threatening to close the plant if it went union. Nissan has said it is defending against the charge. Workers say the company routinely imposes one-on-one meetings, where they are questioned about their views on unionization and have their work histories reviewed. Some say those who support the union are routinely denied promotion. Others say pro-union workers have been unfairly let go. In March 2014, a 43-year-old pro-UAW Nissan worker, Calvin Moore, who had worked in the plant since 2004, was fired. Many workers began to protest. The actor Danny Glover, a supporter of Nissan workers who was also present at Saturday’s march, with NAACP president Cornell William Brooks, called a press conference to denounce the firing. Students from Jackson State and Tougaloo College engaged in civil disobedience at Nissan headquarters. Workers in Brazil organized protests in solidarity. Three months later, Moore was hired again. The win put wind in the union’s sails. “It bolstered people’s spirits,” Moore said on Saturday. “To be honest, people were happier for me than I was for myself.” Moore said community support and events, such as the March on Mississippi, were key to winning support among coworkers. “We have had a lot of non-union workers who have changed their mind about the UAW,” he said. “Events like this should help us get more support, especially when people see this on TV.” ‘If there was ever a movement to be lead’ High-profile labor efforts could prove crucial not just to unions in the coming months and years, but also to Democratic attempts to win back Congress and the White House. Last year, Donald Trump won the largest share of union voters for a Republican since 1984. He has since focused on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US. However, with many of these new jobs being temporary, Democrats feel they can win union voters back by focusing on how to improve such jobs. Such a strategy, if successful, may not just to win back blue-collar voters. It could also help soften racial tensions that have spread among manufacturing workers. With Republicans fighting unionization nationwide, the incoming Democratic National Committee chair, Tom Perez – who was labor secretary under Barack Obama – has signaled that he intends to focus on supporting efforts to unionize. In Canton, workers said their efforts could provide a model for the progressive movement in the age of Trump. “If there was ever a movement to be led,” said Mississippi NAACP president Derrick Johnson, “it would be led out of Mississippi, because we have always lead the movement.” Mike Elk is a member of the Washington-Baltimore NewsGuild.

He thinks it's overbought, because it has significantly outperformed the market and the sector, which hasn't been the case in the past. Worth added that the stock is also trading significantly above its 150-day moving average, which has happened only four times in its history. Every time it has been this high above the 150-day moving average, the stock pulled back. Worth thinks it's going to trade lower again and he would sell the stock. Mike Khouw believes Boeing could have some fundamental problems, too. He explained that deliveries of Boeing 777 are going to slow down and there is also more competition in smaller airplanes segment. To make a bearish bet, Khouw wants to sell the April 180/190 call spread for a total credit of $4.30. The trade starts to lose money above $184.30 or 1.16 percent above the current market price. If Boeing Co trades below $180 at the April expiration, Khouw is going to collect $4.30, which is his maximal profit.

That satellite is based on a bus similar to one that an unnamed government agency, perhaps the NRO, is offering to NASA. Credit: NASA WASHINGTON — NASA is soliciting concepts for payloads that could fly on a mysterious satellite it is in discussions to inherit from another government agency. NASA issued a request for information (RFI) Feb. 15 for a proposed spacecraft called the NASA Science/Technology Platform Satellite, or NSTP-Sat. The RFI was the first time NASA had publicly discussed such a mission. The RFI, issued by NASA's science mission directorate, solicits ideas for payloads, including remote sensing instruments and technology demonstrations, which could fly on the spacecraft. The RFI offered few details about the proposed mission, noting NSTP-Sat could fly "to low Earth orbit, geostationary equatorial orbit, medium Earth orbit, Earth-Moon L1, or lunar orbit in the 2021 timeframe." The RFI, which remains open until March 17, seeks ideas for how this spacecraft could be used to meet NASA's science and technology development goals. The RFI states that NASA will use the responses to determine "whether there are science opportunities for new uses of this spacecraft" and "whether a solicitation for proposals is warranted to enable such opportunities." [Satellite Quiz: What's Up There?] The RFI offered few details about the spacecraft itself. "The NSTP-Sat is a spacecraft platform that has become available to NASA as excess Government property through an interagency agreement," it stated. It added the spacecraft was a "Boeing GEO spinner bus" that could launch on an EELV-class rocket or as a secondary payload on a Space Launch System mission. NASA and other organizations involved with NSTP-Sat have been reticent to provide additional details about how NASA gained access to the satellite bus. Alan Zide, a program executive in NASA's heliophysics division and the point of contact listed in the RFI, did not respond to email messages with questions about the satellite. A diagram of the satellite bus being offered to NASA from the NASA RFI issued in February. Credit: NASA NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown said March 1 that NASA is in discussions with the U.S. Air Force to obtain the bus. "NASA and the U.S. Air Force (USAF) are in discussions concerning the transfer of a satellite bus that the USAF has determined does not meet current or projected Air Force mission requirements," he said. U.S. Air Force spokeswoman Capt. AnnMarie Annicelli said March 2 she was not familiar with the satellite and was looking into it, but has not provided any additional information. When asked who the original customer was for this Boeing-built satellite, Addrian Brooks, a spokesman for Boeing Network and Space Systems, said March 2 that the company was "unable to disclose this information." Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who specializes in space history, notes the dimensions for the satellite provided in the RFI are consistent with two versions of satellites built by Hughes Space and Communications. One, the HS-389, was used for the Intelsat 6 series of satellites, while the HS-393 was sold to other commercial customers. Those satellites were built and launched in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Boeing acquired Hughes Space and Communications in 2000. The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), he noted, is thought to have used the same bus for a series of data relay satellites operating under the code name QUASAR, also known as the Satellite Data System (SDS). Four such satellites launched from 1989 through 1996. Spin-stabilized satellites have fallen out of favor, having been replaced by three-axis stabilized satellites. The last Boeing-built commercial spin-stabilized satellite, a Boeing 376 spacecraft called e-BIRD, launched in 2003. McDowell said a later generation of QUASAR satellites, launched from 1998 to as recently as 2014, were also assumed to be three-axis stabilized. However, he noted there’s little known about this series of satellites, leaving open the possibility it also used the same bus as the earlier spacecraft. "It's possible that some other NRO program also used this bus, but QUASAR/SDS is definitely the most likely," he said in a March 3 email. If the satellite in question is indeed from the NRO, it would not be the first time NASA inherited spare hardware from that intelligence agency. In 2012, NASA announced it was taking possession of two 2.4-meter mirror assemblies from the NRO. The mirrors were reportedly built for NRO's Future Imagery Architecture program, and became surplus when the NRO cancelled the optical portion of that program in the mid-2000s. NASA, after taking possession of the mirrors, solicited ideas from the scientific community on how to use what it called Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets. NASA decided to use one of the mirrors for the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), which originally planned to build a much smaller mirror. WFIRST is planned for launch in the mid-2020s.

First operational in 2016, the Y-20 military transport is now the largest such aircraft in production in the world. Roughly the size of the Boeing C-17 Globemaster, the Y-20 is a crucial component in China’s growing ability to expand its strategic power projection capabilities. After initially expressing a need for 400 of these aircraft, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) later stated that this number was revised to 1000. AVIC began production of the AG600 seaplane in July of 2016. The AG600 is a large flying boat, capable of landing and taking off on water, or on land-based airstrips, as it has a conventional, retractable tricycle landing gear. It is similar in size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus 320 airliner, and the largest seaplane currently in production anywhere in the world. The stated role of the aircraft is search and rescue, firefighting and humanitarian relief; however, it may also be slated to supplement the Harbin SH-5 in long range anti-submarine warfare (ASW) patrols and aerial reconnaissance. This video is based on our previous military analysis entitled “China Makes Strides In Strategic Aviation“ When the Liaoning CV-16 was commissioned into service with the PLA Navy (PLAN) in 2012, its reliance on Z-18J airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) helicopters was immediately identified as a weakness. The ski-jump STOBAR operation of the Liaoning and second aircraft carrier currently under construction, cannot support the operation of a large, fixed wing AEW&C aircraft. CATOBAR operations, utilizing a steam or electromagnetic catapult are required to aid such large and heavy aircraft in taking off from aircraft carriers. Further evidence that China plans on building a third aircraft carrier that allows for CATOBAR operations are the discovery of what appears to be a fixed wing AEW&C aircraft, similar in appearance to the U.S. Navy’s Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, at the Wuhan testing facility. Whether this aircraft is a prototype or a mock-up is not yet known. The large scale production of the Y-20 is a significant achievement of China’s state owned aviation industry, and forecasts China’s growing desire for a robust strategic airlift capability. Not only can the Y-20 transport a large amount of cargo or troops over a great distance, but it can even transport main battle tanks and other armored vehicles. With a maximum payload weight of 73 short tons, the Y-20 can transport the PLA’s most modern Type 99A or Type 96 MBTs, and any IFVs and APCs now in service. The aircraft has a maximum range exceeding 10,000 km (6,200 miles), and can carry a reduced payload of 40 short tons a range of 7,800 km. (4,850 miles). Range with the maximum payload of 73 short tons is approximately 4,500 km. (2,800 miles). Very similar in design, dimensions and appearance to the Boeing C-17 Globemaster and Ilyushin IL-76, the Y-20 was built to fill the roles of strategic airlift, paratroop transport, and heavy airdrop missions. It is slightly larger than the IL-76, yet smaller that a C-17. With the C-17 no longer being produced by Boeing, having halted production in 2015, the Y-20 is now the largest military transport aircraft currently in production. As China makes a concerted effort to secure its strategic interests both close to home, and as far away as the Horn of Africa, a viable strategic airlift capability is seen as essential. With a reported short takeoff ability of 700 meters, the Y-20 can supply troops and supplies to any of China’s island outposts in the South China Sea that have an airstrip, such as Woody Island, Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef or Subi Reef. Any military operations in response to territorial incursions on the part of other claimants to disputed territories in the region that required invading and occupying land would greatly depend on sufficient strategic airlift support. With tensions between China and the Philippines significantly lessened with the new Duterte administration, and cordial relations with Malaysia and Brunei, the likelihood of such a scenario has greatly reduced since last summer. The aircraft can also greatly aid the PLA in maintaining the new military base at Doraleh, Djibouti. The new military base is located just eight miles from Camp Lemonnier, the largest U.S. military facility on the continent of Africa, and will serve as a logistics base capable of supporting Chinese maritime interests in the Indian Ocean, The Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. The Japanese Self Defense Forces also operate a small logistics support center adjacent to Camp Lemonnier, and will apparently be expanding this facility in response the Chinese project. The question of Taiwan, and any future attempt to retake it by force of arms, would require a massive amphibious and airlift commitment. China lacks both at present, but as Southfront has diligently documented recently, the PLA and PLAN have greatly expanded and modernized their amphibious warfare capabilities. Any invasion of Taiwan would require not only a sizeable amphibious armada, but a substantial strategic airlift effort. The acquisition of up to a thousand Y-20s goes a long way towards building the nucleus of such a force.The development of the AG600 maritime aircraft is a case study that clearly confirms the growth of China’s aviation industry. Developed by AVIC as an amphibian aircraft meant to serve a host of civilian and military duties, although AVIC is downplaying any military role for the plane, it was designed and built in roughly two years. The Harbin SH-5, which the AG600 will replace, took a fledgling Chinese aviation industry nearly 15 years to design and produce, and only a since production run yielding 6 aircraft was the result. AVIC has received orders for 17 aircraft so far, all for the domestic market. Although the aircraft can accommodate 50 passengers, no commercial airlines have expressed interest in the design so far. It is more likely that the AG600 will be utilized by the PLAN as a long range maritime patrol aircraft. With much in common with the ShinMaywa US-2 seaplane utilized by the Japanese Maritime Self Defense forces (JMSDF), the AG600 will fill a similar role in the PLAN. The US-2 currently operates as an air-sea rescue (SAR) and maritime patrol/surveillance aircraft. It is also quite likely that the AG600 will be further developed into an anti-submarine (ASW) patrol aircraft like its predecessor the Harbin SH-5. As China strengthens its position in the South China Sea and continues to develop the defense infrastructure on a number of man-made islands, a long range SAR aircraft will be a great asset is support of PLAN and PLAAF air patrols operated from these islands. The AG-600 is equipped with retractable landing gear, and can operate from an airfield as well as from water. The reported maximum range of the AG600 is approximately 4,500 km. (2,800 miles). After decades of investing in its indigenous aviation industry, one with humble beginnings, and learning as much as possible from both Russian and U.S. aircraft design, the nation has achieved the ability to develop a real strategic airlift capability. Although still reliant on Russian aircraft  engine production to a large degree in its most modern aircraft, Chinese analogs of many other Russian designs have definitely afforded the Chinese aviation industry greater independence. The maturity of this industry in just the last decade has impressed its peers in both Russia and various Western nations. The resources and funding allocated to acquiring strategic airlift on the level expressed in official government press briefings and reported by state run media in China all communicate an obvious desire to expand the ability to both project power and respond strategically to challenges to Chinese national interests on a global scale. China is rapidly breaking free from its regional power status, and will continue to gain greater influence in global economic, political, and military spheres. China may communicate its peaceful intentions through diplomatic channels; however, it is sending a quite different message in real terms as it continues to develop and fortify its position in the South China Sea and the Horn of Africa. China is wisely seeking to protect the vital trade lanes that are its very life blood. The economic benefit from this trade has enriched the nation and helped to bring it out of an era of stagnation and subjugation to outside interests. China is once again rising to a level of global influence and importance that it has enjoyed for the overwhelming majority of its more than 5,000 years of history. It is crucial to note that over the vast majority of that same history, China has largely adopted a strategically defensive military posture, very rarely engaging in military campaigns of expansion against its neighbors. By further solidifying its position in the South China Sea, China is wisely occupying the “central position” as part of a larger defensive strategy to protect the vital trade lanes and resources that will ensure its continued prosperity. One thing is clear, China is developing the military means to defend its position as a world power and is sending a clear message to its peers that it will no longer subordinate its own national interests to those of others, regardless of their global power status. A viable aircraft carrier force and a large strategic air lift capability send a clear message to the United States and Japan, that China is determined and quite capable of securing and defending its national interests on a global scale. This increasingly assertive posture need not lead to military conflict; however, an even more assertive United States has already bristled at the possibility of relinquishing any amount of control over what it sees as its sole, global sphere of influence.

PTI Air India has 23 B787-800 planes in the fleet besides other types of Boeing and Airbus planes. Photo: Mint New Delhi: The government-owned Air India is looking to raise short-term loans worth over Rs3,000 crore to partly fund acquisition of four Boeing 787 planes. It plans to induct these four planes—part of the 27 aircraft order placed with the Boeing Inc in 2006—between July and October this year. Currently, the national airline has 23 B787-800 planes in the fleet besides other types of Boeing and Airbus planes. To fund the purchase of four more Boeing 787 aircraft, the airline is looking for banks and financial institutions to arrange bridge financing or short term loans for a period of 15 months. The bridge finance would be up to "$470 million (approximately $117.500 million per aircraft) for partly financing acquisition of four B787-8 aircraft,” as per an invitation of offer document. At the current dollar-rupee exchange rate, $470 million translates to little over Rs3,100 crore. For availing the short- term loan, the national airline would provide the aircraft as security. The loan amount would be repaid after it concludes a sale and lease back (SLB) arrangement. Under SLB arrangement, the seller of an asset leases it back from the purchaser for a long term. There would be no government guarantee for the loan, Air India has said in the document. According to the document, Air India has sold 21 planes of the 23 Boeing 787 aircraft that are currently in operations and took them back under SLB arrangement. The SLB of the two remaining planes, which were delivered to the airline between November 2106 and January this year, is under process. Back in 2006, as part of fleet expansion plans, Air India placed orders with Boeing for 68 aircraft—27 Dreamliners, 15 B777-300ERs, 8 B777-200LRs and 18 B-737-800s. Of these, Boeing has already delivered 61 planes to the airline. Apart from four B787-8s, remaining three B777-300ER are scheduled to be delivered early next year.

The company, formerly Virgin Galactic, focuses on small-satellite launch services that will be provided by LauncherOne and its Cosmic Girl carrier airplane, a modified Boeing 747 jet. Photo by Jeff Gritchen, Orange County Register/SCNG By Andrew Edwards, Press-Telegram Posted: 03/04/17, 5:36 PM PST | Updated: 1 day ago # Comments The break/meeting area at Virgin Orbit includes seats from its 747 launch airplane in Long Beach on March 3, 2017. The company, formerly Virgin Galactic, focuses on small-satellite launch services that will be provided by LauncherOne and its Cosmic Girl carrier airplane, a modified Boeing 747 jet. Photo by Jeff Gritchen, Orange County Register/SCNG Long Beach may still be a place where flying machines and other high-tech products are built, even if factories where thousands of workers assemble big jets are a relic of the past. That’s the prospect after Thursday’s announcement that a new company called Virgin Orbit would be formed to build rockets that officials hope will transform space launches into a relatively inexpensive venture. The company, however, is new in name only. The team, part of billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, had already been active in Long Beach for about two years. Virgin Group now has three companies focused on different aspects of private spaceflight, an industry where high-profile billionaires such as Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are furthering the cause of space travel as being something private enterprises, not just superpower governments, can do. Space for tech Long Beach had been home to assembly plants for such aircraft as the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III military transport jet and the Boeing 717 and Douglas DC-8 passenger jets. Earlier, Douglas Co. workers built B-17 bombers and the DC-3 passenger aircraft in Long Beach. Boeing’s C-17 plant closed in late 2015 after the assembly of its 279th and final Globemaster III. Months prior to the plant’s closure, a Wall Street Journal headline declared to the nation that Boeing’s phase out of C-17 production signified the “end of Southern California’s jet age.” Reacting to Virgin Orbit’s announcement last week, Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Randy Gordon said the company’s doing business in Long Beach helps to fulfill former Mayor Beverly O’Neill’s dream of the city becoming a place for trade, tourism and technology. “It will certainly bring new technology and prestigious names to Long Beach,” Gordon said. Gordon pointed to document imagery company Laserfiche and Epson America as previous examples of tech companies settling in Long Beach. Virgin Orbit’s headquarters is in Douglas Park, the northeast Long Beach cluster of new industrial and commercial developments on former Boeing Co. property. Mercedes-Benz USA opened its West Coast headquarters there in late 2015. And Shimadzu Precision Instruments moved its U.S. headquarters and assembly plant from Torrance to Douglas Park in the same year. Shimadzu Precision Instruments produces aircraft equipment and is the subsidiary of a Japanese firm. Advertisement “I think it’s really exciting that we’re doing this in Long Beach, on top of an area that used to produce commercial aircraft,” Galactic Ventures Chief Executive George T. Whitesides said. New markets for new tech California Employment Development Department data show Los Angeles County manufacturers employed an estimated 116,000 people in aerospace parts and product manufacturing in December 1991, the final month of the Soviet Union’s existence. As of this past January, aerospace employment in the county was nowhere near the levels of the Cold War. Some 36,200 people working in Los Angeles County had jobs in the field. Nonetheless, Virgin Orbit vice president of special projects Will Pomerantz said the local availability of talent with aerospace expertise motivated company leaders to set up shop in Long Beach. At present, Virgin Orbit has about 250 people, mostly engineers and technicians, working in Long Beach. Virgin Orbit announced its existence two years and one day after Virgin Galactic moved into a 180,000-square-foot assembly plant in eastern Long Beach. Almost all of the new company’s floor space is devoted to giving engineers and technicians a place to design, manufacture and assemble a new rocket that Virgin Orbit executives say has the potential to deliver a small payload into space at a relatively low price. “We’re not trying to fly the biggest rockets,” Pomerantz said while providing a tour of Virgin Orbit’s facility. “We’re trying to fly the most rockets, or the most affordable rockets.” Virgin Orbit’s rocket, LauncherOne, is designed to attach below the wing of a specially modified Boeing 747 jumbo jet named Cosmic Girl and to be fired like a missile into outer space while the jet is in midair at an altitude of roughly 35,000 feet. The rocket itself measures to nearly 70 feet long and can weigh some 55,000 pounds when carrying fuel and its satellite payload. Virgin Orbit’s rocket designs for LauncherOne call for two-stage rockets to be assembled from carbon composite materials. Each stage has a single engine, and Pomerantz said the launchers need to be built to withstand the stresses occurring at velocities as fast as 25 times the speed of sound. LauncherOne’s first launch into outer space may take place by year’s end, Pomerantz said. If all goes according to plan, Virgin Orbit would eventually become capable of producing 24 launch vehicles annually. The cost for a customer who wants to hire Virgin Orbit to send a small satellite into space may be about $10 million to $12 million. That’s why Pomerantz said Virgin Orbit engineers are employing proven technologies like RP-1 fuel — “it’s got a fancy name, but it’s kerosene and oxygen” — and cutting edge equipment such as a DMG Mori Lasertec 4300 3D, a machine that Pomerantz said can print 3-D rocket components that are themselves composed of various types of metal. “We are not counting on this for our first flight,” he said. “This is a science project.” Among Southern California’s spaceflight companies, there’s a lot of difference between what SpaceX and Virgin Orbit are seeking to do. Space X flies larger rockets than what Virgin Galactic aims to do with LauncherOne and has already delivered supplies to the International Space Station and made significant advances toward the development of reusable heavy rocket stages. Space X advertises a $62 million price for a customer who wants to hire a Falcon 9 to send a payload all the way into geosynchronous transfer orbit, a path through space from where it’s possible for a satellite to enter a high-earth geosynchronous orbit. A geosynchronous orbit, according to NASA, is roughly 22,000 miles above the Earth’s surface and sufficiently far enough into outer space that a communications or weather satellite can stick to a single line of longitude. In other words, the satellite’s orbit is in sync with the Earth’s rotation. Space X’s Falcon 9 has nine first-stage engines and a single-second stage engine in order to carry 18,300 pounds of payload into geosynchronous transfer orbit Virgin Orbit’s Launcher- One, by way of contrast, is designed to send a payload on the order of 1,100 pounds (and, per Pomerantz, about the size of a dishwasher or washing machine) about 124 miles above the planet’s surface, into low-Earth orbit. Satellites in low-Earth orbit are moving relative to the Earth, but can still be employed to capture images of what’s occurring on the planet’s surface, Dan Hart, the newly named company’s president, said. A large of number of satellites gathering scientific and weather data, such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, are in low-Earth orbit, according to NASA. A new frontier for future engineers Virgin Orbit is privately held, Pomerantz said. Virgin Group and Aabar Investments, of the United Arab Emirates, have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the company’s development. Private spaceflight companies such as Virgin Orbit and SpaceX are in a situation that’s analogous to aviation pioneers doing business in the first years of powered flight, said Forouzan Golshani, dean of the College of Engineering at Cal State Long Beach. “What these companies are doing is very important,” he said. “These are the brave leaders of industry that will pave the way for spaceflight being like flying from L.A. to New York,” he said. Cal State Long Beach has already established a relationship with Virgin Orbit. At least 25 graduates of the Long Beach campus work for Virgin, according to information provided by the campus. Three students interned with Virgin in summer 2016. Propulsion development engineer Nicole Lewis is among the young engineers working for Virgin Orbit. Lewis, a self-described “space nerd,” said she obtained her employment after earning a bachelor’s degree from Columbia University, where she studied mechanical engineering. She said she interned with United Launch Alliance, Boeing and Virgin before being hired in August 2015. A major aspect of her job working on the LauncherOne is helping engineers working in the propulsion, launch operations and structure groups solve design problems that require people with different areas of expertise to work together. The job involves a lot of pressure, but not in a way that gets people down, she said. “Yes, but in a way that people are able to respond to it and do a lot of good work,” Lewis said.

This gratin lyonnais (Lyon-style caramelized onion soup made with chicken stock, sherry and thyme with crouton and gruyere cheese) was prepared by chef Jim Drohman at Le Pichet on Friday, Feb. 3, 2017, in Seattle. (Johnny Andrews / TNS) By Bethany Jean Clement The Seattle Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Jim Drohman was an aerospace engineer at Boeing, but his heart wasn’t in it. When he turned his attention to cooking, it was with a highly technical, extremely thorough mind: How did the French build their classic flavors, each element of a recipe relying upon and enhancing the others? He went to the source to study, training at L’Ecole Superieur de Cuisine Francaise Jean Ferrandi in Paris, working at restaurants including Le Boudin Sauvage and the Michelin-rated Le Coq de la Maison Blanche. Upon his return, he helmed the kitchen of Seattle’s storied, much-missed Campagne. Then, in 2000, he joined forces with business partner Joanne Herron to give us the gift of the restaurant Le Pichet. Later came its sibling, Cafe Presse. When you see French onion soup on the Pichet or Presse menu – which you will every winter, until the chill is well-dispelled in April – you may rest assured that it is the product of intensive thought. Drohman eschews the common Parisian style, made with beef stock, in favor of the chicken-stock-based mode of Lyon; the lighter flavor of the latter, he maintains, better showcases the taste of the onions. You also may rest assured that it is delicious, with the simple flavors of onion and broth augmented with not just white wine, but also sherry, and garlic, and thyme, and something he and his staff call “duck Jell-O” – “the gelatin-rich duck juices that are left in the bottom of the pot when slow-cooking duck legs for confit,” an addition he says is “typical of the French bistro kitchen, where nothing tasty is ever allowed to go to waste.” Unless you’re making duck confit at home, your version of Drohman’s soupe a l’oignon gratinee won’t be quite as rich as the bowlsful you’ll get at Le Pichet or Cafe Presse. But you’ll still have the sweet slipperiness of the caramelized onions; the bright, winey-tasting broth; the crispy-edged bread growing marvelously broth-logged; the nutty, creamy cheese pulling in strings from your spoon. And for the Seattle Times reader who wrote in search of vegetarian French onion soup, Drohman was kind enough to share the engineering behind the best vegetable stock for the job. Whichever way you decide to make it – or if you decide to let Le Pichet or Cafe Presse do the honors – this is a soup that will keep you warm until spring is really, truly here, year after year. Jim Drohman’s Soupe a l’Oignon Gratinee 2 1/2 pounds yellow onions 4 cloves garlic, germ removed 1 sprig thyme 8 slices rustic country bread, preferably day-old 1/2 stick unsalted butter 1 1/2 cups sherry 3/4 cup dry white wine 1 bay leaf 2 quarts chicken stock (or vegetable broth – see below) Salt and black pepper 2 cups grated Gruyere cheese Peel the onions, and slice thinly. Slice the garlic thinly. Wash, dry and stem the thyme. Chop it finely. Bake the slices of country bread on a sheet pan in a very low oven until dry and crispy. In a large soup pot set over medium heat, sweat the onions and garlic with the butter, stirring often, until richly colored. Add the sherry, increase the heat and cook until the sherry is almost completely reduced. Add the white wine, and reduce by half. Add the thyme, bay and chicken stock, and bring to a simmer. Simmer to combine the flavors, about 20 minutes. Carefully skim the soup to remove any fat. Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into individual bowls. Top first with the crouton, then with a nice layer of Gruyere cheese. Heat under the broiler until crusty and golden. Serve immediately. Yield: 8 servings Jim Drohman’s notes on vegetable broth Drohman’s recommendations for making a meat-free broth that’ll stand up to the rich flavors of his French onion soup, in his words: “Use roasted veggies. Roasting gives vegetables – especially onions and root veggies – a deeper, richer, almost nutty flavor that you just don’t get by putting the veg right in water, or even by sauteing the veggies in the pot before adding water. Here’s how to do it: Take some carrots, celery and root veggies, and scrub and rinse well, but don’t peel. Cut into about 1-inch chunks. Take your unpeeled garlic, onions and shallot, and cut in halves or quarters, again about 1 inch. Put all in a roasting pan or sheet pan. Drizzle with vegetable oil, stir well, then spread out in an even layer. Roast at 400 degrees, stirring every 15 minutes, until the veg is caramelized and golden. Put all into a stockpot, then deglaze the roasting pan with wine or water, scraping up all the roasty bits, and add the deglaze to the stock pot. Cover with cold water to 2 inches above the solids, and add herbs, bay, peppercorns, etc. Bring to a boil, skim well, reduce to a simmer and let cook about three hours (or more, if time allows). Strain. ”Dried mushrooms can add an earthiness (and, dare I say it, a certain meatiness) that would work well in onion soup. Just add a few to the above stock – say, 1 ounce for 2 gallons of water. I would use dried cepes (porcini), which give nice flavor but are much cheaper than dried morels. “For adding flavor and color to stock, a time-honored French technique is grilling your onions before adding to the pot. Basically, you cut the onion in half the fat way (not from root to stem; the other way), and place the cut side on a grill or in a saute pan without oil until it is completely blackened. Then add the onion to the stock pot.

Interim contractor support refers to an agreement wherein a service will defer an investment due to a lack of technological capabilities, such as equipment spares or technical data. Boeing is expected to complete this service for Saudi Arabia by the end of March. The modification supports U.S. foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia. The kingdom commissioned its latest batch of F-15SA fighters in late January as part of its effort to fight extremist militants in Yemen. The contract is comprised entirely of foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is the contracting activity. The F-15SA is a modified version of the F-15 Strike Eagle, an air supremacy jet designed for air-to-air combat missions. The aircraft is typically armed with a 20mm cannon in addition to air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles.

(Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global aircraft fuel cells market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 06, 2017 11:23 AM Eastern Standard Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The global aircraft fuel cells market size is projected to grow to USD 439.4 million by 2021, at a CAGR of just above 6% over the forecast period, according to Technavio’s latest report. In this report, Technavio covers the market outlook and growth prospects of the global aircraft fuel cells market for 2017-2021. Based on the type of fuel cell, the market is segmented into proton exchange member fuel cell (PEMFC), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC), and alkaline fuel cell (AFC). Fuel cells generate clean electricity by utilizing energy generated from electrochemical reactions, converting chemical energy into electrical and heat energy. Boeing was the first company to use a first fuel cell to successfully power jet propulsion. Environmental mandates encouraging the use of alternative fuels is the key driving factor for the growth of the aircraft fuel cells market. This is not only pushing for increasing adoption of fuel cells in modern aircraft but also decreasing the pressure on fossil fuels. Technavio’s research study segments the global aircraft fuel cells market into the following regions: APAC Americas EMEA APAC: largest aircraft fuel cells market segment “APAC is the leading regional segment of the aircraft fuel cells market, generating close to 54% of the overall revenue. The increasing implementation of fuel cells in aircraft in the region is driven by mandates for reduction of CO₂ emissions and steady increase in the number of aircraft,” says Avimanyu Basu, a lead analyst at Technavio for aerospace research. China, Japan, and South Korea have made massive investments towards the research, development, commercialization, and adoption of PEMFCs and hydrogen fuel cells. Also, the growing preference for air travel in the region will create an additional demand for new aircraft, which will directly impact the aircraft fuel cells market.

Americas: fastest-growing aircraft fuel cells market segment The Americas is projected to be the fastest growing regional segment, with a CAGR of 7.37% through the forecast period. The high aviation expenses and leads in technological innovations are driving the North American segment of the market. The US is the key contributor to the market segment, due to the many patents they hold and the growing number of initiatives undertaken by the government to reduce carbon emissions. Also, the region is home to some of the world's most renowned aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing, Bombardier, Gulfstream, and Embraer, which also is responsible for the impressive growth of the market segment. EMEA: government mandates and policies drives growth of market segment “The EU has introduced several mandates and policies to reduce the carbon footprint. These mandates put a limit on the usage of crude oil, with increased focus on the development and deployment of fuel cells, batteries, and alternative fuels, thereby driving the growth of the market segment,” says Avimanyu. The strong government support to the many domestic fuel cell developers in the region has propelled the demand for fuel cells in the region. Additionally, the increasing need to conserve energy has also encouraged many private players to invest in the development of fuel cell.

Close share panel Image copyright Google Image caption The Advanced Manufacturing Park on the Rotherham-Sheffield border has a Rolls Royce jet engine factory, a nuclear research centre and a Boeing aerospace facility The Prime Minister has said South Yorkshire could help "power a new engineering revolution" for the UK. Theresa May told the Sheffield Star last month's investment announcements by Boeing and McLaren were a "spectacular success" for the region. Both firms have announced facilities at the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre between Rotherham and Sheffield. Mrs May said she wants the model being pioneered in South Yorkshire to be copied across the country. She told The Star: "Attracting one of the world's most famous car brands and one of the leading names in aerospace to Sheffield were deals built on the city pooling its skills and working together. "I want to see the prosperity that areas like London and the South East have enjoyed replicated across the country. Image caption Theresa May said South Yorkshire can "help power a new engineering revolution for the UK" "That means developing and supporting key sectors to inspire an economic revival in places like South Yorkshire, and all our great regions and cities." The Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) at Catcliffe, on the Sheffield-Rotherham border, was founded by the University of Sheffield and Boeing in 2001 on the site of the old Orgreave coking plant. It is a centre for collaborative research and now houses a nuclear research facility and a Rolls Royce jet engine factory. Sheffield tech firm The Floow has also recently announced a £13 million investment package there. In February McLaren announced plans for a £50m supercar chassis factory on the site, creating 200 jobs. Image copyright MOHD RASFAN/Getty Image caption McLaren Automotive announced plans for the £50m supercar chassis factory in February, saying it was a "logical next step" for the supercar manufacturer Soon after, Boeing announced a £20m, 2,300 sq m plant - its first European commercial factory - alongside the AMRC to manufacture hi-tech parts for aircraft wings.

upgrade maintenance processes for the Kuwait Air Force (KAF). The project will be carried out under a contract modification received from the US Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). The scope of the project includes the automation and standardisation of the KAF maintenance management infrastructure by using GOLDesp maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) software. "Receiving this contract is a significant milestone for our company as it demonstrates the KAF's confidence in our software and services." In June 2011, GOLDesp MRO was incorporated for the KAF F/A-18 fighter attack aircraft under an original contract received from NAVAIR. Tapestry Solutions president and chief executive officer a Robin Wright said: “The implementation of our enterprise-level software will significantly reduce operational costs for the KAF while improving their productivity and equipment availability. “Receiving this contract is a significant milestone for our company as it demonstrates the KAF's confidence in our software and services.” GOLDesp offers automated workflow tools used to manage MRO for both military and commercial customers, along with maintaining crews to endure precise tracking and management of inventory through the supply chain, thereby enhancing the total asset visibility of movements and repairs. With the implementation of GOLDesp, users can assess maintainability and reliability, schedule and record maintenance actions, as well as control and update configurations, right down to a component's part and serial number. The software can also be used to manage each step of the repair process with an aim to cut down on repair cycle times and costs. GOLDesp supports MRO and supply chain management for lifecycle support of complex assets for land, air, sea as well as space.

Source: Boeing Boeing will bid its MH-139, a military variant of Leonardo Helicopters' AW139, for the US Air Force (USAF) UH-1N 'Huey' replacement programme. The air force's requirements for a new helicopter to protect its intercontinental ballistic missiles and to transport US government and security forces are expected to be released when the draft request for proposals (RFP) is published in April, Richard Lemaster, directorUH-1N replacement and capture team lead for Boeing told Jane's on 2 March. "We understand the missions the aircraft is going to fly and we are convinced we have the ability to put some non-developmental items on the aircraft in order to [meet] those specific air force requirements … tailoring the configuration to our operator specific requirements," he said. The final RfP is expected in July 2017 with a contract award anticipated in 2018. Boeing will leverage the US Federal Aviation Administration's certification that the company and Leonardo have on the AW139, Lemaster said, adding the characteristics of the MH-139 are what make it such a good fit for the Huey replacement effort. For example, the design of the MH-139 will make it much easier for maintainers to keep the helicopter flying, Lemaster said. The avionics components are located in the nose of the aircraft with a removable cowling that swings up to enable access. Unlike in the UH-1N, the transmission is located above the cabin space and is accessible by sliding a cowling forward. Another cowling toward the aft slides toward the tail to enable access to the engines, Lemaster said. "This whole cowling splits in half. From the forward section, you have access to the entire transmission all mounted above the cabin, you can get to the hydraulics, electrical connections, and fuel connections. It is very easy to get in and do the preventive maintenance that is necessary," he said. Want to read more?

The airline’s dedicated fuel efficiency team drove numerous initiatives across all operational functions of the business, saving over 60,000 tonnes of fuel. This 2.5% improvement during 2016 amounts to nearly 190,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide savings, the equivalent of 1,200 flights between Abu Dhabi and London or the removal of over 40,000 cars from the road.  Fuel consumption is influenced by many factors such as the aircraft and engine type, the weight being carried and the duration of the flight. The airline is working on several key initiatives to optimise efficiency, both with the aircraft itself and through external collaboration with aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus. Richard Hill, Chief Operations Officer for Etihad Airways, said: “Fuel optimisation is a top agenda item for any successful and sustainable airline, with Etihad Airways no exception. There have been some encouraging results during 2016 and I’m delighted to see so many of our pilots fully engaged with the programme, as this has ensured additional learning opportunities and the identification of new measures that can deliver greater fuel savings in the years ahead. It’s a vital part of our sustainability efforts and we will continue to look for ways to improve our performance.” Advertisement Reducing weight can be a vital part of fuel savings, with aircraft such as the A380 having a maximum take-off weight of 575 tonnes, equivalent to 115 African elephants or 218 Toyota Land Cruisers.  The airline has made a conscientious effort to reduce the weight of on-board items.  A ‘weight out’ programme, which resulted in the removal or replacement of on board items, led to a fuel burn reduction of 1,100 tonnes of fuel per year. Weather plays a part in influencing aircraft fuel efficiency. The airline is investing in new technology such as the ‘Boeing Wind Uplink’ scheme to ensure that flight crews have the latest information on weather patterns, allowing them to plan for the optimum fuel performance of their aircraft during flight. Fuel burn performance is negatively impacted by seasonal fog, requiring additional holding fuel to be carried, inbound to Abu Dhabi and the airline is now collaborating with the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi to enable more accurate fog predictions. Internally, continuous reviews to holding fuel policy have allowed for more accurate calculation of additional fuel requirements, using past data to ensure adequate additional fuel requirements are met.  Airport staff are also supporting efforts to ensure that ground power is used instead of the auxiliary power unit when aircraft are on the ground. These and many other initiatives have led to the positive results delivered so far with different areas of the business such as Engineering, Airports and Guest Experience working to identify new areas where additional savings can be delivered. The environmental benefits are not only substantial but the efficiency improvement in 2016 compared to 2015 exceeds the emissions reduction goal that the industry has set itself, currently a 1.5% efficiency improvement across international aviation. By going beyond this Etihad Airways is also contributing to carbon neutral growth targets and the ultimate long term goal - for emissions to be fifty percent of 2005 levels by 2050. -Ends- About Etihad Aviation Group Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) is a diversified global aviation and travel group comprising five business divisions – Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, Etihad Airways Engineering, Etihad Airport Services, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners.

The airline’s dedicated fuel efficiency team drove numerous initiatives across all operational functions of the business, saving over 60,000 tonnes of fuel. This 2.5% improvement during 2016 amounts to nearly 190,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide savings, the equivalent of 1,200 flights between Abu Dhabi and London or the removal of over 40,000 cars from the road.  Fuel consumption is influenced by many factors such as the aircraft and engine type, the weight being carried and the duration of the flight. The airline is working on several key initiatives to optimise efficiency, both with the aircraft itself and through external collaboration with aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus. Richard Hill, Chief Operations Officer for Etihad Airways, said: “Fuel optimisation is a top agenda item for any successful and sustainable airline, with Etihad Airways no exception. There have been some encouraging results during 2016 and I’m delighted to see so many of our pilots fully engaged with the programme, as this has ensured additional learning opportunities and the identification of new measures that can deliver greater fuel savings in the years ahead. It’s a vital part of our sustainability efforts and we will continue to look for ways to improve our performance.” Advertisement Reducing weight can be a vital part of fuel savings, with aircraft such as the A380 having a maximum take-off weight of 575 tonnes, equivalent to 115 African elephants or 218 Toyota Land Cruisers.  The airline has made a conscientious effort to reduce the weight of on-board items.  A ‘weight out’ programme, which resulted in the removal or replacement of on board items, led to a fuel burn reduction of 1,100 tonnes of fuel per year. Weather plays a part in influencing aircraft fuel efficiency. The airline is investing in new technology such as the ‘Boeing Wind Uplink’ scheme to ensure that flight crews have the latest information on weather patterns, allowing them to plan for the optimum fuel performance of their aircraft during flight. Fuel burn performance is negatively impacted by seasonal fog, requiring additional holding fuel to be carried, inbound to Abu Dhabi and the airline is now collaborating with the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi to enable more accurate fog predictions. Internally, continuous reviews to holding fuel policy have allowed for more accurate calculation of additional fuel requirements, using past data to ensure adequate additional fuel requirements are met.  Airport staff are also supporting efforts to ensure that ground power is used instead of the auxiliary power unit when aircraft are on the ground. These and many other initiatives have led to the positive results delivered so far with different areas of the business such as Engineering, Airports and Guest Experience working to identify new areas where additional savings can be delivered. The environmental benefits are not only substantial but the efficiency improvement in 2016 compared to 2015 exceeds the emissions reduction goal that the industry has set itself, currently a 1.5% efficiency improvement across international aviation. By going beyond this Etihad Airways is also contributing to carbon neutral growth targets and the ultimate long term goal - for emissions to be fifty percent of 2005 levels by 2050. -Ends- About Etihad Aviation Group Etihad Aviation Group (EAG) is a diversified global aviation and travel group comprising five business divisions – Etihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, Etihad Airways Engineering, Etihad Airport Services, Hala Group and Airline Equity Partners.

F/A-18F Super Hornet aircraft sits on display at company's booth during the Aero India air show at Air Force Station Yelahanka in Bengaluru, India, on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017. A Canadian CF-18 Hornet flies beside two Portuguese F16 Flying Falcons over Lithuania on Sept. 15, 2014. ShareAdjustCommentPrint The Liberal government plans to request bids for a new fleet of fighter jets as early as 2019, which would coincide with the next federal election. That move, along with the push by the Liberals to have the first of the interim Super Hornet fighter aircraft delivered by that year, could help blunt criticism about bungled military procurements and delays in buying a new jet, say military insiders and analysts. Public Services and Procurement Canada confirmed the 2019 date for the release to industry of the request for proposals for the permanent fighter fleet. The department also noted the government expects a deal in place by the end of 2017 or early 2018 to acquire the 18 Boeing Super Hornets as an interim measure. The Liberal government has been pushing to get the first of those planes delivered some time in 2019, industry sources say. Defence analyst Martin Shadwick said such moves could provide political cover for the Liberals. “It could be politically useful in an election year to have both in the works,” said Shadwick, who teaches strategic studies at York University in Toronto. “That’s a pretty good way to buy some political insulation.” Shadwick said if the first Super Hornets arrive during the election year, that in particular would be a tangible event the Liberal government could highlight. The Liberals had promised during the last campaign to purchase a replacement for the CF-18 jet fleet, pointing out that it would go for a cheaper alternative to the controversial F-35 stealth fighter that had been selected by the Conservative government. That’s a pretty good way to buy some political insulation Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan announced in November the government’s decision to begin negotiations to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornets as “interim” fighter jets until a permanent fleet for the existing CF-18 aircraft could be bought. The Liberals said Canada is facing a capability gap because it doesn’t have enough jets to fulfil its military missions, a situation Sajjan has blamed on the previous Conservative government for bungling the project to replace the aging CF-18s. The Liberals’ upcoming Defence Policy Review will also contain details on the project to acquire a permanent replacement fleet for the CF-18s. “These requirements will include the number of aircraft needed, the level of in-service support required and the estimated time of delivery,” noted the recently released update from Public Services and Procurement Canada. “Planning for the competition is already underway, and we anticipate a request for proposals will be issued in 2019.” But the Liberal plan to buy the Super Hornets has come under fire from retired Royal Canadian Air Force generals, who say it is too costly. They argue the Liberals should cancel the Super Hornet deal and proceed immediately to a competition to buy permanent replacements for the CF-18s. Jordan Owens, a spokeswoman for Sajjan, said the government is continuing with its negotiations on the Super Hornets. “The Royal Canadian Air Force faces a significant challenge because it does not have the number of fighter aircraft available to meet Canada’s NORAD and NATO obligations if called to do so simultaneously,” Owens said. Critics, including the Conservatives and some retired officers, have disputed that position and questioned whether there is such a gap. The Liberals have reversed their position somewhat on the F-35. They now say they will hold an open competition for the permanent fleet of fighter jets and that Lockheed Martin is welcome to propose the F-35.   Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

The bridge finance would be up to “$470 million (approximately $117.500 million per aircraft) for partly financing acquisition of four B787-8 aircraft,” the ‘Invitation of Offer’ issued by Air India said. The airline plans to induct these four planes between July and October this year. These planes are part of the 27 aircraft ordered from Boeing in 2006. Of this, Air India has so far bought 23 Dreamliners. According to the Invitation of Offer document, the bridge loan facility will be repaid on conclusion of a Sale and Lease Back (SLB)/outright purchase arrangement, which is already under consideration. Under the SLB arrangement, the seller of an asset leases it back from the purchaser for a long term. “Air India would prefer to have a bullet repayment for this facility or a suitable moratorium period for payment of principal amount under this facility. The bidder with the lower all in costs would be selected,” it said. Aircraft as security The airline has offered aircraft as security for availing the short-term loan. There would be no government guarantee for the loan, Air India has said in the document. Air India has sold 21 planes of the 23 Boeing 787 aircraft, and took them back under the SLB arrangement. The SLB of two planes, which were delivered to the airline between November last year, and January this year, is under process. In February, Air India had issued an Invitation of Offer for SLB of these two aircraft. As part of its fleet expansion plan, Air India had in 2006 placed orders with Boeing for 68 aircraft — 27 Dreamliners, 15 777-300ERs, eight 777-200LRs and 18 737-800s.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Wall Street slips on Trump comments Wall Street ends flat Samsung chief Lee charged with bribery, embezzlement From boom to gloom at the China-North Korea border One-off costs eat into HSBC's 2016 profits N Chandrasekaran takes over as Tata Sons Chairman, promises to work towards groups' upliftment Trump celebrates rollout of Boeing's new 787-10 Wall Street rises to record highs Wall Street surges to record highs Videos Congress, SP, BSP have different culture of...

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau SAN DIEGO Airbus (AIR.PA) expects the jetliner industry to book almost 30 percent fewer net orders in 2017, but to maintain a slow increase in deliveries, its sales chief said on Monday. John Leahy, chief operating officer for customers at the world's second-largest jet producer behind Boeing (BA.N), said he expected the industry would book over 1,000 net orders in 2017 compared with around 1,400 in 2016. He did not say how this would translate into orders for Airbus, which has not issued a forecast for new commercial business this year. Leahy also said that Airbus would not embark on significant new airplane developments in coming years. "We are not planning any great new developments in the next few years ... We will be doing incremental improvements," Leahy told the Istat Americas air finance conference.

The head of Air Force Special Operations Command has revealed the plan will put a laser weapon on an AC-130 gunship.  The weapon would be mounted on the gunship and have its power gradually increased as tests progress.  Scroll down for video  A US AC-130H Spectre gunship dropping flares during a training mission. The head of Air Force Special Operations Command has revealed plans to put a laser weapon on an AC-130 gunship within ayear for radical tests. The laser-armed C-130 project is U.S. Special Operations Command's top unfunded priority, according to Lt. Gen. Brad Webb, the head of Air Force Special Operations Command. 'I'm pretty optimistic,' Webb said of the project Thursday at an Air Force Association-sponsored conference, according to Defence One.  'There are a lot of vendors that are really contributing to and continue to push that technology along.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Fitbit set to track sleep as well as steps as its data shows...

Share this article Share 20 shares The command has money 'to do the first steps' of the project, Webb claimed. He also said military bosses would need to work on the 'rules on engagement' for the futuristic weapons. 'At some point … a policy discussion is going to have to be had on where and how can you use a laser and where and where and how can you not,' he said.  THE AC-130 GUNSHIP  The AC-130's  primary missions are close air support and armed reconnaissance.  They are often used to support troops in contact with enemy forces, convoy escort and point air defense.  The AC-130 is armed with a fearsome array of weaponry, including a 105 mm cannon and 25 or 40 mm gatling guns. The AC-130 users a suite of sensors ot protect itself, and  is armed with a fearsome array of weaponry, including a 105 mm cannon and 25 or 40 mm gatling guns It has a combat history dating to Vietnam, where gunships destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and were credited with many life-saving close air support missions.   During Operation Desert Storm, AC-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces.   'But I think that's a discussion to be had further down the road.'  Air Force bosses are also experimenting with fitting external laser pods to the giant B-52 bomber, allowing it to blast incoming missiles out of the sky or jam their navigation systems.   The Boeing-manufactured bomber (pictured) has been in use since 1952 and is expected to remain operating until 2040, when it'll be replaced by the Northrop Grumman's B-21. Air Force bosses are experimenting with fitting external laser pods to the giant plane, allowing it to blast incoming missiles out of the sky or jam their navigation systems. LASER WEAPONS 'COMING SOON'  Air Force bosses have boasted combat lasers will be fitted to fighters planes 'very soon' and have revealed a full scale prototype is being built. 'I believe we'll have a directed energy pod we can put on a fighter plane very soon,' Air Force General Hawk Carlisle claimed at the Air Force Association Air & Space conference last year in a presentation on what he called Fifth-Generation Warfare, according to Ars Technica. 'That day is a lot closer than I think a lot of people think it is.'    The project is part of the Air Force Research Lab's five-year plan to create power, optics and lasers to help defend large bombers such as the B-52. Air Force Chief Scientist Greg Zacharias told Scout Warrior: 'You can take out the target if you put the laser on the attacking weapon for a long enough period of time.'  The researchers say the older, larger plane cold be perfect for laser weapons, and attaching an external pod would not affect its capabilities.  Zacharias said the laser system would not be expected to work on stealthy aircraft such as F-15's or F-35's.  Lasers use extreme heat and light to burn targets without creating a large explosion. They work at very high speeds so they have an almost instant ability to destroy rapid targets and defend against enemies.  Zacharias also said that if for some reason a pilot doesn't want to destroy an incoming missile but throw it off course, lasers could jam them.  Lasers use extreme heat and light to burn targets without creating a large explosion. They work at very high speeds so they have an almost instant ability to destroy rapid targets and defend against enemies. The lasers could even be synchronized with telescopes to make them more precise for tracking and destroying attackers LASER WEAPON HISTORY  The Pentagon has experimenting with laser weapons for decades.  In 2009, the Advanced Tactical Laser — fired from a C-130 — burned a hole in the hood of a truck.  In 2014, the Navy deployed a laser on an amphibious transport dock in the Persian Gulf.  The captain of the ship was given permission to use the laser as a defensive weapon.  The Air Force and the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency spent billions of dollars putting a laser on the nose of the 747 jetliner that would be used to shoot down ballistic missiles.  The project was canceled in 2012.   The lasers can be synchronized with telescopes to make them more precise for tracking and destroying attackers.  Aircraft lasers for fighter jets such as the B-52 could eventually be applied to a wide range of uses such as air-to-air combat, air support, counter-drone, counter-boat and ground attacks.  The Air Force Research Laboratory has said that they aim to have a plan in place for a laser weapon program by 2023.  Aircraft lasers for fighter jets such as the B-52 could eventually be applied to a wide range of uses such as air-to-air combat, air support, counter-drone, counter-boat and ground attacks. The Air Force Research Laboratory has said that they aim to have a plan in place for a laser weapon program by 2023 Ground level testing for a weapon called the High Energy Laser has been taking place for the last few years at White Sand Missile Range in New Mexico, with the first airborne tests set to take place by 2021.  Air Force leaders told Scout Warrior that they plan to also integrate the lasers in large platforms such as C-17s and C-130s, and eventually on smaller jets such as the F-15.  But these laser weapons may not stick solely to aircraft platforms.  The US Navy has plans to incorporate these lasers on US naval ships to help defend ships from drones and missiles.  The lasers could also play a crucial role in defending against ballistic missiles. According to Air Force experts, one of the clearest advantages of this laser technology is that instead of carrying a limited number of missiles on an aircraft, an energy based weapon such as a laser could fire thousand of shots using one gallon of jet fuel.  BOEING B-52 FACTS AND FIGURES  First flight: 1952 Length: 159 feet, 4 inches Wingspan: 185 feet Speed: 650 mph Range: 8,800 miles without refueling Armaments: 31,500 kilograms of ordnance, which can include bombs, mines and missiles Crew: Five Inventory: 58 active, 18 reserve Cost: US$84 million Source: US Air Force  Read more: Air Force Laser Weapons to Defend B-52 Bomber - Warrior - Scout Air Force Wants to Test a Laser on an Attack Plane Within A Year - Defense One Share or comment on this article e-mail 20 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

The move, however, has caused an outcry online as, once the short-haul Boeing A320 and A321 planes are modified to 74cm (29 inches), BA customers will now have an inch less legroom than budget carrier Ryanair, which gives passengers 30 inches. BA classifies its short-haul flights as lasting less than 5 hours. Many online have questioned the move, asking why they should continue to pay higher fares for fewer amenities. @British_Airways What makes BA a better quality airline now on short haul flights?

Customers fly with us because we offer quality and value in all areas,” a spokesman for the airline said. This is the latest budget cutting move by BA, following the move last September to begin charging for snacks onboard short haul flights.

It's a desire for anonymity Grand Rapids Ballet (GRB) creative director Michael Auer, the organization's own multitalented and multifaceted wizard, can identify with as well. When it comes to helping others find the courage, heart and smarts in their creative endeavors for the 46-year-old ballet organization, Auer stays behind the scenes. Michael Auer, creative director at Grand Rapids Ballet.Eric Bouwens  Much of Auer's work happens behind the scenes, working with technology, projects, and working with choreographers as a creative conduit for their visions for the music, audio, and special effects.Eric Bouwens  Born in Vienna, Austria, Auer studied ballet at the Vienna State Opera Ballet and then at New York's School of American Ballet. He went on to a professional dance career with North Carolina Dance Theatre, Eliot Feld Ballet, Frankfurt Ballet and at Pacific Northwest Ballet. With was there that he met wife Patricia Barker, a prima ballerina with the company. They've now been together for 33 years. After his career as a dancer, Auer's second career was as a self-taught computer software engineer. He has worked at Microsoft, Boeing, Carnegie Mellon and others--creating software, developing early virtual reality technology, and doing market research. That diverse skill set has served him--and GRB--well since Barker took over as artistic director in 2010. The 62-year-old Auer is not only Barker's right-hand man, artistic advisor, confidant, and sounding board. He also plays the role of website developer, IT guy, and technical liaison between guest choreographers and GRB's production staff. Instead of assuming the job title of "artistic associate," standard at most ballet companies, Auer says he bestowed upon himself the title of creative director, a title he was used to at many of the tech companies he worked for in the past. Because, along with the aforementioned duties, he takes on rehearsing and coaching roles for the company's dancers and teaching class, the position of creative director is more fitting to the broad scope of his responsibilities. Perhaps his biggest duty is acting as a creative conduit between guest choreographers/repetiteurs and the capabilities of GRB's 300-seat Peter Martin Wege Theatre. "Primarily what I do when a choreographer comes in is help facilitate things like the use of music and any audio editing that needs done. [I help with] technical requirements, such as if they are looking to do projections and special effects, and how the stage needs to be arranged," says Auer. His efforts in those areas are perhaps best seen in GRB's popular contemporary dance series "MOVEMEDIA." The series takes the creative talents of some of today's most sought after choreographers and blends them with visual elements and technology to provide a contemporary performance experience. In past "MOVEMEDIA" productions, Auer has helped choreographers with creating video projections and other special effects, including helping to make the background video of a film strip in choreographer Robyn Mineko Williams' "One Take" (2014) look vintage, and remixing the music and navigating flashlight logistics for GRB resident choreographer Penny Saunders' 2015 work for the company, "Slight." He also came up with 3D stage floor projections of water and moonlight for Mario Radacosky's 2012 ballet "Black & White: Swan Lake" that the company reprised last month. Dancers rehearse for "MOVEMEDIA" performances this weekend.Eric Bouwens  Dancers rehearse for "MOVEMEDIA" performances this weekend.Eric Bouwens  Dancers rehearse for "MOVEMEDIA" performances this weekend.Eric Bouwens  Auer says he has a personal agenda to get choreographers to understand that they have an artistic purpose behind their works and that they are not just putting steps together.  "Their piece should say something," says Auer. "It should speak to those in the audience and possibly raise a dialog in the community." For the latest iteration of "MOVEMEDIA," "World Premieres," happening March 10-12 at the Peter Martin Wege Theatre, Auer worked with Saunders again on her new ballet, "In Frame." "My goal with the work was to create an environment that connects the universal realities of love, life and death, creation and destruction, to the beauty and vulnerability of the creative process," said Saunders. Set to several tracks from Max Richter's reworked version of Antonio Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons," Saunders says she enlisted Auer to help project images of ink and watercolor paintings by artist Alice Klock during her piece. "The only reason I took on an endeavor like this is because I know that Michael Auer will figure out a way for all of this to come together," says Saunders. "I have seen him in action enough times now to know that I can count on his brain to help me make it all work." Auer also had a hand in synchronizing video projections to the music used in Robert Dekkers and Vanessa Theissen's new work for the program, "Dear Light Along the Way to Nothingness." Titled after an excerpt James Merrill's poem "Log," the 26-minute ballet for 21 dancers is set to Caroline Shaw's 2013 Pulitzer Prize-winning composition, "Partita for Eight Voices." "This work was inspired by the dancers, my collaborators (Vanessa and costume designer Christian Squires), and the present environment in which we live," says Dekkers. Rounding out what Auer refers to as "probably the biggest 'MOVEMEDIA' we've ever done" will be award-winning choreographer Robyn Mineko Williams' latest for the company. There are certainly advantages for a ballet company in having their own theater space, like not having to pay to rent another theater space, having 24/7 access to it for rehearsals, and allowing for experimentation by choreographers and technical staff. But perhaps the theater's most unique advantage is the way the stage is raked, with an incline from the front edge of the stage to the back. This allows for everyone in the audience to see the stage floor, making the use of floor projections that one might otherwise only see as an audience member in other theaters seated in the balcony. Auer says while the Peter Martin Wege theater has those advantage,s it also has its limitations. One of the biggest is the inability to fully "fly" in and out stage curtains, drops, and scenic elements such as at other venues they use like DeVos Performance Hall where the company performs its annual The Nutcracker production. Other limitations include the lack of an orchestra pit and having only a 10-foot loading dock door that prohibits bringing in large set pieces.

As mentioned, Auer teaches and coaches the dancers but particularly enjoys rehearsing and "cleaning" dance works. "I do like going in when the dancers know their steps and we can start getting people in line," says Auer. "I help the dancers add quality, dynamics, intent, and purpose to their dancing." When he is not working his magic behind the scenes at GRB, Auer says he likes to cook.  "Having places like Fish Lads of Grand Rapids and Trader Joe's has elevated our cooking at home," he says. As for Barker's culinary skills, he jokingly says "I keep Patricia [Barker] far, far away from the cooktop."  She doesn't deny it. "I think [the kitchen] is a wasted room in the house," Barker confesses. The Seattle transplants bought a house in Heritage Hill that they share with their 23-year-old pet cat Mathilda and are settling into life in Grand Rapids.  "There has been a tremendous growth in the city for the better since we arrived with an influx of new people, new buildings, new restaurants and more," says Auer. But for now, the pair's attentions are focused on the upcoming "MOVEMEDIA" production. There's plenty of magic yet to be made Barker, her dancers, and though the audience may not realize it, by man behind the curtain, Michael Auer.

07.03.2017 13:30   новости на русском azərbaycan dilində Facebook Twitter Google+ RSS Main page Latest News Analytics Politics Business Society Sports Arts & Entertainment Azernews.az World news Weird / Interesting Photo Galleries Voice of Diaspora Your Corner TODAY.AZ / World news Kyrgyz president suggests Parliament to dissolve 06 March 2017 [17:47] - TODAY.AZ By Azernews By Kamila Aliyeva Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev supported the initiative to dissolve the Parliament commenting on the statement of MP Bakyt Torobayev, the presidential press service reported on March 6. MP Bakyt Torobayev has earlier proposed his counterparts to dissolve the Parliament, Atambayev said on March 6 during the presenting of state awards at his residence. "He [Torobayev] wanted to help out his looter-brother; however, I would back his suggestion. I wanted to address the MPs, crows do not pick out crow's eyes. If you cannot find peace, get dissolved together with Bakyt Torobayev," said Atambayev. Or else, the President called the Parliament to abide law, and think of the destiny of the country and work for the sake of the nation. "If you don't want peace, then people want it," stated the President. President Atambayev said that some parliament members allege that the Boeing plane, which crashed near Bishkek in mid-January killing about 40, was carrying some cargo owned by him and that he has millions-worth of offshore property in Cyprus. “They say that my cargo was on board, they [MPs] shout about it, but know that this is not true,” he said adding that if they were sure about it, they would have already gone to Istanbul or Hong Kong to check this information and bring evidence. “If they do not have the means, I am willing to buy tickets for them, these are just rumors and attempts to blacken my name,” Atambaev said. Instead of generating laws, the Parliament, according to Atambayev, has become a place of generating rumors. Kyrgyzstan's state security service said it detained opposition leader Omurbek Tekebayev on Sunday on charges of corruption and fraud. Tekebayev, 58, leads the Ata Meken (Fatherland) party's parliamentary faction. At a session of Parliament, which addressed the issue of detention of Tekebayev, Bakyt Torobayev offered MPs to dissolve Parliament if it is not capable of solving problems. The ex-Soviet Central Asian nation will hold a presidential election on November 19. Atambayev cannot run for re-election under the Kyrgyz constitution.

The expectation at the start of this decade was that 3D printing would unleash a home manufacturing revolution comparable to the DTP (desktop publishing) revolution that was made possible by the PC and 2D printers. “You’ve heard of 3D printers, but you probably don’t own one yet,” wrote Wired in 2012. The comparison was made to early PCs – expensive, limited to techies, perceived as gadgets, but promising. Both had common origins as highly technical machines. And both were destined to evolve into user-friendliness and utilisation for non-technical, real-world work. But the enthusiastic prediction that most homes would have a 3D printer has not come true. This is in stark contrast to PCs, and for a long time 2D printers. Those machines did appear “on every desk and in every home”, in line with the vision of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. But the fact that most homes don’t have a 3D printer does not mean there is no revolution. 3D printing is slowly emerging for business applications: in healthcare, in prototyping and manufacturing, in inventory and supply chains, for example. This adoption is taking place in industry, not in the home. Analysts see eight-fold growth for the 3D printing market over the next few years, from being worth $5bn worldwide now to $40bn in 2020 – and the Dutch want part of it. Forget the 3D consumer market for now and take the industrial sector, which is currently picking up 3D printing. Look, for example, at Boeing’s new space taxi, the unmanned Starliner. The US aviation giant has hired a small company, Oxford Performance Materials, to make about 600 3D printed parts for its space programme. The parts are being made from special fire- and radiation-resistant plastics. This is quite a leap from NASA’s 2014 production of a ratchet wrench on board the International Space Station. Boeing’s use of 3D printing for its Starliner is also space bound, but in the international harbour of Dutch city Rotterdam, 3D printing is being explored for seafaring ships. Last year, the Port of Rotterdam announced its Fieldlab additive manufacturing facility for the 3D printing of ship propellers. The process is the same as regular 3D printing, but uses metal instead of plastic. The investment of several million euros into the Rotterdam Fieldlab follows a successful pilot in 2015. Read more about 3D printing Manufacturing companies are looking into more and more ways to incorporate additive manufacturing. Here is a look at some of the reasons and ways 3D printing use is evolving. Because of their lightweight nature, 3D printed braces can help improve patient compliance in the group most affected by scoliosis – adolescent females. As 3D printing disrupts business and technology mandates, CIOs can gain new relevance as business enablers. Metal is also the base material for two other Dutch 3D printing innovations – a futuristic bicycle and an artistic canal bridge in Amsterdam. The first project has already been completed. Students at the Technical University Delft printed a steel bike frame, which is just as heavy and usable as a regular frame. The Arc Bicycle, as it is known, was launched in April last year by Dutch minister of economic affairs Henk Kamp, who took it for a ride. The three-month printing process involved layering molten pieces of metal on top of each other – a process the makers describe as drawing lines in the air. The creation of the Arc Bicycle was made possible by Dutch robotics company MX3D and its multi-axis robotic arms. The dimensions of traditional 3D printers restrict the size of objects they can output, but MX3D offers “printing outside the box”, said the company’s CTO, Tim Geurtjes. This approach is markedly different from another Dutch project, 3D Print Canal House, designed by DUS Architects. This ambitious project aims to make a complete Amsterdam canal house, printed in parts that then need to be assembled. The 3D printer used for the project is a repurposed shipping container called the KamerMaker. Meanwhile, MX3D is about to start another 3D printing project – a pedestrian bridge. Its 3D printing robots will build a canal bridge, metal drop by metal drop, to form a load-bearing mesh. This showcase innovation is planned for Amsterdam’s red light district. Since the scheme was announced in the summer of 2015, MX3D has been experimenting and refining the bridge, designed by Dutch artist Joris Laarman. Spain appeared to have beaten the Netherlands’ scoop for the world’s first 3D printed bridge when a structurer was installed in a Madrid park last December. But the Spanish bridge was made from concrete, produced in eight parts and then assembled. The Dutch bridge will see the printing robots making the stainless steel structure as they cross it – meeting in the middle to finish the construction. Watch the bridge grow However, contrary to the initial plan – and mock-up photos – the printing will not be done live on location at the Oudezijds Achterburgwal, because although the bridge itself will be weather (and tourist) proof, the robots (and the construction process) are not. Instead, it will be done in MX3D’s studio in Amsterdam-Noord, where the public can come to watch the bridge grow. Production is scheduled to start during the first quarter of this year, and the bridge should be in situ in the red light district at the beginning of next year. This 3D printing project may be a showcase, but it is also a sign of serious industrial interest in the Netherlands. One of the parties involved is venerable Dutch construction giant Heijmans, a 93-year-old company that is also taking part in the plastic printed 3D Canal House. While that build will take about three years to complete, the possibilities for more custom construction and creative output are intriguing the Dutch, who see a third industrial revolution, merging digital with manufacturing. The possibilities have also caught the Netherlands government’s attention. At the end of last year, the ministry of economic affairs unveiled an action plan for smart industry. Working with Dutch research and technology organisations, it aims to boost development and standards for smart industrial applications. This includes 3D printing, which is seen as an economic growth area. The hip development area of Amsterdam-Noord is already home to an impressive mix of building styles – now 3D printing promises to break the mould for housing, bridges, bicycles, ship parts, and more.

Hide Caption 12 of 12 Story highlights MH370 vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board Families of those aboard are setting up a private search fund (CNN)The families of those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have launched a campaign to privately fund a search for the aircraft, which disappeared nearly three years ago. Australia, China and Malaysia announced in January that they were ending their official search for the plane. MH370 was traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, when it vanished over the Indian Ocean with 239 people on board.

MUST WATCH Search for flight MH370 suspended 02:43 Jiang Hui, whose mother was on the plane, told CNN on Saturday that relatives were working to create an international fund made up of donations from the parties involved in the flight. He said he believes various companies should contribute to the fund, including the governments of the 14 countries where the passengers were from, plane manufacturer Boeing and Malaysia Airlines. Read More "The fund will be invested and the annual investment returns or interests will be used for the search of MH370," Jiang said. "Once the plane is found, the original donation will be returned to the donors, without interest." He did not provide a target amount for the fund. Decision not taken lightly In their January joint statement announcing the suspension of the search for the aircraft, Australia, China and Malaysia said the decision had not been taken lightly. "Despite every effort using the best science available, cutting edge technology, as well as modeling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field, unfortunately, the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," it said. The officials said they would not rule out another search if "credible" evidence were to emerge. Voice370, a support group for family members of those aboard the flight, released a statement expressing disappointment over the suspension. "Commercial planes cannot just be allowed to disappear without a trace," the statement said. "Stopping at this stage is nothing short of irresponsible, and betrays a shocking lack of faith in the data, tools and recommendations of an array of official experts assembled by the authorities themselves." RELATED: Timeline of MH370 disappearance The plane's disappearance remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries in modern history. Searchers spent millions of dollars scouring tens of thousands of square miles, but so far have yielded little new information about the plane's final moments. What we do know At 12:41 a.m. local time on March 8, 2014, MH370 departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport for Beijing. It was heading north but after its last message of "Good night Malaysian Three Seven Zero," it changed course toward the west, according to military radar. From there, investigators believe it turned south around the edge of Indonesia and across the vast Indian Ocean. Investigators confirmed in July that MH370 captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah had tracked a route deep into the Indian Ocean on his home flight simulator, very similar to the one officials believe the missing plane took. Grandparents, a newly graduated engineer, a young couple and a 2-year-old boy were among the hundreds of people on board MH370 when it vanished. Most of the passengers and crew were from China and Malaysia, but individuals and families from 14 different countries were also on board the missing flight. Theories Based on some of the wreckage that's been found, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau determined the wing flaps had been stowed when MH370 crashed. The report suggested the plane had been out of control, spiraling downward at a rate of almost 300 miles per hour at its last satellite transmission. These findings suggested "two early hypotheses," according to CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo; either that a fire on board the plane incapacitated everyone through smoke or fumes, or that a rapid decompression, perhaps because of a breach in a window, led to their deaths hours before the plane ran out of fuel and spiraled downward. But investigators still haven't been able to say for sure what caused the crash. CNN's Yuli Yang reported from Hong Kong and Susannah Cullinane wrote from Auckland.

Have you sent Seattle’s tech to Canada? by Drew Atkins A man looks at the skyline of Vancouver, Canada from Stanley Park at sunset. Credit: Michael Matti It was a Friday afternoon when Donald Trump issued his most controversial order, banning immigration from seven countries. Reaction was swift, as thousands of protesters filled airport terminals, and immigration lawyers scrambled to assist families thrown into a new legal limbo. By Monday, a different sort of aftershock had arrived in Vancouver, Canada. Tech workers from the Bay Area and Puget Sound had done some thinking over the weekend. And the British Columbian city was starting to look a lot better to them. “I speak to immigration lawyers all the time, and they started receiving record numbers of calls from tech workers,” says Michael Tippett, a longtime entrepreneur in Vancouver’s tech industry. “Not only workers. I’m hearing from founders who are saying they’ve got 30 people on a team, three of them are from Iran, and what can we do here? … We’re not sure yet if Seattle’s loss is our win, but there’s a huge opportunity for Vancouver to benefit from this.” Vancouver is currently the junior partner in the “Cascadia innovation corridor,” part of an agreement signed last September between Washington and British Columbia to foster mutual tech growth.  Compared to Puget Sound, the Vancouver area has fewer tech workers, less venture capitalist funding, and no large “anchor” companies like Microsoft, Boeing, or Amazon. But some speculate the balance between the regions could change a bit, if only gradually, as the U.S. becomes more restrictive toward foreigners. After all, Canada’s less stringent immigration system has long been a calling card for the city. Microsoft President Brad Smith calls it a motivating factor behind the company’s $120 million Vancouver engineering facility, which opened last June. It plans to employ over 700 people in the office, at an annual operating cost of $90 million. “Vancouver is a potential problem for U.S. tech growth if our immigration system isn’t reformed,” says Neil Ruiz, executive director of the Center for Law, Economics and Finance at George Washington University. “Other countries are trying to build their ecosystem for foreign entrepreneurs and talent. That could be a threat to our competitiveness in both the long and short term.” For now, a potential point of competition between Vancouver and Puget Sound concerns satellite offices. The Puget Sound area is fertile ground for Bay Area giants looking to establish northern outposts. Whether it’s Facebook’s Frank Gehry-designed new office in South Lake Union, Apple’s new offices downtown and Google’s expanding presence in both Seattle and Kirkland, attracting out-of-state companies is a key factor in the region’s tech growth. The same can be said for Vancouver, which hosts offices for most of the same companies, as well as Microsoft and Amazon. And each company that decides to expand its workforce north of the border, instead of Seattle, strengthens Vancouver’s ecosystem of tech talent. “Vancouver has great immigration policies, but doesn’t have a velocity of talent yet,” says Chris Devore, managing director of Techstars Seattle and a longtime leader in Seattle’s startup scene. “I would attribute that to their lack of anchors, like Amazon. As far as satellites go, in the time horizon of a four-year term (for Trump), without saner immigration policy, I’d say the amount of talent in Seattle insulates it from too much disruption. But if, God forbid, he’s elected to another term, companies will reevaluate things.” In addition to Trump’s immigration action, a draft executive order obtained by Bloomberg News would impose new restrictions on hiring high-skill foreign workers, a much more direct blow to the tech industry. Even without this order, it can currently take three times as long to receive a work visa in the U.S. as opposed to Canada, according to an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group. “Historically, both the U.S. and Canada have done well because we were willing to take anyone from anywhere,” says Vancouver Councilor Andrea Reimer, chair of the city’s Policy and Strategic Priorities Committee. “The larger the pool of talent, the broader the base of genetics, the broader the experience. If U.S. chooses to narrow that down, it gives us an advantage.” Immigrants have long played a vital role in the tech industry, both in starting and staffing companies. Ruiz points out that a high proportion of students from Iran and other countries targeted by Trump’s immigration order pursue advanced STEM degrees in the U.S. Motivating these students and other high-talent workers to relocate north of the border, he says, will hurt the U.S. economy in the long-term. “All of this could have a big impact on innovation,” says Ruiz. “The details of how they do immigration reform (in DC) are going to be very important.” In reaction to Trump’s executive order on immigration, Tippett founded an organization, True North, to help U.S. companies plan a move to Canada. They’ve received hundreds of inquiries, he says, and held talks with the city government. Through the grapevine, he’s heard the organization has been a point of discussion within the Seattle Mayor’s Office as well. The Mayor’s Office didn’t respond to a request for comment. “As we see it, if the policies in the U.S. become more restrictive, we will emerge as the North American standard bearer for a free and open society,” says Tippett. “With tech, we’re talking about an industry that’s not tied to mines or anything. It’s highly fluid and dynamic. It will go where workers feel comfortable.” Tech is already a major part of Vancouver’s economy, with roughly 40 percent of downtown office space occupied by the industry. Its expansion faces some key obstacles, particularly the high cost of real estate in the city. But Councilor Reimer believes President Trump’s immigration policies are a key issue for the regional economy. “All businesses do better in an environment of stability because predicting the future means you can plan,” says Reimer. “I don’t know how well you know Canadians, but we’re obsessed with not being America, but also feeling somewhat inferior to America. We love Seattle, and we think the tech corridor is fantastic…. But right now, though, we have the kind of stability and, frankly, safety that immigrants want to see as they grow their lives.” Show comments + - Like this article? Help us write more like it.

An Opportunity, Not a Problem Science Fiction, Video Games and Other Influences Upskill CEO Brian Ballard has been a tech geek for decades. Lately, though, the workforce interests him just as much (as if the new name of his company isn’t proof enough). Can new tech like wearables help fill the skills gap and the coming worker shortage? More About: Skilled Worker Shortage You hear people talking about this, but it hasn’t entered the national dialogue yet. It’s still an Us vs. The Machines rhetoric, or Us vs. Other Countries. This is something that’s happening in every country in the world. People are concerned about how the future looks because of technology and how it relates to their industry.”  - Brian Ballard Title: CEO and co-founder Organization: Upskill Formerly: Director of product development for Battlefield Telecommunications Systems, CTO and VP for Mav6 (ARES Systems Group), and field operations officer for the Department of Defense. The IndustryWeek Manufacturing Leader of the Week highlights the manufacturing leaders, executives and stars who are driving growth in today's industry and helping to shape the future of manufacturing. Upskill; illustration: Bill Szilagyi, IndustryWeek Advertisement After more than a week on the road — first in transit, then at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, then in transit again — Brian Ballard returned to work on fire for the wearables industry he has worked in for close to a decade. He was also happier than ever that his company changed its name. Ballard is the CEO of the company that was, from 2010 until late January, called APX Labs. It had carved a niche developing software for some major names in the oil, gas and defense sectors, and later picked up General Electric as an investor and a customer, along with work from Boeing and two of the five largest companies in oil and gas. Today, though, its name is Upskill. “We had been planning to rename (the company) for a very long time, but we were hesitant to let go of the brand value we had built,” Ballard said. “Everyone knew us as APX — I still say it — but it’s something we knew we would outgrow, which has made it easier to move on. In Switzerland, so much of the conversation revolved around skill. I feel good about aligning our mission to what is clearly a global problem right now.” Ballard discussed the need for workers to upskill — and reskill — as well as the present and future of wearables, other lessons learned in Davos, how science fiction and video games influence our current tech, and plenty of other topics in this broad conversation. Unfortunately, it reads best on a standard desktop, laptop or mobile screen. There are no augmented reality bonus features … Yet. Popular Now OEE – Learn How to Use It Right 12 Key Strategies to Achieving a Work-Life Balance Three Reasons Why Visual Management Boards Fail IndustryWeek: The last time we talked, in late 2015, you predicted that 2016 could be a banner year for wearables: “You’ll start seeing them used on a much larger scale, moving from one line to the whole factory, or from one factory to the whole bullpen of factories that support a process.” Good call. Brian Ballard: The market itself has really matured as far as people’s expectations of what technology can do for them. And this is a crazy time because there’s a backdrop of what technology is going to do to get rid of people’s jobs, and there’s a lot of freaking out about that. I can’t imagine going back to doing everything with a manual Phillips screwdriver when I have a DeWalt drill just sitting right there. There are parts of our lives, particularly where it’s a dumb tool, where we’re not threatened by it and we happily embrace the capability that it brings. I think where you can’t see some of the intelligence inside technology it becomes harder to trust. With augmented reality, that problem is solved: you quite literally see the technology and what it’s doing for you, and the results speak for themselves. … All that is going to change. It’ll get sleeker, get smaller, get more powerful. I think the fact that we’re already down this path, that there are real companies finding real value, this is going to be the common way people do work for a lot of jobs in the future, and the more the industry can do to build a value chain around it, the better we’re going to be served by it and it will help people stay competitive and useful in the market significantly longer than if they don’t think about their skill on a continuum. IW: Outside of the Industrial Internet of Things, of course, augmented reality seems like the most important technology just because of the role it can play in helping to fill the millions of jobs that will open up over the next decade. BB: The number of people affected by the skills gap over the coming years for high-skilled jobs is crazy. I have to look it up, but call it roughly 2.3 million people. That’s half the total of the unemployed population of the country. What if we could actually get those roles filled, by getting people something that makes the apprenticeship quicker? I spend a lot of time with customers, going out to sites to see how they do training, and it’s an industrial-era process. … You go through these archaic training processes, you’re expected to memorize them, then you might never see that problem for years, and by the time you do see it you have no idea what to do. We’re far better off training people with the techniques they need to understand and to make the information needed always available. Love tech? Keep up with the manufacturing technology world with the M&T Newsletter, in your inbox every Friday morning IW: If you were one of the two dozen CEOs on the new administration’s job initiatives committee, what would be some of your suggestions beyond, as you just said, Hey, look, AR can fill half the unemployed population? BB: I ran into some of those guys (at Davos), so I actually am trying to suggest some things to them. I won’t get into super specifics, but the skills gap is a very real problem for a lot of these companies. How do you solve that? These very large company CEOs, they have a lot of tools at their disposal. They can build factories, they can build automation, they can reconfigure their workforce. … If you’re dealing with the fear of your job going away, that’s a corporate culture problem for a lot of these CEOs. You have to engage with the people, you have to show that your technology investments are about helping them and the company, rather than trying to solve a problem. That’s a culture thing. Whether I’m dealing with my own company, whether I’m talking to a CEO who has a multi-hundred-thousand-person workforce, these are still people who look at their companies very much like family. You want to do good by your people, but we have to engage in what we say and in what we do. The term I heard a lot was “Bring the workforce along”. First, we accept that technology is changing, businesses are changing, industries are changing at pace we’ve never seen before. Technology is disruptive to expectations around timelines, so we have to bring the economy along with us in that transformation, and you can’t do it by ignoring people. You have to equip them with the tools that they can use to forge their path through this. You hear people talking about this, but it hasn’t entered the national dialogue yet, it’s still an Us vs. The Machines rhetoric, or Us vs. Other Countries. This is something that’s happening in every country in the world. People are concerned about how the future looks because of technology and how it relates to their industry. At the same time, the world is consuming an unbelievable amount of products at a pace that has never happened before, either. There are people who look at that as opportunity.

MP Bakyt Torobayev has earlier proposed his counterparts to dissolve the Parliament, Atambayev said on March 6 during the presenting of state awards at his residence. "He [Torobayev] wanted to help out his looter-brother; however, I would back his suggestion. I wanted to address the MPs, crows do not pick out crow's eyes. If you cannot find peace, get dissolved together with Bakyt Torobayev," said Atambayev. Or else, the President called the Parliament to abide law, and think of the destiny of the country and work for the sake of the nation. "If you don't want peace, then people want it," stated the President. President Atambayev said that some parliament members allege that the Boeing plane, which crashed near Bishkek in mid-January killing about 40, was carrying some cargo owned by him and that he has millions-worth of offshore property in Cyprus. “They say that my cargo was on board, they [MPs] shout about it, but know that this is not true,” he said adding that if they were sure about it, they would have already gone to Istanbul or Hong Kong to check this information and bring evidence. “If they do not have the means, I am willing to buy tickets for them, these are just rumors and attempts to blacken my name,” Atambaev said. Instead of generating laws, the Parliament, according to Atambayev, has become a place of generating rumors. Kyrgyzstan's state security service said it detained opposition leader Omurbek Tekebayev on Sunday on charges of corruption and fraud. Tekebayev, 58, leads the Ata Meken (Fatherland) party's parliamentary faction. At a session of Parliament, which addressed the issue of detention of Tekebayev, Bakyt Torobayev offered MPs to dissolve Parliament if it is not capable of solving problems. The ex-Soviet Central Asian nation will hold a presidential election on November 19. Atambayev cannot run for re-election under the Kyrgyz constitution. --- Kamila Aliyeva is AzerNews’ staff journalist, follow her on Twitter: @Kami_Aliyeva Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz    Category News Trump's new travel ban order published 13:13 German, Turkish ministers to discuss ways to normalize relations 12:40 Netanyahu praises U.S. anti-semitism policy 12:33 CBI: Americans can open bank accounts in Iran 11:32 Iraq security forces take control of Mosul's main government building 10:42 Trump, Abe hold phone conversation over North Korea missile launch 10:34 Leaders of euro zone's biggest economies back multi-speed Europe 10:25 Minister: France to encourage banks to work with Iran 6 March 17:57 IAEA says Iran removes excess centrifuges from Fordow plant 6 March 17:06 Ashgabat, Tashkent voice commitment to expand ties, ink deals 6 March 16:44 Latest Popular 13:26 • Italian Snam to invest 270M euros in TAP 13:13 • Trump's new travel ban order published 13:10 • First VP Mehriban Aliyeva: Being a parliament member was great honor for me 13:01 • Turkish Vice Admiral: Azerbaijani army able to prevent all provocations, attacks of enemy 12:43 • Rethinking productivity growth 12:40 • German, Turkish ministers to discuss ways to normalize relations 12:33 • Netanyahu praises U.S. anti-semitism policy 12:23 • National wrestlers grab three medals in Turkey [PHOTO] 12:07 • "Red Garden" awarded Best Feature Film [PHOTO] 11:53 • ESISC reveals probe into "Armenian connection" network at Council of Europe 11:44 • YARAT Film Club to present Azer Guliyev`s films 11:32 • CBI: Americans can open bank accounts in Iran 11:20 • Azerbaijan submits EC its offers on TRACECA 11:03 • Washington Times: U.S. must applaud Mehriban Aliyeva’s becoming First VP 11:00 • Azerbaijan to join İTB Berlin exhibition 10:47 • Azeri Light price hits $56.83 10:42 • Iraq security forces take control of Mosul's main government building 10:35 • Azerbaijani karate fighters shine in Turkey [PHOTO] 10:34 • Trump, Abe hold phone conversation over North Korea missile launch 10:30 • Armenia continues breaking ceasefire with Azerbaijan 6 March 16:00 • Kyrgyzstan sees fall in trade turnover with EEU states 6 March 14:17 • 'Kaspersky Lab' to develop cooperation with Azerbaijan 6 March 17:43 • Azerbaijani, Russian FMs review strategic partnership [UPDATE / PHOTO] 6 March 17:57 • Minister: France to encourage banks to work with Iran 6 March 14:36 • Azerbaijani opera singers to perform in Moscow 6 March 16:32 • Baku among Top 5 destinations for International Women's Day 6 March 17:23 • Iran MFA spokesman: We recommend Armenia, Azerbaijan to solve their problem themselves 6 March 15:41 • Cinema to be offered for entrepreneurs at privatization auction 6 March 17:41 • Azerbaijan further cuts oil output 6 March 18:03 • Azerbaijan to manufacture new UAVs in 2017 6 March 17:23 • Baku to host Spanish Film Festival 6 March 16:50 • MP: Azerbaijan’s refugee experience is example for Europe 6 March 17:05 • Kyrgyz president suggests Parliament to dissolve 6 March 15:23 • National judokas win gold medals in Antalya 6 March 15:10 • Don't miss workshop by Candoco Dance Company 6 March 18:21 • Only for women-new film project [PHOTO] 6 March 14:52 • Daniil Kvyat: Baku track is absolutely different than others 6 March 16:44 • Ashgabat, Tashkent voice commitment to expand ties, ink deals 6 March 17:06 • IAEA says Iran removes excess centrifuges from Fordow plant 6 March 13:51 • President Aliyev, First Lady inaugurate Heart Center in Baku [UPDATE/ PHOTO] AzerNews Newspaper Facebook Twitter Google+ RSS Information About us Contacts Advertising Azernews In Print News Archive © 2017 AzerNews.

These kinds of comments have prompted a number of companies to turn to PR agencies who can help them prepare for similar threats. Photo: Associated Press By Alexandra Bruell Alexandra Bruell The Wall Street Journal BiographyAlexandra Bruell alexandra.bruell@wsj.com March 6, 2017 6:00 a.m. ET 4 COMMENTS From product recalls to unwieldy CEOs, public relations experts have seen it all. At least, they thought they had. Then the U.S. elected a president who tweets whatever is on his mind: bashing auto makers like General Motors for manufacturing cars in Mexico, declaring companies like the New York Times to be “failing,” criticizing Nordstrom for dropping his daughter’s fashion label, and complaining about the cost of Boeing’s 747 Air Force One. As President Donald Trump calls out specific corporations, not only is he fueling an unprecedented amount of anxiety among executives, he also is creating an influx of business for public relations agencies. “This is the first situation like this we’ve ever seen,” said Gene Grabowski, who has spent over two decades in Washington, D.C.-focused PR and advocacy roles and is now a partner at crisis communications firm KGlobal. Clients typically ask for advice on how to be prepared to handle plausible scenarios like a plant fire, huge product recall or malfeasance by a board member, he said. “This is the first time clients reached out asking, ‘What do we do if the president attacks us?’ This is now a category,” said Mr. Grabowski. “Attack by the President” is now among the scenarios that the firm jots down on a whiteboard during routine crisis and issues management exercises for clients. The purpose is to discover what’s most likely to happen, how likely it is to happen and then how to react, said Mr. Grabowski. His firm has had discussions with at least three clients about developing a “Trump strategy.” Related News President Trump’s Tweets Have Companies Playing Defense How to Trade a Donald Trump Tweet Trump Says ‘No Way’ to Toyota Plant in Mexico In Mr. Trump’s first six weeks in office, companies have been confronted with how to respond to his public outrage that they would move U.S. jobs or operations outside the country. Mr. Trump campaigned heavily on promises to put Americans back to work, and since his election, he has been vocal about efforts to work with individual companies to retain jobs and create new ones. Executives have also been put in the tedious position of figuring out how to react to polarizing policy changes like immigration. Corporations have put out carefully worded responses and, in some cases, made actual changes to their business plans—sometimes even allowing Mr. Trump to claim credit for influencing those decisions. Behind the scenes, most of these interactions are carefully managed by public relations experts. As more of these fast-moving scenarios play out in public and executives fear a 140-character tweet will send their stock price tumbling, more companies are paying up to be prepared for the worst. After a handful of clients reached out for help, Zeno Group, a PR agency within the Daniel J. Edelman network, recast its crisis and issues resources to create a formal approach that uses insights from both the U.S. administration change and Brexit, said Kim Metcalfe, executive vice president of corporate affairs at Zeno. The new offering, dubbed Zeno Seismic, focuses on “how companies should deal with massive unexpected business and societal changes,” she said. At least six clients have reached out for help over the past few weeks. Seeing “the correlation between a tweet and a stock price, it’s enough for them to realize they need to pay attention,” she said. It’s also getting tough for PR professionals to do their bread-and-butter work of getting publicity for their clients’ product launches and other developments. National media outlets are spending more time covering Trump’s administration, and people are increasingly getting their news from outlets that cater to their views, Ms. Metcalfe said. Peter Duda, executive vice president and co-lead of the global issues and crisis practice at Weber Shandwick, said that his shop has seen an uptick in demand from clients who want crisis preparedness plans that address a “new, more highly politicized environment.” Managing reputations and brand equity is taking up more of the firm’s time since the election, he said. For example, Weber Shandwick was recently contacted by a “U.S. multinational financial services company that wants our help to protect its brand and corporate reputation in Mexico, given the anti-American sentiment that’s growing due to the administration’s proposed policies,” Mr. Duda said. The work will include a simulation drill for the management team that will offer up a fictitious crisis -- a piece of information that quickly spreads to the news media, for example—and provide a forum for discussing the various ways they can respond or “manage the repercussions of inaction.” Another PR agency executive said his team advised the CEO of a large technology client to publicly avoid speaking about “things that could draw the ire of the new environment in Washington,” such as immigration policy. If the CEO is asked publicly about what’s happening in Washington, the client is being advised to “keep to things about the business, and business in the new environment,” this executive said. In the last two months, half a dozen clients have reached out asking for help in evaluating whether they have “vulnerabilities” that might make them a target or in dealing with actual crises related to the Trump administration, said Don Baer, CEO of Burson-Marsteller. That is an unusual amount of activity, he said. Even companies who likely “would never be targeted” by President Trump, including some Fortune 300 clients, are asking for support, said Kris Balderston, president of global public affairs at FleishmanHillard. The president “doesn’t know they exist, but everyone is kind of afraid.” To get in front of any potential dust-up, Mr. Grabowski said his firm is also helping clients with preventive measures, like proactively sending factsheets to Congressmen with information about clients’ contributions to jobs, taxes and charities in their districts. “Managing Donald Trump is like managing a boss,” he said. “Don’t become a target. Never pick a fight.” Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print CONTENT FROM OUR SPONSOR Deloitte CMO Insights and Analysis from Deloitte Using Blockchain for Loyalty Rewards Customer loyalty rewards programs could benefit from blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that facilitates transactions in a secure, digitized environment.

Less than a year after being hired and promised full-time positions by GM and union officials, the workers are out of a job. Medical insurance is running out at the end of the month, and there are few prospects for decent jobs in a city where 117,000 workers are unemployed. The job cuts in Detroit provide a far more realistic picture of the US economy than soaring stock markets or the Fed officials’ fantasies about “full employment.” Yet the layoff of 1,300 workers was not even deemed newsworthy by the local media. It also did not rate a mention by President Trump, who has appointed GM’s CEO to his corporate advisory board. The Detroit job cuts follow more than 2,000 GM layoffs in Lansing, Michigan, and Lordstown, Ohio in January. They anticipate a far greater onslaught as US corporations restructure in response to the global economic slowdown and increasing international competition. In the US, automakers are cutting production due to a growing glut of unsold cars. Commercial aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which cut eight percent of its workforce last year, announced Friday that 1,880 workers had accepted voluntary retirements. The company said more job cuts are expected in 2017 amid falling orders and tight competition with European-based Airbus, which announced 1,200 job cuts a few months ago. A new layoff announcement is made virtually every day in the retail, banking and technology sectors. These are part of an international process. On Wednesday, China’s labor minister, Yin Weimin, said the country will cut another 500,000 steel and coal jobs this year. Last year, 726,000 workers lost their jobs in the coal and steel industries, or 40 percent of the 1.8 million jobs the government said would be eliminated in those industries as part of a massive restructuring of state enterprises. In addition to the job cuts, corporations are seeking to transform their workforces into largely casual, temporary laborers, hired and fired at will, like the Detroit-Hamtramck GM workers. According to the Government Accountability Office, contingent workers now comprise 40.4 percent of all employees. Under Obama, 95 percent of all new jobs created in the US since the so-called economic recovery began have been part-time and temporary. In the European Union, more than half of all new jobs since 2010 have been through temporary contracts. The corporations are also accelerating their plans to dump their pensions and retiree health care obligations and continue to shift the cost of medical coverage on to workers. This month, 22,600 retired coal miners or their widows were notified that they will be losing health care benefits on April 30, when funding for their insurance plans expire. More than one million working or retired Americans are currently covered by pension plans that are in imminent danger of insolvency, according to the Pension Rights Center. The Trump administration, packed with billionaires, is planning to slash corporate taxes and eliminate workplace safety, environmental and labor regulations. In his address to the joint session of Congress on Tuesday, Trump declared that his government has “undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job crushing regulations.” The increase in military spending outlined in his new budget will be paid for by slashing food stamps and other essential programs, while the ultra-reactionaries appointed to key agencies set their sights on the privatization of public education and the elimination of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. As Wall Street is celebrating the Trump administration’s plans for a massive handout to the corporations and banks, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka has pledged that his corporatist and anti-working class organization is “absolutely” committed to partnering with Trump. Trump’s fascistic rants against immigrant workers and endless claims that foreign countries and foreign workers are destroying jobs and lowering wages is a calculated effort, aided and abetted by the unions, to divide the working class and block a unified response to the escalation of the class war policies at home and ever greater imperialist militarism abroad. Responding to the speech, Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, told Fox News that the unions were prepared for Trump to “rewrite the rules of the economy,” particularly on trade and immigration policy. Trump’s speech was the president’s “finest moment,” the union head said, signaling that “he’s about to start doing business rather than playing for the camera—that was a good sign.” Far from condemning the president’s xenophobic and racist slanders against immigrants, the AFL-CIO head signaled his support for an even more brutal immigration policy, including against legal residents. “I was actually pleasantly surprised,” Trumka said, “to hear him say the system is broken and its legal immigration, as well as undocumented people—he talked about them a lot—but this was the first time he spoke about legal immigration being used to drive down wages. We’ve been saying that for a long time.” Trumka said that workers voted for the president because “they wanted him to rewrite the rules of the economy—not for the rich, not for the wealthy, not for corporate America, not for Wall Street but for them—and so he’s been a mixed bag on that.” The unions would tout the good things he did and criticize the bad, Trumka said, echoing the lie that trade wars and mass deportation were good for American workers. “Will we partner with him? Absolutely,” Trumka said. “Will we partner with him to try to rewrite the immigration rules of the country? Absolutely… Using the bully pulpit to say this is your country, this is where you owe your allegiance, this is where you should be investing and building, that is a good thing.” The trade unions have been a chief conduit for spreading nationalist poison among workers for a very long time. In the early 1980s, as American capitalism fell into decline and its corporations confronted international competitors, the unions promoted economic nationalism to justify their integration into the structure of corporate management and collusion in the destruction of the jobs and living standards of the workers they claimed to represent. While the unions have worked closely with the Democrats in overseeing the attack on jobs and wages for decades, they now see income opportunities in Trump’s efforts to entice corporations to “Buy American, Hire American.” This has nothing to do with the interests of workers. Rather, the union executives want to restore their lost income through the influx of new dues-paying members, regardless of whether they are earning poverty wages. The unions are not “workers’ organizations,” but labor-management syndicates that are hostile to the interests of the working class. New organizations of struggle, including rank-and-file factory and workplace committees, democratically controlled by workers and committed to the methods of the class struggle, must be built to resist the coming attacks on jobs, living standards, essential social services and all the basic social rights of the working class. Above all, workers must reject economic nationalism. Workers in every country face the same struggles and confront the same enemy: the global capitalist system, which enriches a handful of billionaires at the expense of the broad masses of working people whose collective labor creates society’s riches. To unite the working class—black, white, native-born and immigrant, in the US and around the world—workers must build a political movement, independent of both capitalist parties, the Democrats and Republicans, to fight for international socialism and against the danger of world war.

Aerojet Rocketdyne's electric engines enable Intelsat's 33e to be operational  It's a first, Aerojet Rocketdyne Inc.'s , a subsidiary of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:AJRD), 100-volt fuel-efficient electric propulsion subsystem has enabled Intelsat's Epic Next Generation (EpicNG) satellite to become operational. The NextGen satellite launched in the summer is now online, fully functional. Intelsat 33e represents the inaugural mission of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 100-volt fuel-efficient electric propulsion subsystem. This improved fuel efficiency reduces propellant mass by several hundred pounds, helping to enable the high throughput capability of this new Intelsat Epic Next Generation (EpicNG) satellite. The launch was in summer, and now the system is officially online. Aerojet Rocketdyne's rocket engines are now providing in-flight maneuvers for the Intelsat 33e communications satellite, that was launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana on August 24. Boeing Satellite Systems International, which built the satellite, has announced that the spacecraft is now operational.  The electric propulsion subsystem provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne includes a 4.4kW power processing unit, relay box, electrical harnessing and six 2.2kW MR-510 electric arcjet thrusters. Aerojet Rocketdyne has flown more than 170 MR-510 arcjet thrusters with 100 percent mission success. Intelsat 33e is the second of six Intelsat EpicNG satellites being built by Boeing. Intelsat EpicNG is a high performance, next generation satellite platform that delivers global high-throughput capability. Intelsat 33e offers coverage in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In addition to the electric propulsion subsystem, Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion on the Intelsat 33e mission includes 16 monopropellant rocket engines: 12 four-Newton MR-111C hydrazine and four 22-Newton MR-106L hydrazine engines, all of which provide attitude control and adjustment, east-west stationkeeping, spin control, decommissioning and settling burns. The MR-111 and MR-106 engines have extensive flight history, each with more than 2,000 flight thrusters delivered with 100 percent mission success.  The remaining three Intelsat EpicNG satellites, also being built by Boeing, will all include the same complement of six Aerojet Rocketdyne electric propulsion thrusters for north-south stationkeeping, and 16 hydrazine rocket engines. President Eileen Drake Aerojet Rocketdyne's CEO said, “Congratulations to all on another successful Intelsat mission, and the first mission for the 100-volt electric propulsion thrusters. “We are honored to continue our valued relationship with Boeing and to help enable the high throughput capability of the new Intelsat EpicNG satellites.”   http://www.Rocket.com  http://www.AerojetRocketdyne.com  http://boeing.com   Topical Tags :  New Products    Agencies    Systems    Satellite Operator    Service Provider      Regional Tags :  Asia/Asia Pacific    Middle East/Africa    Europe    North America         FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News Sentinel-2B soars and monitors from the soil to the sky... Copernicus' Earth Observation mission  ULA to launch NASA's JPSS-2 mission AtlanTechRF reveals their Satellite Simulator Systems' new SNG series at D.C. trade event Draper's GN&C expertise to play a crucial role with SSL's government-owned satellite servicing mission Next-generation satellite terminal makes market entry from Hughes Network Systems More News A plethora of products from Teledyne Microwave Solutions (TMS) presented at D.C. show...

This 2.5% improvement during 2016 amounts to nearly 190,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide savings, the equivalent of 1,200 flights between Abu Dhabi and London or the removal of over 40,000 cars from the road.  Fuel consumption is influenced by many factors such as the aircraft and engine type, the weight being carried and the duration of the flight. The airline is working on several key initiatives to optimise efficiency, both with the aircraft itself and through external collaboration with aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus. Richard Hill, Chief Operations Officer for Etihad Airways, said: “Fuel optimisation is a top agenda item for any successful and sustainable airline, with Etihad Airways no exception. There have been some encouraging results during 2016 and I’m delighted to see so many of our pilots fully engaged with the programme, as this has ensured additional learning opportunities and the identification of new measures that can deliver greater fuel savings in the years ahead. It’s a vital part of our sustainability efforts and we will continue to look for ways to improve our performance.” Reducing weight can be a vital part of fuel savings, with aircraft such as the A380 having a maximum take-off weight of 575 tonnes, equivalent to 115 African elephants or 218 Toyota Land Cruisers.  The airline has made a conscientious effort to reduce the weight of on-board items. A ‘weight out’ programme, which resulted in the removal or replacement of on board items, led to a fuel burn reduction of 1,100 tonnes of fuel per year. Weather plays a part in influencing aircraft fuel efficiency. The airline is investing in new technology such as the ‘Boeing Wind Uplink’ scheme to ensure that flight crews have the latest information on weather patterns, allowing them to plan for the optimum fuel performance of their aircraft during flight. Fuel burn performance is negatively impacted by seasonal fog, requiring additional holding fuel to be carried, inbound to Abu Dhabi and the airline is now collaborating with the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi to enable more accurate fog predictions. Internally, continuous reviews to holding fuel policy have allowed for more accurate calculation of additional fuel requirements, using past data to ensure adequate additional fuel requirements are met.  Airport staff are also supporting efforts to ensure that ground power is used instead of the auxiliary power unit when aircraft are on the ground. These and many other initiatives have led to the positive results delivered so far with different areas of the business such as Engineering, Airports and Guest Experience working to identify new areas where additional savings can be delivered. The environmental benefits are not only substantial but the efficiency improvement in 2016 compared to 2015 exceeds the emissions reduction goal that the industry has set itself, currently a 1.5% efficiency improvement across international aviation. By going beyond this Etihad Airways is also contributing to carbon neutral growth targets and the ultimate long term goal - for emissions to be fifty percent of 2005 levels by 2050.  Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Advertisement Rate Article: 1 Select ratingPoorOkayGoodGreatAwesome   Tweet comment (0) Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Pinterest Delicious Stumbleupon Digg Reddit EDITOR’S CHOICE 1 - 4 OF 12 Zine el Abidine Ben Ali convicted in Mariah Carey case Meet the Dubai kid who just created a live-saving invention!

Loading video... Roadshow Ford's new Stratasys 3D printer has the company dreaming big Innovative tool puts sideways spin on additive manufacturing and promises quicker car development. March 5, 2017 Transcript [MUSIC] We've been hearing for years about how 3D printing is poised to revolutionize car manufacturing. But it's still hard to grasp just how this rapidly maturing technology will up-end the status quo. [MUSIC] That's why I'm here at Ford's Research and Innovation Center in Dearborn, Michigan. To check out the company's new Stratasys Infinite Build 3D printer. This isn't just the company's most exciting new toy, it's got the potential to turn car design and manufacturing on its head, or more accurately, on its side. When you think about 3D printing, you probably picture a small horizontal platform. Upon which material is repeatedly layered to create something. The problem with that setup is that you can only build the object so high. The genius with the stratasys prototype machine is that it prints sideways, allowing for the creation of much larger objects. Ford is among the only companies to have access to this equipment. Boeing is also working with Stragasys to investigate the technology's potential for aerospace. And some trial work is being done in the medical field now too. The blue oval has only had this machine since November and right now it's still learning the machines capabilities and quirks. Trying to figure out how this tool can help develop better automobiles. This machine, what it does, is it takes that concept of this horizontal table, and it turns it up 90 degrees on its side. And it actually extrudes into the table from a horizontal feed. The other difference with this technology is the material supply, which is a very critical part of it. With conventional FDM machines Strategists' machines they use a filament to feed the material in. The filament is almost like a line from a weed whip that type of material. With this process it actually uses an micro pellet so the material looks a lot more like a very coarse powder. Because of that, this system is able to run for extended periods of time. The robot that we see here in the background is actually used for changing material containers. So, when the machine uses up a container material, the robot can actually reach up, remove that container, and put a new container in it's place. So it enables the machine to run continuously uninterrupted. Trying to figure out how many ways we can use it, what types of applications that we have in a big company like this, that's the biggest challenge. I think there's a lot of flexibility in what we can do. It can apply to manufacturing, prototyping, eventually to production, and touch pretty much every part of the vehicle. So that's really exciting to make our processes a lot more efficient and more stylish. So I think that there is a lot of excitement within the company because of the capabilities that it adds that we have not had before. There's definitely a learning curve at work Fords lab coats have already figured out that certain things are best printed out in certain orientation. And sometimes the machine can get lost and they [UNKNOWN] start a section over again. It's early date for this prototype tech so all of this is to be expected. It's not hard to envision machines like these helping to print not just prototype parts for concept cars or tool and [UNKNOWN] or multiple production plans but also eventually small volume parts for competition cars. Cars. Imagine Ford's GT WEC race car needs a new front splitter or wing for a particular race track. Engineers will soon be able to model the part on a computer and three print it in a matter of hours or a couple of days, instead of waiting weeks or even months. Eventually Ford helps 3D print signatures to the point where it can support big value production Helping to develop lighter-weight parts for cars and trucks. Who knows, maybe this tech will one day speed up the design and production process, to the point where yearly vehicle face-lifts can become commonplace again, or perhaps to where individual owners can customize their cars. Ford Stratasys 3D printer is still very much in beta And its researchers are just now starting to figure out what this incredible additive manufacturing toolbox can do. The hope and increasingly the plan is to use it to develop processes, tooling, and hard parts to bring cooler, more versatile vehicles to your driveway sooner. [MUSIC] And for less money.

Tags Business strategy Business, Asian Opinions Do winners always have to fight wars? The Business Times | Stephanie Luo | Monday, Mar 6, 2017 Photo: The Business Times Stephanie Luo The Business Times Monday, Mar 6, 2017 THE conventional wisdom is that in business, there are rarely winners without losers. And sometimes, the path to success is littered with the bodies of your competitors. But those who read Sun Zi Bingfa: Strategic Applications to Business and Marketing Practices will come away knowing that waging war is not necessary in order to emerge victorious. Inspired by Sun Tzu's Art of War, Wee Chow-Hou, professor of strategy and marketing at the Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, uses the concepts of fighting military battles to illustrate a relationship between war and business. In his book, he argues that you do not need to go around killing your business competitors. In fact, subduing the enemy without doing battle is ultimately the best strategy. Companies emerge stronger when they face intense competition, but they shouldn't enter into price, bidding or promotional wars against their rivals without careful analysis. Competition or the equivalent of a military war in the business context plays out these days in the form of price wars. In the Cola Wars, Coke and Pepsi waged a furious battle in the soda market in the 80s; in the sky wars, Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas slugged it out for market share in the airline industry in the 90s. Although the book advocates war as a last resort, it doesn't imply that battles will not be fought. For a leader to decide whether a nation should go to war, his moral influences are of utmost importance. As Sun Zi said, a warlord must not embark on a military campaign simply out of anger. Similarly, in business, a leader cannot be reckless in his decisions especially if it involves an entire nation. Citing North Korea as an example, Prof Wee said that the country shuts itself out as a form of "cold" war by refusing to engage in trade with other nations. In contrast to North Korea, China opened itself up to the world under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, in the 1978 move that tore down the "Bamboo Curtain". Eventually, this move encouraged other nations to trade with it. From a poverty-stricken nation dependent on agriculture to the world's largest manufacturing base today, China has proven that showing an open-door policy brings growth and opportunity. Sun Zi Bingfa also refers to the "blue-ocean" strategy for companies, defined as the "most logical way to generate growth and profits". A blue-ocean company is one that creates uncontested market space instead of competing in existing markets, which have shrinking profit margins and limited growth opportunities. Cirque du Soleil is an example of a successful blue-ocean company. It eliminated the use of animals that are the stock-in-trade of circuses and has instead woven in opera and ballet into its performances. Dyson, the makers of vacuum cleaners that run on cyclone technology, is another example; although there have been copycat versions of the British company's bladeless fans in China, Dyson has arguably been the leader in that market since 2009. While there is a need for the selective usage of offensive strategies, proactive defence is occasionally necessary when forces and resources are inadequate. Just as David could defeat Goliath, a small company is capable of picking a single position of the enemy and concentrate its forces there, adopting the "hit-and-run" strategy from guerrilla warfare to defeat its rivals. It is easy for the mind to drift while reading Sun Zi Bingfa because it gets repetitive in the middle, and similar points are supported by the same examples. But, the book is still a good read for those in the corporate world, which still has a lot to learn from the army. stephluo@sph.com.sg @StephLuoBT This article was first published on March 4, 2017.

They’re just moving to South Carolina. “So 1800 workers in Washington are finding themselves unemployed. At the same time, more than 3000 people in the Palmetto State have gone to work, begun training and started pumping new life into the economy. So why aren’t the two unions in Washington who are making this doleful announcement talking about that story? I’m just taking a shot in the dark here, but it might be because South Carolina is a right to work state and the union has already been roundly rejected by the workers there.” And the press won’t debunk them because that would step on an anti-Trump storyline.

Hide Caption 12 of 12 Story highlights MH370 vanished in 2014 with 239 people on board Families of those aboard are setting up a private search fund (CNN)The families of those aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have launched a campaign to privately fund a search for the aircraft, which disappeared nearly three years ago. Australia, China and Malaysia announced in January that they were ending their official search for the plane. MH370 was traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, when it vanished over the Indian Ocean with 239 people on board. JUST WATCHED Search for flight MH370 suspended Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Search for flight MH370 suspended 02:43 Jiang Hui, whose mother was on the plane, told CNN on Saturday that relatives were working to create an international fund made up of donations from the parties involved in the flight. He said he believes various companies should contribute to the fund, including the governments of the 14 countries where the passengers were from, plane manufacturer Boeing and Malaysia Airlines. Read More "The fund will be invested and the annual investment returns or interests will be used for the search of MH370," Jiang said. "Once the plane is found, the original donation will be returned to the donors, without interest." He did not provide a target amount for the fund. Decision not taken lightly In their January joint statement announcing the suspension of the search for the aircraft, Australia, China and Malaysia said the decision had not been taken lightly. "Despite every effort using the best science available, cutting edge technology, as well as modeling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field, unfortunately, the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," it said. The officials said they would not rule out another search if "credible" evidence were to emerge. Voice370, a support group for family members of those aboard the flight, released a statement expressing disappointment over the suspension. "Commercial planes cannot just be allowed to disappear without a trace," the statement said. "Stopping at this stage is nothing short of irresponsible, and betrays a shocking lack of faith in the data, tools and recommendations of an array of official experts assembled by the authorities themselves." RELATED: Timeline of MH370 disappearance The plane's disappearance remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries in modern history. Searchers spent millions of dollars scouring tens of thousands of square miles, but so far have yielded little new information about the plane's final moments. What we do know At 12:41 a.m. local time on March 8, 2014, MH370 departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport for Beijing. It was heading north but after its last message of "Good night Malaysian Three Seven Zero," it changed course toward the west, according to military radar. From there, investigators believe it turned south around the edge of Indonesia and across the vast Indian Ocean. Investigators confirmed in July that MH370 captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah had tracked a route deep into the Indian Ocean on his home flight simulator, very similar to the one officials believe the missing plane took. Grandparents, a newly graduated engineer, a young couple and a 2-year-old boy were among the hundreds of people on board MH370 when it vanished. Most of the passengers and crew were from China and Malaysia, but individuals and families from 14 different countries were also on board the missing flight. Theories Based on some of the wreckage that's been found, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau determined the wing flaps had been stowed when MH370 crashed. The report suggested the plane had been out of control, spiraling downward at a rate of almost 300 miles per hour at its last satellite transmission. These findings suggested "two early hypotheses," according to CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo; either that a fire on board the plane incapacitated everyone through smoke or fumes, or that a rapid decompression, perhaps because of a breach in a window, led to their deaths hours before the plane ran out of fuel and spiraled downward. But investigators still haven't been able to say for sure what caused the crash. CNN's Yuli Yang reported from Hong Kong and Susannah Cullinane wrote from Auckland.

What impact will the Trump administration have on feds? Read the latest in our First 100 Days section. “The tax code is probably longer than or as complex as trying to get through the Bible,” with many details now being debated, said Baca. Advertisement The most complicated issue is how imports and exports will be taxed, Baca said. The House of Representatives is considering a provision called the Border Adjustment Tax, which will increase and harden taxes on imports and exports. “It’s really pitted industries in town here [in Washington, D.C.] against each other,” he said. While traditional manufacturers like GE and Boeing support the plan, it’s heavily criticized by retailers in the automotive dealing and tech industries. “We live in a global economy, and the reality is that global markets, global supply chains, really allow us to have iPhones, clothes, food,” Baca said. Although this import and export tax might appear to be a good idea in the short term, driving businesses to work within the country, it would likely end up driving up the price of goods because the reason many companies export and import in the first place is to save money. Baca quoted a recent study stating consumers could expect to spend more than $1700 more per year on even basic items if the plan goes through. “There’s this whole notion about this being able to bring back more jobs to America. The reality is that I don’t know if there’s a lot of evidence that proves that,” Baca said. Many of the manufacturing jobs that left the U.S. are slowly becoming automated — and they’re not about to switch back to U.S. workers. “I think we need tax reform that protects current jobs. Probably one that doesn’t include the Border Adjustment Tax,” he said. Baca said that he’d prefer a tax reform that spurs companies to keep prices competitive and create jobs, while also lowering taxes on businesses. Instead, Baca hopes to recoup lost revenue by reexamining wasteful government spending. The current plan, in conjunction with cuts to other taxes, “allows them to take a trillion dollars in revenue, which would come from the Border Adjustment Tax, to offset those cuts,” Baca said. However, the “trillion dollars that we’re talking about, of new revenue, that’s a hidden trillion-dollar tax increase on a lot of people,” Baca said. Since many manufacturing jobs are being replaced by automation, “Congress should be looking at ways of promoting things like STEM education, and engineering at that mid level,” said Baca, to ensure that people retain employment and have the skill set that will adapt to the future.

Indian-origin businessman shot... US shooting: Deep Rai, out of ... WASHINGTON: A Sikh man was told ''go back to your country'' before being shot at by a white gunman in an apparent hate crime that comes on the heels of a similar episode last week in Kansas that claimed the life of an Indian engineer. Deep Rai, a 39-year-old US citizen of Sikh heritage, was shot while he was cleaning his car in his driveway in the city of Kent, near Seattle, Washington, according to the local media. Rai, who survived the shooting, and an eyewitness, told authorities the gunman asked him to go back to his country after an altercation, before shooting him and speeding away. The incident is being investigated as a hate crime and authorities are on the lookout for the man, who had masked the lower half of his face at the time of the attack. The incident has alarmed the Indian community in the region, which is home to more than 1,00,000 Indians, including 30,000 Sikhs, according to local community leaders. Some of them immigrated to the area more than 110 years ago, concurrent with the large-scale arrival of European immigrants. In fact, Kent is couple of hours south of Bellingham, where the first recorded anti-Indian, anti-Sikh riots took place in 1907. While Washington -- home to Microsoft, Boeing, Amazon, and Starbucks among other companies -- is a Democratic-voting state broadly aligned with liberal west coast sensitivities, there are deeply conservative pockets in semi-urban areas outside Seattle and parts of Eastern Washington. Local community leaders say they are ''shaken and very frustrated at the hate and rhetoric that is being spread today about anyone that looks different, who looks like an immigrant." ''Based on anecdotal evidence, more and more people are saying inappropriate things to Sikh men. The stigma attached to being a racist has been erased from the community,'' Jasmit Singh, a Sikh resident of Renton, near Kent told reporters. ''Investigating this as an anti-Sikh hate crime is critical, because without our government agencies recognizing hatred for what it is, we can't combat the problem.'' Singh said there has been a rise in verbal abuse and uncomfortable encounters recently, ''a kind of prejudice, a kind of xenophobia that is nothing that we've seen in the recent past,'' recalling the aftermath of 9/11. ''But at that time, it felt like the administration was actively working to allay those fears. Now, it's a very different dimension,'' he added. In fact, many civil rights groups are now speaking up against the permissiveness of anti-immigrant sentiments and xenophobia after the election of Donald Trump, with a spike in hate crimes following the rise of the alt-right movement. President Trump has condemned ''hate and evil in all its forms'' but on occasions, he and some of his aides and surrogates have displayed thinly-disguised animosity towards immigrants and minorities in the guise of protecting American borders, its workers, and its jobs.

BUSINESS Don't expect a space race. SpaceX and NASA need each other Dragon spacecraft SpaceX In 2014, SpaceX unveiled a version of its Dragon spacecraft that would accommodate a crew. In 2014, SpaceX unveiled a version of its Dragon spacecraft that would accommodate a crew. (SpaceX) Samantha MasunagaContact Reporter SpaceX, the upstart company, and NASA, the government agency, both have plans to venture to Mars and orbit the moon. But that doesn’t mean they’ve launched a new space race. In fact, NASA has long been SpaceX’s most important customer, providing contracts to deliver cargo and eventually astronauts to the International Space Station. And the Hawthorne company will need NASA’s technical support to achieve the first of its grand ambitions in deep space. SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk acknowledged as much last week, shortly after announcing that SpaceX would launch two private, paying individuals on a weeklong lunar flyby in 2018. “SpaceX could not do this without NASA,” Musk tweeted. “Can’t express enough appreciation.” NASA, on the other hand, has come to rely on SpaceX and other companies for transport to the space station as its funding has tightened. In today’s dollars, the agency’s budget is about half what it was at the peak of the 1960s, and down from the 1990s. In the wake of the SpaceX news, NASA issued a statement that said it is “changing the way it does business through its commercial partnerships,” in part to “free” the agency to focus on rockets and spacecraft to go beyond the moon into deep space. “The whole idea is that NASA is at the point of a spear,” said Howard McCurdy, professor in the school of public affairs at American University. “It’s like exploration of any terrestrial realm. This is the way the model is supposed to work.” Indeed, the rapid ascent of Musk and other space industry pioneers is validation of the public-private partnership envisioned when Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984. By the mid-2000s, NASA was signing contracts with the private sector to fill in for its own funding constraints and the impending retirement of the space shuttle program. In 2006, SpaceX won its first NASA award for $278 million to help develop the company’s now-workhorse Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon space capsule. It later received an additional $118 million, and SpaceX contributed a total of about $454 million of its own funds to finish development, according to a NASA report. We would not be the company that we are today without that early support from NASA. — Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president Two years later, SpaceX won a $1.6-billion NASA contract to transport cargo to the space station. The deal came as the fledgling company of about 400 employees was starting to successfully launch the Falcon 1 from an atoll in the Marshall Islands. It was not just NASA’s financial resources and technical support that helped SpaceX, said company President Gwynne Shotwell, but also the agency’s trust. “We would not be the company that we are today without that early support from NASA,” Shotwell said. “We would have made it, but it would have been more of a struggle, it would have taken us longer.” A major milestone for the partnership came in 2012 when SpaceX launched its first NASA cargo load, making it the first private company to send a spacecraft to the space station. Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at the Teal Group, said the NASA supply missions gave SpaceX “almost instant credibility." "Having NASA as an anchor client allowed them to have enough revenue flow so that they could establish themselves and eventually diversify and get some commercial contracts and eventually to be able to get into the military establishment,” he said. Today, SpaceX and Boeing Co. are developing separate crew capsules as part of NASA contracts to transport astronauts to the space station. SpaceX noted that this NASA program provided most of the funding to develop the Dragon 2 spacecraft, which will make the moon trip. It is planning to conduct the first test flight of the Dragon crew capsule in November, followed by a flight test with humans in May 2018. Once operational crewed flights to the space station are underway, the company said it would launch its Dragon capsule atop the Falcon Heavy rocket, which was developed with SpaceX funds, for the lunar mission in late 2018. Other well-known, newer space companies have also recently been awarded NASA contracts, including Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and British billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. Both of those companies intend to target the suborbital space tourism markets, though Blue Origin has also unveiled plans for a launch vehicle called the New Glenn, which the company has said could lift astronauts to low-Earth orbit or even beyond. Blue Origin is interested in developing a lunar spacecraft and lander, and eventually, a delivery service for the moon, according to a white paper obtained by the Washington Post that the company sent to NASA officials and President Trump’s transition team. Virgin Orbit, which recently split from Virgin Galactic, is focused on launching small satellites. NASA’s role as a “development catalyst” has been part of the agency’s objectives since its earliest days, said Sean O’Keefe, a former NASA administrator and current university professor at Syracuse University. “The idea was to spin that into opportunities for commercial market potential for other discoveries, for those who would build on the knowledge base of what was determined, discovered or invented as a means to overcome obstacles and take it to another level,” he said. Moving human presence deeper into space is going to require the best of NASA and the private sector. — Phil McAlister, NASA division director for commercial spaceflight development Phil McAlister, division director for commercial spaceflight development at NASA, called the recent advances of the space companies “really positive.” "Moving human presence deeper into space is going to require the best of NASA and the private sector," he said. Over the last 10 years, he added, NASA’s private partners have become more technologically mature and capable. It’s unclear whether NASA will provide any further assistance for the SpaceX moon shot, though Musk emphasized that the agency would have first priority if it wanted to work with SpaceX on a lunar orbit mission. NASA also has its own plans to fly around the moon with a crew in tow. Last month, NASA said it would look into the feasibility of putting a crew on the first flight test of its Orion spacecraft and heavy-lift rocket, Space Launch System, in 2019. That mission is set to go around the moon to test maneuvers that would be necessary to eventually go farther into deep space. While both SLS and Falcon Heavy will have heavy-launch capabilities, they may not necessarily be redundant, said Dava Newman, former NASA deputy administrator and Apollo program professor of astronautics at MIT. “If in the next two years there’s two capabilities for heavy-lift, that’d be awesome,” she said. “Having one system leaves you vulnerable” to system failures. The nature of NASA’s mission, and its funding, is up in the air under the new Trump administration, however. The agency is still waiting on Trump to appoint a new administrator, and there has been debate in Washington about whether NASA should go back to the moon or venture ahead toward Mars. SpaceX’s private moon mission could influence that debate, McCurdy said. “It certainly complicates the argument that the moon-firsters would like to make.” Both SpaceX and NASA plan flights to Mars. Last year, Musk unveiled plans to colonize the Red Planet, sending up to a million people on more than 1,000 spaceships, stretched over decades. He called for a public-private partnership, but the nature of any collaboration was unclear. The two entities will team up on at least one launch — SpaceX’s first Red Dragon uncrewed mission to Mars, now aimed at 2020, two years behind Musk’s original timeline. NASA has more than 50 years of experience with Mars exploration and will provide SpaceX with technical support during the mission, which could include help with data transmission from deep space, flight systems and engineering, and mission design and navigation. In exchange, NASA is interested in the entry, descent and landing data from the capsule. SpaceX has started testing some of that supersonic retro-propulsion technology by landing its first-stage rocket booster on floating platforms and on land, a technique that could be important for future Mars landings, said Ellen Stofan, former NASA chief scientist. NASA has successfully landed rovers on Mars weighing up to almost a ton. The robots have dropped to the planet’s surface in air bags, using rockets, and with the assistance of cables extended from a “sky crane” — all methods that are problematic for landing humans. A human mission would weigh considerably more, somewhere between 10 and 20 tons, Newman said. “It is an order of magnitude greater than we’ve ever done,” she said. “We all want to figure out how to get to Mars. And one of the things we need to figure out is to get humans there safely.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Can Trump's White House investigate itself? Tuesday is election day in L.A.

Philip Corrie, 39, faced sentence for a string of burglaries, including one to a school and two break-ins to a church in two days. He kicked off his latest crime spree as he burgled Sutton Tankers on Boeing Way on the Preston Farm Industrial Estate in Stockton and stole a laptop from a staff locker room on December 12 last year. He went to Mandale Mill Primary School on Thorntree Road, Thornaby, which was undergoing building work, three days earlier. He stole a site manager’s laptop and hard drive from a portable building at 12 to 12.30pm. When spotted on the grounds, he claimed he was looking for work, Teesside Crown Court heard from prosecutor Rachel Masters today. He was detained but escaped and was arrested about a fortnight later. He was bailed, only to invade the staff area of the Iceland warehouse on Castlegate, Stockton, rifled through handbags in a cloakroom and pinched two purses containing £40 and 10 Euros on January 4. He was challenged here too, and said he was a new starter. Staff saw through his lies. He was arrested and confessed to his crime, but was bailed a second time. He broke into the Stockton Baptist Tabernacle church on The Square on January 9, walked into an empty worship area, stole a guitar and sold it immediately at a bargain shop. He burgled the church again the next day, taking an amplifier. Teesside Crown Court The belongings were recovered but the minister spoke of disappointment at how Corrie had taken advantage of a place of hospitality. Corrie, of Cobden Street, Thornaby, admitted the five burglaries. He had 10 burglaries, mostly not at homes, on his record of 83 offences. Duncan McReddie, defending, said Corrie made candid confessions and, in a letter, showed remorse and unusual insight. “But that insight is overridden when he’s in the grip of addiction.” He said the scaffolder was a normal member of society when he kept his drug addiction at bay. “But when he goes back to the drugs, his need for his next fix is all-consuming,” added Mr McReddie. “Philip Corrie is not a man beyond redemption.” Judge Sean Morris said Corrie’s offending had tailed off but was now “back with a vengeance”. He told the offender, appearing in court via video link to Holme House Prison: “You’re middle-aged now. “You’ve had every opportunity under the sun given by you by the law courts to reform your ways but you steadfastly refuse to do so. “You’ve got to keep your hands off other people’s property. You are an almost professional burglar. “You’ve had drug treatment and testing orders, supervision orders, community orders of every type. These cost a fortune. “They say prison is expensive. I shudder to think how much all those courses, all those probation officers have cost, all to no avail. “Take the time to have some introspection. Drugs are a lifestyle choice,” he added, jailing Corrie for 18 months.

A graveside service will be held 12:30 p.m. at the General Douglas McBride Veterans Cemetery. Reverend Glenn Tyrion of Trinity United Methodist Church will be officiating. Military honors will be rendered by the Roswell Veterans Honor Guard. William Henry Gay was born in Florence, Kansas September 26, 1919 to Agnes and Berry Gay. He and his younger sister, Amanda Marie, were raised in Newton, Kansas and had extended family in the Mennonite community of Goessel, a town just north of Newton. Agnes was widowed when Bill was just 3 years of age but that didn’t stop him from growing into a wonderful father and a man’s man who loved the outdoors, sports and other rugged pursuits. After high school graduation he attended Bethel College for one year then attended Pittsburg State Teachers College where he met the love of his life, Elma Jean McKinney, in an English literature class. She knew he needed help with his studies so he accepted and they were married June 22, 1941. Then-union came just 6 months before Pearl Harbor. At the time, Bill was a welder at a plant in Wichita which became Boeing Air Craft; he was an assistant foreman when they turned out the first B-29. His service time was with the Army at different locations in Kansas and Colorado. He was a Corporal, a Carbine Sharpshooter and a Surgical Technician. He was shipped overseas with the same National Guard Unit that he had trained with in Kansas so he was really glad to be reunited with boys from his hometown when they headed to war. He spent [auth] V.E. Day on a troop ship and after serving sue months overseas he was shipped back to the U.S. with orders to report to the Pacific arena conflict. However, he spent V.J. Day with Jean at her parents’ home in Fredonia, Kansas. He was always grateful to have been in the service of his country but that his tasks kept him from the terrible sites of active battles. Bill decided to finish his education and received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Denver University and his master’s degree in industrial arts from Kansas State University. After teaching 3 years in Wichita, he and Jean moved to Denver where Bill taught graphic arts at Kepner Junior High School for 30 years. His class won la Place at the State Fair 8 years in a row, even over high school students. When they decided to divide the competition into high school and junior high, his students won first place for 18 more years. Bill and Jean adopted three children. First, Curtis, then three years later, Rick and after four more years, Kendra. The family enjoyed fishing, hiking and camping. When it became clear that those activities kept Jean in the camp kitchen, they decided to take up rock collecting. They tried antique bottle collecting too but always found Rock Hounds to be friendlier and more sharing. The family enjoyed ice skating and skiing in the mountains west of Denver. As teachers the family enjoyed 3 months of the year exploring the mountains and desert areas of the western US. Bill and Jean joined the Methodist Church when living in Wichita and transferred their membership to Bethany United Methodist Church in Denver where Bill was baptized on March 3″1,1956. Bill helped with the building project and was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and taught the adult Sunday School class. Jean was the organist and choir director for 25 years. Bill never missed a day without devotions at the breakfast table, a month without a tithe or a camping trip that didn’t include finding the closest church where the children could keep up with perfect attendance. He truly loved the Lord. Bill also enjoyed being an Indian Guides member with his sons Rick and Curt as well as his role as Scout Master of the Boy Scouts in Lakewood, Colorado. Kendra kept her parents busy sitting in the stands cheering for her during her many years of softball and track. Bill and Jean rarely missed an activity their children were involved in, whether it was a school play, a madrigal choir group, a sporting event or their kids participation in the Golden Youth Symphony Orchestra where Curt played the French Horn, Rick the percussion and Kendra the violin. As you may all know, the Gays loved rocks…. the more the merrier. Rocks became their life. In fact, they spent many wonderful years collecting rocks, polishing rocks, making jewelry and competing in rock shows. They were selected winners of the “Education Through Sharing Award” by the American Federation of Mineralogical Societies at a National Convention and were honored locally at the Rocky Mountain Federation Gem and Mineral Show. The year before Bill retired he was an exchange teacher to Australia. They exchanged jobs, houses and even cars. Bill and Jean lived in Adelaide for 1 year and explored their adopted continent on their free time … of course collecting rock specimens along the way. Bill and Jean moved to Roswell where Jean’s 2 sisters had relocated in retirement. Since Roswell had such a great climate they decided to move after Kendra was married. That Thanksgiving they woke up to 2 inches of snow! As members of the Chaparral Rock Hound club, they taught lapidary class for the enrichment programs in the Roswell school district. They were also involved in the local RS VP group and loved their time learning new skills in lapidary and jewelry making. No one loved the pursuits of rock collecting and the friends they had in the club more than Bill. He and Jean returned to Australia and spent a month in New Zealand visiting friends and rock hounds they had met before. But their fondest times were spent in the adventure of collecting the next pretty rock and bringing it home to find it’s inner beauty. After toughing it out with declining health and missing his wife of 74 years. Bill joined his loved ones and his Savior, peacefully and joyously with his children at his side. Bill was preceded in death by his father, mother and sister and by his loving wife Jean. He is survived by his children Curtis Gay of Denver, Rick and Dianne Gay of Trenton, Texas and Kendra and Gary Rhoades of Burlington, Colorado. Grand children Joshua Ray and Heather Roots, Karah Reygers and husband Joseph, Kolby Melia and husband Daniel. Great Grand children Bailee, Aaron, Rachel, Donovyn, Dyanna, Benton, Abby, Baylor, Jacoby and Bowen. He will be missed by 2 nieces, a nephew and many, many friends. Arrangements are under the personal care of LaGrone Funeral Chapel. Online condolences may be made at lagronefuneralchapels.com.

Pic Courtesy/Amul It was a matter of a minute. At 9.15 every morning in the late 1960s, Uttara Parikh entered the Air India office. The phone rang an exact minute after, at least once every week. It was her boss Bobby Kooka's crisp 9.16 am greeting. Keen to crack a fresh idea for a hoarding he had drummed up at night or to tweak an artwork, Air India's commercial director was bent on apprising his young assistant of plans the moment she stepped into their office, then in the Bank of India Building at Fort. The Maharajah mascot was Kooka's 1946 inspiration. By the 1960s the national carrier had already put out some of the world's best airline advertising. Cleverly conceived, executed with rare flair and finesse, the hoarding at Kemps Corner preceded the bigger billboard which fronts Air India's present hub. That went up with the portly mascot quipping, 'Nariman had a point and I'll be on it'. In response to JRD Tata's 1970 announcement that the company would be headquartered at the Nariman Point tip of Marine Drive, the ad drew the Maharajah squatting atop that iconic tower soon also to boast the country's first escalator. Amul's stark indictment of politicians after the 26/11 terror tragedy.âÂÂPic Courtesy/Amul Parikh followed a drill. Having heard Kooka's instruction, she made two calls. One was to Bahadur, the J Walter Thompson artist, who'd rush on motorbike across from the agency on PM Road in 10 minutes. Bahadur sketching the visual, she dialled a second number. That was for Creado, the man who actually shimmied up the scaffolding to hand paint what was on paper - a skill lost to public sight around the year 2000 with the arrival of printed flexes. "Using refined language and imagery, our ads relied on humour to convey civic messages before Amul did," Parikh says. "You think Maharajah and you automatically think Air India. The Maharajah legacy continues. And he has moved with the times. He's slimmer and savvier now. Some campaigns have depicted him with headphones and gadgets even," says Air India's Commercial Director Pankaj Srivastava. This banner framed by Nana Chudasama saluted the resilience and recuperative spirit of Bombay a week after serial bomb blasts ripped the city in March 1993. Pic Courtesy/History on a Banner I dig delightedly into cartons crammed with ad albums. Leafing through, I can smell the 1960s and '70s at the turn of each brittle page. City-specific gems include the Maharajah gasping 'Bombay takes my breath away... 60% of air pollution is caused by automobiles' and the jollier 'Love, sax and all that jazz' celebrating a 1990s Jazz Yatra with the tubby mascot in longhaired rock star avatar. Aviation-related ads show him in charming Chinaman garb, declare 'Confucius say Man who fly Boeing, know where he going'. And, as a 1998 tribute to 50 years of Indian women pilots, 'There's no clipping their wings'. Guffaw-worthy too is the smart series asserting punctuality: from 'Quicksand – 92% on time in Dhahran' and 'Mall the time in the world – 94% on time in Singapore', to my favourite, 'Hey big mamma, on time me comma – 100% on time in Africa.' When JRD Tata announced the plan for Air India to move into its new headquarters, this was the Maharajah's quip. It referred to corporator KF Nariman, who masterminded the Back Bay Reclamation that formed the commercial district of Nariman Point. PicâÂÂCourtesy/Air India I get delicious background details from Saleem (Bittu) Ahmadullah and Gita Mistry, whose mothers were Kooka's sisters. I largely owe Bittu my love of local history, ever since he led me on a heritage trail interesting enough to trundle along tightly clutching an eight-month bellyful of baby! The cousins share how Kooka and JWT artist Umesh Rao tried a thousand designs of the bowing Maharajah with perpetually closed eyes, experimenting with different girth measures for him. He was intended as an overdressed flunkey, not courteous royalty. "The mischievous character was Bobby's personality. He taught us to laugh at ourselves," says Saleem. "To get the Air India ad you needed to be urbane with a touch of sophistication," adds Gita. "It was iconoclastic but worked in days when we were more self-confident." This sense of loss is as strongly felt by Karan Johar. In an interview with Amul adman and mid-day merry man Rahul daCunha, the filmmaker said, "At the moment we seriously lack humour. Amul hoardings stand for three qualities - morality, intelligence and humour. If only our people had all three." Johar's earliest memory of an Amul ad is the one on Marine Drive (beside Bachelor's ice cream stall near Patel Bridge) thanks to his movie mogul father Yash Johar. In the utterly butterly sunny new book, Amul's India 3.0, based on 50 years of Amul advertising by daCunha Communications, he says, "Dad would drop me to school and college. When the 1970s property boom led to more and more high-rise buildings mushrooming across Nariman Point, Nana Chudasama's banner protested this dangerous trend on reclaimed land. Pic Courtesy/History on a Banner I remember the spot on Marine Drive where he'd crane his head out of the car window to see something, chuckle, stick his head back in and drive on. As a child I'd no idea what he was chuckling at. Those days you looked out of the window and appreciated the landscape outside, unlike today where your face is stuck in a phone. Amul topicals are never offensive because they aren't personal. It is always gentle sarcasm." That particular Amul billboard was superbly situated. On view for about a decade from the mid 1980s, it still gave the impression of offering twice-monthly changed ads for far more years. I remember wishing the car or cab that hurtled me down the promenade would halt right here in traffic, to catch more than a passing glimpse of those taglines. The ad strategically faced office-goers in vehicles snaking along the street's north-south axis. Evenings saw it lend the Queen's Necklace a sparkle beyond its pearl strand of lights. The Amul message was mostly a chirpy chide, a naughty nudge, at worst a rap without rancour. When a butter brand becomes the barometer of a nation, how could it not scoop urbs prima in Indis within its savvy sweep? The longest-running outdoor advertising campaign on the planet continues to benignly berate local civic and political apathy. Whether the city is troubled or terrorised, flooded or neglected, the polka-dot dressed Amul girl's heart beats for Bombay. She brings laughter to an age of lout-giri. Shining her vibe from prime spots across town, the little moppet with a blue fringe over saucer eyes, imagined by Sylvester daCunha and visualised by Eustace Fernandes in the 1960s, reigns as a one-woman champion. She is her own Aam Aadmi Party. Ribbing without ridiculing, teasing not taunting, her puns are fun, her jokes never jibes. Staying cool in an insanely volatile era, she urges us to likewise. A short hop from the Air India hoarding, a banner has fluttered in the Arabian Sea breeze for 40-odd years. Nana Chudasama's message blazes on, fiery as the sunsets opposite this site (outside Talk of the Town, where Pizza By the Bay is currently a corner cafe). His terse terminology makes the former sheriff and president of the NGO, I Love Mumbai, something of our original tweeter. Narendrasinhji Mansinghji Chudasama began writing banners with the headline: 'Say it fast, say it slow, rationing must go'. The chronicler of the common man's concerns endearingly says, "I'm a fluke. Politicians provide me with ready fodder for my phrases." Stark, in the absence of visual illustration of his words, Nana's wit is yet enjoyed widely to tickle our collective funny bone. Churchgate station within waving distance means millions of commuters stop in their tracks on the pavement below his office. Grinning as they read lines like 'Save mangroves - our natural coastguards', 'Dalal Street turns into Halal Street - investors slaughtered' and 'Police - decades of service cannot be erased by one black sheep', alluding to rampant criticism against cops after the Marine Drive rape case shocked the city in May 2005. "This is legitimate dissent," says the author of Bombay's most audacious banner. "One message asked 'How long will the tolerant tolerate intolerance?' Other questions have got us into trouble with powers such as the MNS vandalising our premises. I do think one has to remain fearless, speak out. Satire has its special place but my banners are very direct when called for. It's wonderful we at least have a degree of freedom of expression compared with the rest of the country." Is it fading freedom? Fans and followers of Nana's fixture outside Soona Mahal will surely echo what Akshay Chudasama wished for his father in the book, History on a Banner: "May the sun never set on your balcony, to which the city's eyes continue to turn."

Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint New Delhi: Budget airline SpiceJet Ltd will reserve its fourth row for female passengers travelling alone, following a practice adopted by national carrier Air India Ltd. “(From) 8th March 2017 onwards SpiceJet will be reserving the whole of its 4th row for its solo women passengers. The initiative will be observed on all its flights across the fleet inclusive of both Boeings and Q400s (planes),” SpiceJet said in a statement on Monday. 8 March is International Women’s Day. “In case of a full flight scenario, males will be assigned window seats; whereas the aisle and middle seats (B, C and D, E) will be assigned to women on a first come first serve basis. The special seating arrangement is being catered to offer more ease to the solo female travellers, as moving out of the middle or the aisle seats is much easier thereby ensuring safety and comfort to them in case of an emergency and even otherwise,” the statement added. On 8 March, female passengers travelling alone will also be able to upgrade to SpiceMax seats if the latter are available. SpiceMax provides extra legroom, priority check-in, complimentary meal, priority baggage handling and priority boarding. “The airline will also be offering complimentary hot beverages and cookies to all women passengers on all its Boeing flights along with the F&B (food and beverage) service,” it said. Air India had from 18 January started reserving one row—six seats—in economy class for single women travellers on all its domestic flights. It was the first time an airline had taken such a step. SpcieJet has about 343 daily flights to 45 destinations on a 49-plane fleet and about 13% domestic market share.

Ogg March 6, 2017 4:04 pm EST Print Email Tweet 2017 may feel like it has been a year of surprises. The reality is that 2017 is just a continuation of yet another year of surprises. What is amazing now is that the current bull market is now turning 8 years old. 24/7 Wall St. has decided to feature a then versus now, and it is important to recall that the attitude of the investing public is truly night and day. Stocks have now hit all-time highs in 2017 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 Index, and even in the NASDAQ. Investors have bought after every single sell-off for over 5 years now, and those same investors are also looking for new ideas and overlooked opportunities. The S&P 500 Index bottomed at 666.79 on March 6, 2009. That was at 2,376.75 on last look, up a whopping 256%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a low of 6,469.95 on March 6, 2009. After having hit 21,000  The Dow was last trading at 20,972 for a gain of 224%. The NASDAQ hit a low of 1,265.52 on March 9, 2009, one trading day after the S&P and the Dow hit their lows. At about 5,850 on last look, that is a gain of 362%. The 10-year Treasury yield on March 6, 2009 was at a low of 2.77% — yet that yield is 2.50% some 8 years later. CNN’s closing bell title on March 6, 2009: Dow fights back… The blue-chip indicator musters a gain after hitting a 12-year low on the weak jobs report and bank woes. Now think about something for March 6, 2009 — The BLS reported on that day that employers had cut a whopping 651,000 jobs from their payrolls in February of 2009. This coming jobs report is calling for close to a gain of 200,000. It was also on March 6, 2008 that the BLS reported that unemployment rose to 8.1% from 7.6% the prior month — versus less than 5% now. Also noted back on March 6, 2009: GM’s survival was in doubt. Citigroup shares broke the $1.00 mark. GE shares hit $6.66 — they are $30 now. Split-adjusted: Apple shares were at $12.9 on March 6, 2009 and were $11.87 the next day, versus $139 today. Boeing shares dipped under $30 on March 6 and 9 (2009) — versus $180 now. The Dow was down over 6% for the week, and was down almost 25% year-to-date. The Dow was down 53% versus its all-time high on October 9, 2007. Wells Fargo slashed its quarterly dividend by 85% to $0.05 from $0.34) to save $5 billion per year.

(Photo: REUTERS)  Share  Comments Get politics updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Theresa May’s flagship anti-terror law could be binned, her successor as Home Secretary signalled tonight. Amber Rudd fuelled fears the Counter Extremism Bill will be axed during an appearance before MPs and peers. Asked what had happened to the long-promised Bill and if “we are still going to have one”, she told the joint committee on National Security Strategy: “We are considering that at the moment. “I can’t give (you) complete confirmation but we are continuing to consider it.” Doubts have been mounting over the Bill’s future ever since it was announced in last year’s Queen Speech. Read More British military bases hit by two security breaches a DAY as number of incidents soars Critics said it failed to outline a clear definition of the problem it was designed to tackle. There have been repeated claims ministers were planning to shelve the laws. Home Secretary Amber Rudd was speaking to a House of Lords committee During an 80-minute grilling, she also admitted the Brexit -fuelled slump in Sterling could punch dents in the defence budgets. Officials had “hedged” the currency for two years but failure to rebound would hit spending plans, she said. “It won’t impact immediately. Of course, we don’t know where the currency will be in two years; time,” Ms Rudd added. “But it is something we are every aware of and could impact after two years if it is in the same place, if we have a situation where our purchasing power is down by 15%, it will have an impact.” Ministers have planned a range of foreign imports to add to Armed Forces’ hardware. It includes a deal to buy nine Boeing P8 spy planes for the RAF from the US, F35 Lightning II fighter jets and French steel for the new Dreadnought submarines carrying the Navy’s Trident nuclear missiles. Earlier, answering Home Office questions in the Commons, Ms Rudd said the UK would try aim to stay part of the European Arrest Warrant system after quitting the EU. She told MPs: “The European Arrest Warrant is an effective tool and is absolutely essential to delivering effective judgment to the murderers, rapists and paedophiles that we have managed to seek judgment on. The new F-35B Lightning II jet will be added to Britain's military arsenal (Photo: Getty) “It is a priority to ensure that we do remain part of it and I can also reassure honourable colleagues throughout the House that this is something that our European partners would like to achieve as well.” Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s outgoing national security adviser, Sir Mark Lyall-Grant, denied he had fallen out with Mrs May. He quits the role next month following claims No 10 was unhappy at the way he “mansplained” to the PM. But he said: “There is no truth in those reports. “It has been a great honour for me to be able to serve two prime ministers and I feel I’ve done my best with both those Prime Ministers. “Both of them have said they have been very happy with me.” Sir Mark insisted he “ever found it difficult to speak truth to power”. He added: “I have spent 37 years in government service and I feel the time has come to try something new.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Conservative Party European Union Home Office Theresa May Brexit Armed forces Politics Terrorism News all Most Read Most Recent RapeCCTV images of British backpacker 'held hostage and raped for two months' minutes before she was dramatically rescued The young woman was allegedly repeatedly beaten and sexually assaulted by a 22-year-old Cairns man she agreed to go on a road trip with International Space StationBizarre 'megaship' captured by International Space Station camera before Nasa 'dims the feed' Conspiracy theorists are claiming Nasa may have adjusted the image to make the strange objects 'disappear' CrimeNursery worker arrested after CCTV 'shows her pushing four-year-old girl down flight of stairs' Sarah Gable, 52, was immediately fired from the childcare centre and later arrested on suspicion of simple assault and endangering the welfare of a child International Women's DayWomen urged to take the day off next Wednesday as part of 'Day Without a Woman' strike The group behind the Women’s March are encouraging women to take part in honour of International Women's Day RapeDad raped teenage daughter to 'prove sex was better with men' after she told him she was gay The 54-year-old reacted with "uncontrolled anger” by brutally attacking the 16-year-old who had confided in him that she was "struggling with her identity" ElephantsOne of Africa's oldest and largest elephants 'killed by poachers with a poisoned arrow' in Kenya Satao II, a 50-year-old 'giant tusker' named after another famed giant killed in 2014, was found dead on Monday - now there are only 30 left Tony BellewMum's heartfelt story of Tony Bellew saving son's life by standing up to bullies and telling them 'I'm his best mate' Laura Evison says the 16-year-old schoolboy 'was in a bad place' being severely bullied at school - until The Bomber stepped in The BudgetWhen is the Budget 2017?

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Mar 6, 2017 at 2:03PM The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) serves as the "mad scientist" wing of the U.S. Pentagon, responsible for building such things as anthropomorphic robots and super-secret spy planes. Perhaps it shouldn't come as a huge surprise that now, DARPA wants to put robots in space. The bigger surprise is that these will be peaceful robots, quietly tinkering on glitchy spacecraft and helping to extend the lifespan of satellites in orbit. It came from outer space -- and it had hands! (Artist's concept of what DARPA's RSV will look like.) Image source: DARPA. Department of Defense will open a space tow-truck service Last month, DARPA announced it has teamed up with Space Systems Loral (SSL) "to develop technologies that would enable cooperative inspection and servicing of satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO), more than 20,000 miles above the Earth, and demonstrate those technologies on orbit." DARPA calls this its Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites (RSGS) project, and its missions in orbit will include: High-resolution inspection of satellites in orbit Fixing "mechanical anomalies, such as solar array and antenna deployment malfunctions" Towing satellites that have left their planned orbits back into the correct flight path Upgrading satellites with new and additional payloads Refueling satellites that have run out of gas DARPA believes that if successful, RSGS could "radically [lower] the risks and costs of operating" both military and commercial satellites in GEO. Who is SSL? SSL is a division of Canadian space tech specialist MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates, the same company that last month agreed to buy U.S. satellite imaging specialist DigitalGlobe (NYSE:DGI) in a $2.4 billion deal. What will SSL do? DARPA will provide a "robotic module" including specialized arms for repairing satellites, a toolkit, and software to operate all of the above. SSL's role in RSGS will be to supply a spacecraft and integrate DARPA's module into it, thus forming one complete "robotic servicing vehicle," or RSV. SSL will then demo the RSV in orbit, after which it will offer to service defunct military and commercial satellites on a paid basis. Best of all, SSL gets to retain ownership of the RSV once the demo is done. As for what DARPA gets out of all this, SSL has agreed to offer discounted prices for servicing military satellites "throughout the operational life of the RSV." Additionally, DARPA will license its module technology to other private space corporations, receiving license fees for their use. Wait. I'm getting deja vu... I don't blame you. All of the above does sound a lot like NASA's Restore-L program to service satellites, doesn't it? I mean, even to the extent of DARPA making SSL its favored contractor, just as NASA did.  Well, DARPA addresses this confusion, too, explaining that the key differences between its RSGS program and NASA's Restore-L are: The RSGS RSV will be doctoring satellites in GEO -- farther from Earth and with more of a communications lag than Restore-L will experience in LEO (low earth orbit). Thus, whereas Restore-L can be remotely operated from Earth, RSGS will be a truly independent robot, working more or less autonomously at very high orbits. Additionally, Restore-L is purely a demonstration project, whereas the RSGS robot will be expected to remain in operation for some years after its demo is complete. Thus, it needs to be more robust and higher-reliability (and presumably, more expensive) than Restore-L. All that said, DARPA "has conducted extensive dialogues" with NASA regarding Restore-L, and will be exchanging information with its counterparts to accelerate development of both programs. What it means to investors Strange as it may seem, Canada-owned SSL is fast becoming a favorite of America's government aerospace and defense agencies. That's not great news for U.S. investors who might want to invest in SSL's parent company, whose stock for the time being is listed only in Toronto. It could also be bad news for local American aerospace companies like Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA). Boeing and Lockheed, as you may know, work together under the umbrella of the United Launch Alliance to perform services in space. As we reported last year, they are teaming up to build a space tow-truck service. At some time in the next few years, Boeing and Lockheed Martin plan to convert spent second-stage launch rockets into chassis for "space trucks" that can shuttle supplies around in orbit, refuel, and even make repairs on satellites. Orbital ATK has a similar plan, but it will use a custom-made Mission Extension Vehicle, or MEV, to refuel, tow around, and perform repairs on orbiting satellites. What's more, Orbital ATK may be first in this race, as it plans to put its first MEV in orbit as early as next year. But now SSL is joining in the fun. With backing from both NASA and DARPA as well, it's clear which horse the U.S. government is backing, even if it appears SSL will be last out of the gate. If ULA and Orbital ATK want to secure their place in this race, they need to get their respective space tow truck services in orbit -- and pronto. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends DigitalGlobe and Orbital ATK. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy. Author Rich Smith (TMFDitty) I like things that go "boom."

News Business Business Comment Peugeot-owner PSA is making nice as it takes control of Vauxhall but tough decisions lie ahead Brexit hangs over everything and the downside of Britain’s flexible economy is that it’s cheap to fire people  James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Monday 6 March 2017 15:30 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The Vauxhall Astra: Where will the new model be built? PSA Group boss Carlos Tavares was saying all the right things as his company’s acquisition of General Motors’ European arm, including Vauxhall, was confirmed.  “I trust my Vauxhall employees in the UK,” he said. “I know that they are skilled. I know that they are dedicated. I know that they are committed. As long as we improve their performance and we become the best, there is no risk they should fear”.  British ministers take note. There’s a lot you could learn from this man as regards diplomacy.  Read more GM May Book $4.5 Billion Writedown on Opel Sale to PSA Peugeot PSA Peugeot Buys GM's European Business for $2.4 Billion, Creating Region's Second-Biggest Carmaker Peugeot-Citroën plays down fears of Vauxhall job losses However, away from the honeyed words, hard negotiations lie ahead and while the company’s factories at Luton and Ellesmere Port are safe for now, their long-term futures remain in doubt.  Unite leader Len McCluskey said the union has been working “day and night to fight for members’ interests” and pledged to continue to do so. He’ll need to be at the top of his game. General Motors Europe lost its previous owner billions. Mr Tavares cannot allow it to continue haemorrhaging cash, not if he wants to keep his job.  There will inevitably be some short-term pain involved in getting the plants to where he wants them to be. That was what his comment about improving performance was all about. Of more concern, however, to both Mr McCluskey and the Brexit Government is what happens two to three years out.  Vauxhall employs 4,500 people directly at its plants in Luton and Ellesmere Port, plus a further 18,000 indirectly in the supply chain. If those jobs are lost, it’s unlikely that there will be anything like them along to plug the gap.  The location of the new Vauxhall Astra’s construction is an open question. Given the uncertainty created by Brexit, what would you do in Mr Tavares’s position? (Consider the possible imposition of tariffs and the near certainty of extra bureaucracy when exporting cars from a Britain outside of the EU, thanks to the May government insisting on a “hard” Brexit.) You might very well be tempted by put your shiny new model somewhere that limits its impact. Go with Britain and the tariffs and bureaucracy will affect exports to the enormous European single market. Opt for somewhere in Europe and they will only effect exports to the much smaller British market. QED.  In point of fact, it’s not just PSA that is or will be considering its position against that backdrop. The same is true for almost every carmaker operating within these shores. Keeping them could get expensive in terms of the concessions and sweeteners they may demand to compensate them for what they’re going to have to put up with in future.  As for the more immediate need to make cuts so GM Europe makes money, well, right-wingers often hail Britain’s “flexible” labour market. Trouble is that flexibility makes it very much easier to fire British workers than it does their German or French colleagues.  Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy. Reuters 2/35 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 3/35 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 4/35 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Tim Cook met Ms May at Downing Street on Thursday morning and reiterated the tech giant's plans to build a new UK headquarters at the Battersea Power Station as proof of the company's support of the UK. Getty 7/35 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Wilson - 03/06/17 06:00 AM EST 56   © Getty Images Capitol Hill’s top moneyman is taking his budget savvy to K Street after more than two decades years on the job. Will Smith, who has led the House Appropriations Committee’s Republican staff for the last three years of his congressional career, will be joining Cornerstone Government Affairs, a lobbying firm that handles a slew of appropriations work. He starts March 20. Smith worked for the panel, which crafts legislation to fund the federal government, for five years, but spent the bulk of his time — 12 years — in Rep. Hal Rogers’ (R-Ky.) personal office, where he rose to chief of staff.  Rogers called Smith his “right hand in the halls of Congress” in a statement to The Hill. “Will has been my right hand in the halls of Congress for nearly two decades, and I cannot imagine a more thoughtful advisor, a more capable strategist, or a more loyal friend,” the Kentucky congressman said.  “His professionalism and commitment to the task at hand are truly unmatched.  Congress as an institution will not be the same without Will’s strong leadership and steady hand, but Cornerstone is fortunate to have such a talented and hard-working individual join its ranks,” he added.  Rogers, who represents Smith’s hometown of Beattyville, Ky., just ceded the gavel of the Appropriations committee to Rep. Rodney FrelinghuysenRodney FrelinghuysenMoneyman brings budget prowess to lobby firm Overnight Finance: Dem seeks Treasury probe into Trump, Russia | Koch-backed group floats border tax alternatives | Feds raid Caterpillar's offices | Jobless claims near four decade low Overnight Defense: Sessions recuses himself from Russia probes | Trump touts defense plans on aircraft carrier | House to vote on defense spending bill MORE (R-N.J.) at the beginning of this congressional session due to term limits.  Smith helped to shepherd the passage of 66 bills in the span of five years, and worked on the committee for a total of 600 budget and oversight hearings and more than 200 different investigations.  He talked about the power of using the budgeting process to fund repairs for damaged roads and infrastructure and creating programs to combat problems like the prescription drug and opioid addition epidemic, an issue he is passionate about.  “I grew up in a family where my dad was sort of the sole town doctor in a really small town in Kentucky, he served the people there for 60 years,” Smith said on in the Rayburn cafeteria on Friday on one of his last days of work.   “And so when I got out of college, I came up to Washington not really knowing what I wanted to do, but knowing that I wanted to spend some time up here and be a public servant and help the people back home,” he said.  Before prescription drug addiction made national headlines, Smith saw its impact in Kentucky.  While working as Rogers’s chief of staff, he helped the congressman create Operation UNITE in 2003, an organization to fight substance abuse. Smith looks at the organization and its evolution as one of the accomplishments of which he is the most proud. The organization’s name is an acronym for Unlawful Narcotics Investigations, Treatment and Education, which it describes as the “three-pronged” approach to combating drug abuse — resources for law enforcement, treatment for addicts and drug education in schools. In terms of what policy areas he plans to focus his advocacy efforts on, Smith smiles and says that he’s done it all.  Once he leaves, Smith cannot lobby any of his former colleagues on the Appropriations committee for one year. Cornerstone, which racked up $16.8 million in federal lobbying revenue last year, has clients including Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, Boeing, H&R Block and ACT for NIH: Advancing Cures Today, an organization that seeks to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. In addition, the firm has a reach outside the Beltway, with offices in eight states.  “Will is the consummate professional and a class act,” said Jim Richards, a principal and director at Cornerstone. “Will’s well-deserved and excellent reputation on both sides of the Capitol, and amongst both parties, brings tremendous value to our clients on a multitude of fronts.” In the fall of 2013, Smith slogged through the government shutdown, when Congress failed to enact spending legislation by the end of the fiscal year. Faced with an impasse over a GOP push to stop ObamaCare, the government shut down for 16 days that October, the first stoppage in more than 17 years.  “There’s not a day that’s not challenging out here,” Smith said, but “it was challenging in the sense that we were here every day, every night, for almost a month … producing legislation, putting bills across the floor,” he said. “[We were] trying to come up with— helping leadership come up with— a solution.” The House passed nine “mini” funding bills aimed at pumping cash into various agencies and programs, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institutes of Health and the National Park Service, but all of them died in the Democrat-controlled Senate. “It was a tough time,” Smith said. He glowingly refers to the Appropriations Committee as the “most collegial, bipartisan committee in the House.” “If you’re not funding the government, you’re in a bad situation, right?  The appropriations process is vital obviously to the functioning of government. We’re the only committee that absolutely has to produce every year, there’s no getting around that,” he said.   “We buckle down, we get our work done, we work best behind the scenes,” he adds, calling the members and staff on the panel, “work horses, not show horses.” When Smith first started on Capitol Hill in 1994, he worked for Sen.

He then spent a yearlong stint on a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, before starting with Rogers in 1998, a job he says he had moved to Washington to try and get.  “It’s a good time to leave, and it’s a good time explore new opportunities,” Smith said. “I feel like I’ve done what I’ve set out to do since I got here.” Tags Rodney Frelinghuysen, Mitch McConnell   View the discussion thread.

(AMZN) chairman Jeff Bezos this week is expected to announce some customers and new initiatives, the latest step toward its long-term goal of building rockets powerful enough to penetrate deep into the solar system, according to industry officials. Continue Reading Below The moves by the typically secretive Mr. Bezos, these officials said, are anticipated to disclose further details about Blue Origin LLC's strategy to create a family of reusable rockets initially intended to take tourists on suborbital voyages, and then propel spacecraft into Earth's orbit and eventually blast both manned and robotic missions to the Moon and various planets. Plans for heavy-lift boosters previously unveiled by Mr. Bezos, including one version roughly half as powerful as the iconic Saturn V rockets that lifted Apollo astronauts to the moon, ultimately could emerge as rivals with powerful rockets already under development by fellow billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is working on its own version of a deep-space booster and capsule. The initial test flight of SpaceX's long-delayed Falcon Heavy, which would become the world's most potent operational rocket, is scheduled for later this year. NASA's much larger booster, called SLS, is slated for its maiden flight in 2018. So far, Mr. Bezos has been less specific about timetables to demonstrate the reliability of his emerging heavy-lift rocket variant, called New Glenn, after the late astronaut and U.S. senator, John Glenn. Amazon's founder has been even less specific about a next-generation rocket on the drawing board, dubbed New Armstrong, in memory of the late astronaut Neil Armstrong, who was the first man to set foot on the Moon. That booster is intended for travel deep into the solar system. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Both self-described "space geeks" with ambitious visions of helping humans establish large-scale settlements beyond Earth in their lifetimes, Messrs. Bezos and Musk have jousted good-naturedly on social media in the past about competing to land the first spent booster vertically back on Earth. Mr. Bezos did it first after a suborbital mission, but Mr. Musk accomplished the feat by landing the main portion of a Falcon 9 rocket that delivered a payload into orbit. For the first time, Blue Origin in the next few days is expected to make public specific customers, according to industry officials. A series of announcements and postings on Twitter is slated to follow a separate flurry of news reports last week about Blue Origin's bid for NASA's support to ship experiments, cargo and other hardware to the moon with the aim of setting up a permanent settlement there. The proposal, which hasn't been acted on by the agency, was first reported by the Washington Post, which is controlled by Mr. Bezos. Last-minute shifts could change Blue Origin's plans for the coming days, and Mr. Bezos is renowned for teasing the media with broad concepts, often without providing subsequent details. He is scheduled to speak Tuesday morning in the prominent leadoff slot at an international satellite conference in Washington. The appearance also comes in the wake of Mr. Musk prompting headlines last week with a proposal to fly two fare-paying passengers on an automated trip around the moon by 2018. Traditional and startup U.S. space companies are maneuvering to take advantage of the principle of public-private partnerships to accelerate manned exploration favored by President Donald Trump's administration. With a few exceptions, Mr. Bezos has opted to run Blue Origin since its founding at the beginning of the last decade behind a strict veil of secrecy -- and without seeking substantial federal contracts or development funding. Last September, Mr. Bezos rocked the international aerospace community by disclosing that his New Glenn rocket would feature a cluster of seven main engines and stand more than 310 feet tall. If it flies by the end of the decade as intended, the largest version of the proposed booster could vie for commercial and military satellite launches with SpaceX, Europe's premier launch provider Arianespace and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. (BA) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT). Over the years, Mr. Bezos has stressed the importance of creating reusable technology able to slash transportation costs by operating much more frequently than today's rockets. He also has talked about his long-term vision of "millions of people living and working in space." Unlike Mr. Musk, who relishes making a steady stream of splashy announcements setting increasingly aggressive goals, Mr. Bezos remained virtually silent to outsiders until after Blue Origin pulled off its coup of successfully landing a New Shepard booster back at its West Texas launchpad in late 2015. The unmanned vehicle flew a suborbital test to 333,000 feet, reached nearly four times the speed of sound, and then both the capsule and its liquid-fueled rocket separately landed safely -- ready for another flight. At the time, Mr. Bezos projected commercial space-tourism flights could start "sometime in 2017." He also said "full reuse is a game changer" for access to space. In November 2016, when he disclosed plans for a series of larger rockets with substantially more thrust, Mr. Bezos issued a stark reminder of how different his approach is versus that of Mr. Musk. Noting "our mascot is the tortoise," Mr. Bezos said "deliberate and methodical wins the day, and you do things quickest by never skipping steps."

Alts Equities Smart-Beta New ETFs ETF Ecosystem Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel 2017 Outlook Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2017 → March → A Trump ETF Trade on Aerospace, Defense A Trump ETF Trade on Aerospace, Defense March 6, 2017 at 10:37 am by Brenton Garen Aerospace and defense stocks and exchange traded funds have been one of the ultimate “Trump trades” since Donald Trump won the November U.S. presidential election. Some analysts and market observers believe the group has more upside in store for investors. Although the aerospace and defense industry is perceived as being beholden to Uncle Sam’s whims, the allure of late-cycle sectors, including industrials, in a rising rate environment remains in place. Industrials perform well when interest rates rise because rising rates can go hand-in-hand with economic growth. However, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEArca: ITA), PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (NYSEArca: PPA) and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEArca: XAR) were stung earlier this year after Trump criticized the Pentagon’s profligate spending habits. “The major catalyst for the sector in the past few months had been Trump’s proposed commitment to increase defense spending, a point he reiterated in his speech to Congress on Tuesday night,” reports CNBC. “Trump’s call to move ahead with “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history” is exactly what leads Mark Tepper, founder of Strategic Wealth Partners, to bank on more room to run for defense stocks, even from a fundamental standpoint.” ITA is a cap-weighted ETF, meaning it has larger weights to big-name defense stocks, including Dow components Boeing (NYSE: BA) and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX). XAR is an equal-weight ETF. PPA holds 50 stocks “involved in the development, manufacturing, operations and support of US defense, homeland security and aerospace operations,” according to PowerShares. “This year alone, stocks like Boeing and Honeywell are up as much as 17 percent and 9 percent, respectively. But even among defense stocks that haven’t hit record highs, names like Northrop Grumman are up more than 25 percent just over the past year,” according to CNBC. Aerospace and defense stocks are part of the broader industrial sector and have been important drivers of the sector’s performance over the past year. In fact, aerospace and defense names have been industrial leaders. Over the past 12 months, ITA is ahead of the largest diversified industrial ETF by more than 1,100 basis points.

Jump to Navigation Home Page Top Stories Opinion News Releases In Depth Links Video & Audio You are hereHome › Top Stories › Success Of Proposed Guam Wind Power Project In Doubt Submitted by admin on Mon, 08/24/2015 - 00:00 Utility Commission Chairman: Nothing done on 9.4 MW facility By Gaynor Dumat-ol Daleno HAGÃTÃA, Guam (Pacific Daily News, Aug. 23, 2015) – A proposed project to build a 9.4-megawatt wind power plant might fail to meet a goal to begin supplying power to Guam Power Authority in March next year, a utilities commission official said recently. Consolidated Commission on Utilities Chairman Joey Duenas said he doubts that a wind-powered power plant would work on the island at all. In 2013, Pacific Green Resources entered into an agreement with GPA to produce 9.4 megawatts of wind power and 5 megawatts of solar power and sell that energy to GPA. "They haven’t done anything yet, so I am not very optimistic," Duenas said. "I’m not very optimistic that they will produce power with wind within that time frame. I don’t know if they ever will." A management representative for Pacific Green Resources was unavailable for comment when the Pacific Daily News called. A staff member who answered said the person in charge wasn’t available. Duenas said two challenges make wind energy on Guam difficult to overcome. He said wind power generators need vast, open land to provide adequate space between each windmill. On this small island, commercial-scale wind power plants might be tough to pull off, he said. And for a utility-scale wind power plant to be viable, there must be steady flow of winds — ranging from 12 mph to 28 mph — for efficiency, he said. Earthquakes and typhoons also add to the obstacles of windmill projects on the island. "Guam is seismically active and is in the Pacific’s Typhoon Alley, so wind turbines must be engineered to resist both earthquakes and typhoon-force winds," a report on the U.S. Energy Information Administration website states. GPA has received a federal grant to build a test windmill at Windward Hills. That project is under construction. But while the test for wind viability will be conducted, Duenas said "we’re not every optimistic." GPA is required by local law to use renewable energy, such as solar or wind, for at least 5 percent of its energy source by the end of this year. The wind power plant project is to be privately built and funded. The investor would make its money back by selling power to GPA. Pacific Green also planned to build a 5.6-megawatt solar power plant, but the company sold that part of its contract with GPA to another investor. A subsidiary of Fortune 250 company NRG Energy has recently completed construction of a 25-megawatt solar power plant in Inarajan. That solar power plant NRG built, in a partnership that brought the technical expertise of aircraft maker Boeing, has begun providing test energy to GPA, and an official opening of the plant is scheduled for Oct. 7. Solar energy might be good for the environment but, with falling oil prices, GPA will end up paying more for solar power than heavy fuel oil. GPA’s agreement with NRG requires the agency to pay 19 cents per kwh of solar power during the first year of their 25-year agreement. Each year, that cost would increase by 1 cent for the next 24 years. Oil prices have been decreasing, and because of the oil price drop in July, GPA’s fuel cost translates to about 10 cents per kilowatt hour, Duenas said. "It is gong to be a negative; It is going to cost us money," Duenas said of solar power compared with recent fuel oil prices. GPA has invited bidders to submit another round of renewable energy project proposals, which would lead to the production of 40 megawatts of energy by one or multiple investors. Most, if not all, of the proposals submitted are for solar power, Duenas said. The names of the bidders haven’t been released because GPA and the prospective bidders are still negotiating.

Reuters 2/35 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 3/35 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 4/35 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

News Business Business Comment Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset: One of the co-CEOs needs to go after their merger Most companies eschew co-ceos for the simple reason that it's a bad idea, and if they're going to demand people lower down re-interview for their jobs, the people at the top should set an example James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Monday 6 March 2017 13:48 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Sailing into choppy waters: Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life will have two CEOs after their merger LLOYD IMAGES The first duplicate role to be axed when big companies like Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management get together should be one of the chief executives.  For a start, if they’re not the highest paid employee they’ll almost certainly be close to it. Jettisoning one of them gets the cost savings shareholders are usually promised off to a good start.  Moreover, if you plan to tell people lower down the corporate ladder that they’re going to have to re-apply for jobs they’ve been doing well in competition with someone from the other side, the people at the top need to set an example.  Read more Standard Life and Aberdeen shares soar after £3.8bn merger deal History will also show that on those rare occasions where this doesn’t happen, disaster often follows.  Chief executives like Martin Gilbert at Aberdeen and Keith Skeoch at Standard Life, typically have big egos, a lofty estimation of their own worth when set against other mere mortals, and rather clear views on they way things should be done at the companies they run. They also get used to people saying “that’s a brilliant idea”  in response to their every pronouncement. Their underlings know their careers will be a lot more fruitful if they do that.  Despite the smiles, public expressions of amity and pledges to work together in the newly merged company’s best interests, one plus one rarely equals two. It more commonly results in head butting, back stabbing and simmering internal warfare as the loyal soldiers from each side form up behind their man.  Read more Standard Life and Aberdeen shares soar after £3.8bn merger deal Standard Life chairman wades in against Brexit Even Superman Skeoch will struggle with his dual role at Standard Life The phenomenon of staff being seen as a company X person or a company Y person often persists for years after big mergers, even when the two sides have settled upon a single boss. It is that much harder to deal with when they can’t agree upon which CEO  should stay and which should go at the outset.  The strong performance of the two companies' shares tells you that there is a fairly compelling business case for the deal between Standard and Aberdeen, an all share affair that will see Standard’s investors getting two thirds of the merged company and Aberdeen’s the rest. Money management favours either giants or boutiques. Life has been getting increasing tough for those in the middle. Combining these two, which have both been suffering net outflows of funds, will create a behemoth with £660bn under management.  Beyond their common Scottish roots, they favour stock picking, as opposed to tracking stock market indices, and getting together will give them the clout to square up to America’s big fund managers, and perhaps to pursue further deals. But much will now depend on the two men at the top, who have been very closely linked to the successes of their respective businesses, and have substantial personal as well as financial stakes in them, playing nicely together.  Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy.

News Business Business Comment Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset: One of the co-CEOs needs to go after their merger Most companies eschew co-ceos for the simple reason that it's a bad idea, and if they're going to demand people lower down re-interview for their jobs, the people at the top should set an example James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Monday 6 March 2017 13:48 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Sailing into choppy waters: Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life will have two CEOs after their merger LLOYD IMAGES The first duplicate role to be axed when big companies like Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management get together should be one of the chief executives.  For a start, if they’re not the highest paid employee they’ll almost certainly be close to it. Jettisoning one of them gets the cost savings shareholders are usually promised off to a good start.  Moreover, if you plan to tell people lower down the corporate ladder that they’re going to have to re-apply for jobs they’ve been doing well in competition with someone from the other side, the people at the top need to set an example.  Read more Standard Life and Aberdeen shares soar after £3.8bn merger deal History will also show that on those rare occasions where this doesn’t happen, disaster often follows.  Chief executives like Martin Gilbert at Aberdeen and Keith Skeoch at Standard Life, typically have big egos, a lofty estimation of their own worth when set against other mere mortals, and rather clear views on they way things should be done at the companies they run. They also get used to people saying “that’s a brilliant idea”  in response to their every pronouncement. Their underlings know their careers will be a lot more fruitful if they do that.  Despite the smiles, public expressions of amity and pledges to work together in the newly merged company’s best interests, one plus one rarely equals two. It more commonly results in head butting, back stabbing and simmering internal warfare as the loyal soldiers from each side form up behind their man.  Read more Standard Life and Aberdeen shares soar after £3.8bn merger deal Standard Life chairman wades in against Brexit Even Superman Skeoch will struggle with his dual role at Standard Life The phenomenon of staff being seen as a company X person or a company Y person often persists for years after big mergers, even when the two sides have settled upon a single boss. It is that much harder to deal with when they can’t agree upon which CEO  should stay and which should go at the outset.  The strong performance of the two companies' shares tells you that there is a fairly compelling business case for the deal between Standard and Aberdeen, an all share affair that will see Standard’s investors getting two thirds of the merged company and Aberdeen’s the rest. Money management favours either giants or boutiques. Life has been getting increasing tough for those in the middle. Combining these two, which have both been suffering net outflows of funds, will create a behemoth with £660bn under management.  Beyond their common Scottish roots, they favour stock picking, as opposed to tracking stock market indices, and getting together will give them the clout to square up to America’s big fund managers, and perhaps to pursue further deals. But much will now depend on the two men at the top, who have been very closely linked to the successes of their respective businesses, and have substantial personal as well as financial stakes in them, playing nicely together.  Business picture of the day 35 show all Business picture of the day 1/35 UK businesses are already facing recruitment crisis as Polish workers head home - Friday February 15 After a Brexit vote in which a primary concern was too much immigration, some might be applauding the trend, but for important UK industries it is already creating a serious problem, and one that provides a preview of what may be to come for the wider economy.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The moves by the typically secretive Mr. Bezos, these officials said, are anticipated to disclose further details about Blue Origin LLC’s strategy to create a family of reusable rockets initially intended to take tourists on suborbital voyages, and then propel spacecraft into Earth’s orbit and eventually blast both manned and robotic missions to the Moon and various planets. Plans for heavy-lift boosters previously unveiled by Mr. Bezos, including one version roughly half as powerful as the iconic Saturn V rockets that lifted Apollo astronauts to the moon, ultimately could emerge as rivals with powerful rockets already under development by fellow billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX. Bloomberg News Jeff Bezos, left, founder of Blue Origin, speaks during a space symposium in Colorado Springs, Colo., in April 2016. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is working on its own version of a deep-space booster and capsule. The initial test flight of SpaceX’s long-delayed Falcon Heavy, which would become the world’s most potent operational rocket, is scheduled for later this year. NASA’s much larger booster, called SLS, is slated for its maiden flight in 2018. So far, Mr. Bezos has been less specific about timetables to demonstrate the reliability of his emerging heavy-lift rocket variant, called New Glenn, after the late astronaut and U.S. senator, John Glenn. Amazon’s founder has been even less specific about a next-generation rocket on the drawing board, dubbed New Armstrong, in memory of the late astronaut Neil Armstrong, who was the first man to set foot on the Moon. That booster is intended for travel deep into the solar system. Both self-described “space geeks” with ambitious visions of helping humans establish large-scale settlements beyond Earth in their lifetimes, Messrs. Bezos and Musk have jousted good-naturedly on social media in the past about competing to land the first spent booster vertically back on Earth. Mr. Bezos did it first after a suborbital mission, but Mr. Musk accomplished the feat by landing the main portion of a Falcon 9 rocket that delivered a payload into orbit. For the first time, Blue Origin in the next few days is expected to make public specific customers, according to industry officials. A series of announcements and postings on Twitter is slated to follow a separate flurry of news reports last week about Blue Origin’s bid for NASA’s support to ship experiments, cargo and other hardware to the moon with the aim of setting up a permanent settlement there. The proposal, which hasn’t been acted on by the agency, was first reported by the Washington Post, which is controlled by Mr. Bezos. Last-minute shifts could change Blue Origin’s plans for the coming days, and Mr. Bezos is renowned for teasing the media with broad concepts, often without providing subsequent details. He is scheduled to speak Tuesday morning in the prominent leadoff slot at an international satellite conference in Washington. The appearance also comes in the wake of Mr. Musk prompting headlines last week with a proposal to fly two fare-paying passengers on an automated trip around the moon by 2018. Traditional and startup U.S. space companies are maneuvering to take advantage of the principle of public-private partnerships to accelerate manned exploration favored by President Donald Trump’s administration. With a few exceptions, Mr. Bezos has opted to run Blue Origin since its founding at the beginning of the last decade behind a strict veil of secrecy—and without seeking substantial federal contracts or development funding. Last September, Mr. Bezos rocked the international aerospace community by disclosing that his New Glenn rocket would feature a cluster of seven main engines and stand more than 310 feet tall. If it flies by the end of the decade as intended, the largest version of the proposed booster could vie for commercial and military satellite launches with SpaceX, Europe’s premier launch provider Arianespace and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Read More Over the years, Mr. Bezos has stressed the importance of creating reusable technology able to slash transportation costs by operating much more frequently than today’s rockets. He also has talked about his long-term vision of “millions of people living and working in space.” Unlike Mr. Musk, who relishes making a steady stream of splashy announcements setting increasingly aggressive goals, Mr. Bezos remained virtually silent to outsiders until after Blue Origin pulled off its coup of successfully landing a New Shepard booster back at its West Texas launchpad in late 2015. The unmanned vehicle flew a suborbital test to 333,000 feet, reached nearly four times the speed of sound, and then both the capsule and its liquid-fueled rocket separately landed safely—ready for another flight. At the time, Mr. Bezos projected commercial space-tourism flights could start “sometime in 2017.” He also said “full reuse is a game changer” for access to space. In November 2016, when he disclosed plans for a series of larger rockets with substantially more thrust, Mr. Bezos issued a stark reminder of how different his approach is versus that of Mr. Musk. Noting “our mascot is the tortoise,” Mr. Bezos said “deliberate and methodical wins the day, and you do things quickest by never skipping steps.” Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com More From The Wall Street Journal Cities See a 'Bright Flight' http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324328904578624031829252000.html How to Win a Real-Estate Bidding War Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The news comes after head of the Onuguu-Progress parliamentary faction, Bakyt Torobayev called on his colleagues last week to dissolve the Parliament if it is not capable of solving problems. Torobayev made the proposal at a Parliament meeting which discussed the issues of corruption and fraud. According to the presidential press service, President Atambayev, speaking at a ceremony of presenting state awards, said some parliament members allege that the Boeing plane, which crashed near Bishkek in mid-January killing about 40, was carrying some cargo owned by him and that he has millions-worth of offshore property in Cyprus. “These are just rumors and attempts to blacken my name… The parliament has evolved from a legislative body into a body which disseminates rumors… Maybe, indeed, you will support Torobaev and dissolve [the parliament], otherwise respect the law and work for the people’s welfare,” Atambayev said.

That ruling allows private citizens and corporations to make unlimited donations for political campaigns. By MichaelBrush Columnist Thanks to millennials, socially responsible investing is now a big deal. Investment funds dedicated to sustainable investing rose 33% during 2014-16 to $8.72 trillion, says the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment. Millennials no doubt played a big role in this. More than 70% of them say they favor sustainable investing, according to Morgan Stanley. It’s a trait they picked up from their baby-boomer parents. This is all well and good, but many sustainable investing devotees, young and old, have a blind spot that needs fixing. Blame it on the so-called “experts” in the industry. They make a big deal of avoiding fossil fuel companies and polluters. The environment isn’t the only thing that needs minding. We also need a sustainable democracy. Without that, it doesn’t matter how clean the environment is. Life could get ugly. And make no mistake, sustainable democracy is at risk. No, this isn’t another Donald Trump rant. Democracy was precarious before he came into office. A key turning point was in 2010, when the Supreme Court ruled against government restrictions on corporate political spending in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Since companies have deep pockets, their interests may trample those of average voters. In short, it’s hard to say which did more harm, Citizens United or the Gulf oil spill, as baby boomer Jackson Browne wrote in his song “The Long Way Around.” Whatever you think about Citizens United, it’s not going away soon. The best thing to do now is to learn how to contain the potential damage. For socially responsible investors, this means favoring companies with these three traits in the arena of campaign contributions: • Political spending transparency • Policies governing how they donate • Strong board oversight of managements’ campaign contributions Above all, these qualities help shareholders understand how companies are contributing to politicians. If investors disagree, they can sell their shares or challenge boards of directors and management. Openness and board oversight help prevent managers from secretly going rogue with campaign contributions that work against shareholder values. All of this seems fairly obvious. So it’s odd that the “sustainable investing” experts often put little emphasis on investing in sustainable democracy. A list of “sustainable investing” themes from Arabesque Asset Management, which you can find in this note, appears comprehensive. It includes 30 topics of interest — everything from carbon emissions and community relations, to diversity and CEO pay. What about political campaign contributions and investing in sustainable democracy? Nowhere to be seen. In a way, this isn’t surprising, since definitions of “sustainable” investing are all over the map. Center for Political Accountability The first stop for investors wanting to invest in sustainable democracy is the Center for Political Accountability (CPA) website. CPA examines the websites of S&P 500 SPX, -0.33%   companies to gauge whether they have 24 qualities that CPA says companies need in the realm of campaign contributions. The big picture is that CPA is looking for the three qualities I mentioned above: transparency, policy and board oversight. CPA then ranks S&P 500 companies on a scale of 0-100. You can find a spreadsheet with rankings here. This ranking serves two purposes: • It tells you as an investor which companies are “doing the right thing.” It’s a handy guide to investing in sustainable democracy. • The rating system also pressures companies to change their ways if they aren’t up to snuff. “It is pushing companies to more broadly disclose their political spending and political spending policies, where no disclosure is required by law,” says Bruce Freed, CPA’s president and founder. “There are a growing number of companies that take our index seriously that are looking to strengthen the way they oversee and disclose political spending.” Sustainable performance A big question for investors is whether sustainable investing hurts performance. One theory says it should help. Consider companies that are more “responsible” because they are more transparent and they take the long view on matters like the environment. They may also naturally make wiser long-term business decisions and attract more customers because of good will. Research results vary. Arabesque Asset Management claims 80% of academic studies found the stocks of companies with “good sustainability practices” outperform other stocks. Morningstar thinks social impact funds gained about 5% annually in the past 10 years, lagging behind other funds by about a percentage point a year. Morgan Stanley seems to be in the middle, concluding in this note that sustainable investments have “usually met, and often exceeded, the performance of comparable traditional investments.” I think investing in a sustainable democracy may well give you an edge, for two reasons. 1. Better governance I had a hunch that companies ranking high in CPA’s system also have solid corporate governance, which can work in your favor as an investor. So I asked Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) to help check. ISS assigns companies a corporate governance rating, called ISS QualityScore, based on four factors: board structure and independence, executive pay policies, shareholder rights, and audit and risk oversight. Here’s what we found. The top 48 ranked companies in CPA’s system (those with a score of 90% or higher) had a median corporate governance risk rating of 4 on the ISS 1-10 scale, where a lower score is better. The bottom 48 companies, which all got a 0% rating from CPA, had a median ISS rating of 7.5. (A higher ISS score is worse.) This makes sense, because companies that are generally more open and transparent with shareholders tend to get better governance scores, says John Roe, head of ISS Analytics. But he also cautions the sample size is too small to draw definitive conclusions on whether CPA scores are a proxy for governance scores. 2. Better results To test how you’d do if you used CPA’s system as a sustainable democracy investment guide, I looked at how well CPA’s top 48 companies did against the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP, -0.45%   I chose this ETF because I used a simple equal weighting of the companies, so this ETF is the fairest comparison. (In contrast, the S&P 500 Index that most people track uses a market-cap weighted system. This means that smaller companies have a smaller impact on overall index returns.) The results are remarkable. CPA’s top 48 stocks beat the market by 7 percentage points over the past three years. From the start of 2011 through Feb. 21 of this year, CPA’s stocks returned 41.5% compared with 34.3% for the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF. (For reference, the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Index did a little better. It advanced 36.1%. But the CPA stocks still beat that.) All returns include dividends. One pushback on my performance test might be that the CPA’s list of top-ranked companies may have over-represented companies in sectors that just happened to do well during that time frame. So I looked at a different time frame, the past five years. The results were even better. CPA’s top 48 stocks beat the market by 20 percentage points. They advanced 133.3% vs. 113.3% for the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (and 108.9% for the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Index). Some of the best-performing stocks in this group, in either time frame, included: Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.75% Morgan Stanley MS, -0.56% J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.95% Visa Inc. V, +0.17% Altria Group Inc. MO, +0.01% Time Warner Inc. TWX, -0.65% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.03% Boeing Co. BA, -0.69% Becton Dickinson & Co. BDX, -0.11% Celgene Corp. CELG, -0.11% Edwards Lifesciences Corp. EW, -2.69%  and Tesoro Corp. TSO, +1.14% Some of the weaker performers included: International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.23% Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.71% Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +0.02% Praxair Inc. PX, +0.11% Schlumberger Ltd. SLB, +0.02% Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, -0.88% Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, -0.51% Express Scripts Holding Co. ESRX, -2.14% Noble Energy Inc. NBL, +0.27%  and Exelon Corp. EXC, -0.69% Before you conclude that my mini-study proves you can “do well by doing right,” as the cliché goes, a few qualifiers are in order. Statisticians would point out that there’s no attempt to tease out what caused the performance difference. Correlation does not equal causation. The sample size is small. And there are only two time frames. Plus, my test for outperformance against a rising market might be the wrong way to look at this. Here’s what I mean. Let’s assume I’m right that CPA scores are a way to measure corporate governance. The nuance here is that quality corporate governance is really better at suggesting possible protection against downside risk, as opposed to outperformance, says Roe, the head of ISS Analytics. Give a little Even if investing in sustainable democracy didn’t help you outperform the market, does this really matter? After all, if socially responsible investing is about putting money into the stocks of companies that share your values, then maybe it’s OK to give up some gains in the process. People give up money and time whenever they donate to charities or volunteer. There is a cost to those activities. But it’s offset by the benefit of knowing you might be improving the world. Why should investing be any different? A lot of millennials seem to agree with this. Over half of them in the Morgan Stanley study I cited above said they get it that sustainable investing may involve some trade-off in financial gain — yet they are some of the biggest fans of this style of investing. At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush has suggested BAC, JPM, CELG,KO, GILD and BMY in his stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks. Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer who has covered business for the New York Times and The Economist group, and he attended Columbia Business School in the Knight-Bagehot program.

News Business Business News Nintendo shares jump 4.1% after Switch console launch success 'There’s a sigh of relief today that the actual launch has gone smoothly so far,' said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Yuji Nakamura Monday 6 March 2017 10:08 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The Nintendo Switch being played in New York Getty Nintendo shares rose on Friday to their highest in a month after a smooth debut of Switch, a hybrid console that aims to bring together the worlds of mobile and home gaming. Retailers in Tokyo and Sydney began selling a limited number of units early, while fans in New York and Toronto waited in the cold to buy the new devices at midnight sale events. Demand easily outstripped supply, with most retailers exhausting both pre-order and same-day inventory within minutes or hours, signalling Nintendo is on track to reach its goal of shipping 2 million units by the end of the month. Shares rose as much as 4.1 per cent, also the biggest gain in a month, as analysts expressed optimism the launch was going well. Prior to Friday, Nintendo’s stock had declined for four-straight days as some early negative reviews and concerns about potential defects unnerved investors. Read more Nintendo Switch goes on sale, sells out immediately “There’s a sigh of relief today that the actual launch has gone smoothly so far,” said Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group. “We have to wait and see if any major issue comes up by the end of the week.” Switch, which sells for £279.99 or 30,000 yen, is the Kyoto-based company’s biggest bet in years. Nintendo’s late foray into making mobile games for smartphones has only just started, and the Wii U console was a flop, making it even more important that the new console succeeds. The new gadget is essentially a tablet sporting wireless controllers that can be used anywhere, on its own in the park or plugged into the living room TV.

Gamespot called it a “technical marvel,” while the Verge sang praises of its launch title, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. IGN bemoaned compromises in the hardware to merge home and portable gaming, while Arstechnica said the machine’s battery life is too short for long trips. A line of about 90 people snaked through a stairwell at Bic Camera Inc.’s shop in Shibuya before it opened, mostly full of people who had not pre-ordered the new device. Among them was Yuki Adachi, 26, who was visiting from Osaka. “I’m most excited about its portability. It’s different from smartphones because it has chunky buttons useful for action games,” Adachi said. “I’m mostly looking forward to using it on the Shinkansen (bullet train) as I travel a lot between Osaka and Tokyo.” Thousands of others throughout the world posted photos or live-streamed themselves buying the device, including one from Nintendo’s flagship store in New York. The attention now turns to the weekend to gauge fan reaction and the device’s durability. Several gaming reviewers who tested the system had reported connectivity problems with its Joy Con controllers, raising questions about hardware quality. Nintendo declined to comment on the issue.

Reuters 2/35 Global sales of UK food and drink hit the £20bn mark for the first time - Tuesday February 21 Global sales of UK food and drink have hit the £20bn mark for the first time in history, as the Government prepares to ramp up its focus on international trade following the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Getty 3/35 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 4/35 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 7/35 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The new Zelda game scored a 98 out of 100 on review-aggregation website Metacritic, making it the fourth-highest rated video game of all time. Snipperclips, another launch title, also received strong reviews for its innovative puzzle gameplay, which critics said showed off the Switch’s multiplayer strengths. “While this early adoption phase is important to build sales momentum, it can only take the Switch so far,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at IHS Markit. “Convincing a wider audience to commit to the platform will take some work. A mixture of compelling content and features, price point, word of mouth and effective marketing will all need to come together to engage this broader audience.” Bloomberg More about: Nintendo Nintendo Switch Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

That includes all the private messages where users may be less likely to talk strictly work. Detectify Labs security researcher Frans Rosén determined he could steal users' private tokens—which allow access to the user’s communications—by tricking them with a malicious web page. According to Rosén, Slack responded to his first notification 33 minutes after he sent it and resolved the issue within five hours. The company also paid him $3,000 for reporting the bug. Internet-Connected Teddy Bear Don't Keep Secrets A high-tech toy teddy bear exposed more than 2 million voice messages from children and parents by using poor security practices, according to a security researcher. Spiral Toys’ CloudPets brand of internet toys reads like a list of security don’ts. The company stored customer credentials in a publicly available online database that didn’t require a password and wasn’t behind a firewall while it put audio messages in an Amazon-hosted service that didn’t require authorization, according to a Feb. 27 blog by Troy Hunt, who maintains Have I Been Pwned? breach notification service. The company hashed customers’ credentials, but it didn’t establish any password strength requirements so capable hackers would be able to crack large chunks of the more than 800,000 credentials, Hunt wrote. Some passwords, for example, were a single letter or commonly used passwords like “password,” “123456” and “cloudpets.” The data was exposed from Christmas to sometime in January, and Motherboard reports it was also accessed and held for ransom multiple times in a wave of attacks on MongoDB databases. Hunt says the company was alerted several times about the breach, but never responded. Mark Myers, Spiral Toys CEO, told Network World no voice recordings were stolen. “Circling back to the parents' position for a moment, you must assume data like this will end up in other peoples' [sic] hands,” Hunt wrote. “Whether it's the Cayla doll, the Barbie, the VTech tablets or the CloudPets, assume breach. It only takes one little mistake on behalf of the data custodian—such as misconfiguring the database security—and every single piece of data they hold on you and your family can be in the public domain in mere minutes.” Boeing Employee Emails 36,000 Coworkers' Personal Info to Spouse Boeing has started notifying the 36,000 employees whose personal information was mistakenly leaked via email, according to Threatpost. A Boeing employee had a problem formatting a spreadsheet and emailed it to his spouse for help, wrote Boeing Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Marie Olson in a letter to the Washington State attorney general notifying the state of the data breach. The spreadsheet contained names, birthdates, Social Security numbers, and other accounting code and employee identification information—but tucked away in “hidden” columns. The employee sent the email Nov. 21, though it wasn’t discovered until January.

News Business Business News Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management shares soar after £3.8bn merger deal The deal, which will create a £660bn asset manager, is the latest move by the active management industry to combat a tide of investors shifting money to low-cost, passive funds Sarah Jones Monday 6 March 2017 16:54 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Standard Life, the Edinburgh-based firm, appears to be successfully managing a transition into fund management from pensions Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images Standard Life, Scotland’s largest insurer, agreed to acquire Aberdeen Asset Management for about £3.8bn, a deal that would create one of Europe’s biggest fund managers. Their shares soared. Under the terms, Standard Life shareholders will own 66.7 per cent of the combined group, according to a joint statement on Monday. Aberdeen’s investors will receive 0.757 new Standard Life ordinary share for each share they already own. That values Aberdeen in line with its market value before the talks were disclosed 4 March. The deal, which will create a £660bn asset manager, is the latest move by the active management industry to combat a tide of investors shifting money to low-cost, passive funds. Aberdeen, hurt by weaker sentiment toward emerging markets, has suffered more than three years of redemptions, leading chief executive Martin Gilbert to freeze salaries and cut costs to protect profitability. Read more Aberdeen Asset Management says Asian storm is dying down Aberdeen shareholders have no choice but to “accept a nil-premium takeover or risk a material dividend cut, possibly as soon as the interim results in May, due to the weak capital situation,” Paul McGinnis, an analyst at Shore Capital Group Ltd., wrote in a note to clients. “The uncertainty created by an offer and subsequent integration period could be unhelpful in attracting new money from clients for two groups already experiencing net outflows.” Read more Standard Life shuts property fund after post-Brexit withdrawals Standard Life chairman wades in against Brexit Even Superman Skeoch will struggle with his dual role at Standard Life Standard Life jumped more than 9.6 per cent, the most since September 2014, before ending the day up 6.3 per cent at 402.51p. Aberdeen's shares closed up 5.9 per cent at 303.9p. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Aberdeen’s largest shareholder with a 17 percent stake, and Lloyds Banking Group Plc, the third-biggest shareholder, support the deal, according to the statement from the companies. Standard Life’s Keith Skeoch and Gilbert will be co-CEOs of the merged companies, which will be headquartered in Scotland. Standard Life’s Gerry Grimstone will be chairman. Standard Life, based in Edinburgh, employs around 8,335 people and the Aberdeen, Scotland-based asset manager has more than 2,800 workers. “We strongly believe that we can build on the strength of the existing Standard Life business by combining with Aberdeen to create one of the largest active investment managers in the world and deliver significant value for all of our stakeholders," Skeoch said in the statement.

Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Media & Advertising Cloud Innovation Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Amazon Chief Bezos Expected to Unveil Further Private Space Exploration Plans ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Amazon Chief Bezos Expected to Unveil Further Private Space Exploration Plans Published March 06, 2017 Industries Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print The burgeoning space-transportation company owned by Amazon.com chairman Jeff Bezos this week is expected to announce some customers and new initiatives, the latest step toward its long-term goal of building rockets powerful enough to penetrate deep into the solar system, according to industry officials.  Continue Reading Below The moves by the typically secretive Mr. Bezos, these officials said, are anticipated to disclose further details about Blue Origin LLC's strategy to create a family of reusable rockets initially intended to take tourists on suborbital voyages, and then propel spacecraft into Earth's orbit and eventually blast both manned and robotic missions to the Moon and various planets.  Plans for heavy-lift boosters previously unveiled by Mr. Bezos, including one version roughly half as powerful as the iconic Saturn V rockets that lifted Apollo astronauts to the moon, ultimately could emerge as rivals with powerful rockets already under development by fellow billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is working on its own version of a deep-space booster and capsule.  The initial test flight of SpaceX's long-delayed Falcon Heavy, which would become the world's most potent operational rocket, is scheduled for later this year. NASA's much larger booster, called SLS, is slated for its maiden flight in 2018.  So far, Mr. Bezos has been less specific about timetables to demonstrate the reliability of his emerging heavy-lift rocket variant, called New Glenn, after the late astronaut and U.S. senator, John Glenn. Amazon's founder has been even less specific about a next-generation rocket on the drawing board, dubbed New Armstrong, in memory of the late astronaut Neil Armstrong, who was the first man to set foot on the Moon. That booster is intended for travel deep into the solar system.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Both self-described "space geeks" with ambitious visions of helping humans establish large-scale settlements beyond Earth in their lifetimes, Messrs. Bezos and Musk have jousted good-naturedly on social media in the past about competing to land the first spent booster vertically back on Earth. Mr. Bezos did it first after a suborbital mission, but Mr. Musk accomplished the feat by landing the main portion of a Falcon 9 rocket that delivered a payload into orbit.  For the first time, Blue Origin in the next few days is expected to make public specific customers, according to industry officials. A series of announcements and postings on Twitter is slated to follow a separate flurry of news reports last week about Blue Origin's bid for NASA's support to ship experiments, cargo and other hardware to the moon with the aim of setting up a permanent settlement there.  The proposal, which hasn't been acted on by the agency, was first reported by the Washington Post, which is controlled by Mr. Bezos.  Last-minute shifts could change Blue Origin's plans for the coming days, and Mr. Bezos is renowned for teasing the media with broad concepts, often without providing subsequent details. He is scheduled to speak Tuesday morning in the prominent leadoff slot at an international satellite conference in Washington.  The appearance also comes in the wake of Mr. Musk prompting headlines last week with a proposal to fly two fare-paying passengers on an automated trip around the moon by 2018.  Traditional and startup U.S. space companies are maneuvering to take advantage of the principle of public-private partnerships to accelerate manned exploration favored by President Donald Trump's administration.  With a few exceptions, Mr. Bezos has opted to run Blue Origin since its founding at the beginning of the last decade behind a strict veil of secrecy -- and without seeking substantial federal contracts or development funding. Last September, Mr. Bezos rocked the international aerospace community by disclosing that his New Glenn rocket would feature a cluster of seven main engines and stand more than 310 feet tall. If it flies by the end of the decade as intended, the largest version of the proposed booster could vie for commercial and military satellite launches with SpaceX, Europe's premier launch provider Arianespace and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp.  Over the years, Mr. Bezos has stressed the importance of creating reusable technology able to slash transportation costs by operating much more frequently than today's rockets. He also has talked about his long-term vision of "millions of people living and working in space."  Unlike Mr. Musk, who relishes making a steady stream of splashy announcements setting increasingly aggressive goals, Mr. Bezos remained virtually silent to outsiders until after Blue Origin pulled off its coup of successfully landing a New Shepard booster back at its West Texas launchpad in late 2015.  The unmanned vehicle flew a suborbital test to 333,000 feet, reached nearly four times the speed of sound, and then both the capsule and its liquid-fueled rocket separately landed safely -- ready for another flight. At the time, Mr. Bezos projected commercial space-tourism flights could start "sometime in 2017." He also said "full reuse is a game changer" for access to space.  In November 2016, when he disclosed plans for a series of larger rockets with substantially more thrust, Mr. Bezos issued a stark reminder of how different his approach is versus that of Mr. Musk.  Noting "our mascot is the tortoise," Mr. Bezos said "deliberate and methodical wins the day, and you do things quickest by never skipping steps."  Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

By Luigi Zingales is the Robert C. McCormack Distinguished Service Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance at the University of Chicago – Booth School of Business. He is a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a Research Fellow of the Center for Economic Policy Research, and a Fellow of the European Corporate Governance Institute. Cross-posted from Evonomics. After his election, it was difficult to predict what President Trump would do. In the election campaign he said everything and the opposite of everything: from a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports to the reintroduction of the separation of commercial and investment banks, from an aggressive use of antitrust authority to the total abolishment of Dodd-Frank, the financial regulation that was enacted after the crisis. After two months, it is clear that the Trump industrial policy will be pro-business, not pro-market. It may seem to be a nuance, but there is a fundamental difference. A pro-business policy favors existing companies at the expense of future generations. A pro-market policy favors conditions that allow all businesses to thrive without any favoritism. A pro-business policy defends domestic enterprises with favorable rates and treatment. A pro-market policy opens the domestic market to international competition because doing so would not only benefit consumers, but would also benefit the companies themselves in the long term, which will have to learn to be competitive on the market, rather than prosper thanks to protection and state aid. A pro-business policy turns a blind eye (often two) when companies pollute, evade, and defraud consumers. A pro-market policy seeks to reduce the tax and regulatory burden, but ensures that laws are applied equally to all. Paradoxically, a pro-business policy ends up damaging not only the economy, but also, in the long-run, those companies that it had originally benefited. This matters little to its supporters, because when the chickens come home to roost they will have already grossed billions. Angelo Mozilo, founder of Countrywide, the bank responsible for a large chunk of the toxic mortgages that led to the 2008 crisis, lives happily on the $600 million he accumulated, despite the enormous damage of the financial crisis that he helped to create. During the presidential campaign Trump used many populist themes. The first signal that his policies will be neither populist nor popular, but strictly pro-business, is his choice of Cabinet members. Trump had promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington of lobbyists. Few realized that he would do that by making intermediaries pointless, as the lobbyists themselves would be in charge of the departments: the CEO of Exxon as head of foreign policy, a former Goldman Sachs partner at the Treasury, the daughter of a ship owner for Transportation, a raider at Commerce, etc. The second signal was the president-elect’s picks to head the most important government agencies. As the head of the EPA, Trump placed a lawyer who sued the EPA in Oklahoma for the oil industry. As the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Trump has chosen a lawyer experienced in defending companies accused of fraud and international corruption. What’s more, the new chairman of the SEC is married to a partner at Goldman Sachs, a company regulated by the SEC. The third signal was Trump’s threat to introduce a “border tax,” another name for a tariff on imports. This tax will not only serve the protectionist desires of some parts of U.S. industries, but also provide financial resources to cover the promised reduction in direct taxation. The tax would be contrary to the World Trade Organization’s rules. However, Trump has threatened that the U.S. will leave the WTO. The worst signal, however, comes from the way Trump has used his tweets to attack and coax American businesses. United Technologies (UT) has been praised for its decision to cancel plans to close its plant in Indianapolis and relocate it to Mexico. Apparently this decision was the result of tax benefits offered by Vice President-elect Pence, who is the governor of Indiana. In truth, the decision seems motivated by fear of reprisals on government contracts, which represent a large sum of UT’s revenues. A fear that appears justified, as Trump attacked Boeing over the cost (which he considered excessive) of the new presidential aircraft and attacked Lockheed Martin over the F-35 aircraft. Trump is probably right on both counts, and this only adds to his popularity, but a president should address these issues by following the rules and not with an execution on the public square of social media. With this strategy, Trump cleverly uses the carrot and stick approach. When Ford was publicly commended for deciding not to build a new plant in Mexico, the price of its shares rose 4.5 percent. Softbank did even better (+ 6.2 percent) after being praised by Trump for investing $50 billion in the United States. Softbank’s motive was simple: Softbank owns Sprint, a mobile operator that would like to merge with T-Mobile in order to increase market power. The authority to permit this merger lies with the new head of the Federal Trade Commission, yet to be named by Trump. Trump’s positive tweet feeds Softbank’s hopes that the merger will be approved. We would expect such behavior from a dictator of a banana republic, not from the President-elect of the oldest democracy in the world. The Trump presidency has begun in the worst possible way for all those who, like me, still believe in the market. 00000 This entry was posted in Guest Post on March 6, 2017 by Lambert Strether. About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Hicks March 6, 2017 at 4:07 am https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8IvKx0c19w Reply ↓ Gman March 6, 2017 at 9:31 am Great clip. ‘Funnily enough’ of the four US Presidents assassinated in office, three, Kennedy, Garfield and Lincoln all attempted to challenge or oppose the Central Banking System, and the fourth, McKinley, raised protective tariffs to promote American industry, and maintained the nation on the gold standard in a rejection of inflationary proposals only to be capped for his trouble in his second term. On the campaign trail a fired up, brave or stupid (or both) Trump was fiercely critical of the Fed’s clearly politicised rôle in the US economy, but to be fair it was sh*t or bust time for him, and few expected it was him, instead of the on message Hillary, they’d be giving the ‘little talk’ to anyway. Reply ↓ a different chris March 6, 2017 at 9:02 am >Distinguished Service Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance at the University of Chicago Ok, so the guy who “believes in the market” has never been part of it in his life – you get to be an academic by making only a handful of “sales”, to a very small group of people at a time, in your whole life. Not really the same as running a bodega. >which will have to learn to be competitive on the market We know what it takes to be competitive with China – pay employees $3/day and yet still have the government subsidize you and protect you on your home turf. Oh, that’s not real appealing? Well then go back into your ivory tower. >a president should address these issues by following the rules What rules? Whose rules? I don’t see anything in the Constitution about this… He says what Trump has done has accomplished what Trump wanted to accomplish. I don’t like hardly anything Trump has done, but I’m not sure what our Distinguished Professor is protesting about? He/she likes “markets” because he/she (tenure, 6 fig salary) is a “consumer” and sees things only that way. Reply ↓ RenoDino March 6, 2017 at 9:09 am What I love about the new regime is look on the faces of the captains of industry who meet in Trump’s boardroom who can’t believe their good fortune after having opposed him every step of the way. He is now giving them everything they want, and they don’t want the dream to stop. They know what he is doing is complete and utter madness based upon everything they’ve had to deal with up until now. He is literally giving them the keys to the Capitol and only asking for some vague promises of American jobs in return. These titans of industry didn’t even mastermind this takeover. It was handed to them after they fought against it by supporting the establishment candidate. They are captives of a giant Cheeto from Hell who, like Pedro, will make all of their wildest dreams come true. Acting like everything is normal is the hard part. Reply ↓ oh March 6, 2017 at 9:52 am We would expect such behavior from a dictator of a banana republic, not from the President-elect of the oldest democracy in the world. We’ve been acting more like a banana republic since 9/11 and yes, we have no more bananas. Reply ↓ JEHR March 6, 2017 at 11:11 am “not from the President-elect of the oldest democracy in the world.” Well, I see this said so often (by Americans) that I wondered whether or not it is true: Which country can claim to be the World’s oldest democracy? Russell Campbell, Dunedin, New Zealand Lots of them can. And do. Greece has a pretty good claim having invented the concept in the first place. However, long spells as an Ottoman colony or under military junta might put it out of the running if you’re looking for longest continuously democratic country. Britain has a decent claim but it depends what you mean by democracy. As Rowan Atkinson put it in Blackadder: “take Manchester for instance. Population: 60,000. Electoral roll: 3”. America frequently claims to be but this is because they define democracy so narrowly and in their own image such that on their criteria they’re the worlds only democracy and on any other criteria they still aren’t and never have been. Seth, Edinburgh, Scotland Perhaps Iceland can – their parliament, the Althing, is the oldest one still in use. It was formed in 930 by Vikings. Johan van Slooten, Urk, Netherlands Reply ↓ MaroonBulldog March 6, 2017 at 12:09 pm The Republic of San Marino claims to be the world’s oldest democracy. Reply ↓ Tom Bradford March 6, 2017 at 7:24 pm In the USA half the population – the female half – had no voice in ‘democracy’ before 1920. The first nation to give women generally the vote was New Zealand in 1893 so I’d say theirs is the oldest true democracy. But as argued above, it all depends on what you mean by “democracy”. Reply ↓ susan the other March 6, 2017 at 12:04 pm Maybe the reason why our dear professor didn’t mention jobs is because he knows there aren’t any. If he really wanted to get at Trump, jobs is the only way to do it. Trump made such big promises – a job for everyone stuff. It will be a long time before any significant jobs materialize. Trump’s reasoning seems to be to cut the fat out of government (also cutting so many jobs he might not ever make up for it) to free up the money to do some big PR infra which he can boast as job creation. When it will only be 6s. But if the professor knows there really aren’t any jobs for a variety of market reasons (markets are the culprits), how on earth can he believe in the markets. That’s just nonsense. In order to “believe” in markets, first you must believe in labor. So it is almost safe to say we will never have those old ideal markets ever again. We need to find a new mechanism to create our economies. Labor-less yet equal. Maybe. Reply ↓ shinola March 6, 2017 at 1:44 pm ” A pro-market policy seeks to reduce the tax and regulatory burden, but ensures that laws are applied equally to all.” Just where does this benign, self-correcting market that the good professor rhapsodizes about exist? In Camelot? Perhaps it’s just around the corner from El Dorado.. Reply ↓ RUKidding March 6, 2017 at 1:50 pm And up the street from Xanadu. Reply ↓ TG March 6, 2017 at 3:34 pm “A pro-business policy defends domestic enterprises with favorable rates and treatment. A pro-market policy opens the domestic market to international competition because doing so would not only benefit consumers, but would also benefit the companies themselves in the long term,..” With respect, what parallel dimension does this person come from? Is that the one where Spock has a beard and is evil? The United States was, until relatively recently historically, strongly protectionist. All four presidents carved on Mt. Rushmore were unashamed in-your-face protectionists. They, and those like them, took the United States from being a backwards agricultural colony and turned it into the greatest industrial power the world had ever seen. But now that the United States has turned towards race-to-the-bottom trade policies, it has lost ground to other more mercantilist nations, such as China and South Korea. Certainly Trump may well botch things, and there is a difference between intelligent protectionism and crony-capitalism. But overall your thesis lacks even face validity. Reply ↓ Clearpoint March 6, 2017 at 4:20 pm Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t being a true believer in the “free market” a mandatory job requirement of being a tenured professor at the Chicago School of Economics? Care to put that little conflict of interest to a “free market” test professor market? Reply ↓ VietnamVet March 6, 2017 at 8:33 pm This article adds clarity. The oligarchs haven’t changed. A subset led by Donald Trump seized control of the US federal government. They are “nationalists”. Another subset “globalists” lost power. Corporate media; GE, News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS, together with the intelligence community are pushing a soft coup to get back in charge via impeachment or the 25th amendment. Yesterday, Verizon’s Huffington Post headline read “Unglued”. Once the populist rhetoric by western politicians is shown to be a huge con, the collapse of the Atlantic Alliance will be inevitable. The chaos of the Shock Doctrine is engulfing the world. Reply ↓ Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The company is also testing the printer to make prototypes of one-piece auto parts that could be used in production of future vehicles. The use of a 3D printer capable of manufacturing parts of unlimited size and shape "could be a breakthrough for vehicle manufacturing," the automaker stated in a news release. Ford is testing the Stratasys Infinite-Build 3D printer, which was one of two new industrial machines announced last fall. The printer can also build objects using materials such as carbon fiber for lighter weight and stronger parts. Stratasys Stratasys' new Infinite-Build 3D Demonstrator and Robotic Composite 3D Demonstrator allow manufacturers to build parts of near limitless sizes with greater detail, strength and ligher weight than before. For example, Ford said, a 3D-printed spoiler may weigh less than half of its metal-cast equivalent. "Increasingly affordable and efficient, 3D printing large car parts, like car spoilers, could benefit both Ford and consumers," Ford stated. "Parts that are printed can be lighter in weight than their traditionally manufactured counterparts, and may help improve fuel efficiency." 3D printing technology, Ford said, can provide a more efficient and affordable way to produce tooling, prototype parts, or components at low volumes, like Ford Performance vehicles, or for personalized car parts. The new 3D print system is located at Ford's Research and Innovation Center in Dearborn, Mich. The Stratasys Infinite Build 3D printer was designed specifically to address the requirements of the aerospace and automotive industries by being able to build completed parts with repeatable mechanical properties. Boeing is also testing an Infinite-Build 3D printer to explore the production of low volume, lightweight parts. The printer uses a "screw" or "worm" drive filament extruder, enabling it to print with composite materials, such as carbon fiber, which doesn't shrink or warp as much as more common thermoplastics. Typically, fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers press a polymer filament through a pair of wheels or gears and out of a heated extruder head, layer by layer. A screw extruder winds the filament through the head, which increases the flow pressure needed tor extruding composite materials. Stratasys' Infinite-Build 3D printer uses a horizontal build platform versus a traditional vertical platform to create printed objects. By turning the platform horizontally, the machine can build parts sideways, which translates into a build area that's only limited by the space a manufacturer has. "This gives us the capacity for making much larger parts and to gain much lighter assembly," said Ellen Lee, technical leader at Ford's additive manufacturing research facility.

Many MSPs are seen to be stuck in the same comfort cycle of doing business within the few markets that they are comfortable in, but delivering stellar growth goes beyond doing just that; they need to take risks and branch out, or risk being gone. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with SolarWinds MSP, addressed key trends in the market for MSPs, diversifying areas of play – from SMB through to mid-market and enterprise, lucrative verticals, the importance of strategic alliances, as well as expanding into niche areas such as cybersecurity and ransomware and using them as a hook for customer conversations.

March 13, 2017 Issue Who Is Trump’s Friend Jim?  An investigation into the “substantial guy” who told the President that “Paris is no longer Paris.”  By Lauren Collins Donald Trump has a friend named Jim, “a very, very substantial guy.” We don’t know much else about Jim, except that, as Trump recently told a crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference, “he loves the City of Lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris. It was automatic with his wife and his family. Hadn’t seen him in a while. And I said, ‘Jim, let me ask you a question: How’s Paris doing?’ ‘Paris? I don’t go there anymore. Paris is no longer Paris.’ ” Trump can remind you of Jane Austen’s Mrs. Bennet. For all his talk of fake news, he seems to get a decent amount of information over whatever the Fifth Avenue equivalent is of the garden fence. A man of few intimates, he often cites acquaintances: his “many fabulous friends who happen to be gay” (he went on to say that he opposed both same-sex marriage and long putters, because he’s a traditionalist); “the very famous German golfer Bernhard Langer,” who he said told him he’d witnessed voter fraud at his local polling station. (Langer’s daughter told the Times, “He is not a friend of President Trump’s, and I don’t know why he would talk about him.”) And so, in an attempt to suss out the source of inspiration for Trump’s latest foray into European diplomacy, a search was undertaken for his formerly Francophilic friend Jim. Trump doesn’t follow any Jims on Twitter. But it’s easy to find Jims with whom he’s crossed paths. Jim Kelly, formerly of the Buffalo Bills? “No, that would not be Jim Kelly,” a representative said. Jim Dolan, the C.E.O. of Cablevision and the chairman of Madison Square Garden, who lent Trump the Rockettes for his inaugural concert? “That’s not him,” his spokesperson responded. Jim Furyk, the golfer? “Not him,” according to his agent. Jim Davis, the footwear mogul, whose support for Trump prompted a hate Web site to declare New Balance “the Official Shoes of White People”? “No, it is not Jim Davis,” a company P.R. manager replied. Jim Inhofe, the senator and climate-change denier, did not respond; neither did Jim McNerney, the former Boeing executive, who is part of the President’s Kitchen Cabinet. Jim Mattis, the “Warrior Monk” general, doesn’t have a wife. James Comey—does anybody know if he goes by Jim? Jim, from Trump’s description, sounds old, settled, rich. His Paris, one imagines, spanned from Cartier to L’Ami Louis. But he didn’t ring a bell for observers of the New York–Palm Beach power scene. “I haven’t got a clue as to who Trump’s friend Jim is,” David Patrick Columbia, of New York Social Diary, said. “I know a few Juleses but no Jims who fit the bill,” the writer William Norwich said, confessing that he’d been puzzling over Jim’s identity ever since Trump name-checked him. “You really think there is an actual person?” the journalist Kati Marton asked. “Jim is akin to Mexican rapists and Swedish terrorists.” The Web site of the party photographer Patrick McMullan yielded only two Trump-adjacent Jims: Jim Gold, who has posed next to Melania at charity events and, as the C.E.O. of Neiman Marcus, presumably can’t get away with shunning Paris; and Jim McGreevey, who attended an after-party for the première of a movie called “Ira & Abby” at the Viceroy Hotel in Santa Monica with Trump in 2006, after a sex scandal forced him to resign as governor of New Jersey. “I only wish!” McGreevey, who now runs a reëntry program for prisoners in Jersey City, wrote. “The last time I was in Paris was eight years ago, with my then seven-year-old daughter. Vive la France, Jim.” A promising lead: Jim O’Neill, a managing director at Peter Thiel’s investment fund, whom Trump is said to be considering to run the F.D.A. O’Neill did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment, nor did the White House. Or was Jim the same Jim who’s been in Trump’s life since before “The Art of the Deal,” in which he wrote of a college classmate, “a guy with a 180 IQ,” who “couldn’t have sex with his wife” because he was so stressed out about buying a house? (“The only famous person I knew of at Penn was Candice Bergen,” said Jim Ellowitch, Wharton ’68, who didn’t remember any other Jims.) In a strange Trumpian inversion, Jim the Francophobe was turning out to be the jet-setting counterpart to those vague characters (like Joe the Plumber) with whom politicians have so long stocked their narratives of economic stagnation. Last week, François Hollande, the French President, criticized Trump for his comments, offering to send him or Jim a ticket to Disneyland Paris. Regular Parisians, though, just wanted to know what had happened to ruin Jim’s last trip—whether it was the rain or the new spa at the Ritz or something else. Jim, if you’re out there, levez-vous, s’il vous plaît.  ♦ Lauren Collins began working at The New Yorker in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008.

The government has regular communications” with officials of the Trump administration, he said. Any US protectionist economic measures or trade sanctions can be responded in kind, Li said. The Chinese government can also apply pressure on American businesses in China, such as last December’s fine on General Motors Co.’s Chinese venture, he said. SAIC General Motors Corp, a venture with China’s largest carmaker producing Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet vehicles in Shanghai, was fined 201 million yuan (US$29 million) on December 23 last year. The venture had pursued monopolistic pricing with dealers, according to a report by state broadcaster CCTV, citing Shanghai’s antitrust authority. The fine, equivalent to 4 per cent of the 2015 sales of the venture’s Cadillax SRX, Chevrolet Trax and Buick Excelle models, would hardly cause a dent in General Motors’ China business. The Detroit-based carmaker reported a 2015 operating profit of US$2.1 billion in China. Still, the timing of the fine underscored China’s resolve to use economic tactics for political ends. It came a week after President Elect Trump questioned why the US should continue to observe the so-called “One China” policy -- a cornerstone of Sino-US relations that China considers sacrosanct -- unless Beijing is willing to concede on policies that obstruct American interests. Many US companies from aircraft maker Boeing Co., to iPhone producer Apple Inc, to coffee purveyor Starbucks Inc. depend on the world’s most populous market for a substantial part of their global sales and growth. The China market makes up more than a third of General Motors’ global sales. American businesses will be increasingly vulnerable to the Chinese government’s ire, if Sino-US relations take a turn for the worse. Qualcomm Inc, the San Diego-based supplier of chip sets for smartphones, was fined US$975 million in February 2015 for breaching Chinese antitrust rules. That’s the highest fine in China’s corporate history, following a 14-month long investigation into Qualcomm’s anti-competition practices. To the stick in China’s economic tool kit, Chinese premier Li Keqiang is offering carrots to neutralise any potentially hostile US policies, pledging to promote worldwide economic cooperation and defend global trade. China will “forcefully optimise business environment for foreign investors,” lower the barriers to entry in services, manufacturing, mining and allow foreign companies to raise funds in China’s onshore equity and bond markets, Li said in his annual work report to the Chinese parliament. Continuing the trend of deregulation and easing in red tape, China’s central government will give local authorities the mandate to offer their own preferential policies, subsidies and incentives to woo foreign investors, Li said. “China’s doors will only open wider, and China will continue to be the most attractive destination for foreign investments,” the premier said.

So what’s left when you and your company reign supreme among the planet’s retailers? Apparently, the answer is to take your business off Earth. According to a report from TechCrunch, Bezos wants his space flight venture Blue Origin to supply goods, equipment, and eventually people to a hypothetical moon colony, and he wants to get started by 2020. Blue Origin was founded way back in 2000, and began test flights in 2015, reaching space with their second test flight and managing a full recovery-and-reuse flight in early 2016 – rather a better record than rival venture SpaceX, which, as per the Guardian, made headlines worldwide with a very public failure to achieve liftoff in September, 2016, blowing up their rocket only 4 feet off the launchpad. SpaceX rockets actually have a 93% success rate, but their public failures have hurt their image. [Image by NASA via Getty Images] Bezos and Blue Origin have plans to start manned test flights this year, with tourist flights (if all goes well) in 2018. But Bezos has his sights set on bigger things, as revealed by a confidential seven-page white paper sent both to NASA and the Trump administration, regarding Blue Origin’s plans to develop a lunar lander able to drop cargo on the moon and return to Earth. Bezos wants flights to start by mid-2020, and the letter urges officials to make plans to establish a “permanently inhabited lunar settlement.” It’s a bold move, trying to bring NASA and an administration which seems dedicated to sweeping cuts on board with establishing a permanent American presence on the moon. NASA hasn’t sent a shuttle into space since 2011, and the Trump administration recently revealed plans to practically eliminate the NOAA’s satellite budget in favor of an expanded military, alongside other government and research cuts. Bezos is seeking a commitment both in funding and expertise from NASA, although he plans to invest his own funds alongside them. In spite of the current outlook for American research and space travel, Bezos is adamant. “It is time for America to return to the Moon — this time to stay,” he told the Washington Post (which he also owns) after the letter, marked “proprietary and confidential,” was leaked to the press. It urges the space agency and the government to back an Amazon-like shipment service to the moon. “A permanently inhabited lunar settlement is a difficult and worthy objective. I sense a lot of people are excited about this.” The plan is to land a spacecraft at the moon’s south pole, where there is a constant source of light for solar panels and nearby water ice which can be used both for drinking water and in the creation of rocket fuel. The design would allow for shipments of up to 10,000 pounds at a time, and is intended to be compatible with NASA’s existing launch craft, Boeing/Lockheed Martin’s United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket, and Blue Origin’s own New Glenn rocket, still in development. While the moon’s surface is certainly inhospitable, the lack of atmosphere (Mars does have an atmosphere) actually makes many aspects of a landing and subsequent return easier. [Image by NASA/Newsmakers] Bezos, Blue Origin, and NASA itself anticipate that, unlike the Obama administration, the Trump administration will make returning to the moon a focus. Many have suggested that establishing a permanent moon base will have serious military implications, making it an attractive target for Trump’s intent to enhance American military capability. Obama rejected plans for a return to the moon in 2010, saying “we’ve been there before,” shortly before NASA’s shuttle program was suspended. But their counter-proposal for a manned mission to Mars never came close to fruition, and critics quickly became frustrated that NASA hasn’t been able to take humans further than low Earth orbit in four decades. A moon shot isn’t at all unfeasible, and could revitalize public interest in manned space exploration. In light of that, NASA has stepped up plans to resume manned space flights, aiming for a manned mission in 2019. Bezos, and other companies, want to be there to meet them. “Blue Moon is all about cost-effective delivery of mass to the surface of the Moon. Any credible first lunar settlement will require that capability.” [Featured Image by NASA via Getty Images] Now Watch This: SpaceX Plans To Fly Tourists Around The Moon Now Read This: iPhone 8 News And Rumors: Flagship Loses Huge Feature, Gains Unique Tricks Share 12 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Don Crothers Tags: amazon, Jeff Bezos, nasa, the moon March 5, 2017 Selena Gomez ‘Struggles To Be Apart From The Weeknd,’ Couple Purchasing Home?

High Time Our Planes Shoot Deadly Lasers Rhett Jones Mar 6, 2017, 6:00am ⋅ Filed to:  aeroplanes lasers military Weapons Share US military bigwigs gathered in Orlando this week for the annual AirWarfare Symposium to discuss big plans for big weapons that do big damage. According to a report, the biggest unfunded project that US Special Operations Command hopes to push through is a C-130 that's equipped with a power laser weapon. An AC-130. Photo: Getty Lt. Gen. Brad Webb, the head of Air Force Special Operations Command tells Defence One that he's very optimistic about the project. "There are a lot of vendors that are really contributing to and continue to push that technology along," he says. The project has been floating around as a potential R&D effort for years. Back in 2015, Lt. Gen. Brad Heithold, who was then head of Air Force Special Operations Command, told Breaking Defence that he believes "we can put a high energy laser — offensive and defensive — on an AC-130 by the close of this decade." Webb says that the Airborne Laser program that attempted to out a defensive laser on the nose of a 747 jetliner had turned defence officials off of the technology. It never made it past it to the stage of actually producing an operational aircraft and it was canceled in 2012. But according to Webb, things have changed and as technology has improved, the project could get off the ground soon. First, "a relatively low-kilowatt laser" will need to be tested and the money is reportedly already in place for that. Lasers have been demonstrated by Boeing to be capable of burning a hole in the hood of a truck and the U.S.S. Ponce was given permission to use its Laser Weapon System (LaWS) prototype as a defensive weapon. Likewise, the plan is for C-130 aeroplanes to use the weapon as anti-ballistic missile defence that could be capable of offensive measures. Webb also acknowledged that "At some point ... a policy discussion is going to have to be had on where and how can you use a laser where and how can you not." With the White House calling for an increase of $US54 ($71) billion to the defence budget, it's possible that the project could find the funding. But that budget will have to get past congress and everyone in government is pretty tied up with investigating endless scandals right now.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Aaron Gregg By Aaron Gregg March 5 Follow @Post_AG Donald Trump’s presidency was quickly seen as a win for defense companies, who hope to benefit from what the commander in chief has vowed would be a military buildup of historic proportions. But after weeks of euphoric stock valuations, some analysts are warning such optimism could be misplaced given the dynamics in Congress. “We’ve tempered our expectations to the low end of the range and believe that the last week of April could devolve into political trench warfare, with neither side budging on priorities,” New York-based investment bank Cowen Group wrote in a research note last week. “Trump’s repeated promises on defense could hit the same Beltway traffic jam that Affordable Care Act repeal/replace and comprehensive tax reform seem to be stuck in.” Even the increases the White House has touted — which still need to work their way through both houses of Congress — are viewed by some as underwhelming. The White House said last week it would propose increasing the military’s budget by $54 billion, which the White House described as a 10 percent jump in defense spending. But others characterized the increase differently: only about $18 billion more than what the Obama administration had already planned, or a more modest 3 percent boost. [Trump promises ‘great rebuilding of the Armed Forces’ while signing executive order at the Pentagon] “It’s nothing close to the historically high growth rates that this thing had initially been positioned at,” said Byron Callan, managing director of Capital Alpha Partners, a provider of research to financial institutions. The budget increase announced Monday “is a pretty pedestrian increase compared to the Reagan era … some of these [defense] companies were growing at 15 to 20 percent in the early 1980s,” Callan said. [Trump’s defense spending increase isn’t extraordinary, but its impact could be] In general, defense investors have been ecstatic at the prospect of having another Republican in the White House, and Trump’s campaign statements about adding hundreds of ships and planes to the U.S. military arsenal have only boosted their optimism. The S&P’s Aerospace and Defense index has gained close to 20 percent of its value since election night and has easily outperformed the Dow Jones industrial average, which is itself reaching all-time highs. But observers have been warning for months that congressional politics would make it hard for the president to achieve his defense goals, and an otherwise-giddy investor community is starting to take notice. “There was euphoria in these early months at the generic goals Trump had laid out when he was a candidate,” said MacKenzie Eaglen, a military analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But the increases announced Monday “were not historic, and the political dynamics are hardening, not softening. Everything is a party-line vote now.” [Four questions about how Trump would affect the military industrial complex] To substantially expand the military, Trump will have to muster enough votes in Congress to repeal the Budget Control Act, which has capped defense spending for the past few years. Some defense investors worry such a move could meet stiff resistance from those fighting corresponding cuts to agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department. A research note from Howard Rubel, an investment banker with D.C.-based Jefferies, said the president’s initial budget plan is “likely to be dead on arrival,” because proposed Environmental Protection Agency and State Department cuts will alienate moderate Democrats and a lack of entitlement reform provisions will irk Republican budget hawks. But Trump is also facing pressure from defense-minded members of the House and Senate, who say his spending plan doesn’t go far enough. Even as President Trump boasted Thursday about what he is calling “one of the largest defense spending increases in American History” from atop a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier in Newport News, Va., high-ranking Republicans in Congress attacked his budget proposal for underfunding the military. “With a world on fire, America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3 percent more than President Obama’s budget. We can and must do better,” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Monday in a statement. Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio) accused the White House of “fake budgeting” for claiming its $54 billion budget increase would increase defense spending by 10 percent, when the plan is only 3 percent higher than what Obama had planned. And Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, also called the funding level insufficient. For all his talk about a defense buildup, Trump has also sought to cast himself as a tough negotiator determined to cut better deals for the taxpayer. The president’s targeted tweets at defense companies — such as when he threatened to cancel Boeing’s Air Force One contract or replace Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter with a cheaper plane — set the industry abuzz because of the way they shifted blame for federal largesse onto the companies receiving military contracts. “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of … the fantastic — and it is a fantastic — new F-35 jet fighter,” Trump said in his speech to Congress last week. He went on to imply that the browbeating would continue: “We’ll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government.” But so far it seems that the companies in his crosshairs have mostly benefited. Each time specific companies have been the subject of his tweets their stock prices have wavered only slightly, in each case recovering lost value within a few hours. Even Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which have been the subject of highly public criticism from the president over certain contracts, have seen their stock values increase by 11 percent and 28 percent respectively since Election Day. Trump’s highly public negotiations with Lockheed Martin over the F-35 contract resulted in a contract deal that shaved $728 million from the cost of the contract and brought the unit price of the plane below $95 million for the first time, reductions that were generally in line with what the government was already planning. It is not clear that Lockheed Martin will take much of a financial hit. In a February conference call, Lockheed Martin chief financial officer Bruce Tanner said he still expects the company’s operating margins on the F-35 to increase in the coming year, even after negotiations with the president. business capitalbusiness true Please provide a valid email address.

Can that entrenched trend be reversed? A growing number of market experts believe the answer is yes. "I'm very optimistic," small businessman Drew Greenblatt told CNBC's "On The Money" in an interview. "We're going to see an American manufacturing renaissance" Greenblatt, chair of the National Association of Manufacturers and president of Baltimore-based Marlin Steel Wire Products, pointed to policies that Trump wants to enact as a potential catalyst to new hiring. "We're talking about reducing regulations by 75 percent, cutting our tax rate from 40-something percent to 15 percent," he said. "It's just going to make America more attractive to bring back opportunities to our country," he added. However, in industries such as apparel, more than 97 percent of clothing and shoes are made overseas. Given the entrenched economic realities, others are skeptical that any government policy can spark a manufacturing rebound "There's not much that can bring most of those jobs back, " retail consultant Jan Kniffen told CNBC in an interview. "We haven't made patterns in America, we haven't made the product in America forever," he said. Kniffen added that the U.S. "would need factories, but those factories would have to be so automated, the jobs would be maintaining the equipment not producing the product." That is because "the cost of producing abroad is so low and shipping not that much," he said. Greenblatt remained optimistic that at least some sectors could see a resurgence. " I acknowledge some industries are not coming back here, it makes more sense to do it elsewhere. But things like making airplanes and bulldozers and cars, it's going to grow here, it's going to thrive here." Greenblatt's Marlin Steel exports to 39 countries from its Maryland factory. He told CNBC that the company designs and fabricates wire baskets for automotive clients including Toyota Motor and General Motors. "We make baskets for Caterpillar and Boeing," he said. "These companies are building factories in America, growing factories in America and they're poised for big expansion as these policies improve." Kniffen, however, sees a longer timeline. "I think what he just described is a 15- to 20-year program if you could do it in terms of training," he said. However, both men cited a significant lack of trained workers to fill available jobs. In a 2015 report, the Manufacturing Institute said that over the next decade, more than 3 million manufacturing jobs would need to be filled as current workers retire or move on to other jobs. However, because of the decline in necessary skills, barely a million of those positions will be staffed, in part because fewer students are receiving the necessary training in schools. "There is a significant skills gap", Greenblatt said. "We need schools to be teaching math, English, the STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Math] educations. These things are critical to create the talent pool so we can hire these people." Another trade change the Trump administration is considering is the border-adjustment tax, as part of an effort to fund a border wall with Mexico. The proposal would place a 20-percent tax on all goods imported into the U.S., but outgoing American-made goods would not be subject to the tax. Kniffen told CNBC he was "conceptually" is in favor "of a cross border tax," but cited significant risks. Some experts say a border tax would be passed on to American consumers, and may result in the loss of jobs in certain sectors. "I think it would bring back jobs, and we would get exports," he said. "But in the short term the disruption would be enormous, my retailers would all go broke...and we wouldn't bring those (retail) jobs back. " Kniffen added it "could be a net positive long term". But "in the short term, it could be very painful." On the Money airs on CNBC Saturday at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets.

News Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Archive Editorial: The Caterpillar raid Saturday Mar 4, 2017 at 7:00 PM For a second there Thursday it seemed the moving vans had come early to Caterpillar's global headquarters in downtown Peoria following the January shocker that the company's top brass would be relocating to the Chicago area. On closer inspection, unfortunately, the vehicles were occupied by federal agents — from the IRS, etc. — swarming on 100 NE Adams St. to remove a few items, alright: specifically documents and electronic records listed on a federal search warrant as part of a criminal investigation into allegations of tax evasion. Agents also descended on facilities in East Peoria and Morton. You don't see that every day with a Fortune 100 company, and we can't recall ever witnessing it locally. Ironically, the raid comes just one week after the president met with Cat Chairman Doug Oberhelman and professed his admiration for this "great company ... I love Caterpillar." The company has long been a White House darling, hosting George W. Bush here in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009, with another visit seemingly in the works with the new president. His Justice Department didn't wait for an invitation. The raid sought evidence regarding allegations brought to light eight years ago in a lawsuit filed by a former employee, Daniel Schlicksup, who argued that he had been wrongfully demoted for blowing a whistle on the practice of shifting profits to a subsidiary in Geneva, Switzerland from parts he said were actually sold and shipped out of the Morton facility, ostensibly to avoid U.S. taxes estimated at some $2.4 billion in this case. Cat would later settle with Schlicksup, but not before drawing the attention of the IRS, the U.S. Senate and some shareholders who sued, as well. Caterpillar has consistently maintained its innocence and continued to last week, with CEO Jim Umpleby citing its cooperation with the investigation but saying, "We are Caterpillar. We are an honorable company ... We conduct our business within the framework of applicable laws and regulations." We'd like to give Cat the benefit of the doubt. In a nation that imposes one of the highest corporate rates in the industrialized world at 35 percent, it has hardly been the poster child for going out of its way to dodge its taxes — see the likes of General Electric, Boeing, etc. for that distinction. Meanwhile, Congress has dragged its feet on reforming an outdated tax code that arguably hampers U.S. competitiveness.  Given that, it is not unfair to ask: Why Cat? Why now? These issues go back to the beginning of this century, spanning four CEOs. Has something changed? We don't have that answer. Certainly we've noticed that Caterpillar has been getting it from all sides of late. The SEC is looking into its 2011 purchase of the mining company Bucyrus as well as sales of equipment to nations considered sponsors of terrorism by our State Department, specifically Syria and Sudan. An investment group critical of Caterpillar executive compensation is seeking greater shareholder protections against "fraudulent behavior" by managers. Indeed, Cat's stock price, which has been up despite its staggering sales declines, took a hit in response to this news. In 2015, the company was found guilty by a federal jury of stealing trade secrets from a British supplier and hit with a sizeable penalty, which it has appealed. The warrants seemed to hint at searches beyond just the tax questions. Caterpillar still employs some 12,000 people in the Peoria area. We'd like to see it stay that way, and we won't hide our concern that this latest development likely doesn't help. As we've written before, we not only want the company that has been so synonymous with Peoria to do good, but to be good. Let's see where this goes.

Ford figures they will be lighter than their metal counterparts, and therefore more fuel efficient. The company will start with spoilers, those streamlined decorations fastened to car exteriors to make them look faster. For now, the company is testing parts for its Ford Performance race car division, but 3D-printed parts could be used for mass-market cars and trucks in the future. Ford released photos of 3D-printed parts, like the plastic molding for car interiors. The company hinted that it might one day be able to 3D-print more complicated parts, like intake manifolds. The 3D printing is taking place at the company’s factory in Dearborn, Michigan, using a printer made by the company Stratasys. Ford said Stratasys is “capable of printing automotive parts of practically any shape or length.” Jim Vurpillat, marketing director for Stratasys at its locations in Minneapolis and Israel, said 3D printing has been used in cars before, but only in “very limited” use for customized parts. He said that Boeing also uses a Stratasys printer. Other designers have experimented with 3D printing to make items with moving mechanical parts, like wheelchairs and parts for guns.

RUGABER The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — Reducing America’s huge trade deficits would deliver stronger economic growth and improve national security, the White House trade adviser said, in a speech that underscored the Trump administration’s harsh view of recent U.S. trade policies. Speaking at a National Association of Business Economics conference, Peter Navarro argued Monday that China and other trading partners use the proceeds from export sales to buy U.S. companies and technology, reducing America’s self-reliance. He says, for example, that only one U.S. company is capable of repairing the propellers on Navy submarines. “Might we lose a broader cold war for America’s freedom and prosperity, not by shots fired but by cash registers ringing?” Navarro said. “Might we lose a broader hot war, simply because we have sent our manufacturing and defense industrial base off-shore.” President Donald Trump named Navarro, a University of California-Irvine economist, to lead a new White House council on trade. The appointment signaled Trump’s intention to shake up relations with China. Navarro is a sharp critic of Chinese economic and military policies.

Navarro’s views on the trade deficit stand in stark contrast with mainstream economists, a difference he seemed to relish in his remarks. Most economists see trade deficits as an outcome of a nation spending more than it saves, rather than the result of bad trade deals. They worry that the measures pushed by Navarro, such as higher tariffs, would raise prices for imports of consumer goods such as clothes, toys and electronics. They also warn that it could spark retaliatory measures that would harm U.S. exports. Navarro on Monday said mainstream economists underestimated the damage caused by massive trade deficits. Last year, the United States exported $1.45 trillion in goods and imported $2.19 trillion, creating a trade deficit of more than $734 billion in goods, almost half of it with China. He said the Trump administration would reduce trade deficits by negotiating better trade agreements and reducing corporate tax rates and regulations to make American companies more competitive. Navarro waved away the argument that cracking down on imported goods would raise prices for American consumers. He says “modest inflation” would be a worthwhile price to pay for saving and creating U.S. jobs. “This seems to be an elitist out-of-touch argument, as it assumes that the poorest segments of our society would rather have cheap products than a good job, and a good paycheck,” he said. Navarro described his job as leading a “SWAT team” in the White House that helps U.S. companies contend with unfair trade practices abroad and burdensome regulations at home. His remarks also sketched out the full ambition of Trump’s trade policies. For example, Navarro said the administration wants to encourage more companies to make or source their parts in the United States, rather than simply assembling foreign made parts in the U.S. “One of the major goals of the Trump administration is to reclaim all of the supply chain and manufacturing capabilities that would otherwise exist if the playing field were level,” Navarro said. Yet this could be a tall order: Many large U.S. corporations source parts from dozens of countries around the world, a result of decisions made over decades. Boeing, for example, uses parts from 90 countries. Glenn Hubbard, who served as George W. Bush’s top economic adviser, said during a press briefing at the conference that forcing the relocation of supply chains “would be very disruptive.” “I don’t think business people are comfortable with that,” Hubbard added. Doug Elmendorf, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a former Clinton administration official, said that Trump’s proposed tax cuts and deregulatory agenda could accelerate the economy’s growth. But the administration’s trade policies could offset those benefits. “Their approach to trade policy is one thing that will lower growth,” Elmendorf said. PAUL WISEMAN CHRISTOPHER S.

Wilson - 03/06/17 05:30 AM EST 1   © Getty Former Rep. Ander Crenshaw (R-Fla.), who retired from Congress earlier this year, is joining law and lobby firm King & Spalding.  He’s becoming a senior counsel within the firm’s government advocacy and public policy practice. The firm says he’ll be specializing in issues involving the financial services, defense and healthcare sectors. “Congressman Crenshaw is widely regarded as a thoughtful, diligent legislator and has high-level contacts throughout the executive and legislative branches,” Wick Sollers, the managing partner of King & Spalding’s Washington office, said in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT Crenshaw was first elected to Congress in 2000, and served in the Florida state Senate and House of Representatives. In his private-sector life, he spent nearly two decades as an investment banker.  “Ander’s tenure in the House was marked by an ability to build consensus through common-sense arguments and strong advocacy,” said Tom Spulak, chair of the firm’s government advocacy and public policy practice.  On Capitol Hill, he sat on the House Appropriations Committee, including several of its subcommittees. He chaired its Financial Services and General Government Affairs subcommittee, responsible for funding of the Treasury Department. Crenshaw also concentrated his efforts on military funding, disability rights and international affairs, including helping to found the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent government agency focused on foreign aid. He also sponsored a piece of legislation called the ABLE Act to create tax-free savings accounts for people with disabilities. King & Spalding earned $3.7 million in lobbying revenues in 2016, with clients including the Muscular Dystrophy Association and Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace conglomerate third in size only to Boeing and Airbus. The firm also represents the government of Saudi Arabia. “King & Spalding’s roster of former government officials — elected and non-elected, both Democrat and Republican — was a compelling platform as I contemplated life after Congress,” said Crenshaw.  The firm boasts a lineup of former officials, including former Rep. Mike Andrews (D-Texas); Jeffrey Bucholtz, former acting assistant attorney general at the Justice Department; former Defense Department inspector general Eleanor Hill; former chief counsel at the IRS, Hap Shashy; Terry Snell, a national security and foreign policy adviser to Sen.

 The guy running Trump's trade policy just wrote a seriously troubling op-ed in The Wall Street Journal Linette Lopez Mar. 6, 2017, 10:55 AM 86,215 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters Peter Navarro writes like a man ready to start a trade war. In an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, the head of this administration's National Trade Council succinctly laid out why he thinks the US is losing its grip on the economy. Step by step he broke down his view on gross-domestic-product growth, trade deficits, and how the US's national security depended on keeping American assets in American hands. The problem, however, is that his conjectures have almost no relationship with the reality of how our economy works. Navarro misses the most important part of economic growth, demonizes innocuous trade measures, and paints a dark picture of America's place in the world. This has the effect of making Navarro seem paranoid — and for all the wrong reasons. Navarro's views expressed in the article shouldn't surprise many who've been following his career. The Economist called him a "China-bashing eccentric," and much of the US economics community was surprised by his appointment to the White House. Economist Lee Branstetter, a professor at Carnegie Mellon who is a former presidential trade adviser, told Business Insider that Navarro never studied the global free-trade system. "He doesn't publish in journals," he said. "What he's writing and saying right now has nothing to do with what he got his Harvard Ph.D. in ... He doesn't do research that would meet the scientific standards of that community. As far as I'm concerned he doesn't know what he's talking about in terms of trade policy." But Navarro does fit with the Trumpian worldview that the US is a victim and that there is no win-win situation in international economic dealing. So let's tiptoe through this one, shall we? How do we grow? Navarro's article opens with an incomplete premise, that US GDP growth comes from "only four factors: consumption, government spending, business investment and net exports (the difference between exports and imports)." This is the basis on which Navarro argues that having a trade deficit — buying more goods than you're selling to your trading partners — hurts growth and that the best way to grow faster is by closing this deficit. That is to say, selling more goods than you buy. In the most practical terms, for you that means fewer cheap South Korean flat-screen TVs until we can figure out a way to sell the South Koreans more stuff. Trump released a trade agenda that complained about that very thing last week, actually. Thing is, the trade deficit is far from the most important part of GDP. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 2016 trade deficit was about $500 billion. That's a lot, but it's a fraction of the other main components of GDP, like the $3 trillion of private investment and the $12.8 trillion in consumption last year. Two main factors for GDP growth — the trade deficit not among them — are accepted by economists pretty much the world over: labor-force growth and labor-force productivity. You can hire more workers, who then spend their wages and buy stuff, growing the economy, or you can make the workers you have make more stuff. As for the importance of a trade deficit as a measure of how healthy your economy is, note that during the Great Depression, the US had a trade surplus. It didn't matter that we were selling to the rest of the world like crazy because no one here had any purchasing power. What we import and export takes a seat way in the back compared with whether American citizens can buy things, go places, and make our economy move. So this right here, from Navarro's op-ed article, is a bit of a red herring, according to modern economic thinking: "Suppose America successfully negotiates a bilateral trade deal this year with Mexico in which Mexico agrees to buy more products from the U.S. that it now purchases from the rest of the world. This would show up in government data as an increase in U.S. exports, a lower trade deficit, and an increase in the growth of America's GDP." Two things here. One, nearly all economists think that ripping up the NAFTA deal with Mexico and Canada and dealing with them one-on-one puts the US at a disadvantage in negotiating and is a waste of time and money. Two, focusing on something as comparatively small as the trade deficit takes the Trump administration away from the real issue with slow GDP growth, and that's whether the workforce is growing or becoming more productive. Right now, both are slow. There are bunch of reasons for that, including a massive demographic shift as baby boomers leave the workforce and technological advancements that have changed the nature of American jobs. War-ready Now we have to talk about the paranoia in Navarro's piece. Navarro is worried that the US isn't battle-ready because, in his mind, it doesn't make anything. He is also concerned that foreign countries will buy up the US's military industrial complex: "Suppose the purchaser is a rapidly militarizing strategic rival intent on world hegemony. It buys up America's companies, technologies, farmland, food-supply chain — and ultimately controls much of the U.S. defense-industrial base. How might that alternative version of conquest by purchase end for our sons and daughters? Might we lose a broader cold war for America's freedom and prosperity, not by shots fired but by cash registers ringing? Might we lose a broader hot war because America has sent its defense-industrial base abroad on the wings of a persistent trade deficit?" At this point Navarro is hysterical, painting a picture of a US that is rapidly selling itself off bit by bit. This not the country of Google and Exxon Mobil. It's certainly not the country of Boeing and Lockheed Martin. This is a vision from a man who desperately fears a modern, globalized world and the change it brings with it. Instead of moving us forward, into a future in which American technology and innovation win in a dynamic interconnected world, he wants to take us back. For example, in the piece Navarro makes a plea for a dying industry: "America's ... shipbuilding industry is gathering barnacles." That's true, but shipbuilding has been declining around the world for years. Last year saw a 91% year-over-year decline in shipping contracts. It's a dying thing that no amount of government economic planning can rescue. The things Peter Navarro wants to fight against — the things that keep him up at night — are windmills, waving their blades at a paranoid mind. To charge them he wants to disrupt global supply chains and put up tariffs; he wants to bully the US's way into new markets and upset our trading partners. This is no way to do trade policy. But Navarro and his team seem on a reckless mission to try.   For more on what could come of US trade wars listen to BI's Linette Lopez and Josh Barro on their podcast, Hard Pass:     This is an opinion column.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Airlines laud DOT for putting two comment periods on ice By Brianna Gurciullo 03/06/17 10:00 AM EST With help from Tanya Snyder and Lauren Gardner PUT ON ICE: DOT has cut off the comment periods, at least temporarily, for a proposed rule on disclosing baggage fees and an information request on how airlines share flight details with comparison websites, saying a pause “will allow the president’s appointees the opportunity to review and consider” the Obama administration's actions. Story Continued Below On one side: Airlines for America had called for such a suspension on comments. The group's president and CEO, Nick Calio, praised Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao's "leadership" in a statement after DOT decided in A4A's favor. The group argues that the proposed rule would let the federal government “dictate how airlines sell and distribute products and services,” and the request for information would let the government “interfere in the commercial relationship between airlines and their distribution partners.” And the other: The president of the Travel Technology Association, whose members include sites like Priceline and Expedia, said the group was “disappointed” by DOT’s move. “Consumers deserve transparency in fare and schedule information and ancillary fees,” Steve Shur said in a statement. “DOT must live up to its mandate on consumer protection and ensure consumers have access to all the information they need to make a purchasing decision.” Also of note: The department announced that airlines won’t have to report data on mishandled scooters and wheelchairs until 2019, following a request from Delta and A4A. The so-called compliance date was originally a year earlier.

But as long as I’m holding the wheel. I don’t want no spitting on the bus.” (NJ Advance Media’s Larry Higgs) Want to keep up with MT’s song picks? Follow our Spotify playlist. A TWEET TO START OFF THE WEEK: From the Eno Center for Transportation’s Jeff Davis (@JDwithTW): “Sec. Chao has renamed the @USDOT blog. It was ‘Fast Lane’ but recent spike in fatal car crashes stigmatizes speed.” CANADA ON HER MIND? Chao could take a trip to Canada to learn more about Nav Canada, the nonprofit corporation that manages the nation’s air traffic control system, Canada’s transport minister told The Hill. Chao and Trump haven’t definitively said whether they would back a plan to spin off U.S. air traffic control functions from the FAA. But House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster is sure to advocate for such a proposal in the next bill to reauthorize the FAA. PELOSI SHOOTS DOWN RYAN’S INFRASTRUCTURE IDEA: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday for saying that, under an infrastructure plan, the private sector should spend $40 for every $1 the federal government spends. “That’s not going to have the impact that we need to build our infrastructure,” Pelosi told POLITICO Playbook’s Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman in an interview. ‘A notion-monger’: She also slammed President Donald Trump for promising investments in infrastructure without a fleshed-out plan. “The president, in addition to being a fear-monger, is a notion-monger,” Pelosi said. “There isn’t an idea that comes forward, something that says, ‘This is our goal, our vision. These are the facts about it. This is our plan to get it done.’ No, he just says, ‘We’re going to have an infrastructure [package].’” No go: Pelosi said public-private partnerships “could be a good formula” for a package. “But if [the proposal] is what we suspect it could be, [which] is wealthy individuals getting tax credits to build something which they will own and charge tolls, that’s not a go,” she said. TRAVEL BAN 2.0 EXPECTED TODAY: "President Donald Trump is expected to sign on Monday a new executive order on his controversial travel ban at the Department of Homeland Security, according to senior government officials familiar with the matter," POLITICO's Josh Dawsey and Nancy Cook report. "It is unclear how significant the changes to the current order will be or whether the White House will continue a court fight over its old order. The original order restrained immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, temporarily halted the entry of refugees and indefinitely shut down the entrance of refugees from Syria." THIS WEEK: Tuesday — The National Press Club holds a news conference on infrastructure needs with city officials. Airports Council International-North America unveils the results of a survey on airport infrastructure. Wednesday — The Washington Post holds a discussion with Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), former Transportation secretary Ray LaHood and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), among others, about infrastructure. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee holds a hearing on Elaine Duke’s nomination to serve as DHS deputy secretary. The House Homeland Security Committee marks up the Aviation Employee Screening and Security Enhancement Act of 2017 and the TSA Administrator Modernization Act of 2017, among other bills. The House Transportation Aviation Subcommittee holds a hearing on “air transportation in the United States in the 21st century.” The Senate Appropriations THUD Subcommittee holds a hearing on “funding our nation’s transportation infrastructure needs.” The Cato Institute hosts a discussion about “setting infrastructure priorities” in Rayburn. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association holds its Bob Hoover Trophy Reception. Thursday — A House Natural Resources subcommittee holds a hearing on “improving and expanding infrastructure in tribal and insular communities.” The House Transportation Water Resources Subcommittee holds a hearing on “the role of federal agencies in water infrastructure.” The House Appropriations THUD Subcommittee holds a Members’ Day hearing. WHO WAS THERE: CQ Roll Call’s Jacob Fischler reports the names of the officials who attended a Trump administration meeting on infrastructure last week: Check out the list. AMTRAK ‘COMMITTED’ TO GULF COAST SERVICE: Wick Moorman, the new president and CEO of Amtrak, wrote a letter to the Southern Rail Commission’s chairman reaffirming his corporation’s support for reviving passenger rail service along the Gulf Coast. “We are committed to operating both the long-distance and corridor services on the Gulf Coast route as soon as the necessary funding can be arranged, and the necessary agreements are in place to implement the service,” Moorman wrote. “I am committed along with the rest of the Amtrak team to working with the Commission and the Gulf Coast states to obtain the necessary commitments from the host railroads to determine the capital and operating needs of each service in order to advance all these important projects.” ON THE 13TH SURGE OF SAFETRACK WMATA GAVE TO ME: The latest SafeTrack surge has two phases: one that began Saturday and ends April 1, and another that begins April 2 and ends a week later. During the first phase, trains will single track between the Van Dorn Street and Huntington stops and the Braddock Road station. During the second phase, Yellow Line trains will single track between Huntington and King Street-Old Town. The Washington Post has more here. FIRST IN MT: More than 100 mayors signed on to letters asking lawmakers to turn down any proposal to separate air traffic control operations from the FAA. Among the group: seven mayors from South Dakota, home to Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune, and seven from Florida, home to ranking member Bill Nelson. The House Transportation Committee’s top Democrat, Peter DeFazio, might notice that three Oregon mayors signed on. One Pennsylvania mayor joined the effort against separation: Latrobe Mayor Rosemarie Wolford. But that probably won't stop Shuster from continuing to fight for his ATC overhaul plan. SHIFTING GEARS: Stacey Dion has joined the Carlyle Group as a managing director. Dion was vice president for corporate public policy at Boeing.

(ALC), with deliveries starting in 2019. In 2015, Los Angeles-based ALC made the first commitment to the long-range (LR) version of the A321neo, which will be able to fly around 206 passengers in a two-class layout on routes of up to 4,000 nautical miles. In November 2016, Dublin-based Aer Lingus confirmed it had issued a request for proposals (RFP) for seven A321neo LRs. Under a long-term lease agreement, ALC plans to deliver the first A321neo LR to Aer Lingus in the 2019 second quarter. Two more will be delivered in 2019, followed by four in 2020. ALC said Aer Lingus will operate the A321neo LRs on transatlantic and other routes. “The A321neo LR aircraft leased from ALC will allow Aer Lingus to eventually replace four Boeing 757s, and add more nonstop routes and frequencies to US and Canadian cities,” ALC executive chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said.
