自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Sep 25, 2016 - Page 15　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Americans might be going to Iran with Boeing deal The company is expected to open offices in Iran, where a hatred of the US was the ideological bedrock of the Islamic republic By Thomas Erdbrink  /  NY Times News Service, TEHRAN Long before the first newly purchased Boeing airliner lands at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Iran and the US will have had to come to terms with a new reality: US citizens would once again be taking up residence in Tehran, the first to do so since the Islamic Revolution and subsequent hostage crisis in 1979 and 1980. When the US on Wednesday gave the green light for the direct sale of Western planes to Iran, much more than about four decades of sanctions on such deals came to an end. Not that the deals approved by the US Department of the Treasury are insignificant: 80 Boeing jets and an initial batch of 17 Airbus planes out of a potential total of 118. However, the sale would have the important effect of ending an era of absolute isolation between the countries. Boeing would almost certainly have to open an administrative office in Tehran, and technicians would have to move here to train their Iranian counterparts in the care and maintenance of the planes. Among them, almost certainly, would be many Americans. That seems to be exactly what the US had in mind in approving the deal, Iranian analysts say. The deal not only allows Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to show a tangible gain from warming relations with the West, but also moves Iran that much closer to his ultimate goal of normalization of relations with the US. “Once this deal is a fact it will be much harder for the hard-liners to try to prevent relations with the United States,” said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political activist who supports Rouhani. “Nobody can deny that with the planes, people and know-how will enter Iran.” Word of the Boeing and Airbus deals came as Rouhani was attending the UN General Assembly in New York. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Rouhani said Iranian officials already had developed relationships with counterparts at both aviation companies through “many visits,” and that Iran welcomed foreign businesses and investments. “I do not see any problems,” he told reporters. It is the US government that is responsible for keeping US companies from the Iranian market, he said. “If Americans have problems, they need to resolve their own problems.” Buying planes from the US, opening a Boeing office or having US representatives at an international airport might seem insignificant. However, it would represent a tectonic shift in relations. In 1980, when ties between the countries were severed, all 140,000 Americans living in Iran were forced to leave. The US embassy was turned into an ideological museum and all US businesses left over the years, as sanctions made commerce increasingly difficult, and more recently, impossible. The bureaus of the New York Times, Bloomberg and some other news media organizations were long the only official US entities allowed to operate in Iran, either by the Iranian authorities or under US sanctions. When Conoco won an oil contract in Iran in 1995, it secretly opened an office in Tehran, only to close it when US Congress adopted tougher sanctions. Many Iranians hope the January nuclear agreement, which led to the lifting of some sanctions, changed all of that, citing the jetliner deal as the start of a new era. “We are getting to a point where the gap between economic relations and political normalization is gradually getting smaller,” said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1674 times.

Friday, 18 November 2016 اردو Türkçe العربیة فارسی Toggle navigation TASNIM NEWS .com Home All Stories Politics Economy World Defense Nuclear Society/Culture Science Sports Tourism Other Media Photos Interview Airbus, Boeing Representatives Due in Tehran Later This Month: Minister News ID: 1195030 Service: Economy September, 24, 2016 - 19:00 TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Iranian Minister of Road and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi said Saturday that representatives of Airbus and Boeing will travel to Tehran later this month to finalize talks on Iran’s purchase of passenger planes. Financial negotiations for the purchase of jetliners are underway with Airbus and Boeing, Akhoundi told reporters on Wednesday. He added that representatives of the two leading aviation rivals will travel to the Iranian capital in a few days to discuss legal issues related to the purchase of the aircraft. “After completing the legal talks, (we will) enter technical negotiations…,” he said. His remarks came after a spokesman for Airbus said on Wednesday that it had received two licenses from the US Treasury allowing it to export a total of 17 aircraft to Iran. Although based in Europe, Airbus needs US approval because of the high number of US parts in its jets. The US Treasury is expected to start approving sales of Boeing jets within days as well. Iran provisionally agreed earlier this year to buy over 200 jets worth $50 billion at list prices from Airbus and Boeing following the removal of anti-Tehran sanctions. Later, the US House of Representatives in July passed two amendments that would stop the aircraft sales, although to become law they need to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama. While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a lasting nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers- came into force in January, some Iranian officials have complained about the US failure to fully implement the accord. Back in March, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei said Americans have yet to fulfill what they were supposed to do as per the nuclear deal. Iran still has problems in its banking transactions or in restoring its frozen assets, because Western countries and those involved in such processes are afraid of Americans, the Leader said at the time, criticizing the US for its moves to prevent Iran from taking advantage of the sanctions removal.

Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding jets and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. US manufacturer Boeing says China is forecasted to become the world’s first trillion dollar market for new aircraft over the next two decades. Its latest China version of its Current Market Outlook (CMO) projects a demand for 6,810 new aircraft in the country over the next 20 years, valued at $1.025 trillion at list prices. Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle aircraft through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding jets and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new aircraft such as the 787, 777 and 777X.  This year's forecast reflects a continued shift from very large jets to efficient new small and medium widebody airliners. China's single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China's widebody fleet only represents approximately 5 percent of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. Worldwide, Boeing projects a larger demand for 39,620 new aircraft over the next 20 years in its Current Market Outlook, an increase of 4.1% over last year's forecast with annual growth of 4.8%, valuing future aircraft deliveries at $5.9 trillion. "Despite recent events that have impacted the financial markets, the aviation sector will continue to see long-term growth with the commercial fleet doubling in size," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "We expect to see passing, passenger traffic grow 4.8 percent a year over the next two decades."

About us Membership Contact us Fri November 18, 2016 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia U.S. approves export of Boeing, Airbus planes to Iran Economy September 23, 2016 The U.S. Treasury Department has granted permission to Boeing and Airbus to export commercial planes to Iran, a Treasury spokesperson told NPR. The government has approved a deal — not yet finalized — for Boeing to sell IranAir 80 commercial passenger aircraft. Thumbs-up from the Treasury is a major step forward on a key portion of last year's deal between Iran and six world powers including the U.S., in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from decades-long sanctions. That relief officially started in January, as we reported. "These licenses contain strict conditions to ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred to a designated entity," the Treasury spokesperson said. Boeing and Iran reached a $20 billion provisional agreement in late June for 80 aircraft, as NPR's Jackie Northam reported. Since then, the Treasury has "spent months scrutinizing the deal to see what technology will be used on the planes, and whether anyone remaining on a U.S. sanctions list is involved in the deal," Jackie said. She added that this marks the first time that Boeing has sold planes to Iran since its 1979 revolution. Jackie reports, "There is ferocious competition between Boeing and Airbus, and a good chance Boeing would be locked out of the Iranian market for decades if it didn't get this approval." The new aircraft are a major step toward modernizing and expanding "the country's elderly fleet", as Reuters reported. The Treasury also granted Boeing's competitor Airbus a license to sell 17 aircraft to IranAir, as Jackie reported. "Even though Airbus is based in Europe, it needs U.S. approval because its planes contain sophisticated technological equipment made in America. That includes the computers and navigational equipment." Both companies received the green light to sell a mix of wide-body and single aisle jets, Jackie said. She has reported that this deal is seen as an important test case for doing business with Iran, including big questions on financing: "Commercial aircraft are one of the very few products U.S. companies are allowed to sell to Iran. Even so, a deal has to be done without using American dollars or the U.S. financial system. This creates a problem even for international companies wanting to sell to Iran because most foreign banks have partnerships with American banks. "Former Treasury official Elizabeth Rosenberg says that's why all eyes are on Boeing to see if it can find innovative ways to pick through this financial minefield." The deals are also likely to "test conservative opposition" to the nuclear agreement in both the U.S. and Iran, as Reuters reported. In the U.S., many Republican lawmakers are against selling Iran planes, as are some conservatives in Iran.

If it works out, this will be the second change-of guard at this MRO. It was originally supposed to be run by American aircraft maker Boeing which built the unit. Mainly catering to Air India's own fleet, once leased out the carrier will only send its aircraft to Nagpur if the offer is competitive. The tender conditions call for the bidder to have a net worth of $10 million and a turnover with $50 million at least. The lessee will have to offer a guaranteed amount of $14 million with a yearly increase in line with wholesale price index (WPI). A monthly percentage of gross revenue will have to be shared over and above that. MRO was a part of the offset obligation to be fulfilled by Boeing following $11 billion aircraft deal with Air India in 2006. In 2010, the plan was changed and Boeing's role was limited to construction of MRO to be taken over by Air India Engineering Services for operations. After running the MRO for a year mainly catering to in-house aircraft, Air India is now planning to rope in a partner. There are plans to lease it out for 30 years on revenue sharing basis. Sources said the decision was taken recently while earlier there were plans of Air India to go solo. H R Jagannathan, CEO of Air India Engineering Services, told TOI a partner would bring in additional resources helping the MRO expand operations. Once leased out there would be no guarantee of in-house business from Air India and the operator will have to compete in open market, he said. Air India already has similar facilities in Mumbai and Delhi. Even if the offer fails, Nagpur MRO will continue to be an important facility for Air India in light of new acquisitions to happen. In the next 18 months, Air India may end up acquiring 40 new aircraft which will be a mix of Boeing and Airbus. A part of the fleet would be serviced in Nagpur. There are plans to expand the services in Nagpur by getting approvals from directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA). An approval is already there for Boeing 777 and an application has been put up for Airbus 320. The application for Boeing 737 aircraft will be moved soon, a source said. In a Nutshell * The $100 million Boeing MRO was announced in 2006 * It was considered an anchor investor to attract other units in Mihan-SEZ * Earlier Boeing was supposed to run the MRO * Eventually Boeing built it and handed it over to Air India * Now Air India wants to lease it out to a private companyStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Hensarling speaks during the testimony of Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Cordray in Washington. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:35 PM, September 23, 2016 WASHINGTON - Senior Republican U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers made clear on Friday they will keep campaigning against Boeing and Airbus jetliner sales to Iran, despite the Treasury Department's announcement that it had begun issuing licenses for the exports. Republican Representatives Pete Roskam and Jeb Hensarling wrote to Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which oversees sanctions, demanding more answers about any security implications of the delivery of aircraft to Iran. "There is little evidence indicating that Iran Air has indeed stopped transporting weapons, troops, and cash to terrorist groups and rogue regimes," the congressmen wrote in a letter, dated Thursday, seen by Reuters. Both congressmen hold influential financial positions in the House. Hensarling is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Roskam is chairman of the tax-writing Ways & Means Committee's Oversight subcommittee. Airbus<AIR.PA> and Boeing <BA.N> said on Wednesday they had received U.S. Treasury approval to begin exporting over 200 jets to Iran, under a deal struck in January. The news is likely to ease complaints from Iran over implementation of last year's international nuclear agreement, in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Some members of Congress have raised concerns that killing the deal could cost jobs at Boeing plants, but opponents of the deal argue that security concerns are more important. The letter to Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, asked for answers to several detailed questions on issues including Iran Air's leadership, the Treasury's ability to control transfers of aircraft or parts once they are in Iran's hands and the nuclear pact. Foreign banks have been reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining sanctions prohibiting the use of the U.S. financial system for Iranian business. With U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump strongly critical of the rapprochement, some banks fear they could be left with no insurance if Iran sanctions "snap back." Republican members of Congress unanimously opposed the nuclear agreement, seen as one of Democratic President Barack Obama's foreign policy achievements. Arguing that Obama was more concerned with enhancing his legacy than national security, they have pushed legislation and other measures seeking to overturn or undermine the agreement.

November 18, 2016 0340 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:169140 Publish Date: Fri, 23 Sep 2016 18:57:55 GMT Service: Iran US gives Boeing, Airbus go-ahead for sales to Iran The US green light for Boeing and Airbus sales to Iran has broken a taboo and opens the door to a potential boom in foreign financial dealings with Tehran. As well as a long overdue modernization for its aging fleet of passenger planes, Wednesday's announcement of US licenses for Airbus and Boeing serves to reassure other foreign firms and major banks on doing business with the Islamic Republic. "A taboo has been broken. This deal will ease the fears of major foreign banks and companies which want to work with Iran," an official of an Iranian private bank told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It will allow financial channels to be put into place for big foreign banks to work with Iran." An Iranian newspaper, Donya-e Eqtesad, said experts were now predicting that "major Western banks will soon renew ties with Iran's banks'. The approvals from the US Treasury Department allow Airbus and Boeing to proceed with sales worth billions of dollars into a country that had been entirely off-limits prior to Iran's landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. "We have issued the first two licenses for the export of certain commercial passenger aircraft to Iran under this new policy — to Boeing and Airbus," a US Treasury spokesperson said on Wednesday. The approval allows Boeing to fulfill a June memorandum of understanding with Iran Air that covered the sale of 80 planes, consisting of single-aisle 737 and the long-range 777 aircraft. The sales will be the US aircraft-maker's first to Tehran since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution which was followed a year later by a break in diplomatic ties with Washington. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said other licenses would follow 'in coming weeks', in comments following a meeting between Iran and major powers in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. Before the nuclear deal, which went into effect in January, under which Iran modified its atomic program in return for the lifting of international sanctions, an embargo dating from 1995 prevented Western manufacturers from selling equipment and spare parts to Iranian companies. In January, European giant Airbus struck a similar preliminary agreement as its US competitor to sell Iran 118 aircraft, but it also required US approval because some of the planes' components are made in the United States. The announcement of the licenses comes after repeated complaints by Iranian leaders that Washington was dragging its feet on the lifting of sanctions under the nuclear deal and putting up financial obstacles for the non-US companies and banks lining up to do business with Tehran. The Boeing deal is estimated to be worth roughly $25 billion while the Airbus accord was initially valued at $25 billion. Iran's current commercial aviation fleet numbers around 140 planes with an average age of around 20 years, with many in desperate need of replacement. Iran projects a demand for between 400 and 500 commercial airliners over the next decade. Iranian newspaper Donya-e Eqtesad said international banks would play a key role in financing the huge contracts with Boeing and Airbus.     KeyWords US jet IranDaily   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Tremor shakes western Iran Norway’s DNO to study key Iranian oil field Saudi-proposed anti-Syria resolution rewarding terror sponsors: Iran Iran rejects 'baseless' claims by Arab states Iran warns against Israel’s bid to erase al-Quds Islamic identity Senior Iranian official warns US against failing to comply with nuclear deal Germany will try to ensure Iran nuclear deal survives with Trump Iran pours cold water on Hong Kong Rouhani: Government, system seeking constructive interaction with world Leader: Iran unimpressed by US election results Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0822 sec

As one of the first customers for the Airbus A380 Super Jumbo it is a bold decision to cut the iconic airliner from its fleet, but such a move highlights the new commercial vision of Malaysia Airlines and the re-birth of the famous Asian flag carrier on the international stage. For the embattled airline big many no longer be beautiful, at least in aircraft size after it also recently retired the Boeing 777, as it attempts to become a leader across its home region and capture and ride the air traffic boom across Asia. A recent commitment for up to 50 Boeing 737MAX airliners is a clear sign of the airline’s future strategy. These aircraft will arrive from 2019 and will enable the carrier to operate more competitively and efficiently against rivals. The deal comprises a firm order for 25 MAX-8s and options for up to 25 MAX-8s or MAX-9s and will be used not only to replace older equipment on short-haul routes but to grow the airline’s network. Its recently appointed chief executive officer, Peter Bellew, describes the deal as “a game-changer” for Malaysia Airlines providing it with “much lower costs and greater efficiency” to develop its network and return to profitability. “This new aircraft order will set the stage for our continued recovery and success into the next decade,” he says. The additional range of the new generation airliner means that Malaysia Airlines will also be able to utilise the equipment on many longer routes of up to six or seven hours, opening a significant number of new city pair options out of Kuala Lumpur and other parts of Malaysia that are not commercially sustainable for widebodied equipment. Markets such as Australia, India and Pakistan are attractive to Malaysia Airlines, however, like many others across the region, one stands out more than others… China. Bellew, says the carrier has barely scratched the surface in a market that offers so much potential. “Our planes are almost full [to China]. With three, four, five more aircraft, we will be able to make money even next week.” Malaysia Airlines suffered a massive blow to its brand after flight MH370, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew, disappeared in March 2014. In July 2014, another flight, MH17, was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard. The writing had been on the wall for the old Malaysia Airlines long before these atrocities, but they provided the impetus for a bold restructuring by the state-run airline’s sole shareholder, Khazanah Nasional Berhad and a new commercial outlook. In May 2015 an administrator was appointed to facilitate the transfer of selected assets and liabilities from the existing Malaysian Airline System Berhad to a brand new company, Malaysia Airlines Berhad. The original business continued to operate through to August 31, 2015, with the new operator, effectively a start-up, taking to the air for the first time from September 1, 2015. The transition of the business was a key component of the 12-point Malaysia Airlines Recovery Plan, which was announced in August 2014 to restructure the national carrier and set it on a path towards sustainable profitability. Taking the lead role in this transformation was Christoph Mueller, who has built a reputation in the industry in helping oversee the restructuring of troubled airlines, most recently turning around the fortunes of Aer Lingus in the Republic of Ireland. With a vision to run the new company entirely on commercial terms he has worked to develop a modern operation without the legacy costs that had forced the old airline into debt. However, just less than a year into his contract, Mueller resigned as group managing director and chief executive officer in March 2016 and from July 1, 2016 Peter Bellew, previously chief operating officer at the carrier, was appointed to the helm in an accelerated leadership transition, less than a year after first joining the business. Irish national, Peter Bellew, spent ten years learning the airline sector at low-cost carrier Ryanair, where a focus on cost management helped it establish itself as one of the world’s most successful airlines. Initially as deputy director of flight operations, he held positions in sales, marketing, training and recruitment before being appointed director of flight operations before joining Malaysia Airlines.  He took up his role as chief operating officer in Kuala Lumpur in September 2015 and alongside group managing director and chief executive officer, Christoph Mueller, has been a key figure in the transformation of the airline. He replaced Mueller as chief executive officer from July 1, 2016 and is responsible for continuity in the execution of the Malaysia Airlines’ turnaround plan and further progress of the overall restructuring effort, as set out by state-controlled shareholder Khazanah Nasional Berhad in its 12-point MAS Recovery Plan. Despite the transition at the top, the turnaround of the airline remains on-track, says Bellew, who is confident the airline will be profitable by 2018 and could be listed on Bursa Malaysia as early as spring 2019. A man that understands the importance of managing costs from his Ryanair days says these are now “under control” and the focus is now “to boost revenues”. The net profit recorded by the carrier in the first quarter of this year would seem to confirm this. Prior to exceptional items, the first quarter was marginally profitable for the airline at the operating level, driven by favourable fuel prices and market conditions, coupled with operational improvements and a particularly strong performance in February. The performance gives a strong indication that the turnaround initiatives are delivering positive results. While its new short-haul fleet will play a key role in this strategy, and a new agreement with Emirates Airline and increasing partnerships with oneworld alliance partners will maximise connectivity, widebodied equipment will remain part of the Malaysia Airlines fleet. After the last of its 777s left in January 2016, it is left with a fleet of 13 A330-300s and six A380s. The Super Jumbos are earmarked for retirement from 2018 when all six of its new A350-900s are due to have been delivered on leases from Air Lease Corporation (the first aircraft is due in 2017). The A350s will directly replace the A380 on its only remaining scheduled route – Kuala Lumpur – London Heathrow – as well as to serve some stronger medium-haul markets in Asia and into Australasia. As part of its restructuring, the airline has suspended non-stop services to Amsterdam, Paris and Dubai, and is using its new codeshare partnership with Dubai-based Emirates Airline to connect its passengers to destinations in Europe, Africa and the United States. Other destination closures over the past couple of years have included Brisbane, Australia; Kunming, China; Frankfurt, Germany; Cochin, India; Male, Maldives; Krabi, Thailand; and Istanbul, Turkey. After a period of significant change, Malaysia Airlines is set a period of stability to enable it to focus on its service offer and enhancing the customer experience. A new Business Class offering is being installed on its A330 fleet while a Premium Economy offering is also being rolled-out on the type and from the end of the year also on the A380. A more flexible pricing policy will also help boost loads while better matching capacity to demand will help to keep robust yields. This focus will help support a return to network growth and Bellew confirms that “new routes from various Malaysian airports to new unserved Asean destinations” are under discussion. “The goal will be to fly customers safely to places they want to go with great value fares and superior service on clean modern aircraft. We will stop doing things that lose money,” he adds. While most of the hard work may now seem to have been done, the Irishman warns the airline can’t be complacent in what is a competitive environment. "Long term booking prospects vary. While demands still run strong in northern Asia, performance is relatively weak in Southeast Asia and Australia due to oversupply," he says. But, he remains confident. “We will fix it. I am sure it will be a road with many interesting turns,” he says. “Our first quarter showed performance indicators on track with yield up 23.4%, costs down by 32.9% and our bottom line ahead of budget.” This article is modified from an original feature that appeared in...

Republican Representatives Pete Roskam and Jeb Hensarling wrote to Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which oversees sanctions, demanding more answers about any security implications of the delivery of aircraft to Iran. "There is little evidence indicating that Iran Air has indeed stopped transporting weapons, troops, and cash to terrorist groups and rogue regimes," the congressmen wrote in a letter, dated Thursday, seen by Reuters. Both congressmen hold influential financial positions in the House. Hensarling is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Roskam is chairman of the tax-writing Ways & Means Committee's Oversight subcommittee. Airbus and Boeing said on Wednesday they had received U.S. Treasury approval to begin exporting over 200 jets to Iran, under a deal struck in January. The news is likely to ease complaints from Iran over implementation of last year's international nuclear agreement, in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Some members of Congress have raised concerns that killing the deal could cost jobs at Boeing plants, but opponents of the deal argue that security concerns are more important. The letter to Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, asked for answers to several detailed questions on issues including Iran Air's leadership, the Treasury's ability to control transfers of aircraft or parts once they are in Iran's hands and the nuclear pact. Foreign banks have been reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining sanctions prohibiting the use of the U.S. financial system for Iranian business. With U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump strongly critical of the rapprochement, some banks fear they could be left with no insurance if Iran sanctions "snap back." Republican members of Congress unanimously opposed the nuclear agreement, seen as one of Democratic President Barack Obama's foreign policy achievements. Arguing that Obama was more concerned with enhancing his legacy than national security, they have pushed legislation and other measures seeking to overturn or undermine the agreement.

By Adam Behsudi 09/23/16 10:00 AM EDT With help from Doug Palmer and Megan Cassella AMERICANS SAY: TPP WHO? There could be a sliver of hope for the languishing TPP deal after all, despite the beating it’s taking from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in their race for the White House, a first-ever poll conducted for POLITICO and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health suggests. Story Continued Below That’s because nearly a year after the White House finished negotiating the landmark trade pact, most Americans still don’t know about the agreement, considered the economic linchpin of President Barack Obama’s rebalance toward Asia. Seventy percent of those polled said they hadn’t heard or read anything about the TPP, and among the 29 percent who had, views of the agreement were mainly negative: 63 percent of those respondents were against it, and 68 percent opposed a vote on its ratification in the lame-duck session of Congress. The percentages show that efforts of labor and environmental groups to stir up opposition to the agreement have had limited impact, providing the White House with an opening to make both its economic and national security case for the agreement to the rest of the public. Pro Trade’s Doug Palmer has the story here. Read the full poll results here. IT’S FRIDAY, SEPT. 23! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host would like to point out Hillary Clinton’s latest declaration that she is “not down with TPP.” Clinton’s “Between Two Ferns” appearance is in contrast to President Barack Obama’s slow jam TPP endorsement of “yeah, you know me.” Got any other cool ways to explain your position on TPP? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi. TRUMP’S RISE TURNING GOP AGAINST TRADE: The poll also found that a large majority of Republican voters are repudiating their party’s traditional support for free trade, and falling sharply in line with nominee Donald Trump’s insistence that trade costs Americans more jobs than it creates. Meanwhile, Democrats, whose representatives in Congress have traditionally been far more skeptical of trade deals — and largely voted against giving President Barack Obama the “fast-track” authority to negotiate the TPP last year — are now far more apt than Republicans to see the benefit of trade, according to poll. Forty-seven percent of Republicans surveyed said that trade deals have hurt their communities over the last ten years, compared to only 24 percent of Democratic voters. Only 18 percent of Republicans surveyed said that trade deals helped, while 33 percent of Democrats believe free trade helps. POLITICO Pro Europe Brief’s Ben Oreskes has the story here. More from the POLITICO-Harvard poll: Despite the United States’ long and deep relationship with the United Kingdom, more Americans oppose boosting trade with the country to help it with its “Brexit” from the European Union than support the idea. Read the story here. BOEING: U.S. WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT IN AIRBUS CASE: The U.S. says it’s ready to negotiate a deal with the European Union to end trade distorting subsidies in each side’s respective aircraft industries. But after the U.S. declared a “sweeping victory” Thursday against the EU when Brussels and four member state governments were faulted for not removing illegal subsidy programs for Airbus, Boeing says it has no problem with Washington pursuing retaliation. “We’re confident that the United States will pursue those remedies necessary to help Europe and help Airbus move away from the practices that have been put in place over these many, many years,” Ted Austell, Boeing’s vice president for international policy, said in a press call. The WTO issued a ruling that found the EU, along with France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, failed to comply with a 2011 Appellate Body decision that faulted European governments for providing $22 billion worth of illegally subsidized financing to cover costs for the development of a number of Airbus aircraft. The U.S. notified the WTO in 2011 that the harm caused by the illegal subsidies translated to between $7 billion and $10 billion in retaliation. But the road to retaliation could be a long one. With the EU having a chance to appeal Thursday’s ruling, it could be six to nine months before the U.S. would be in a position to put in place countermeasures. Also still pending is a decision examining whether the U.S. has complied with a ruling that faulted federal and state-level aid for Boeing. The EU has also filed another case alleging Washington state provide billions worth of trade-distorting subsidies to the U.S. aerospace giant. Decisions in those cases could color any negotiations between the two sides and how far the U.S. is willing to go in the retaliation process. In any scenario, Boeing officials said they want an outcome that ends EU “launch aid” — or loans to fund jet development — and other support programs once and for all. CHINA SQUASHES THE BEEF WITH THE U.S.: China has lifted restrictions that have kept U.S. beef out of that major market since 2003 over fears of mad cow disease, but exporters aren’t jumping for joy just yet. The statement from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture clarifies the new policy would only apply to U.S. beef from animals under 30 months of age but is short on other details. “We look forward to prompt engagement by the relevant authorities for further technical discussions on the specific conditions that will allow trade to resume,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement Thursday. “True access to China's beef market — consistent with science-based, international standards for trade — remains a top priority for the United States.” China imported just $10 million worth of beef per year from the U.S. just prior to the ban, but meat consumption has grown exponentially since and the beef import market is now reported to be worth as much as $150 million a month. Chinese beef imports reached a record $2.3 billion in 2015, USDA said. The department estimates China will surpass Japan as the second-largest beef importer (after the U.S.) at 825,000 tons in 2016. Canadian beef producers also got good news from China this week when Beijing announced it would further lift similar restrictions that have been in place since 2003. China has allowed boneless cuts of Canadian beef since 2010 but this week said it would also let in bone-in beef from cows under 30 months. CORN GROWERS: FARMS AT RISK WITHOUT TPP: Corn growers blanketed Capitol Hill this week with more than 6,000 letters urging lawmakers to support passage of the TPP. The effort organized by the National Corn Growers Association is among a number of other initiatives taken by agriculture groups in recent weeks to promote the benefits of the trade pact among congressional members. “At a time when the farm economy is struggling, exports represent a rare bright spot for American agriculture,” NCGA President Chip Bowling said. “America’s farmers and ranchers stand ready to share our bounty and meet the challenge of feeding and fueling a growing world. But we can’t do that without trade agreements like TPP.” In one letter, corn growers highlight the declining price of corn — 34 percent since 2010 — and the fact that farm incomes are at their lowest since 2002. TPP, they said, would boost corn as a result of increasing exports of beef and pork, which are reliant on the crop for feed. END OF THE ROAD FOR EX-IM RESCUE EFFORTS: Senate Republicans put forth a short-term funding bill on Thursday that doesn’t include a provision to restore the Export-Import Bank to full functionality, prompting Sen. Lindsey Graham to vow he won’t support it. “I will not vote for a continuing resolution which does not contain a fix for the Export-Import Bank," Graham, one of the bank's strongest supporters, said in a statement after the text was released. "We are losing American jobs to foreign competitors for no good reason." Two of the bank’s biggest beneficiaries, Boeing and General Electric, both are major employers in Graham’s home state of South Carolina. Graham had spearheaded the effort to introduce a provision into previous appropriations legislation that allow the entire membership of the bank's board of directors, if less than full capacity, to constitute a quorum. With only two of five board seats filled, the bank currently lacks the quorum needed to approve deals worth more than $10 million. But some of Ex-Im’s detractors were encouraged by the development. The Koch-backed group Freedom Partners, which previously sent a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan urging Congress to reject all efforts to overhaul the bank’s quorum rules, celebrated the move but continued to urge Republican congressional leaders to oppose Ex-Im rescue efforts not just now but also in the lame duck. “Freedom Partners is encouraged that lawmakers haven’t caved to the back-door efforts that would unleash billion in corporate welfare,” senior policy adviser Andy Koenig said in a statement. THE FLAKE PHILOSOPHY ON A LAME-DUCK TPP VOTE: Congress’ lame-duck session is usually a time for doing “things that you know you need to do but you just can’t bring yourself to do in regular time,” Sen. Jeff Flake said on Thursday — and those things, he added, should include the TPP. Flake, an ardent free-trade supporter who voted in favor of fast-track legislation last year, said that passing the trade pact would take top priority during the lame duck if it were up to him, but he added that many of his colleagues may have other priorities. "Just dealing with funding the government is going to be top priority for most of my colleagues,” the Arizona Republican said at the event. He added he's hopeful lawmakers will be able to find a way during lame duck to "tweak here or there to say, 'Oh, now I can support this.'" "We cannot grow economically if we shut ourselves off ... and I think if you step back, most of my colleagues understand that, even the ones who are going against," Flake said. "Be that as it may, statements have been made, and there's going to have to be some way for people to get back on board." Congress' approval of trade promotion authority last year indicates that TPP still has a chance, he added. That vote "is what gives me hope that in the end, as we get past this political silly season, then we get back to doing what we should do," he said. FARM BILL 2018: THE CONSERVATIVE VIEW: The Heritage Foundation previewed its asks for a 2018 farm bill, calling on Congress to change its approach to crop insurance, food stamps, renewable fuels and trade. The conservative think tank released a 148-page report on Thursday that offers a window into how it may attack negotiations over the 2018 farm bill. The document goes beyond previous calls to split the legislation in two — to create a separate bill for food stamp assistance — to suggest a wholesale rewrite, which it says is "a valuable starting point to change the status quo." It calls for the elimination of the Renewable Fuel Standard as well as trade-stifling tariffs and tariff rate quotas. It criticizes Congress for inviting World Trade Organization disputes by subsidizing cotton producers and acting too slowly to stop country-of-origin labeling for meat.

Follow @routesonline 5,901 followers Aviation is booming in Asia, but the region’s airlines still have a fair share of challenges to face. The Asia-Pacific region is already the number one aviation market in the world and its dominance is only going to grow in the next couple of decades – driven mainly by the huge expansion in air travel within China. Asia currently accounts for about 31.5% of all global passenger traffic, ahead of Europe (26.7%) and North America (24.7%), according to the latest figures from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). In the first six months of the year, traffic in Asia grew by 8.4% - well ahead of the global average of 6%. The Chinese domestic passenger market is now the third biggest in the world, behind internal US traffic and the intra- European market. During the first half of 2016, Chinese domestic travel jumped up by 9.8% compared to the same period last year, due to higher consumer spending and increased routes within China. This trend is only set to continue, with Boeing predicting that Asia will account for around 49% of global passenger traffic by 2035. The region’s traffic is set to rise by 6% per year over this period, equating to 100 million new passengers every year. To cope with demand, Boeing is forecasting that the number of aircraft in service across Asia will have to nearly triple from the 6,350 flying last year to 16,970 by 2035. Fast-growing low-cost carriers (LCCs) will buy an estimated 11,000 single-aisle aircraft in the next 20 years, while there will also be demand for around 3,700 new wide-body long-haul aircraft. Aviation consultant John Strickland, of JLS Consulting, said: “There is a massive number of aircraft on order which are going to come through in the next few years – largely led by LCCs. The legacy airlines are wrestling with this growing competition and amount of capacity.” While this projected increase is being primarily driven by China’s economic growth, there is plenty going on in other parts of the region, including south-east Asia, which should benefit from a new “open skies” agreement. Patrick Folley, a director at aviation consultancy Consilium, added: “Airlines would not be in a position to take on these significant numbers of aircraft if they didn’t have the routes to fly them on, and increased market liberalisation across the Asia-Pacific region has opened up considerable new opportunities.” Despite the rise in regional passenger traffic, airlines in south-east Asia continue to experience low profit levels – with an average operating profit margin of just 0.3%, according to IATA. This is the worst financial performance in the world, apart from the loss-making African aviation industry. Airlines’ bottom lines have been continually squeezed by intense competition within the region from LCCs, such as AirAsia and Lion Air, which is only going to intensify with both these carriers having more than 400 aircraft on order. The long-haul market has also been affected by the aggressive expansion into Asia of the major Gulf carriers: Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. Even the drop in oil prices has not proved to be such an advantage for airlines as it has been accompanied by a rise in the value of the US dollar, which the carriers have to use to pay for their fuel. South-east Asia’s fastest-growing market is Indonesia, which has been adding airline capacity at an average annual rate of around 15% for the last 10 years. The strong growth has come as the country has overcome a fearful reputation for aircraft safety – change led by the LCC Lion Air and the once-derided flag-carrier Garuda. However, growth has slowed so far in 2016 – passenger numbers only rose by 2.3% in the first half of the year. Garuda has added new domestic routes from its Jakarta hub to Sumatra and Borneo this year, as well as relaunching its Singapore to Medan route and adding a Jakarta-Medina, Saudi Arabia, service. But its most significant international move has been switching its UK flights from Gatwick to Heathrow, which has allowed it to offer the first non-stop direct flight from London to Jakarta. “Our long-term strategy from 2016– 2020 focuses on network expansion by 2018, optimising Garuda’s business in Asia Pacific by serving new potential destinations,” said Benny Butarbutar, Garuda’s VP of corporate communications. “Since Indonesian authorities have been upgraded to a Category 1 safety rating with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Garuda Indonesia plans to re-explore the feasibility of starting flights to the US in 2017.” If Indonesian airlines are set to benefit from the country’s upgraded safety rating, it is a different story for Thailand’s aviation industry. Both the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the FAA in the US last year downgraded its safety rating for Thai-based carriers from Category 1 to Category 2, for failing to comply with international standards. This has held back the international growth of new airline NokScoot, a low-cost joint venture between Thailand’s Nok Air and Singapore Airlines’ Scoot that started flying last year. Thai Airways also wants to reintroduce flights to the US from Bangkok next year after axing them in 2015. But this move depends on the ICAO and FAA upgrading their safety rating for Thailand. In neighbouring Malaysia, the headlines have been dominated by the woes of flag-carrier Malaysia Airlines following the loss of two aircraft (MH370 and MH17) in 2014. It also underwent a major financial restructuring last year. The airline has been concentrating on a regional strategy to rebuild its business with a focus on China. Malaysia ordered 50 Boeing 737-MAX aircraft in July, and will also start receiving six Airbus A350s from 2017, which are set to replace the A380 superjumbo on its route to London. Malaysia has also been cutting capacity – a move that low-cost rival AirAsia has capitalised on, with strong growth in Malaysian traffic helping AirAsia to record a 12% rise in passenger numbers to 13.9 million during the second quarter of 2016. AirAsia, which also operates in Thailand, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, could resume long-haul flights to Europe after a four-year gap. The carrier had advertised on its website a daily service from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona, via Istanbul, from October 30. But consultant Strickland is not convinced: “I will be very surprised if AirAsia comes back into Europe now as they don’t currently have a particularly suitable fleet for these ultra-long-haul sectors.” While the low-cost revolution has been in full swing in south-east Asia, this has not been so true in the north-eastern part of the continent, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where LCC penetration is only around 11% of capacity compared with 56% in south-east Asia. Although some LCCs, such as Korea’s Jin Air and Jeju Air, have much larger proportions of some key markets (such as Korean domestic and Japan-Korea traffic). Chris Crampton, UK chairman of PATA, said: “It’s open skies that would make the biggest difference. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries have it, and you’ve seen the proliferation of LCCs across the region – you don’t have it elsewhere on the continent. There’s quite a contrast between that part of Asia and elsewhere.” Some airlines, most notably Japan’s All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, have been able to steal a march on competitors by becoming early users of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This has allowed them to develop more long-haul routes and increase frequencies, despite initial technical problems with the aircraft that led to the grounding of the entire worldwide fleet for three months in 2013. Talking of Dreamliners, Korean Air is due to add the 787-9 to its fleet in 2017. It is also launching flights from Seoul to Delhi in December, as well as adding a route to Okinawa, its 16th destination in Japan. Meanwhile, Korean is considering a new route to Iran – it has already been granted permission to operate four weekly flights between its Incheon hub and Tehran. But weak demand has led to the suspension of its service to Sao Paulo in Brazil following the Olympics. Elsewhere Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific has rebranded its sister regional airline Dragonair as Cathay Dragon, and added new routes to Madrid and from London’s Gatwick Airport, which is being served by its new Airbus A350 fleet. “The A350 fleet makes it feasible for Cathay Pacific to launch and operate direct flights to second-tiered destinations in Europe, further expanding our global network connectivity,” said Paul Cruttenden, marketing and digital sales manager for Cathay Pacific. Taiwan’s EVA Air is also expanding its long-haul network by adding Istanbul and Chicago as destinations from Taipei, while frequencies have been increased to Brisbane and Paris. With all this growth, airports are struggling to keep up with demand. Consilium’s Folley added: “Airport capacity and regulation are the two biggest barriers to growth. With the strong growth in traffic in the region, airport infrastructure has struggled to keep pace. “Growth across the region is such that all areas are in need of more capacity if they are to meet growth forecasts, although some - such as Japan - are more mature than others. China and ASEAN are the areas with the strongest growth prospects and the greatest need for more capacity,” he adds. Creaking airport infrastructure is one of the main reasons why the region’s airlines have been ordering larger aircraft to help to continue growing traffic into some of the most congested Asian hub airports.

Every day closer to a new way to orbit by Staff Writers Washington DC (SPX) Sep 22, 2016 Flowers grown in space to research growing food in orbit for crews of deep-space missions. Image courtesy NASA. For a larger version of this image please go here. Two years after selecting the next generation of American spacecraft and rockets that will launch astronauts to the International Space Station, engineers and spaceflight specialists across NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Boeing and SpaceX are putting in place the elements required for successful missions. Here are eight things to know about Commercial Crew: 1. The Goal - The goal of NASA's Commercial Crew Program is to return human spaceflight launches to U.S. soil, providing reliable and cost-effective access to low-Earth orbit on systems that meet our safety requirements. To accomplish this goal, we are taking a unique approach by asking private companies, Boeing and SpaceX, to develop human spaceflight systems to take over the task of flying astronauts to station. 2. Multi-User Spaceport - Boeing and SpaceX, like other commercial aerospace companies, are capitalizing on the unique experience and infrastructure along the Space Coast at our Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Kennedy has transitioned from a government-only launch complex to a premier multi-user spaceport. In the coming years, the number of launch providers along the Space Coast is expected to more than double. 3. Innovation - Our expertise has been joined with industry innovations to produce the most advanced spacecraft to ever carry humans into orbit. Each company is developing its own unique systems to meet our safety requirements, and once certified by us, the providers will begin taking astronauts to the space station. 4. Research - With two new spacecraft that can carry up to four astronauts to the International Space Station with each of our missions, the number of resident crew will increase and will double the amount of time dedicated to research. That means new technologies and advances to improve life here on Earth and a better understanding of what it will take for long duration, deep space missions, including to Mars. 5. Crew Training - Astronauts Bob Behnken, Eric Boe, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams have been selected to train to fly flight tests aboard the Boeing CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon. The veteran crew have sent time in both spacecraft evaluating and training on their systems. Both providers are responsible for developing every aspect of the mission, from the spacesuits and training, to the rocket and spacecraft. 6. Launch Abort System - Boeing and SpaceX will equip their spacecraft with launch abort systems to get astronauts out of danger ... FAST! 7. Expedited Delivery - Time-sensitive, critical experiments performed in orbit will be returned to Earth aboard commercial crew spacecraft, and returned to the scientists on Earth in hours, instead of days - before vital results are lost. That means better life and physical science research results, like VEGGIE, heart cells, and protein crystals. 8. Lifeboat - The spacecraft will offer safe and versatile lifeboats for the crew of the space station, whether an emergency on-orbit causes the crew to shelter for a brief time in safety, or leave the orbiting laboratory altogether.

American aircraft manufacturer Boeing has said it could pave the way for the US to seek up to $10bn (~€9bn) in annual retaliatory tariffs. It follows years of accusations between the two aerospace companies that each received state funding. The WTO is yet to rule on a similar EU complaint that Boeing benefits from billions of dollars in tax breaks from US authorities. Washington responded to the ruling by calling for an immediate halt for EU subsidies to support US jobs. Meanwhile Airbus said it would appeal the judgement and the EU said it found some of the outcomes “unsatisfactory”. Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing chairman, said: “Today’s ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules. “This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for US aerospace workers, in particular.” US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the panel’s conclusions were “a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers”. He called on the EU, Germany, France, the UK and Spain “to respect WTO rules”. In response, the EU said: “There are certain findings of the panel that we consider to be unsatisfactory. We are closely analysing the report.” Airbus said: “We only needed to make limited changes in European policies and practices to comply.We will address the few still remaining points indicated by the report in our appeal.” Both the EU and the United States have the right to appeal against the ruling.

Restaurants Home Nation / World With Iran Boeing deal, Americans also coming print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google With Iran Boeing deal, Americans also coming By Thomas Erdbrink / New York Times News Service Published Sep 23, 2016 at 12:02AM TEHRAN, Iran — Long before the first newly purchased Boeing airliner lands at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport, Iran and the United States will have had to come to terms with a new reality: U.S. citizens will once again be taking up residence in Tehran, the first to do so since the Islamic Revolution and subsequent hostage crisis in 1979 and 1980. When the United States on Wednesday gave the green light for the direct sale of Western planes to Iran, much more than nearly four decades of sanctions on such deals came to an end. Not that the deals approved by the Treasury Department are insignificant: 80 Boeing jets and an initial batch of 17 Airbus planes out of a potential total of 118. But the sale will have the important effect of ending an era of absolute isolation between the countries. Boeing will almost certainly have to open an administrative office in Tehran, and technicians will have to move here to train their Iranian counterparts in the care and maintenance of the planes. Among them, almost certainly, will be many Americans. That seems to be exactly what the U.S. had in mind in approving the deal, Iranian analysts say. The deal not only allows President Hassan Rouhani to show a tangible gain from warming relations with the West, but also moves Iran that much closer to his ultimate goal of normalization of relations with the United States. “Once this deal is a fact it will be much harder for the hard-liners to try to prevent relations with the United States,” said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political activist who supports Rouhani. “Nobody can deny that with the planes, people and know-how will enter Iran.” Buying planes from the United States, opening a Boeing office or having U.S. representatives at an international airport might seem insignificant. But it would represent a tectonic shift in relations. In 1980, when ties between the countries were severed, all 140,000 Americans living in Iran were forced to leave. The U.S. Embassy was turned into an ideological museum and all American businesses left over the years, as sanctions made commerce increasingly difficult, and more recently, impossible. The bureaus of The New York Times, Bloomberg and some other news media organizations were long the only official American entities allowed to operate in Iran, either by the Iranian authorities or under U.S. sanctions. When Conoco won an oil contract in Iran in 1995, it secretly opened an office in Tehran, only to close it when Congress adopted tougher sanctions. Many Iranians hope the January nuclear agreement, which led to the lifting of some sanctions, changed all of that, citing the jetliner deal as the start of a new era. “We are getting to a point where the gap between economic relations and political normalization is gradually getting smaller,” said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the government. Hatred of the United States was the ideological bedrock of the Islamic republic, however, and there are strong forces dedicated to keeping it that way. Police officers some months ago closed down a knockoff KFC restaurant after hard-liners protested, saying the chicken wings were a symbol of Westernization. When someone tried to open a McDonald’s franchise here 20 years ago, it took just two days for the restaurant to be burned down. And there are still many sources of tension, particularly the harassment of U.S. Navy vessels by Iranian naval speedboats and the imprisonment of several Iranian-Americans with dual nationalities. Those episodes and others like them are not likely to disappear soon, as they serve the interests of hard-liners who want to discourage any sort of rapprochement. “No, we should not have relations,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a conservative political analyst. “We hard-liners also want safe planes. But we need to keep our independence and distance from the United States. That is one of the pillars of our ideology.” 15132226 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

[Airbus.com] The A-380 is the world's largest airliner. [Airbus.com] Languages: Deutsch Print Comments8 The US and Boeing declared victory after the Word Trade Organisation concluded yesterday (22 September) that subsidies for aircraft maker Airbus were illegal. However, the US said it was “ready to negotiate” before slapping on retaliatory duties. The international trade body concluded on Thursday (22 September) that the EU and its member states failed to withdraw subsidies for Airbus and “take appropriate steps to remove the adverse effects”. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the WTO found that Airbus had won aircraft sales deals over Boeing in Europe, China, India and other countries helped by $22 billion in illegal subsidies from the EU. “This report is a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers,” Froman commented. An earlier judgement in 2011 partially overturned accusations that EU states had given Airbus illegal subsidies to develop the world’s largest jetliner, the A380, but said the aircraft maker did receive billions of dollars of unfair aid that harmed Boeing. All sides claim victory in WTO Airbus ruling Trade judges on Wednesday (18 May) partially overturned a ruling that had accused EU states of giving Airbus illegal subsidies, but said the aircraft maker did receive billions of dollars of unfair aid that harmed Boeing. EurActiv.com US ‘ready to negotiate’ Boeing claimed that the EU and its member states put in place new subsidies to Airbus for a grand total of almost $22 billion. That includes $15 billion in launch aid for each Airbus commercial aircraft program from the A300 through the A380, and $2 billion in non-launch aid subsidies. According to the US company, Washington could obtain the WTO’s permission to impose retaliatory duties of up to $10 billion. US officials did not say whether they were preparing to request WTO approval for retaliatory duties yet, as Airbus can appeal the ruling, according to AFP. “We are ready to negotiate if (the EU) is interested,” a US trade official said. Serious blow The conclusions of the WTO´s compliance panel report represented a serious blow for the EU. A European Commission spokesperson commented that “certain findings” of the report are “unsatisfactory”. Still, EU officials welcomed  that the panel rejected new US claims that repayable support for the airbus models A350 XWB and A380 are “prohibited subsidies”. The Commission spokesperson recalled that there are two additional WTO rulings expected in the coming months as regards the American subsidies for Boeing. Boeing Executive Vice President and General Counsel J. Michael Luttig stressed that these cases “are separate and distinct”. “The EU lost this compliance case for the simple reason that it did nothing to remedy its massive subsidies which have had profound effects on the commercial airplane market,” Luttig said. “Whatever happens in the European cases against the United States, launch aid and other illegal government support for Airbus will now come to an end.” Airbus plays down ruling Meanwhile, Airbus played down the consequences of the ruling. An Airbus spokeswoman said the company had already implemented some “limited changes” needed to align with WTO rules. “We will possibly address the few still remaining points indicated by the report in an appeal,” the spokeswoman said. “As a point of fact Airbus and its European partners met their obligations to withdraw any subsidy elements or eliminate adverse effects,” she said. “What a contrast to Boeing which has laid the biggest egg in subsidy history with what is expected to be the very first finding in any of our cases of a prohibited subsidy for 777,” the spokeswoman added. Background The EU and the US have been locked in a dispute over state aid to large commercial aircraft builders Airbus and Boeing since Washington and Brussels filed complaints against one another in 2004. According to international trade rules, government support for manufacturing is illegal if it can be proven to harm the companies or industries of another World Trade Organisation (WTO) member state.

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration said Thursday it has won an important victory in an international trade dispute with the European Union over subsidies to airplane manufacturer Airbus. In June 2011, the World Trade Organization found that the EU and four of its member countries provided billions of dollars in subsidized financing to Airbus. While the EU subsequently claimed to have come into compliance, the United States disagreed and requested that a compliance panel intervene. The WTO panel ruled on Thursday that the United States was broadly correct. The international body, which helps solve trade disputes, found the EU had provided billions of dollars more in subsidies, causing lost sales worth tens of billions of dollars for Boeing Co. Boeing praised the ruling, saying the “day of reckoning” has finally arrived and went so far to say that Airbus might not even exist today if not for continued support of European governments. “Today's historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. “This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for U.S. aerospace workers, in particular.” Boeing added that this decision is independent of the European cases against the United States. United States Trade Representative Michael Froman said the panel's finding is “a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers.” He called on the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain “to respect WTO rules.” “We call on them to end subsidized financing of Airbus immediately,” Froman said. The Boeing Company is the only American producer of large civil aircraft and is the largest single U.S. exporter. Boeing has major facilities across the country, including in Washington and South Carolina. Members of the Washington congressional delegation joined the administration in hailing the ruling, which has the potential to result in tariffs that would likely cost Airbus market share. During what has been a long-running dispute over subsidies for the aerospace industry, the WTO has also issued rulings over the years determining that Boeing was the recipient of banned federal and state support. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., called on the EU to come to the negotiating table and settle, rather than wait for future tariffs on Airbus planes. “Without having to compete against illegal, market-distorting practices, Boeing should win more sales around the world,” Cantwell said.

The WTO ruled so-called "launch aid" loans given to Airbus by EU members to develop its fleet had caused a "genuine and substantial" loss of sales for its competitor Boeing. It also criticised the EU for failing to rein in billions of dollars in illegal subsidies, despite being instructed to do so. Four EU member states - France, Germany, Spain and Britain - had not complied with WTO calls to phase out subsidies, the intergovernmental trade body said. The dramatic ruling has set the stage for the US to seek up to $10bn (pounds 7.6bn) in annual trade tariffs on EU imports, according to Boeing. It's the latest step in a more than decade-old trade spat between rivals Airbus and Boeing, pitting the EU against the US. The Obama administration hailed the decision an "important victory". US trade representative Michael Froman called on the EU, Germany, France, the UK and Spain "to respect WTO rules". "We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves. We will not tolerate our trading partners ignoring the rules at the expense of American workers and their families," he said. In a blow to Europe's argument that the most recent Airbus jet, the A350, fell outside the case, the WTO said funding for the jet had been subsidised, but rejected US claims that it fell into the most serious category of "prohibited" aid. Boeing executive vice president and general counsel J Michael Luttig said that "the day of reckoning for launch aid has finally arrived". "The World Trade Organisation has now found that Airbus is and always has been a creature of government and of illegal government subsidy," he said. The case is the biggest to go before the WTO. It began in 2006, when the US government brought a claim to the WTO against the EU, alleging unfair state support for Airbus. Since then, both sides have won and lost complaints filed against one another. Boeing's chairman and chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said: "Today's historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules. This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for US aerospace workers, in particular."

In June 2011, the World Trade Organization found that the EU and four of its member countries provided billions of dollars in subsidized financing to Airbus. While the EU subsequently claimed to have come into compliance, the U.S.disagreed and requested that a compliance panel intervene. The WTO panel Thursday ruled mostly in favor of the U.S. The international body, which helps solve trade disputes, found the EU had provided billions of dollars more in subsidies, causing lost sales worth tens of billions of dollars for Airbus’ archrival Boeing Co. The WTO, however, found that EU financing was acceptable for some Airbus models – notably the A380, the massive double-decker plane meant for long hauls. Boeing praised the overall ruling, which the EU can appeal, saying the “day of reckoning” has arrived. It went so far to say that Airbus might not even exist today if not for continued support of European governments. “Today’s historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. “This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for U.S. aerospace workers, in particular.” United States Trade Representative Michael Froman says the finding is “a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers.” He called on the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain to “end subsidized financing of Airbus immediately.” This decision is independent of the EU’s case against the United States, in which the WTO is considering whether Boeing received banned federal and state support in the U.S. “Watch this space,” Airbus said in a statement in reaction to the ruling. “Before year-end the record subsidies for the 777X will almost certainly be condemned as illegal,” it said, referring to a new Boeing airliner. The Boeing Company is the only American producer of large civil aircraft and is the largest single U.S. exporter. Boeing has major facilities around the country, including in Washington and South Carolina.

The announcements Wednesday came as Iranian and US leaders are in New York for the United Nations General Assembly and show that the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama is honoring the economic terms of the nuclear pact. The next administration, however, may change that equation for Airbus and Boeing, whose possible deal with Iran would be the biggest for an American company since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and US Embassy takeover. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control early Wednesday. Boeing followed with its own announcement later in the day. Though based abroad, Airbus needed the approval of the US Treasury for the deal because at least 10 percent of the manufacturer’s components are of American origin. Airbus applied for two licenses to cover its deal with Iran to ensure the fast delivery of some of the aircraft, Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told The Associated Press. The license announced Wednesday covers the first 17 planes involved in the deal, which will be A320s and A330s, he said. Dubon said Airbus hoped to receive a second license allowing it to sell the remaining planes to Iran soon. Illustrative photo of an Airbus A330 aircraft. (Wikimedia/Public domain) In January, national carrier Iran Air signed agreements to buy 118 planes from Airbus, estimated to be worth some 22.8 billion euros ($25 billion). On Sunday, state TV reported that Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, a deputy transportation minister, said Iran would cut the number of Airbus planes to 112. Base model A320s are listed at an average of $98 million, while A330s start at $231.5 million. That puts the value of the approved 17 aircraft in the first license around at least $1.8 billion and possibly much higher based on list prices, though buyers typically negotiate sizable discounts for bulk orders. Under Boeing’s deal, Iran Air will buy 80 aircraft with a total list price of $17.6 billion, with deliveries beginning in 2017 and running until 2025. Iran Air also will lease 29 new Boeing 737s in a deal that Iranian officials have suggested would be worth some $25 billion in total. In a statement, Boeing spokesman Marc Sklar said, “We have received that license and remain in talks with Iran Air” based on the memorandum of agreement reached in June. The US Treasury confirmed in a statement that the agency had granted the first licenses to Airbus and Boeing.

(AP/Hasan Sarbakhshian, File) “These licenses contain strict conditions to ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred to a designated entity,” the Treasury said in the statement. Iran’s English language Press TV reported Thursday that Deputy Transport Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan said Iran expects the purchase of planes from Boeing to proceed faster than they will with France’s Airbus. “This is because the structure of negotiations with Boeing is different from that of Airbus,” he said. Fakhrieh Kashan said Boeing has sent the text of its contract to Iran to be studied by the Iranian authorities. He said that Boeing officials were due to travel to Tehran next week to work toward finalizing the contract. Iran’s UN mission did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers, which limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of some international sanctions, specifically allowed for the purchase of aircraft and parts. The license approval clears the way for the two plane manufacturers to begin accessing one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world, home to 80 million people. However, Western analysts are skeptical that there is demand for so many jets or available financing for two separate $25 billion deals. Most Iranian planes were purchased before the Islamic Revolution that ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and brought Islamists to power. Out of Iran’s 250 commercial planes, 162 were flying in June, while the rest were grounded due to lack of spare parts. Iran Air, whose website lists 43 airplanes in its fleet, says it has direct flights to over 30 international destinations, including London. The aircraft deal also has become a political issue in an election year in the US. Some American lawmakers have criticized the Boeing deal to Iran over the Islamic Republic’s “pernicious behavior,” including launching ballistic missiles, firing rockets near US warships in the strategic Strait of Hormuz and briefly detaining American sailors who strayed into its territorial waters. The US presidential election could also have an effect on the sales. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to tear up the nuclear deal if elected this November.

Reuters/Yuya Shino It is not only a direct London-Perth route which new Qantas Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets would possibly fly but also two other Australia-European routes. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce points to the Sydney-Paris and Melbourne-Rome routes as the possible non-stop ultralong-haul flights when the Australian flag carrier receives its new aircraft. However, Joyce assures Qantas 787s would not fly to 40 destinations already covered by Emirates, its hub partner, but instead fly to other top destinations. He says combining direct and via-Dubai services gives Qantas “a very feasible and economic operation in Europe that works very well,” reports Australian Business Traveller. The Perth-London route would be an alternative to A380 trips to the Dubai hub of Emirates. The partnership of the two air carriers requires the UAE city would be the stopover of Qantas flights to Europe, but three new generation of planes could result in direct flights instead. These are the Boeing 787, Boeing 777-8 and Airbus A350-900ULR. The Airbus A350-900ULR is the same aircraft that Singapore Airlines ordered in 2015 and would fly non-stop to the US cities of New York and Los Angeles. Boeing’s 777-8X is also capable of flying more than 18 hours straight economically, Joyce says, reports The Australian. Because of passenger preference for direct flights to their ultimate destinations, orders for mid-size plane models have been rising in recent years. Qantas would replace its bigger Boeing 747 jets with Boeing 787-9 planes for long-haul routes, Joyce adds. Qantas expects to announce its first Dreamliner jet routes by the end of 2016. Joyce says the air carrier would no longer push through with its additional order of eight Airbus 380 jets since it would instead keep flying the 12 it owns for a longer period.

The EU and member states did not implement an order to remove subsidies that Boeing alleges helped Airbus beat it in major multi-billion dollar contract battles, the global free-trade arbiter said in Geneva. The WTO found that Airbus had won aircraft sales deals over Boeing in Europe, China, India and other countries helped by US$22 billion (RM90.36 billion) in illegal subsidies, US Trade Representative Michael Froman said. “This report is a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers,” he said.  ‘We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves.” Boeing claimed that the United States could now levy retaliatory duties against the European Union of up to US$10 billion a year as a result of the ruling yesterday, although US officials refrained from saying they would take such a step. “Today’s ruling confirms that Airbus both failed to withdraw old subsidies and instead put in place new subsidies for a grand total of almost US$22 billion,” the company said. Ready to negotiate Shares of both aircraft builders rose on the ruling.  Airbus was up 2.0 per cent to 53.72 euros (US$59.95) in Paris, and in New York, Boeing finished up 1.0 per cent at US$131.87. The ruling came after a fight dating back to 2004 over support and subsidies given both sides’ aircraft builders. Airbus and Boeing are leading employers and exporters on their home turfs, and compete head-to-head to sell to airlines around the world. The European Union said in a statement that it found some of the WTO findings "unsatisfactory," noting it has the right to appeal the ruling. It also pointed out that the WTO is likely to rule in coming months on EU and Airbus complaints about what they say is illegal US support for Boeing. US trade officials did not say what their next step would be. “We are ready to negotiate if it (the EU) is interested,” a US trade official said. An Airbus spokeswoman claimed in a statement that the WTO ruling backs the company's argument that EU support for the company was mostly legal. “We only needed to make limited changes in European policies and practices to comply,” she said. “This case should not be seen in isolation,” she added.  “There are already decisions condemning Boeing's abusive and illegal subsidies.  “So, it appears that Boeing and the US continue to litigate mainly to try to justify their own grab for state cash.” 12 year old case The WTO had ruled in 2011 that the European Union — and, individually, France, Germany, Spain and Britain — had to take 36 specific steps for withdrawing several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus. The case particularly focused on EU “launch aid” loans to help Airbus develop and bring aircraft to market. US officials subsequently complained to the WTO’s compliance panel that the European Union and the named countries had not followed through in most cases. Washington also expanded its attacks on alleged support for newer aircraft sold by Airbus, the A350 XWB and the A380.  The compliance panel ruled mostly in Boeing’s favour, including on some subsidies for the A350 XWB. “Today’s WTO report reinforces the value of international trade rules that ensure US companies and workers can compete and sell their world-class products and services on a level playing field,” Froman said. “We expect the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain — some of our closest trading partners — to respect WTO rules. We call on them to end subsidised financing of Airbus immediately.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Movie accent expert breaks down 32 actors’ accents Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles US native groups promised input as pipeline dispute looms Takei responds to Trump surrogate’s internment camp comments Japan PM confident in Trump’s diplomacy debut ‘I Wrote That Sh-t’ series puts songwriters for Katy Perry and more US intelligence chief James Clapper resigns Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

A Department of Defense release said the Boeing, the weapon manufacturer, is being awarded the $81,271,024 contract for firm-fixed-price modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract to exercise an option for the procurement of 22 Lot 89 Harpoon missiles and associated containers and components for India under the Foreign Military Sales programme. The contract is expected to be completed in June 2018. In 2014, India requested the US government for the Harpoon missiles for Shishumar class submarine. The request was made under Foreign Military Sale. The US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) had July 2014 said that the Indian government has requested a possible sale of 12 UGM-84L Harpoon Block II Encapsulated Missiles, 10 UTM-84L Harpoon Encapsulated Training missiles, 2 Encapsulated Harpoon certification training vehicles, containers, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, personnel training and training equipment, publications and technical data, US Government and contractor engineering and logistics support services, and other related elements of logistics support. The estimated cost is $200 million. It said that this weapon system, to be employed on the Shishumar class submarine (Type-209), will provide enhanced capabilities for defence of critical sea lines of communication. "India has already purchased Harpoon missiles for integration on Indian Air Force's Jaguar aircraft and Indian Navy's P-8I maritime patrol aircraft. India will have no difficulty absorbing these additional missiles into its armed forces," it added. Sources in the industry said that a contract was signed this June between Indian Ministry of Defence and US Department of Defense for supply of Harpoon systems for the submarines. To execute this contract, the US government has to buy the missiles from Boeing to supply to India. --IANS rs/vd SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features In pictures: Israeli President in India, says 'thank you' '50 days' : PM Modi's gift to Children!

First flight took place on 27 June, Don Bolling, director of business development in the company's Missiles and Fire Control division, said at the Air Force Association's (AFA's) annual conference. The company has since conducted 15 hours of flight testing aboard an F-15C at Jacksonville Air National Guard Base in Florida and is ready to reply to a US Air Force (USAF) request for proposals (RfP) for the acquisition, expected by the end of the year. Legion Pod can house various sensors, but in this application the company fitted its IRST21, a new generation of Lockheed Martin's legacy IRST sensor. The company describes IRST21 as "a passive, long-range sensor system" that uses IRST technology to detect and track airborne threats. Similar to last year's F-16 flight tests, the system successfully tracked multiple airborne targets in representative scenarios, according to Lockheed Martin. The company hopes its Legion Pod can meet a USAF requirement to fit its Boeing F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft with the IRST capability. The IRST21 design allows for mounting in various ways. Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters mount IRST21, designated as AN/ASG-34, on the nose section of the centreline fuel tank, while the Legion Pod variant is being developed to be transportable across a wide range of platforms including the F-15C and F-16.

The company sees demand for its superjumbo growing in the long term. Wang Zhao / AFP A380 has bright future despite production cutbacks, insists Airbus Agencies September 24, 2016 Updated: September 24, 2016 05:36 PM Related Airbus takes chopper to hundreds of jobs at its helicopter business Malaysia Airlines in talks to rent out A380s for Haj and Umrah pilgrim flights Dozens of Boeing and Airbus deliveries put back by Turkish Airlines Airbus brings jets, spacecraft, helicopters and missiles under one roof Dubai International Airport to have most A380-capable gates in the world Topics: Airbus Airbus has dismissed doubts over demand for the world’s largest passenger plane, the double-decker A380, even after it lowered production targets in July. "Every 15 years, the industry is doubling in size,"said the chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy. "So here you have London Heathrow, totally congested. JFK, congested. Los Angeles, congested. Hong Kong, congested. How are we going to double the traffic flows in the next 15 years if we don’t use larger aircraft like the A380?" Despite that longer-term optimism, Airbus now is lacking in new orders for the A380. In 2018, the company plans to cut the A380’s delivery target to 12 a year from 27 in 2015 and about half what is projected for this year, to prevent a glut of unsold planes. Singapore Airlines Ltd said this month it will not extend a lease on one of aircraft. The France-based aircraft maker is also confident in plans from engine maker Pratt & Whitney to solve production delays for its next-generation single-aisle planes, the A320neo, Mr Leahy said. "It is disappointing the situation we find ourselves in. But it’s a good engine for everything we can see. They have some production difficulties that they’re working their way through," Leahy told reporters in New York after a gathering of aviation executives and analysts known as the Wings Club. United Technologies Corp said earlier this month it would deliver 150 of its Pratt & Whitney engines this year, missing its target of 200 and pressuring cash flow. Mr Leahy’s upbeat comments came as the US government and Boeing claimed victory in a dispute with the EU, claiming the Euopean manufacturer gained huge advantages from subsidies. The European Union failed to eliminate subsidies to Airbus that were previously found to violate trade rules, the World Trade Organisation said in a ruling that opens the door to billions of dollars in sanctions against Brussels. The finding by a WTO compliance panel strikes a blow to the EU in a long-running dispute with the United States over government subsidies to the world’s two largest aircraft manufacturers, Airbus and Boeing The US had said it would seek US$10 billion in sanctions if the EU did not remedy illegal financing, which the trade body found in a 2011 ruling had cost Boeing plane sales and market share. The Geneva-based WTO cannot force nations or companies to drop payments that violate trade rules, but it can authorise retaliatory measures to pressure governments into complying with its rulings. The EU can still appeal the latest decision. If it loses, the US can seek sanctions. Separate cases involving assistance for Boeing remain under consideration. "This report is a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers," U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement. "We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves." The WTO panel said EU member states have failed to adequately remedy $18bn in launch aid for Airbus’ A380 superjumbo and other jets, infrastructure support and equity investments that the trade body determined in 2011 had unfairly benefited the plane maker. The ruling also cited additional subsidies not mentioned in that decision five years ago: more than $4bn in launch aid for Airbus’ new A350 wide-body jet. In a separate case, the trade organisation is still determining whether Boeing and the US have adequately addressed $5.3bn in illegal aid that flowed to the Chicago-based planemaker. The EU has filed another case challenging $8.7bn in subsidies granted by the state of Washington in 2013 in exchange for a Boeing pledge to manufacture its 777X jet in the Puget Sound region. business@thenational.ae Follow us on Twitter @TheNationalPF Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Airbus takes chopper to hundreds of jobs at its helicopter business Malaysia Airlines in talks to rent out A380s for Haj and Umrah pilgrim flights Dozens of Boeing and Airbus deliveries put back by Turkish Airlines Airbus brings jets, spacecraft, helicopters and missiles under one roof More Aviation Supercars can now travel in style from Dubai with Emirates Skywheels US regional airline Republic set to fly out of bankruptcy soon Bombardier’s passenger jet woes spur high-cost refinancing Brazil approves Qatar Airways’ stake purchase in Chile-based Latam Airlines MOST VIEWED Business | All Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end Egypt to cut energy subsidies further after securing IMF loan What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

The airline is still discussing a delivery schedule for the Max 8 with Boeing and plans to take the planes by late August or early September of next year, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said during a Friday interview aboard a test model of the aircraft. Boeing has said the plane will be ready to make its debut in the second quarter. The Max 8 will allow Southwest to fly farther than it can now, a benefit as the carrier begins to expand its young international operations. It also offers a fuel-efficiency improvement of about 14 percent over current models and will be the first with the Leap-1B engine built by CFM International Inc., a joint venture of General Electric Co. and France’s Safran SA. “It feels like it’s the first day of a big part of our future,” Van de Ven said as the Max stopped at Dallas Love Field during a series of test flights. “There’s just a lot of excitement at Southwest.” Launch Customer Southwest is considered the launch customer for the upgraded narrow-body jets because it placed the first order for the Max, the fastest-selling jet in Boeing’s history. But whether the low-cost carrier will be the first to fly the plane commercially is in question. The new 737 is running months ahead of schedule, a rarity for commercial jetliners. Boeing has already built the first of the 737s headed for Southwest, even though the new aircraft won’t be handed over until flight-testing concludes and the planes are certified as airworthy. The planemaker is building the Max along side current-model 737s while it prepares to speed combined output next year to 47 planes a month from the current 42. Flight Schedule Before flying the Max, Southwest has to retire its oldest planes, a process now expected to be finished in September 2017. A flight schedule being crafted over the next six months or so may allow the start of Max flights to “move up or back a little bit,” Van de Ven said. Southwest has orders for 30 of Boeing’s Max 7 aircraft, the smallest of the new 737, with deliveries starting in 2019. The carrier has no plans now to purchase a so-called Max 10, a stretched version of the largest 737 model that Boeing is considering. Possible flights across the Atlantic are “really not on the radar,” he said. “We haven’t had any serious interest in that right now,” Van de Ven said. “When we look at our opportunities going forward with the Max 7 and 8, there are 50 additional destinations we could serve and up to 500-ish airplanes over the next 20 years that we could take in that size that fit with our point-to-point network. There’s no reason for us at this point to go look for an airplane that would put us outside of what our current business model is.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

WASHINGTON: Senior Republican US House of Representatives lawmakers made clear on Friday they will keep campaigning against Boeing and Airbus jetliner sales to Iran, despite the Treasury Department’s announcement that it had begun issuing licenses for the exports. Republican Representatives Pete Roskam and Jeb Hensarling wrote to Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which oversees sanctions, demanding more answers about any security implications of the delivery of aircraft to Iran. “There is little evidence indicating that Iran Air has indeed stopped transporting weapons, troops, and cash to terrorist groups and rogue regimes,” the congressmen wrote in a letter, dated Thursday, seen by Reuters. Both congressmen hold influential financial positions in the House. Hensarling is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Roskam is chairman of the tax-writing Ways & Means Committee’s Oversight subcommittee. Airbus and Boeing said on Wednesday they had received US Treasury approval to begin exporting over 200 jets to Iran, under a deal struck in January. The news is likely to ease complaints from Iran over implementation of last year’s international nuclear agreement, in which Tehran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Some members of Congress have raised concerns that killing the deal could cost jobs at Boeing plants, but opponents of the deal argue that security concerns are more important. The letter to Adam Szubin, acting under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, asked for answers to several detailed questions on issues including Iran Air’s leadership, the Treasury’s ability to control transfers of aircraft or parts once they are in Iran’s hands and the nuclear pact. Foreign banks have been reluctant to finance the aircraft deals, fearing they could fall foul of remaining sanctions prohibiting the use of the US financial system for Iranian business. With US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump strongly critical of the rapprochement, some banks fear they could be left with no insurance if Iran sanctions “snap back.” Republican members of Congress unanimously opposed the nuclear agreement, seen as one of Democratic President Barack Obama’s foreign policy achievements. Arguing that Obama was more concerned with enhancing his legacy than national security, they have pushed legislation and other measures seeking to overturn or undermine the agreement.

When Air Astana was established in 2002 as a joint venture between Kazakhstan’s Samruk Kazyna National Welfare Fund and BAE Systems, it was against a backdrop of failed carriers, poor safety records and creaking infrastructure which was managed under the remnants of a former Soviet regulatory framework.  But against all those odds, over the subsequent two decades it has brought stability, profitability and efficiency to Kazakhstan’s air transport sector. A remarkable record of annual profitability is forecasted to continue in 2016 despite the significant impact a devaluation of the local currency, the tenge has had on its operations over the past 12 months. It has posted a small loss of $6.6 million for the first half of this year, but a strong second half, a historically stronger period for the airline, will recuperate those losses and allow it to post a small profit. "Our currency tends to fluctuate with the price of oil, and that's exactly what's happening. Our currency has halved from the back end of last year," Peter Foster, president and chief executive officer, Air Astana explains during a visit to the company’s Almaty headquarters. The currency devaluation has been significant as Kazakhstan has felt the force of its reliance on the commodity sector. Supported by rising oil output and prices, Kazakhstan’s economy had grown at an average of 8% per year until 2013, before suffering a slowdown in 2014 and 2015 sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Ukrainian crisis on trade and visitors. The value of the tenge has fallen by more than a half and Air Astana has had to be quick to react to safeguard its future. Its annual profits slipped from $51.4 million in 2013 to $19.5 million in 2014 after the first currency devaluation but significant cost savings helped boost profitability to rise to $47.4 million last year despite what Foster describes as “extremely challenging local and regional market conditions”. A second devaluation last year has again clouded the skies, but Air Astana believes its cost structure will enable it to maintain its enviable record of posting a profit in each of its 13 full years of operation, while a prestigious Four-Star rating by Skytrax in its World Airline Awards for the past five years, the first carrier from Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent States (the CIS) and Eastern Europe to receive this recognition, helps its continued rise on the international stage. “Currency and commodity price weakness are ongoing challenges. We don’t expect great things from 2016, but with our cost base now amongst the lowest of any full service airline in the world, we expect to be well placed to take advantage when markets improve,” says Foster. Air Astana certainly offers a premium full-service concept across both its Business Class and Economy cabins but benefits from being a start-up carrier in the modern age. “We are a premium carrier, but at the same time a low-cost carrier. Our operating cost is now down to around $0.06 per ASK [available seat kilometres] which is comparable to some of Europe’s leading low-cost carriers,” says Foster. The airline currently operates a network of 65 routes serving 42 international and domestic destinations. A domestic network covering 13 cities is balanced by a growing international network across Central Asia and out into North and South East Asia, the Middle East and Europe with flights operating mainly from bases in Almaty and Astana. These markets are served by a fleet of 30 aircraft comprising Boeing 767-300ERs and 757-200s, Airbus A320 Family equipment (both A320s and A321s) and Embraer 190 regional jets. It has outstanding orders via lessors for eleven A320neo family aircraft and three 787 Dreamliners. As Kazakhstan’s economy wavers, flag carrier Air Astana has been reworking its business plans and moving away from its domestic focus to international routes. The airline is now likely to adopt more of a hub model at Astana International Airport, which serves the growing new capital of the Central Asian country and facilitate the growing connectivity needs within the Eurasia market. Working with the Airport Management Group, which is providing a renewed focus on airport infrastructure at the country’s state-controlled airports, Air Astana has helped drive the future shape of Astana International Airport to better support connecting traffic. This summer it appointed Seabury Advisory Group to complete a review of its own network and develop a flight optimisation strategy for the future. Ahead of this review, the first stage of this process may see the airline switch its Hong Kong flights from Almaty to Astana, while it also plans to relaunch flights between Astana and Kiev, a market previously flown between April 2013 and July 2014. “We are never going to be able to compete with the big players on huge markets such as London – Hong Kong or Frankfurt - Beijing, but we could take a small amount of traffic to add to our passenger loads and boost revenues. However, we can become the big player ourselves in some lesser connected markets such as to/from Urumqi in China, southern Russia or into the likes of Kyrgyzstan simply with an improved schedule offer,” says Peter Foster, president and chief executive officer, Air Astana. “But we have too many routes without a daily offer and that significantly impacts transfer demand. Seabury Group is doing a full network review looking at frequency and connectivity issues,” he adds. The route audit is due for completion in September 2016 at which time the Air Astana board will look at the findings and possibly adapt the future strategy of the airline. Our own analysis of Sabre Market Intelligence data shows that in terms of transfer traffic Astana International Airport currently acts to mainly support flows into the former capital, Almaty. In the year ending May 2016 approximately 150,000 passengers transferred between Air Astana flights at Astana International Airport with seven of the ten largest O&D markets via the facility involving links to and from Almaty. In fact only one of the ten markets connected two points outside of Kazakhstan. Over the 12 month period, flows are dominated by discount economy traffic (92.3%), although the small business flows did generate yields approximately 4.5 times the rate of that market, with the transfer traffic worth around $340 per passenger. The data shows that Almaty International Airport currently acts a stronger transfer hub for Air Astana, but capacity constraints limit development and the continued move of business services to the new capital will dilute future demand. In the 12 months to May 2016 approximately 280,000 annual passengers connected via the airport. Like Astana, traffic is dominated by discount economy traffic (93.8%) and it generates a similar base revenue of $337 per passenger. The airline’s links to Delhi and Kiev are key drivers of the transfer traffic with the Kiev – Tashkent city pair accounting for over 10,000 annual passengers.

This is the Republic of Iran’s capital, Tehran, which from June 30, 2016 has been served on a three times weekly basis from Almaty using Embraer 190 equipment configured with 9 Business Class and 88 Economy seats. Tehran was originally one of two new destinations planned by Air Astana for 2016, but its growth plans have been hit by regulatory red tape.  After announcing last year plans to introduce a link between Astana and Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, from March 2016 and latterly from June 2016, the carrier has had to cancel the launch until at least 2017 after the Civil Aviation Authority of Mongolia (CAAM) revoked its permission to serve this international route. Foster explains that the regulators actions are “ungrounded” after the company successfully completed an audit by CCAM earlier this year and was informed that there were ‘zero findings’. “The Air Services Agreement stipulates the specific three grounds based on which Mongolia could possibly revoke the permission of a Kazakh designated carrier and none of these apply to Air Astana,” he says. “I’ve never known a situation like this before in all my years in the industry.” However, CAAM has retained its strong stance and claims that the Kazakh carrier had not taken the full steps to acquire the certified safety approval along with appropriate permissions for landing slots and tariffs. After CAAM had initially granted permission to start flights on the route Air Astana had already opened reservations for the Astana – Ulaanbaatar route and Foster confirms that it secured more 3,500 bookings, many planning to connect in Astana from its European routes. Air Astana’s own network growth is being supported by an increasing number of partnerships and codeshare agreements are in place with among others Austrian Airlines (to Vienna), Etihad Airways (to Abu Dhabi) and most recently Air India (to New Delhi) and Air France-KLM (to Amsterdam and Paris). The future direction of the airline’s network strategy will ultimately be dictated by the findings of a current Seabury Advisory Group route audit, but discussions have already occurred for planned expansion over the remainder of the decade, including possible growth across Asia, the Indian sub-continent and even into North America. It appears that World Routes host city Chengdu is the most likely destination to join Beijing and Urumqi in its mainland China network from 2017, but Shanghai is also under consideration.  The airline has been exploring flights to the fast expanding Chinese secondary city for a number of years and a deal to serve Shuangliu International Airport could be formalised at this year’s air service development forum. Singapore and Tokyo are also markets under consideration for future expansion across Asia. The Indian sub-continent also offers strong potential for Air Astana, especially to support a likely push for additional transfer traffic across Russia, the CIS and Central Asia. “We have a strategic geographical advantage and the Indian sub-continent is a definite opportunity for us,” says Foster. There are already a large number of traders from India heading to Tbilisi, Georgia, using Almaty as a transit point – many of these currently fly via Moscow and some even to London, according to the Air Astana boss. “We are seriously looking at Islamabad because it is a good market for us and geography is in our favour,” adds Foster, noting Pakistan and Bangladesh both have a big movement of people to the CIS and Russia and “hold vast opportunities” for the carrier. Looking further ahead to the arrival of the first of the airline’s Boeing 787-8s in 2019 and there is the potential for direct flights from Astana to points in the United States. Air Astana was originally due to receive its three Dreamliners in 2017 but deferred delivery until the end of the decade amid concerns that the devaluation of the Kazakhstani tenge would dampen demand. Foster confirms that these aircraft will arrive in 2019 (two aircraft) and 2021 and remain tentatively ear-marked to launch flights to New York, although any future middle-of-market project from Boeing could lead to a revised avenue for development. The airline’s 767-300ER fleet are among the last aircraft off the production line and with reconditioned Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines and winglets already provide good operational efficiency on routes into Europe. This means that it does not have any immediate requirement to replace these widebodies with new equipment. It is a different story for the airline’s 757-200 fleet though and with Boeing slow to confirm any new middle-of-market option, Air Astana has turned to Airbus to replace its five-strong 757-200 fleet and retain commonality with the new A320neo Family airliners that will serve its short- and medium-haul routes. The airline’s 757s are older than the carrier itself and have been in service for between 17 and 21 years having originally flown with German leisure airline LTU, US operator American Trans Air and China Xinjiang Airlines in North Asia. They will be replaced by four A321neoLRs from 2019 as Air Astana becomes one of the first operators of the new variant, which is designed to offer the longest range of any single-aisle aircraft. “In terms of product, in terms of range, in terms of operating cost efficiency, these aircraft are going to take Air Astana to a new level. These aircraft will allow us to operate almost all of our network: domestic, regional and also our long-haul services to Europe and Asia with one common family of aircraft,” says Foster. In fact the A321neoLR will be able to directly replace the 757 on all but one of its routes, offering exactly the same seating configuration (16 lie-flat Business Class and 150 Economy seats), but providing significant cost savings and enhanced operational efficiency. The 757s are currently mainly used on scheduled flights to Antalya, Bangkok, Frankfurt, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, London, Paris and Seoul and Urumqi. “We can use the new aircraft on all our current routes with the exception of Almaty – Kuala Lumpur which is beyond the range of the aircraft,” says Richard Ledger, vice president worldwide sales, Air Astana. “We will likely grow fully to the 767-300ER in this market.” The next big fleet decision for the airline will be the replacement of its Embraer 190 fleet. Although the type has only served with the carrier for five years, the first examples will be coming off lease in 2019. The new ‘E2’ modernised version of the airliner is certainly a favourite, but Foster acknowledges that you can’t discount the Bombardier CSeries. “We have to consider the CSeries now that the Delta Air Lines order has guaranteed the programme and it is now a real aeroplane,” he says. Air Astana expects to appoint advisory investment bankers by February 2017 to support a shareholder goal to complete a public listing in 2018. The proposed dual-listing Initial Public Offering (IPO) will dilute the shares of both Samruk-Kazyna, Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund (51%) and BAE Systems (49%). "We're hoping to do a public listing of the company somewhere between March and October of 2018, and that has to be a dual listing,” says Peter Foster, president and chief executive officer, Air Astana. “By law, there has to be a listing in Kazakhstan, but since the domestic market is illiquid, there will be a concurrent secondary listing in either London, Hong Kong or Singapore. London is more likely since it is quite well geared up to handle investment in this part of the world.” The Kazakhstan government is looking to privatise several national companies to balance the resource-rich nation’s budget deficit caused by the sharp plunge in oil and gas prices, which has stalled Kazakhstan’s economic growth. Local rules require entities seeking public listing to maintain the majority of their shareholding in Kazakhstan and means that 51% of the airline has to remain in Kazakhstani hands, though not necessarily held by the government. "We think that it's likely that BAE would want to realise some value out of their shareholding. By the time the IPO happens, the shareholders would've been holding for 16 years," adds Foster. The former Cathay Pacific, Philippine Airlines, Qatar Airways and Royal Brunei Airlines executive said it is too early to confirm the proposed fund-raising target of the IPO but suggested that between 30% and 50% of the airline’s equity could be made available through the process. What is certain is that the second half of this year will see the continued evolution of the Air Astana offer and brand. The first of its A320neos will arrive from September 2016 (deliberately delayed from May 2016 due to the new airliner’s engine performance issues), a new onboard Wi-Fi system will be rolled-out on the 767 fleet and even a revision to the airline’s corporate brand and livery is in the pipeline.

(NYSE: BA) can do something to slow the decline in orders for its wide-body aircraft is, at this point, anybody’s guess. The company guided full-year orders for all its commercial planes at 535, with wide-body orders totaling 215. So far this year, the company has booked 357 orders, of which 301 are for the narrow-body 737. Analysts at Credit Suisse are not particularly impressed, and while they believe that “the next several years are still a robust cash harvest for Boeing,” they also see some problems. On Thursday the analysts reiterated their Neutral rating on the stock and maintained their price target at $148 per share, an upside of 12.2% to the most recent closing price of $131.87. Credit Suisse does not see a higher target unless Boeing addresses the production rate for its 777 family. Here is their reasoning: Assuming this [777 production rate decision] occurs with Q3 results, the removal of this overhang, along with a decent dividend hike (15-20%) following the mid-Dec. board meeting, could drive some traction in the shares toward [our target price]. This could take a little longer if BA waits until Q4 results to cut 777 further. While an Iranian 777 order could mitigate a potential cut, it is unlikely to be large enough to fully negate it. We’ve noted before that Boeing is having trouble selling the 777 Classic and plans to reduce production from 8.3 per month to 7.0 per month early next year with an eye to reducing the rate to 5.5 per month in 2018. In July the president of Boeing’s commercial division said that orders for the 777 Classic are “pretty solid” through the third quarter of 2017. At a production rate of seven per month, the 777 Classic backlog of 170 will last two years, but that leaves Boeing with no backlog until the 777X is in production beginning in 2020. The 777-300ER carries a list price of $339.6 million and trails only the 747 as the most expensive plane currently available from Boeing. A 777-9X sells for a cool $400 million, and is the most expensive plane in the lineup. For a company that promotes its cash flow as a primary measure of its success, these planes are very important. Here’s Credit Suisse’s take: Last week at an investor conference, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg acknowledged that if the company is not successful at garnering additional 777 orders in the next few months, the 777 production plan will need to adjust downwards, which we expect to occur. The current delivery plan (from May) between now and 2019 requires ~80 new orders with BA hoping for 40-50 777s per year to sustain the current build plan, which is 7/mth in 2017 and 5.5/mth in 2018/19 as 777X blanks feather into the production system. “Blanks” is Boeing’s term for empty slots in a production line. Credit Suisse has not uncovered anything particularly new here, but the analysts are calling on Boeing to be both more realistic and more forthcoming about the company’s plans for 777 production.

By Karthick Arvinth September 23, 2016 07:34 BST Close Embed Feed Boeing 777X: Everything you need to know about the world's biggest passenger airliner IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/18153" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Boeing has welcomed the World Trade Organization's ruling that rival Airbus received unfair state subsidies from European governments. The American aerospace giant said the decision paves the way for the US to seek up to $10bn (£7.7bn) in annual retaliatory tariffs on imports from the European Union. In a report released on 22 September, the WTO said the EU had failed to comply with an earlier ruling in 2011 to halt billions of dollars of subsidised financing to France-based Airbus. It added that the launch of Airbus's most recent jet, the A350, had been aided by state funds. The US responded to the ruling by demanding an immediate halt to EU subsidies to protect American jobs, while Airbus said it would appeal against the decision. "Today's historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules," Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. "This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for US aerospace workers, in particular." Airbus and Boeing have accused each other of receiving unfair state subsidiesReuters The WTO is yet to rule on an EU complaint that the US offered billions of dollars in tax breaks to Boeing. "This report is a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers," US Trade Representative office's Michael Froman said. "We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves." The USTR alleged that Airbus had received $22bn in subsidised financing from the EU along with Germany, France, the UK and Spain. "We expect the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain – some of our closest trading partners – to respect WTO rules. We call on them to end subsidized financing of Airbus immediately," Froman added. "We will not tolerate our trading partners ignoring the rules at the expense of American workers and their families."

The WTO also found Airbus received new illegal subsidies for the A350, which are reported to be nearly $5 billion. In 2011, the WTO outlined specific steps for the EU to withdraw government financial support for Airbus, which included subsidy programs, that European states claimed were "launch aid" for the plane-maker to bring its products to market. Not only did the EU ignore the 2011 measures, the regional bloc further breached rules by granting over $4 billion in new subsidized financing for the Airbus A350 XWB, the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office declared in a statement on Thursday. Airbus An Airbus ACJ319 in a hangar. In total, Airbus has received nearly $22 billion in subsidized financing from the EU as well as Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain, the USTR claimed. "This report is a sweeping victory for the U.S. and its aerospace workers," the USTR's Michael Froman said in a statement. "We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves." For over a decade, Washington and the EU have fought over the issue of subsidies, with the latter asserting that Illinois-based Boeing benefited from billions in U.S. tax breaks. Airbus pledged to appeal Thursday's decision while European officials hinted of an appeal as well, Reuters reported. "The historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules," said Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in a statement on Thursday. Thursday's decision sets the stage for the U.S. to seek up to $10 billion in annual retaliatory tariffs on EU imports, Boeing noted. The WTO is expected to rule on the EU's case against Boeing early next year, according to Reuters. In its statement, Boeing stressed that the Airbus case was independent of EU's accusations against Boeing, claiming that the cases were "separate and distinct." —Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Airplanes Bound for Salt Lake Grounded at Twin Falls By Andrew Weeks September 22, 2016 6:01 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter TWIN FALLS, Idaho (KLIX) – Three Delta passenger airplanes headed to Salt Lake City were diverted to Twin Falls late this afternoon due to thunderstorms. A 39-year-old woman on one of the planes, a Boeing 757, was taken to the hospital because she had become lightheaded and dizzy, said Bill Carberry, manager of Magic Valley Regional Airport. Twin Falls Fire Department and Magic Valley Paramedics responded to the woman. The three planes – two Boeing 737s and one Boeing 757 – landed at around 4:40 p.m. Each plane was bound for Salt Lake City, Carberry said, but due to bad weather in Utah the planes needed to divert. The planes had been refueled, and at a little before 6 p.m. the 757 was preparing for takeoff, he said.

Matthew DiLallo (TMFmd19) Sep 24, 2016 at 12:00PM Image source: Getty Images. While commercial drones have been flying since the early 1980s, their importance to commerce is just starting to take off. According to a recent report (link opens PDF) by business consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the potential commercial applications for drones is astounding. It found that the global value of drone-powered solutions is $127.3 billion, with the best prospect for drone applications being the infrastructure sector, which PwC pegs at a $45.2 billion opportunity. Drilling down into the infrastructure opportunity The reason PwC sees a vast opportunity for drones in the infrastructure sector is that these companies not only perform hazardous work but operate complex assets distributed over large areas. It cites energy companies as one sector that should be one of the first big beneficiaries of drone technology solutions. That's because drones can increase safety and save money by performing three critical applications: investment monitoring, maintenance, and asset inventory. Several companies have already used drones for these applications, and given the initial results, drone usage is likely to continue to become an increasingly important tool for American infrastructure companies. Drones in flight: Saving lives, time, and money Drones have already taken flight in the oil and gas sector with ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) making history in 2013 after it was the first company approved by the U.S. for the commercial use of a drone. That initial flight took place in remote airspace over the Chukchi Sea in Alaska with a ScanEagle drone manufactured by a subsidiary of Boeing (NYSE:BA). ConocoPhillips used the drone for marine mammal and ice surveys offshore Alaska as it prepared to conduct exploratory drilling in the region. While the company never moved forward with this particular drilling project, drones are becoming an increasingly important tool for oil and gas companies. Not only are oil companies using drones to gather data for exploration, but they are using them for inspection operations to determine which drilling rigs need maintenance. For example, producers BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (NYSE: RDS-A) (NYSE: RDS-B), and Apache (NYSE: APA) are using drones to inspect offshore oil rigs in the North Sea for damage. In this case, drones equipped with high-definition and thermal cameras are replacing workers that needed to hang from a wire to inspect rigs. This replacement not only improves safety but it can save time and money, which is critical given where oil prices are these days. The oil industry is not the only one employing drones for safety reasons. Telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) recently completed a trial using drones to inspect its cell towers. It did so because "every time we use a drone it's just one less tower climb. Every tower climb that we can save provides a safer situation, or less opportunity for potential injury." AT&T hailed the trial as a success and going forward it plans to use drones in its tower operations to inspect them for trouble spots. While the drones will not replace tower climbers, it will enable the company to use them more efficiently because they will not have to climb every tower, and when they do, they will know what to expect and will have the proper equipment with them. Image source: AeroVironment.  Cashing in on the drone revolution Most of the companies that operate drones serving the infrastructure sector are privately held, which limits investment options. Furthermore, several drone makers are embedded in larger companies like Boeing and are therefore a small piece of their global business, which limits investors' direct upside. That said, investors do have at one compelling option to consider. AeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is an early leader in the unmanned aircraft space after spending decades developing solutions for the military. It is initially branching into commercial applications to change the way farmers and energy providers monitor and manage their assets. AeroVironment has developed a turnkey information solution, with its Puma AE its first commercial drone approved by the Federal Aviation Administration. That drone is already in the field with British oil giant BP, which currently uses it to monitor operations at its Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska. That said, commercial drone applications are a small part of AeroVironment's current sales, though it represents a massive opportunity for the company over the long term.    Investor takeaway Drones are just starting to take flight to provide time- and money-saving solutions to infrastructure companies. While that is good news for investors in companies that own large infrastructure portfolios like BP or AT&T, there aren't many worthwhile direct drone investment options out there right now other than AeroVironment. That said, new investment opportunities should arise down the road as more infrastructure operators start employing drones. Matt DiLallo owns shares of AeroVironment and ConocoPhillips.

Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar Cybersecurity Computer Scientists Close In on Perfect, Hack-Proof Code September 23, 2016 Joel Harding BOYA SUN FOR QUANTA MAGAZINE IN THE SUMMER of 2015 a team of hackers attempted to take control of an unmanned military helicopter known as Little Bird. The helicopter, which is similar to the piloted version long-favored for US special operations missions, was stationed at a Boeing facility in Arizona. The hackers had a head start: At the time they began the operation, they already had access to one part of the drone’s computer system. From there, all they needed to do was hack into Little Bird’s onboard flight-control computer, and the drone was theirs. When the project started, a “Red Team” of hackers could have taken over the helicopter almost as easily as it could break into your home Wi-Fi. But in the intervening months, engineers from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had implemented a new kind of security mechanism—a software system that couldn’t be commandeered. Key parts of Little Bird’s computer system were unhackable with existing technology, its code as trustworthy as amathematical proof. Even though the Red Team was given six weeks with the drone and more access to its computing network than genuine bad actors could ever expect to attain, they failed to crack Little Bird’s defenses. “They were not able to break out and disrupt the operation in any way,” said Kathleen Fisher, a professor of computer science at Tufts University and the founding program manager of the High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) project. “That result made all of Darpa stand up and say, oh my goodness, we can actually use this technology in systems we care about.” The technology that repelled the hackers was a style of software programming known as formal verification. Unlike most computer code, which is written informally and evaluated based mainly on whether it works, formally verified software reads like a mathematical proof: Each statement follows logically from the preceding one. An entire program can be tested with the same certainty that mathematicians prove theorems. “You’re writing down a mathematical formula that describes the program’s behavior and using some sort of proof checker that’s going to check the correctness of that statement,” saidBryan Parno, who does research on formal verification and security at Microsoft Research.

Source: Sikorsky-Boeing The US Army's Joint Multirole-Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD)/Future Vertical Lift (FVL) effort is moving towards first flights in 2017, but meanwhile is focused on crucial system architecture demonstrations. Dan Bailey, the army's programme director for JMR/FVL, said the effort is demonstrating the platform and, perhaps more importantly, its mission system architecture. US Army and US Navy planners hope to eventually replace a variety of aircraft via FVL. Among other initial parameters, the government is seeking a platform to carry 4 crew and 12 or more troops, self-deploy out to 2,100 n miles, and fly at up to 230 kt or more. "We're into the second of our mission system architecture demonstrations," Bailey said during 23 September comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, DC. Subsystem technology is particularly important, Bailey said, because he expects an FVL to be flying for many years in many environments, and therefore requiring easy upgrades. For example, he noted aircraft such as the Boeing AH-64 Apache has been flying for decades and will continue for many more, but newly integrated subsystems have kept the platform viable. Apaches were designed in the 1970s and first delivered to the US Army in 1984. The JMR-TD programme's focus over the next year is on an architecture implementation process demonstration (AIPD), and six contractors are working on that to validate interoperability between the various pieces, Ryan Bunge, Rockwell Collins' manager for Special Operations, Air Force, and Advanced Rotary-Wing Programs, said during the event. The platforms themselves are to begin flying prototypes late in 2017, and these will undergo 150-200 hours of flight time - and downtime to review data - that take it through 2019, Bailey said. Those flights are likely to uncover engineering issues that will have to be worked out during a development phase. Want to read more?

But miniature representations of potential future weaponry have been on the wane (though not altogether absent) as budgets tighten and the Pentagon searches for ways to buy arms more cheaply. And yet, defense firms were showing off all sorts of far-out concepts at this week’s Air, Space and Cyber conference, the annual gathering of airpower leaders and defense executives in National Harbor, Maryland, the faux city just outside the Washington Beltway. Perhaps industry has grown impatient with complaints from Pentagon acquisition undersecretary Frank Kendall that the U.S. is losing its technological edge to the likes of China, and has set out to prove him wrong. Lockheed Martin offered a black flying wing, akin to the B-2 bomber, but larger, with a T-tail and two massive engines. (One aerospace expert said the model’s turbofans, which probably don’t exist yet, would likely be the largest ever built.) Lockheed officials said cargo and tanker planes of the future could look like this. Boeing outfitted models of three 737 commercial jetliners with different types of communications equipment that could replace the Air Force’s Compass Call, JSTARS, and Rivet Joint surveillance planes. One of them was based on the 737 Max, a variant so recent it hasn’t yet entered commercial service.

Few of these projects have Pentagon funding, but firms are spending their own money to show that that they’re thinking ahead. Cobham, for example, is building special radars for drones that could help them detect and avoid other aircraft in the sky. It’s clear the Pentagon’s push for new technology, reflected by Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work’s Third Offset, is taking root — inside the defense industry anyway. The question that now remains: will there be any money down the road to buy new stuff? Welcome!

From Defense One Sikorsky’s New Ace in the Hole: Lockheed’s Skunk Works // Marcus Weisgerber The newly acquired helicopter maker is tapping into Lockheed Martin’s famed advanced tech division. US Air Force Grounds F-35s It Just Declared Ready for War // Marcus Weisgerber Crumbling avionics lines are the latest setback for the jet, which had been riding a wave of progress. Tomorrow’s Downed Pilots May Be Rescued by an Osprey-Black Hawk Team // Marcus Weisgerber A U.S. Air Force chief of staff who was shot down over Serbia has reenergized the debate over the best way to do combat search and rescue. Sikorsky’s Defense Chief, One-on-One The helicopter maker that became part of Lockheed Martin last year is running faster than ever, says Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky Defense Systems & Services. He chatted with Defense One on the sidelines of the annual AFA conference about a military helicopter portfolio that includes the Air Force’s Combat Rescue Helicopter, Marine Corps’ VH-92 Presidential Helicopter, and the Army’s search for a helicopter of the future. Mehta pointed to Sikorsky’s contract to deliver its first new HH-60 to the Air Force in 2020. The aircraft is required to arrive within 75 months of the order — but the firm gets a bonus if it comes six months early. “We’re tracking very well toward the 69 months,” Mehta said. “The idea is not to rely upon the contract schedule, the idea is to try to get this program and these helicopters pulled left as far as possible. Nobody on my team recognizes or understands 75 months. They all know they’re being measured to a 69-month schedule to achieve early deliveries.” Sikorsky’s defense chief says his firm, whose acquisition by Lockheed Martin was finalized in November, could build the aircraft even faster than that. “We can take advantage of a very hot supply chain that we have in order to pull parts and components left. We also have the manufacturing capacity and the final assembly capacity to be able to do that.” Another project where Mehta says the helicopter maker is working faster: the Army’s Future Vertical Lift project. “It may be the only area in this program where we fundamentally agree with our competitor,” he said. Bell, who is competing against Sikorsky and its partner Boeing, has also said it could build an aircraft faster. “We’re ready to bring the schedule left. I think we’ve done a fair amount of risk reduction with our X2 technology demonstrator,” Mehta said. “We’re flying the S-97 Raider right now.…We think we could be well-positioned for an aircraft with mature technologies, a proven flight system, all the data and analysis that comes with it to be able to compete as a product offering, not only as a technology, as early as 2020.” The Army doesn’t plan to field this new helicopter tech, which will replace the Black Hawks and Apaches until the 2030s, a timeframe that has drawn some criticism. Human-Machine Collaboration The Air Force wants to buy a new plane and radar to track people, vehicles and aircraft to replace the E-8C JSTARS. But it wants that plane to be smaller, its crew slimmed down, and its computers far smarter and more capable. Boeing, which is leading one of three teams competing for the contract, brought to AFA a semitrailer outfitted like a 737 with computer consoles. The new computers, said one employee on the project who flew missions in the back of an E-8C, are far more advanced than those in the planes now. They can better identify targets and even suggest the best type of weapon to use in a strike. Foreign Sales Wrapup The U.S. late Wednesday cleared a $1.9 billion sale of four Boeing KC-46 tankers to Japan. Japan already has four Boeing KC-767 tankers. In case you’re wondering, still no word on whether the U.S. approved the much-anticipated, fighter jet deals to Kuwait and Qatar with a combined $7 billion.

A decade or so from now, Marines could be using a laser-armed version of this bizarre copter-plane to take out enemies over the horizon. It’s the LightningStrike from Aurora Flight Sciences, which is currently the prime contractor on the VTOL X-Plane project by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. An Aurora representative says that “there’s quite a bit of interest” in a laser-armed version of the drone, particularly for use in Marine Corps missions. The LightningStrike uses a hybrid electric distributed propulsion system. A Rolls-Royce AE 1107C turboshaft engine drives three Honeywell generators, which produce a total of three megawatts of electrical power. “That’s enough to power a small town,” John Tylko, the chief innovation officer at Aurora Flight Sciences, pointed out to Defense One at the Air Force Association’s Air Space Cyber conference outside of Washington, D.C. Currently, the LightningStrike uses the juice to run 24 ducted fans that lift the aircraft vertically, then rotate to push it forward, similar to a Boeing V-22 Osprey. But there’s plenty of excess power for other uses, at least while the aircraft is in cruise mode, when its lift fans need only one megawatt.

Be the first to receive updates. “The biggest advantage of this capability is that because it’s generating so much electrical power, it has significant available power in cruise for directed energy payloads or for electronic warfare countermeasure payloads that can be useful in this future landscape,” Tylko said. “Governments are putting a lot of effort into this directed energy.” Aurora and DARPA are talking to different services about what they might want to do with the LightningStrike. “We’re just at the beginnings of that, but the most likely customer is the Marine Corps,” who are attracted by the combination of vertical lift and a forward speed of about 400 knots, Tylko said. Defense One has asked the Marines for comment. Aurora isn’t the only drone maker looking to put lasers on flying robots. Last year, General Atomics, maker of the famous MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones, announced that they were undertaking a privately funded study to incorporate a massive 150-kilowatt laser into their large Predator C drone. The LightningStrike, which would be a medium-altitude drone, doesn’t really compete with the Reaper. Tylko cautioned that a laser-tipped LightningStrike “is ten to twenty years off; it’s really pushing the state of the art. It’s not likely to be fielded in the near term.” In the meantime, Aurora and others are leading the charge away from human pilots and toward more autonomous flying weapons. “Remotely piloted vehicles, that’s a technology from the 1990s,” Tylko said. “Predator and Reaper still need to be flown manually because that’s a technology that’s 20 years old.” Marines staging a beachhead assault, or running an artillery base on the border of a battle zone, don’t generally have much time to devote to drone pilot training or ground crew operations. Aurora is focusing heavily on autonomy and GPS independence across its drone portfolio, including the LightningStrike, to create flying weapons that can pilot themselves — but humans would still be in charge of deciding when to fire, in keeping with current military policy.

The sides will accordingly discuss the legal aspects of the deals to precipitate their implementaiton, Akhondi told reporters, IRNA news agency reported September 24. The two aircraft manufacturers were authorized by the US Treasury earlier this week to sell their products to Iran, months after Iran signed deals with the companies. In January Iran and Airbus signed a deal over 118 airliners. But the company could not accomplish the deal as it was restricted by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States in doing business with Iran. A similar deal between Tehran and Boeing had the same story. Iran plans to buy about 500 aircraft in 10 years to refurbish its aging fleet. Iranian airliners average 25 in age.

Follow @routesonline 5,901 followers While Brazil’s economic woes may be casting a considerable shadow over the region, other parts of Latin America are faring better. Brazil may still be basking in the afterglow of hosting the Olympic Games but the event has proved to be a brief ray of sunshine in an otherwise bleak year for Latin America’s biggest economy. The country has been mired in a nasty recession - the economy shrank by 5.4% in the first quarter of 2016 - and an ongoing political crisis, which has had an inevitable impact on air traffic in and around Brazil. The country’s political instability has also led to a delay in the ratification of an open skies agreement with the US. Figures from International Air Transport Association (IATA) show that the domestic Brazilian air market has been the worst performing major region in the world with traffic (as measured by revenue passenger kilometres) falling by 6.8% during the first six months of 2016. However, other parts of Latin America are faring much better. Across the region, total passenger traffic rose by 3.7% and average load factors edged up by 0.2 percentage points to 80% for the first half of 2016. The continent’s international travel fared even better, with a 7.5% increase in traffic and load factors up 0.9 points to 80.6%. But Brazil’s woes are casting a considerable shadow over the region’s recent success stories, which include Chile, Peru and Colombia, plus Central America and Mexico to the north. The continent’s largest airline, LATAM, has reacted by continuing to cut capacity within Brazil – current plans by the carrier will see a reduction of between 10% and 12% in domestic seats this year compared with 2015. There also seems very little light at the end of the tunnel, with LATAM’s CEO Enrique Cueto admitting the Brazilian market is “expected to remain challenged for at least the next two years”. The airline has been quick to point out that other areas have “experienced demand growth and healthy profitability on international and domestic operations”, including Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. Meanwhile, Brazilian low-cost carrier Gol has responded to the country’s economic woes by implementing a major cost-cutting programme. This has included suspending flights to eight destinations and plans to reduce its fleet by around 15% by the end of this year. Another competitor, Azul, has also had to cut costs and capacity as well as defer expansion plans. John Grant, senior analyst at aviation data specialist OAG, says: “The bubble has burst in Brazil. The economic environment is dragging down consumer demand quite considerably at the same time as capacity growth has been put into the market. It’s going to continue to be soft for the foreseeable future.  “On the other side of South America it’s a more positive story with Chile, Peru and Colombia all performing very well. All three are stable with strong market and economic confidence, which has translated into new air services and capacity.” Colombia, once thought of as a “no-go” zone dominated by drug lords and civil war, has transformed itself as a destination and started to reap the benefits. National airline Avianca, based in Bogota, made an operating profit of $72.2 million in the first quarter of 2016 – a 21.4% increase on the profit it made for the same period last year. Avianca is continuing to step up capacity, which rose by 9% year-on-year, and has been primarily fuelled by international expansion, such as new routes from Bogota to Los Angeles, and adding extra frequencies to London and Madrid. Capacity to Europe has risen by 20.3% this year while traffic has increased by 24.7% pushing transatlantic factors to 82.7% - above the airline’s average of 78.8%. CEO Hernán Rincón said that the airline’s plan was to “selectively grow in specific markets”, such as adding capacity from its Bogota hub to other major regional cities including Santiago and Buenos Aires. Colombia is also benefiting from the growth in low-cost carriers in the region, a development that had previously been concentrated in the major markets of Brazil and Mexico. VivaColombia, which is based in Medellín, has built up a 13.4% market share domestically. The country should be set for more growth with the Colombian government’s plans to further expand Bogota’s El Dorado International Airport, which only opened a new international terminal in 2012. This could see passenger numbers increase from just under 30 million last year to around 40 million by 2021. Bogota is already Latin America’s third busiest airport after São Paulo Guarulhos and Mexico City’s Benito Juárez. Further south in Peru, the plans for expanding Lima’s Jorge Chávez airport have not been going so smoothly. The project to add a second runway has already been delayed by more than 10 years and the latest obstacle has been a contract dispute between Peru’s government and the private company licensed to build the runway, Lima Airport Partners. Better news for the Peruvian capital has been the announcement of new forthcoming European routes, such as Air  Europa’s daily flights from July 2017, and LATAM Peru planning to fly from Lima to Barcelona from December 2016. LATAM has already launched a Lima-Washington Dulles route this year, while British Airways (BA) restarted its services from London Gatwick to Lima in May 2016. BA has been slowly building up its network to South America in the past couple of years – the UK airline has also added San José in Costa Rica during 2016. The Chilean capital Santiago will follow as a new route from London Heathrow from January 3, 2017. “The Chilean economy has been steadily growing, with increasing trade links to Europe, so this new direct route will respond to the need for travel between the two capital cities to do business face-to-face,” said BA CEO Alex Cruz when the route to Santiago was announced. BA’s links with Latin America are set to be strengthened further with its parent company International Airlines Group’s proposed joint business with LATAM. This would see the companies, both part of the Oneworld alliance, being able to coordinate schedules and share revenues – as long as the arrangement is given clearance by competition authorities. LATAM has also signed a similar deal with American Airlines. One part of Latin America where the prospects are even gloomier than in Brazil is Venezuela, which has seen its economy take a savage hit from the collapse in the price of oil in the past couple of years. Venezuela has also been incurring the wrath of airlines by refusing to let them take their money out of the country – the Venezuelan government is currently blocking the repatriation of $3.8 billion in revenue owed to 24 airlines, according to IATA. US-based airlines have been reducing their flights to Caracas due to this impasse and the weakening Venezuelan economy. American Airlines, for example, stopped its New York-Caracas flights in April having only revived the route a few months earlier, although the carrier still flies from Miami to Caracas. LATAM, Aeromexico and Lufthansa are among the airlines to have ended services to Venezuela earlier this year, blaming weak demand. If the fortunes of South America could be divided roughly into east and west by the Andes mountain range, then Mexico, Central America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean to the north is a distinctive third area of Latin America. Mexico is benefiting from the continued economic strength of the US, which should improve further with the recent implementation of an amended “open skies” agreement between the two countries. “There is optimism in Mexico and Central America – Mexico has been growing really strongly in the last two-and-a-half years,” says OAG’s Grant. “There’s a revised open skies agreement between the US and Mexico that allows more flexibility in air services. There are expansion opportunities – you have to be confident about Mexico and Central America and they should be able to grow by 5-6% per year.” Mexico’s success can be seen in the fact that Mexico City airport last year overtook São Paulo as the airport with the most available seats with an annual capacity of more than 49 million. Elsewhere, Cancún is currently Mexico’s fastest growing airport for international flights, with a rise of 15.4% in services during 2015. The country’s largest airline group, Aeromexico, has been using its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners to grow international routes – particularly to Europe and Asia. Aeromexico will add frequencies to Amsterdam, London, Madrid and Santiago in summer 2017. It will also increase flights to Shanghai by 65% next year. The biggest development in this part of Latin America is the “normalisation” of economic and diplomatic links between the US and Cuba after more than 50 years. Up to eight US-based carriers have won the “tentative” rights to fly to Havana, while six airlines have been granted permission to fly from five US cities to nine other Cuban cities. Airline passenger traffic within Latin America is set to grow by an average of 5.8% per year up to 2035, according to the latest forecast by aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The fastest growth is likely to come for travel within the region with Boeing predicting that passenger traffic within South America will increase by around 6% per year. Although some countries, notably Brazil and Venezuela, are currently going through tough economic times, longer-term trends should drive aviation growth - such as rising middle class populations, higher income levels and the continent’s strength in commodities and natural resources. Both Boeing and Airbus predict that the number of commercial aircraft in service in the region will have to more than double in the next two decades from the current level of 1,550 aircraft to more than 3,600 by 2035. Rafael Alonso, president of Airbus for Latin American and the Caribbean, added: “Latin America’s long-haul route expansion is imminent and we are already seeing airlines respond by opting for larger, longer-range and more efficient aircraft such as the A350 XWB and the A380, which both began operating in the region in 2016. We are also seeing the region’s top airlines modernising their fleets with the A320neo family, allowing them to achieve efficiency gains even in a less-than-favourable economic environment.” LATAM has been leading the way in bringing these new types of aircraft to the continent. South America’s biggest carrier is set to start operating the first Airbus A320neo in Brazil soon. It also began operating its first Airbus A350 XWB aircraft earlier in 2016, which is now operating from São Paulo to Miami and Orlando, as well as Madrid. The biggest challenge may not be acquiring the necessary aircraft but finding solutions for the capacity constraints at key airports in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Peru, as passenger numbers are set to double to a predicted 525 million by the middle of the 2030s. Ask what is holding back aviation around Latin America and there are some very clear unanimous answers: high levels of taxation, inadequate government investment in airport infrastructure and excessive bureaucracy. International Airline Transport Association (IATA) has identified 130 different ticket taxes that are being applied across the region, including the Caribbean, and has called on governments to cut this tax burden, which is “undermining the region’s prospects for connectivity growth”. Peter Cerda, IATA regional VP for the Americas, says: “Most of the region’s countries, with the exception of Panama and Chile, have not created the conditions for air transport to flourish. Onerous regulations, which are out of sync with global standards, coupled with excessive taxes, charges and fuel policies that are misaligned with global best practices are commonplace across the region.” The Venezuelan government’s decision to hold on to $3.8 billion of foreign airlines’ money does not help improve the continent’s image, although this is an extreme example. Bureaucracy has also held back the growth of low-cost carriers in some parts of the region. This has been the case in Argentina where the government has imposed pricing limits on airline tickets since 2002. However, this policy is starting to change, which could open the door to low-cost carriers entering the Argentinean market in the near future. There are other positive signs that attitudes are shifting around Latin America, such as the Colombian government’s decision to slash airport fees at Cartagena from $92 to $38 for international flights last year. This move helped boost international passenger traffic by 32% in a year. Eduardo Iglesias, executive director of the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association, has called on governments to work together to help the aviation sector to grow more effectively. “Governments must agree on common global rules to secure a sustained growth of air transport in the region while preserving its competitiveness in relation to the rest of the world,” he says. Air traffic may be growing in the region but the industry is still being “hampered by fragmented airspace, varying standards and protocols, and not enough sharing of data between states”, according to the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO).

The series of panels honors the original 28,000 families and corporations that purchased 53,000 seats in the old Trans World Dome to bring the Rams to St. Louis in 1995. A federal judge has ruled that the Los Angeles Rams must provide season tickets or refunds on deposits for the St. Louis PSLs. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com It seems like only yesterday that thousands of otherwise sensible St. Louisans were applying for the chance to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars just to have the right to spend more hundreds or thousands of dollars to watch the St. Louis Rams play football. In fact, as a federal district court reminded us last week, it was 21 years ago. An entire generation of children has grown to adulthood, grown facial hair and gotten tattoos since the mad scramble for “personal seat licenses” in January 1995. It seemed like a rip-off then, and sure enough, it was. U.S. District Court Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Jr. ruled last week that everyone who got one of the original PSLs to watch the Rams play football in St. Louis might be entitled to some sort of refund someday, but they’re not entitled to buy (and presumably, resell at a premium) tickets to watch them play in Los Angeles. It was just another football-related disappointment in a city that should be used to them by now. Given everything that’s happened since, it’s weird to recall how St. Louis lost its collective mind in 1995. Things were kind of desperate. We’d been through the Great Flood of 1993. McDonnell Douglas was being stalked by Boeing. The NFL had abandoned St. Louis in 1987. The Cardinals were on an austerity kick and Major League Baseball players were on strike. But against all odds, the Missouri Legislature had ponied up half the cost of a new, built-on-spec domed stadium downtown. When St. Louis failed to get an NFL expansion team in 1993, it needed an NFL tenant in the worst sort of way. That’s exactly the way we got the Rams. The late Jerry Clinton, the beer wholesaler who’d gotten the stadium off the ground, had been shoved aside by local bigshots who deemed him insufficiently rich. They formed FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium) and began trailing their coat in Los Angeles. They needed a really rich guy to show the NFL, so they signed up a Columbia, Mo., real estate tycoon named Stan Kroenke. Due diligence was in short supply. FANS Inc. had negotiated one of the worst leases in the history of sports. Kroenke spotted the hole in it right away, the part that gave the team permission to move after 20 years if the stadium wasn’t up to the league’s top standards. He bought a minority stake in the Rams that included first right of refusal for the rest. And then he bade his time, because 20 years is nothing to a real estate man. FANS Inc. set about selling PSLs to raise the money it had promised the Rams if they’d move to St. Louis. PSLs were a new concept then. They’d been brought to the NFL a couple of years earlier by Max Muhleman, a Charlotte, N.C., marketing executive. They were used to help finance a stadium for the expansion Carolina Panthers. The NFL loved it — a new way to get richer by using other people’s money. PSLs were an easier sell than taxpayer financing because they were like user fees: Only the people who actually went to the games had to pay. Of course most new stadiums these days, including the new Busch Stadium in St. Louis, are built with taxpayer money and PSL money, too. In early 1995, FANS Inc. put 46,000 PSLs up for sale and got applications for 73,710. About 53,000 eventually were sold. Most of them were for the cheaper, upper-bowl seats in what would soon become the TWA Dome. But others were for the $4,500 lower-bowl seats. In St. Louis, we’re easy. Most of the money went to the Rams, in one form or another. Part of it paid for Rams Park, the now empty practice facility in Earth City. The lease gives the Rams the option to buy that property for $1 in 2024. If anyone thinks Stan Kroenke won’t try to exercise that option, he hasn’t been paying attention. Even before the Rams’ lease on the stadium, now Edward Jones Dome, hit its 20-year reopener clause, Kroenke was buying property in Inglewood, Calif. It was going to be a Walmart. Sure it was. Meanwhile, as the Rams endured one losing season after another, the bottom fell out of the PSL resale market. The Rams had been selling their own PSLs, creating two classes of PSLs, the original FANS Inc. ones and those sold by the team itself. It turns out the FANS Inc. PSLs have a termination clause in the event the team relocates. The Rams-sold version doesn’t. The judge ruled that fans with the Rams-sold PSLs might be able to apply them in Los Angeles, depriving Kroenke of a few thousand dollars. We can only hope so.

(AFP) UNITED NATIONS, Sept 23, (AP): Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday joined in opposing a call by US Secretary of State John Kerry to halt all flights over Syria in efforts to get relief shipments through, saying that would only help Islamic radicals gain ground. Rouhani also alleged Washington was sowing fear among financial institutions wanting to do business with his country as part of the sanctions relief due Tehran under a deal with six powers in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. He spoke on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly a day after the US government gave aviation giants Airbus and Boeing Co the go-ahead to sell aircraft to Iran as part of the landmark deals under the nuclear pact potentially worth some $50 billion. The outgoing administration of President Barack Obama is keen to show that it is honoring the economic terms of the nuclear pact. But Rouhani said permission should have been granted months earlier under terms of the nuclear pact and criticized the “severe delay.” Coming during heated Security Council debate Tuesday, Kerry’s proposal to halt all flights was met with disagreement both in Moscow and even in Washington. Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress any grounding of war planes should exclude American aircraft, and Russia’s deputy foreign minister said grounding flights would make matters worse, a view echoed Thursday by Rouhani. Kerry called for a stop to all flights after an airstrike on a humanitarian aid convoy this week that killed 20 civilians. But Rouhani suggested air strikes remain the best way of attack on Islamic radicals. “If you ground flights,” he said, “you are aiding the terrorists whether you like it or not because the terrorists … are well equipped except for an air force.” Iran strongly backs Assad’s government and Rouhani said the first priority now should be getting aid to those in need. The second must be a continued focus “on the fight against terrorism,” and the third should be “to pave the proper path” to elections including all groups and political parties in Syria, he said Iran complains that international financial sanctions are not being lifted quickly enough under the agreement that stipulates a removal of these and other penalties imposed over Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for Tehran’s agreement to curb atomic activities that could be used to make a bomb. Tehran says America is to blame, a theme Rouhani sounded both in an earlier speech to the General Assembly and in his comments to reporters.

Ever dream of commanding a gondola? The Venetian Las Vegas Gondola University offers instruction to up to nine participants per day that begins with a history of Venice followed by gondola fundamentals. Learn “Rowing 101” and the hands-on experience of rowing a vessel. At the end there is a ritual ceremony when you receive your official “Sash and Scarf,” Participants also receive a gondola hat and T-shirt, a souvenir photo and a certificate. Daily sessions are between 8 and 10 a.m. Enrollment begins 72 hours in advance by calling (702) 807-3982. The next time we are in Vegas we plan to see the Mob Museum (themobmuseum.org) and learn more about the history of organized crime and law enforcement in Southern Nevada. I’m one of those who like hearing rumors about anything or any person. Before you whisper in my better right ear, make darn sure I’ve used a Q-tip. Between the Army and my former employer, I need a seeing-eye dog that can read lips and use a computer. According to the American Legion the total cost of military operations targeting ISIS is $7 billion. Average daily cost of military operations targeting ISIS is $11.6 million. Although Theodorsia and I just returned from a seven-week vacation, we are planning to drive up to Monterrey for the Jazz Festival. We were there last year and had a wonderful time. Perhaps we just might go to Everett, Washington and tour the Boeing plant and the largest building in the world. It’s big enough to fit Disneyland into it with 13 acres to spare; also, the 90-minute tour will allow visitors to see 30,000 employees assembling millions of parts and miles of wiring into various commercial jet liners. Have you read about Culver City in the August 2016 issue of Sunset Magazine? Check out page 26. Wasn’t it a nice article? Amy Presier wrote, “Thanks to the new light-rail line, you and your surfboard or Schwinn can venture from Culver City to the beach without a single traffic jam.” Please correct me if I am mistaken but didn’t Alan Corlin, Scott Malsin and Jeff Cooper try to stop the light rail before it came to Culver City? After reviewing an article from last month’s Atlanta Journal Constitution, we saw how the non-partisan think tank, the Tax Foundation, rated each state by using Bureau of Economic Analysis data on average prices on various goods and services, including rental costs (taxfoundation.org/blog). More bang for your $100 – Low cost states: 1. Mississippi $115.34 2. Arkansas $114.29 3. Alabama $113.90 4. South Dakota $113.64 5. West Virginia $112.49 What $100 is worth in high cost states: 47. California $88.97 48. New Jersey $87.34 49. New York $86.43 50. Hawaii $85.62 51. Washington D.C. $84.67 Are you also a Smokey Robinson fan? If you are, on October 15 at the SABAN Theatre in Beverly Hills, the man who started Motown will appear. Call (323) 655-0111 or visit Sabantheatre.org. The next time we travel on vacation to Virginia, Theodorsia and I plan to tour President John Tyler’s Sherwood Forest plantation home near Charles City, located between Richmond and Williamsburg. Call (804) 829-5377, tours by appointment. Would you be one of those Americans who would give up their citizenship to become Swiss? Here are just five ways one could be denied citizenship to be Swiss: 1. Refusing to shake a teacher’s hand 2. Refusing to take compulsory swimming lessons 3. Wearing sweat pants in town 4. Refusing to greet passersby 5. Failing to name any Swiss friends or neighboring communities The question for August poised to Costco Club members was, “Should homework be eliminated in elementary school?” Fifty-eight percent said yes, while forty-two percent said no. El Rodeo elementary school, a part of the Beverly Hills Unified School District, announced every student would receive a laptop computer. First graders as well as second graders and kindergarteners get one iPod; while third graders through eighth graders would get Google Chromebooks. As part of the agreement the school will be leasing the laptops via three-year contracts. For those living near Atlantic Avenue in North Long Beach you probably witnessed the grand opening of the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library earlier this month. The library has 24,500 square feet, Wi-Fi throughout, and self-checkout/check-in kiosks. It has three accessible meeting rooms available even when the library is closed and much, much, more. Call (562) 628-2441 or visit LBPLfoundation.org. The average student debt upon graduation is $28,960 but a little help may be on the way. HR 5622 Aguilar D-San Bernardino gives borrowers an option of a one-year grace period. Interest would still continue. I didn’t realize student loan debt exceeds credit card debt and auto loan debt, and is second only to mortgage debt. Have you heard anything about the drought here in California recently? I haven’t either. Has anyone seen a good guy named Vernon Taylor who ran for the Culver City Board of Education? I sure would like to take him out to lunch.

but the service would also face a big challenge in maintaining a complex inventory of eight different types of fighter aircraft. The IAF currently flies MiG-21, MiG-27, MiG-29, Su-30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage fighter jets as well as the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft. The French origin Rafale adds another platform to the inventory, making the maintenance job far more complicated for the IAF technical hands. Successive IAF chiefs had warned the government against multiplicity of the inventory for the sake of better economics and performance. “Multiplicity of platforms is a nightmare. If it were up to me, I would have a single aircraft type. But we don’t live in a perfect world,” former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal P V Naik had stated in the past.  In addition, the IAF also flies several other types of transport and surveillance aircraft including C-17, C-130J, IL-76, IL-78, AN-32, Dornier and Boeing 737 and Embraer jets for VVIP flights. There are Hawk and Pilatus trainers and helicopters too. The inventory problem, however, is unlikely to fade away in future with several aviation majors including Boeing and Lockheed Martin from the US and Saab Gripen and Dassault Aviation offering to manufacture their fighter jets in India if there is an assured order from the IAF. “It is 36 at the moment. We feel that we can create a strong industrial partnership in India. We know very well the large number of aircraft that the IAF needs,” Dassault CEO Eric Trappier said in an interview soon after India signed an agreement with France to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets. The aviation firms sense an opportunity because of the dwindling numbers of fighter aircraft. IAF has sanctions for 42 squadrons, but current strength is only 33 squadrons which includes obsolete versions of MiG variants. More than 15 years ago, the IAF mooted a proposal to purchase 126 fighter jets anticipating the gap. After almost 10 years of tendering, trial, evaluation and negotiation process, the government scrapped that plan and decided to buy only 36 platforms. The government is yet to decide from where the remaining numbers would come. Go to Top Tweet Videos India's rural millions pay price of cash... Trial of IAF fighter jets to touch... J.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Find Company: 23abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Rafale deal will bring good business for us: Samtel chief Nayanima Basu   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet PUNEET KAURA, MD and CEO, Samtel Avionics Defence MSME major Samtel Avionics is betting big on the Indian market even as the Indian defence industry is poised for a quantum leap, says Puneet Kaura, MD and CEO, Samtel Avionics. The Samtel Avionics, which has a joint venture with Thales, is exploring various options to meet the offset obligations of Dassault Aviation that manufactures Rafale jets. In an interview with BusinessLine, he said procurement of the French Rafale fighter jets will bring big business for the firm. Excerpts: Now that the $8-billion Rafale deal is in place, what benefit does it bring to you? We have the same aim for Rafale that is similar to our Mirage upgrade experience. In Rafale, we are looking at supplying infra red search and track system, some work on the electronic warfare suite, we are also looking at avionics, including computers and displays. This was also our original plan when the MMRCA (medium multi-role combat aircraft) was in discussions. I don’t see any reason why it should change. But the procurement of these jets will be done in flyaway condition. How will this benefit you? Rafale will bring big business to the Indian market. They need offsets and this will stretch beyond 2018-19, which is the time required to set up and start manufacturing things like this. There will still be a pipeline of 130-140 more planes to be made for the global market. And plus, let’s say India buys two more squadrons then it comes back to 167-170 planes. And then, they can always use the last leg, the last 6-10 aircraft they can still use even if the timeline is short for manufacturing from India. Does the scaling down of the project from 126 jets to 36 impact you? See we are starting somewhere at least. It has been 15 years that this discussion is going on. We have to look at the reality. The initial plan was too ambitious. Of late biggies such as Lockheed Martin, SAAB and Boeing all have expressed their intention to set up their assembly lines here. What kind of opportunities does that bring for MSMEs like you? We are working with all consortium partners. We are already engaged with many of them as supplier. So these will augment our business. We are engaged with a lot of American, Russian, European and Israeli companies. Tell us about your Mirage 2000 upgrade experience? This was a good experience. We were able to set up a world-class production line similar to what they have in France, transferred the technology and manufactured about 21-22 ship sets. Now we are looking at all the other Mirages that are coming up that will be using this facility for this product for global supply chain. Then there are whole lot of indirect offsets that we are planning to do. We are looking at developing global supply chains for locally designed, developed products. The product lines for those are under discussions right now. This is what we call ‘Go Global.’ For MSMEs like you won’t Make-II be more beneficial where the projects are fully funded? This is definitely more beneficial. Once the product is developed it is easier for the government to invest. Make-II gives more confidence to the supplier that the customer will buy because it will be based on a contract with a timeline. What is your opinion on how the Strategic Partnerships chapter is shaping up? The government is yet to finalise it and it seems the big firms are opposed to having only one SP in one segment? See part of the problem is that every category there is a PSU that exists. I do not think we have the market for two SPs. It is not an easy task. Let’s see how it unfolds. But they are first looking at fighters to start with the SPs because there is a huge gap there. So let us see how it goes. Now that you have gained a deep foothold in the market, are you planning to expand your portfolio? In the electronic space, we are already looking at avionics that includes cockpit avionics and electronics that go into back-end of the aircraft. We are looking at sensor suites, high-end sensors, so we are looking at multiple product lines. Then there is vehicle electronics such as armoured vehicles and tanks. Still there is huge shortage of players in electronic space and then there is huge demand also for electronics. Are there any plans to expand production units? We have three production units. These are independent to each other. Instead of going for JVs, we are now looking for joint working groups by either through ToT and giving royalty to foreign OEMs or joint manufacturing without equity infusion.

Profit taking may weigh on the markets, as traders cash in on the recent gains. Trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, with a lack of major U.S. economic data keeping some traders on the sidelines. U.S. stocks advanced for the third straight session on Thursday amid the release of some domestic economic data, an extension of the commodity rally and a lingering positive reaction to Wednesday's Fed decision. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways in a broad range. Although there was a loss of momentum in late afternoon trading, renewed buying lifted the averages yet again, leading to a positive close. The Dow Industrials added 98.76 points or 0.54 percent before ending at 18,393, the S&P 500 Index closed 14.06 points or 0.65 percent higher at 2,177 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at a new record closing high of 5,340, up 44.34 points or 0.84 percent. Twenty-eight of the thirty Dow components ended the session higher, while only two stocks declined. Procter & Gamble (PG), Disney (DIS), United Technologies (UTX), Coca-Cola (KO), Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Apple (AAPL) and Verizon (VZ) were among the biggest gainers of the session. Among the sectors, housing and oil service stocks advanced notably, but gold stocks gave back some ground. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims fell to 252,000 in the week ended September 17th from 260,000 in the previous week. Economists had expected an uptick in claims to 262,000. The four-week average fell to 258,500 from 260,750. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag were down 36,000 to 2.113 million. A report released by the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million units in August, down from the downwardly revised 5.38 million-unit rate for July. Economists expected sales to have come in at a 5.44 million unit-rate compared to the 5.39 million-unit rate initially reported for July. Single-family home sales fell 2.3 percent, but condominium sales jumped 10.5 percent. Existing home inventories measured in absolute terms fell to 2.04 million units from 2.11 million units, with the months of supply at 4.6 months. The median price of an existing home fell 1.3 percent month-over-month to $240,200, rendering the annual rate to 5.1 percent. The Federal Housing Finance Agency said its house price index climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent month-over-month in July, ahead of the 0.4 percent growth expected by economists. The annual rate of growth accelerated to 5.8 percent from a revised 5.7 percent. The Conference Board reported that its leading economic indicators fell 0.2 percent month-over-month in August, while economists expected a 0.1 percent increase. The July growth was upwardly revised to 0.5 percent from 0.4 percent. Six of the 10 components making up the index served as drags, while the interest rate spread continued to positively influence the index. The Chicago Federal Reserve's national activity index unexpectedly fell to -0.55 in August from 0.24 in July, suggesting a contraction in activity. Meanwhile, the Kansas City Federal Reserve's regional manufacturing index improved to 6 in September from -4 in August. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are slipping $0.11 to $46.21 barrel after climbing $0.98 to $46.32 a barrel on Thursday, marking the fourth straight session of gains that lifted futures to the highest level since September 8th. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,343.80 an ounce, down $0.90 from the previous session's close of $1,344.70 an ounce. On Thursday, gold rallied $13.30. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 100.79 yen compared to the 100.76 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1220 compared to yesterday's $1.1208. Asia The major Asian markets went about in a lackluster manner before ending mixed as the central-bank induced din died down. The Japanese, Chinese, Shanghai, Hang Seng and Indian markets ended lower, while the rest of the markets posted gains. With the yen remaining close to its recent lows, the Japanese market experienced some profit taking, as it re-opened after yesterday's public holiday. The Nikkei 225 Index languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 53.60 points or 0.32 percent at 16,754. Retail, export, financial, real estate, telecom and chemical stocks moved to the downside. However, housing, refining, utility and pharma stocks ended mostly higher. Food stocks saw mixed sentiment. Australia's All Ordinaries Index rose steadily after showing tentativeness in early trading. The index closed 52.30 points or 0.96 percent higher at a 3-week high of 5,519, rising for the fourth straight session. The market witnessed an across-the-board rally, with telecom, real estate and healthcare stocks among the standout performers. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 23,687, down 73.32 points or 0.31 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 8.42 points or 0.28 percent lower at 3,034. On the economic front, provisional results released by Markit showed that the Japanese manufacturing sector returned to expansion, with a PMI score of 49.2 in September compared to 49.5 in August. Meanwhile, all industry activity grew at a slower pace in July, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The all industry activity index rose 0.3 percent month-over-month in July following June's 1 percent increase. Nonetheless, this was the second consecutive increase in activity and better than the expected 0.2 percent growth. Europe European stocks are seeing weakness on profit taking after gains in recent sessions, with oil's weakness and weak private sector activity data weighing on stocks. On the economic front, the eurozone private sector grew at the slowest pace in 20 months in September, flash data from Markit showed. The flash composite output index slid to 52.6 in September from 52.9 in August. Economists had expected the reading to fall marginally to 52.8. The factory PMI improved to 52.6 from 51.7 in August, while it was expected to fall to 51.5. Meanwhile, the services PMI dropped to 52.1 from 52.8 in the prior month. This was the lowest in 21 months. The index was forecast to remain unchanged at 52.8. French statistical office INSEE downwardly revised its second quarter GDP estimate for France to show a 0.1% drop following a 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter. The preliminary estimate showed no growth for the second quarter. U.S. Economic Reports Markit is set to release its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI for September at 9:45 am ET. Economists expect the index to edge down to 52 from 52.1 in August. Philadelphia's Patrick Harker will deliver prepared remarks about the role of Fed in the community in Philadelphia at 12 pm ET.

Stocks in Focus Athletic footwear and apparel retailer Finish Line (FINL) is moving higher in pre-market trading after reporting second quarter earnings that met analyst estimates on better than expected sales. Novatel Wireless (MIFI) may also see early strength after announcing an agreement to sell its mobile broadband business to Hong Kong-based T.C.L. Industries Holdings for $50 million. Meanwhile, shares of Facebook (FB) may move to the downside after a report from the Wall Street Journal said the social media giant overestimated average viewing time for its video ads for two years. AAR Corp. (AIR) reported better than expected first quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations and revenues.

Building the Space Launch System's core stage by Staff Writers New Orleans LA (SPX) Sep 22, 2016 Engineers just completed welding the liquid hydrogen tank that will provide fuel for the first SLS flight in 2018. The tank measures more than 130 feet tall, comprises almost two-thirds of the core stage and holds 537,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen -- which is cooled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit.

The largest rocket stage in the world is coming together piece by piece at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. Large elements for NASA's Space Launch System are in production and will be joined together to create the rocket's 212-foot-tall core stage, the backbone of the SLS rocket. Why is NASA building the world's most powerful rocket? Because SLS is ready to support both near-term missions in the proving ground around the moon starting in 2018, while at the same time being capable of carrying the very large hardware like landers, habitats and other supplies and equipment needed to explore Mars and other deep space destinations in the 2030s and beyond. To power a Mars rocket, the core stage carries around 2.3 million pounds of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to fuel the four RS-25 engines. Engineers just completed welding the largest part of the core stage, the 130-foot-tall liquid hydrogen tank that will provide fuel for the first SLS flight in 2018, but there's still work to ready the tank for its maiden voyage. "Building the core stage is similar to building a house," said Joan Funk, SLS core stage lead at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. "With the massive, welded elements coming off the Vertical Assembly Center at Michoud, we've laid the foundation, framed the walls and put up the roof. The big items are in place. Now it's time to get to work on the inside." That's where engineers will clean and prime each element before beginning the internal integration. Michoud's Vertical Assembly Center, the largest spacecraft-welding tool in the world, is welding many of the core stage's main elements - the forward skirt, the liquid oxygen tank, the liquid hydrogen tank and the engine section. The core stage's fifth element, the intertank, which is bolted, is also being built at Michoud. The Boeing Company, headquartered in Chicago, is the prime contractor building the core stage, but to build the stage, Boeing has worked with 442 businesses across America, including 297 small businesses. "When welding is complete, these structures still have to go through more processing to turn them into functional parts of the rocket," said Funk. "The core stage has parts with very different functions from housing the flight computer and primary avionics to holding the fuel to supporting the four RS-25 engines." The final manufacturing processes and outfitting for each part of the core stage varies with the section's function. Wet structures - elements that hold fuel, or the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen tanks - are put through "proof tests" to assure manufacturing quality. The liquid oxygen tank is hydrostatically tested and filled with water; and the liquid hydrogen tank is pneumatically tested. After testing, the tanks and dry structures - elements that don't hold fuel, or the forward skirt, intertank and engine section - are cleaned, primed and readied for the "work on the inside." Much like a house being constructed, the core stage is outfitted with wiring, plumbing and insulation. The dry structures house flight computers, cameras and avionics - or the "brains" of the rocket. In a house, wiring can carry power or television and internet data from room to room. In the SLS's core stage, 45 miles of wire cabling serves a similar purpose, carrying power and data from element to element powering flight computers, cameras, sensors, avionics and other electronics housed in the dry structures. The core stage's plumbing contains lines that deliver the propellant and oxidizer from the tanks to the engines. Each dry structure also contains purge vent lines and hazardous gas lines designed to eliminate dangerous gases building up in the dry structures prior to launch. "The dry structures are cram-packed full of equipment and the domes of the tanks take up a lot of the room inside the dry structures," said Funk. Racks, cameras, sensors, vent lines, wire cabling, valves, shelves, couplings, and more fill the core stage's dry structures to near capacity. With every inch planned, equipment is mounted and wiring is placed methodically, accounting for time, space, accessibility and much more. When the dry structures are ready to be "stacked," or joined to the other elements, there isn't much room to spare. Before the elements can be stacked, insulation - which is more important to a rocket than to a house - is applied. Not only does NASA's thermal protection system give the rocket its signature orange color, but more importantly, it protects the core stage from the extreme temperatures encountered during launch and maintains the fuels' extremely low temperatures. The liquid hydrogen is chilled to minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit and the liquid oxygen is chilled to minus 297 degrees. How do those elements finally come together to form the 212-foot-long core stage? With the initial wiring, plumbing and insulation complete, the elements are divided into two sections for stacking. Each section is stacked vertically, with elements bolted to one another using segmented support rings welded to each element, providing stiffness. The liquid hydrogen tank sits atop the engine section to create the aft section, and the forward skirt and intertank are bolted to the top and bottom of the liquid oxygen tank to create the forward section. When complete, engineers "break over" the sections, or move them to a horizontal position, for their final assembly. Final wiring, plumbing and insulation are installed after the forward section is joined to the aft to complete the core stage assembly. Before punching its ticket to launch, the core stage will travel by barge to NASA's Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, where it will undergo a free modal test to understand the structure then be mounted in the recently renovated B-2 Test Stand for propellant fill and drain testing and hot fire testing called a "green run." A green run, or the first time the engines are assembled into a single configuration with the core stage and fired at nearly full-power, tests the compatibility and functionality of the system to ensure a safe and viable design. Once post-test assessments and adjustments are complete, the core stage will travel again by barge to NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, for its first flight with Orion.

There was another night of rioting in Charlotte, North Carolina. This time the city’s business district was targeted. Apparently the mob heard the demand of Nation of Islam leader B. J. Murphy for an economic boycott of the city. Here are some observations after a second day of anarchy in Charlotte. First, where is President Obama? For nearly eight years, he has commented on virtually everything from pop culture and sports. But when Charlotte is being trashed by rioters, the president can’t seem to find a camera or microphone. Ninety-three percent of black Americans voted for him. Presumably he has some influence. He is a constitutional law lecturer. This is an excellent time for him to remind the rioters that everybody — not just accused Muslim extremists, but even police officers — has a right to due process. There is a report, courtesy of White House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett, that Obama addressed the rioting in a call to the mayor of Charlotte. Obama told her that “any protests should be conducted in a peaceful manner and that local law enforcement should find ways to calmly and productively engage those protesting.” The mayor has no ability to make the protestors be peaceful. And how do police officers “calmly” engage with rioters? That phone call had one purpose — to tell the mayor to make sure the police were not assertive in restoring order. The result, sadly, was obvious. If you watched video from the streets of Charlotte last night, the response to the rioting was pitiful. The police were vastly outnumbered and were under orders to keep their distance from the rioting. The mob controlled the streets. Multiple stores and business were ransacked. One man was viciously beaten in a parking garage. Reporters covering the riots were attacked. In one instance, rioters attempted to throw a photographer into a fire. One man was shot during the violence and is reportedly on life support. Late last night, Governor Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency and called out the National Guard. Second, journalists need a refresher course on the plain meaning of English words. Breaking windows, stealing cigarettes, Red Bull and drugs, attacking journalists and other innocent bystanders is not a protest. That is a riot. It has no relationship whatsoever to a black police officer shooting an armed black man. But most media continued to refer to the violence as “protests.” Finally, I want to review some statistics. There is little evidence to support the left-wing narrative that there is a widespread problem in American law enforcement of black men being killed by racist white cops. For example: More whites are shot every year by police than blacks. The Washington Post reports today, “Law enforcement officials have fatally shot 706 people this year, 163 of them black men.” That means just 23% of fatal police shootings involved black men and the vast majority of those shootings were justified. (See below.) A Harvard study found that there was zero racial bias by police in the use of deadly force. The black economics professor who conducted the study said, “It is the most surprising result of my career.” The New York Times conceded, “The result contradicts the image of police shootings that many Americans hold.” But they have that image because of media bias. According to data from the Department of Justice, and confirmed by a study conducted by a University of Pennsylvania criminologist, black police officers were 3.3 times more likely to use deadly force at a crime scene than were other officers. According to Heather Mac Donald, a research fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black criminal than a black citizen is to be shot by a police officer. The Washington Post conducted a massive study of police shootings last year and concluded: “But only a small number of the shootings — roughly 5 percent — occurred under the kind of circumstances that raise doubt and draw public outcry… The vast majority of individuals shot and killed by police officers were … armed with guns and killed after attacking police officers or civilians or making other direct threats.” Trump/Cruz Detente? Like Jimmy Carter’s surrender of the Panama Canal, Barack Obama is trying to surrender the Internet to unaccountable international bodies. Senator Ted Cruz is leading the fight to stop Obama and yesterday Donald Trump endorsed the senator’s efforts. Cruz later tweeted his appreciation of Trump’s involvement in the battle, which got the Washington rumor mill buzzing about the possibility of a truce between the two men, perhaps even a Cruz endorsement. My personal opinion is that if Senator Cruz buried the hatchet, it would help solidify Trump’s support and the campaign might not have to worry so much about states like Georgia and Texas. Do it, senator! Boeing’s Bad Bet Boeing is in the business of selling airplanes. I get that. But sometimes corporate responsibility demands more than putting profits first. Sadly, Boeing was among the companies that rushed to do business with Tehran as soon as President Obama lifted sanctions on the rogue regime. And yesterday the Obama administration formally approved the sale of 80 Boeing airliners to Iran. The deal reportedly includes a restriction “to ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use, and cannot be resold or transferred to another entity.” In other words, we don’t want Iran using the planes for military purposes. But how exactly is that going to be enforced? Iran is already using its civilian airliners for exactly this purpose, running troops and supplies into Syria on a regular basis. Obama has done everything he can to appease Iran. He lifted sanctions, sent the regime plane loads of cash and even looked the other way when it failed to comply with the terms of the nuclear deal. On a day when his failure to help African Americans (by stopping the rioting in Charlotte) is on full display, he continues doing everything he can to help Iran. What is less clear is why Boeing would bet on the Iranian regime — the world’s leading state-sponsor of terrorism — to keep its word. What Makes You Angry? We all have our pet peeves, but I have to confess — Hillary Clinton really made me angry this week. Her contrasting reactions to the New York City bombing and the Tulsa shooting were bizarre, yet very revealing. Check out my latest video contrasting Clinton’s response to these events.

The ruling comes after years of disputes between the US and the EU and focuses on $22bn of launch aid provided by the governments of France, Germany, Spain and the UK. The aid came in the form of loans at uncommercial rates to help with the development of new models of airliner.

This amount includes £340m from the British Government in 2009, when then trade secretary Lord Mandelson acted to ensure Airbus kept jobs in Broughton and Bristol. But the WTO did reject the US arguments that support from the four governments for the A350XWB amounted to illegal export subsidies. An Airbus A350-XWB of Vietnam Airlines Victory for US US trade representative Mike Froman said: “This report is a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers.

The case was brought by the US Government after lobbying by the American aerospace giant Boeing with whom Airbus has been in bitter rivalry for dominance in the multi-billion dollar global airliner market. EU response The EU said that parts of the compliance panels report were "unsatisfactory" and that it was "closely analysing" the findings. The Airbus factory at Broughton (Photo: Stacey Oliver) An EU spokesman said: "An important win for the EU is that the panel rejected new US claims that repayable support for the Airbus models A350 XWB and A380 are 'prohibited subsidies'. "The panel has also found that all previous repayable support to other aircrafts, such as the A320, had ended."

Raghotham Updated: Friday, September 23, 2016, 15:18 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News Among other missions it will fulfill, the Rafale will form the new air component of India's triad of nuclear weapons delivery. 1. India today sealed the long-pending deal to buy 36 Rafale multi-role combat jets with the French government. It signals the end of a long and tortuous procurement process that was first initiated 17 years ago in 1999. But it's also the beginning of yet another three-year-long wait before the Indian Air Force gets the first Rafale aircraft. 2. In 1999, former air chief A.Y. Tipnis proposed that India buy a new lot of Mirage 2000s from France as the Russian MiG-21s would soon have to be retired and India's fighter strength would deplete. The IAF was happy with the Mirage fighters that it had bought from France in the late 1980s, which performed well during the Kargil conflict, too. IAF pilots stand in front of a Mirage 2000 aircraft during the Kargil war in 1999 3. In 2001, however, Tipnis' successor S. Krishnaswamy proposed that given India's growing status as a regional power as well as its expanding economic interests, India should rather buy a more capable aircraft. What was until then a plan to buy a multi-role combat aircraft became a global tender for a medium, multi-role combat aircraft, meaning India was opening up the bid to both single-engine and twin-engine aircraft. A request for proposal was floated six years later in 2007. A USAF F-16C over Iraq in 2008 4. Six companies bid for what was then billed as the 'mother of all defence deals' -- after all, India wanted 126 fighters, the largest such deal on offer anywhere in the world at the time, and had earmarked some $10 billion for them. A U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet sits tied-down on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the North Arabian Sea in 2009 [In Pics: Signing of Rafale Fighter Jets deal] 5. America's Lockheed Martin offered the single-engine F-16 fighters, and Boeing the twin-engine F/A-18; Russia's MiG Corporation offered the MiG-35; Sweden's SAAB proposed the single-engine JAS-39 Gripen fighter; the four-nation European consortium (Britain-Germany-Spain-Italy) Eurofighter offered the Typhoon jets; and France's Dassault initially offered the Mirage-2000 and later the Rafale jets. A MiG-35 flies over Moscow 6. After extensive field trials over plains, deserts and over the Himalayas, the IAF shortlisted the Rafale and the Typhoon, taking into account their commercial bids, too. The JAS 39 Gripen is powered by variants of the GE F-404 and F-414 engines. The former powers India's Tejas, too. And the latter would have powered the now-shelved Tejas Mk-II 7. Both the Rafale and the Typhoon began their development journey in the early 1980s. In fact, initially, Eurofighter and Dassault had tried to join hands to develop a single combat aircraft for Europe. But the French withdrew and decided to build their own aircraft after differences cropped up over what kind of an aircraft they wanted to develop. The Eurofighter was keen on a bomber, the French were keen on an aircraft that would be good at air-to-air combat, a fighter. Eventually, though, as defence budgets shrunk through the late 1980s and the 1990s, combat jets had to become multi-role aircraft, capable of both air-to-air and air-to-land combat. 8. Eventually, India named Dassault as the preferred bidder in 2011. A USAF KC-135 refuels a Rafale jet during a French mission in Mali) (Source: YouTube. Video shot by SSgt David Clark. 9. When negotiations started, however, a number of issues came up that prolonged the procurement process right up to 2015. India insisted on assembling 108 of the 126 aircraft in India, demanded significant technology transfer and 50 percent direct offsets, that is, ploughing back 50 percent of the project value into India in the form of joint ventures and new factories in India that would produce components and sub-systems for the aircraft, thus building up India's aerospace industrial capabilities. 10. The French, meanwhile, allegedly had quoted a low figure to win the tender, but then started to jack up the price, a move complicated by the Rupee's devaluation between 2011 and 2013 and by the fact that India was for the first time trying to do life-cycle costing for a defence deal, at which the MoD had no prior experience. 11. The deal with Dassault completely fell through when it became known that the total value of the deal would be of the order of $25-30 billion. 12. But the IAF desperately needs new aircraft to fill its diminishing fighter squadron strength. With this is mind, the Narendra Modi government decided to shelve the tender process altogether and go in for a government-to-government deal with the French, and to buy a much smaller number -- 36 Rafale jets, or two squadrons of 18 jets each -- all to be built in France, and the first Rafale to be delivered in 2019. 13. Yet another year of negotiations took place before the two governments agreed on a price. France started by quoting 12 billion Euros for the 36, but has eventually come down to 7.87 billion euros. In sheer value, it's still a 787-sized (pardon the pun) deal, boeing...oops...going the French way!

Highlights: -- Rovsing achieved a growth in revenue of 36 % from DKK 19.6 m in 2014/15 to DKK 26.6 m in 2015/16. -- EBITDA was improved by DKK 1.2 m from DKK -3.3 m in 2014/15 to DKK -2.1 m in 2015/16. The result is negatively impacted by non-recurrent costs related to the bankruptcy of SSBV Space & Ground B.V and by the start of production of the newly developed SAS product. -- Revenue and EBITDA is accordance with earlier announced guidelines of revenue in the interval of DKK 24-28 m and EBIDTA in the interval of DKK -3 to 0 m. -- The profit for the year of DKK -11 m is impacted by an extraordinary write down of intangible assets of DKK 8.7 m. The write down relates to DSTE IPRs, which has been acquired earlier from SSBV Space & Ground B.V. -- In January 2016, Rovsing signed a subcontract with its US partner RT Logic concerning a test- and simulation system for Boeing Defence & Space. The subcontract has an estimated revenue of USD 1.58 m and may generate a turnover of up to USD 8 m in the years to come. The order itself is attractive and at the same time, it constitutes a decisive reference on the strategically important US market. -- Rovsing has finished the development of the Solar Array Simulator (SAS) and has received the final ESA approval. The product has been very well received in the marketplace and has already been decisive for obtaining significant orders from companies like Lockheed Martin, Airbus and Boeing. -- In December 2015, Rovsing's partner SSBV Space & Ground B.V. filed for suspension of payments and was later declared bankrupt. Subsequently SSBV's activities have been taken over by Celestia STS, with whom Rovsing has entered into an agreement concerning continuation of ongoing projects and future support when needed. Outlook for 2016/17 -- For the financial year 2016/17 revenue of DKK 32-35 m and EBITDA of DKK 0-2 m is expected.

Democrats are criticizing the latest Republican version of legislation that’s needed to avoid a government shutdown next weekend. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada told reporters that McConnell will unveil the stopgap spending bill and a long-delayed bill to combat the Zika virus on Thursday, Sept, 22, 2016, but that Democrats haven’t signed on to the measure. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Democrats in that chamber won’t back the measure, either. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File) WASHINGTON – The Senate’s top Republican on Thursday unveiled legislation to prevent a government shutdown next weekend and provide more than $1 billion to battle the Zika virus. It also would provide $500 million to help Louisiana rebuild from last month’s devastating floods. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the stopgap measure was “clean” of controversies and he left out internet-related language demanded by Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. But Democrats immediately blasted the proposal for failing to fund one of their top priorities: money to help Flint, Michigan, repair its lead-tainted water system. McConnell’s move could set up a showdown vote next week. Democrats said they would likely filibuster the measure since it omits a bipartisan plan to provide $220 million to help Flint and other cities with lead emergencies replace pipes and take other steps to clean their water. McConnell said the measure is “the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle,” noting that it would also allow stepped up spending to combat opioid abuse – a priority of several Senate Republicans up for re-election. McConnell’s bill is drawn from weeks of negotiations. Those talks, however, failed to produce an agreement as the sides wrangled over campaign finance disclosures, Flint, and an administration proposal to allow the Export-Import Bank to finance larger transactions and help overseas customers of companies like Boeing and General Electric purchase U.S. products. The internet provision was an unusual instance where the Trump campaign inserted itself directly into the nitty-gritty of legislative negotiations under way on Capitol Hill. But Trump’s intervention, in the form of a statement from a senior adviser on Wednesday, apparently carried no weight with McConnell, who left out the language Trump wanted without ever even mentioning anything about it in public. Cruz, with Trump’s backing, wanted to block the government from going ahead with a transition of the U.S. Commerce Department’s role in governing the internet’s domain name addressing systems that would transfer responsibility to a nonprofit consortium known as ICANN. Cruz said foreign governments such as China would potentially gain influence over content on the internet. Experts in the field, however, said his concerns were mostly groundless. The stopgap spending bill needs to pass to prevent the government from shutting down next Friday at midnight. Republicans control Congress and have taken the blame for previous shutdowns, such as one that shuttered the government for 16 days in 2013. But McConnell drafted the measure in hopes of making it as difficult as possible for Democrats to filibuster. For instance, it retains a top McConnell priority, to block the SEC from requiring corporations to disclose political spending permitted under the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision allowing unlimited political spending by businesses. That would extend a current ban that McConnell won last December – but that Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and other Democrats were eager to reverse. “They’re all about protecting big, dark money donors,” said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. The $1.1 billion to battle the Zika virus is long overdue and has been held up by a series of battles and setbacks. In the end, however, McConnell dropped controversial provisions that would have blocked Planned Parenthood’s affiliates in Puerto Rico from being eligible for new Zika treatment and prevention funds. He also dropped a House bill to ease Clean Water Act rules on pesticide spraying. Top Democratic negotiator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland urged further talks on the bill, which she said was a “Republican-only bill.” “We Democrats cannot vote for that substitute and urge others to vote against it,” she said on the floor. “What we want to be sure is we avoid a government shutdown and a government showdown, and continue the constructive talks that we’ve had. But the substitute offered by the Republican majority leader falls short.” Democrats supported flood aid for Louisiana but hoped to pair that money with overdue funding to help Flint clean up its water. GOP leaders in both House and Senate, however, promised that Flint funding would be handled in a separate water projects measure that would be finalized in the lame duck session. “This is a very good first step” on Louisiana flood aid,”said Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. “It can be used to help people with housing, help get people back to work, and rebuild communities.” The administration’s proposal on the Export-Import Bank was dropped. The bank will continue to be hobbled without enough board members to produce a quorum and will continue to be blocked from approving transactions exceeding $10 million.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents Bell’s Vigilant Headed for USMC | Bill Blocking Sale of Armored Vehicles to SA Fails | Dassault’s India Fighter Deal Expected Be Signed Today Sep 23, 2016 00:58 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas A fix has been found for a recently discovered issue on a number of F-35 fighters involving tubing insulation crumbling between the wing tank and fuselage tank. The USAF revealed last week that an unnamed supplier used the wrong coating for the insulation which deteriorated when it met fuel. A total of 15 USAF and Norwegian warplanes along with 42 models on the production line were affected by the issue with manufacturer Lockheed Martin fixed to cover engineering and modifications for all affected aircraft. Bell Helicopter has unveiled its V-247 Vigilant, an unmanned tilt-rotor aircraft aimed at filling a USMC need for larger armed systems, as outlined in their 2016 Marine Aviation flight plan. Dubbed the Marine Air Ground Task Force – Unmanned Expeditionary Capabilities, also known as MUX, the service’s UAV concept envisions a multi-sensor, electronic warfare, C4 and strike platform that would complement the Bell Boeing MV-22 Osprey tiltrotor and Lockheed Martin F-35B. While final details of exact requirements for MUX remain to be published, Bell believes that Vigilant will satisfy the USMC’s needs as outlined in the plan, and could make the aircraft ready for production as early as 2023. Middle East & North Africa A bill that would have blocked the sale of Abram tanks and other armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia has failed a US Senate vote, 71-27. The $1.1 billion sale has received much negative publicity amid growing concern of the Saudi’s use of Western-supplied weaponry to commit human rights abuses throughout its ongoing campaign in Yemen. Supporters of the deal claim that the Gulf kingdom is still an important US ally in a volatile region and deserving of backing. Engineers working on Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI)’s Ofek-11 reconnaissance satellite have managed to fix some of the operational issues found shortly after its launch. As a result, Ofek was able to transmit back its first set of pictures to the ground control station. While officials have called the developments encouraging, engineers are currently trying to solve the remaining problems that the satellite is experiencing. Europe Saab has stated that an anonymous client has submitted a purchase order for RBS 70 NG short-range air defense systems. Delivery of the man-portable systems is expected to take place between 2018 and 2020 at a cost of $44 million. The company’s latest variant has garnered much interest from several international clients, with Lithuania and Latvia to integrate and test the weapon for their short-range air defense needs. Self-propelled howitzers (SPH) intended for Norway will instead go to Sweden. 24 Archer (6×6) SPHs will instead be delivered to the Swedish armed forces next year, bringing Stockholm’s total inventory to 48. Both Norway and Sweden agreed to co-develop the Archer back in 2007, but Oslo backed out of the agreement in 2013. Plans for the extra howitzers will see half of the former Norwegian allocation placed in reserve while foreign buyers are sought for the remaining 12. Asia Pacific The US State Department has cleared the sale of four KC-46A aerial refueling tankers to Japan in what is estimated to be a $1.9 billion deal. All aircraft will come equipped with Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24(V) Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) system. Tokyo first announced its intention to purchase the new tankers last October, with the recent approval from the Pentagon moving it closer to becoming the aircraft’s first foreign customer for manufacturer Boeing. It may have taken a long while to get to this stage, but the Indian government is expected to sign a deal for 36 Dassault Rafale fighters today after the Cabinet Committee on Security, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared the inter-governmental agreement (IGA) with France. New Delhi had initially intended to buy 126 Rafale before several years worth of talks with Dassault broke down and Modi and Hollande stepped in last year to agree on the smaller purchase. Friday’s signing will see French defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian finalize the deal with his Indian counterpart, Manohar Parrikar, believed to be worth between $8.5 and $9 billion.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 per cent at 18,392.46, while the broad-based S&amp;P 500 gained 0.7 per cent to 2,177.18. “This is a continuation triggered by the Fed meeting,” said Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management. “Investors are quite convinced that there will be, at most, one rate hike this year and most likely in December.” Yahoo finished flat, missing the rally that lifted other technology companies, after disclosing that hackers, likely state-sponsored, penetrated its network in 2014, stealing data from some 500 million users. Dow member Boeing rose 1.0 per cent following a World Trade Organisation ruling that said the European Union had failed to end illegal subsidies for Airbus.  Boeing said that under the ruling, the United States could levy retaliatory duties against the European Union of up to US$10 billion (RM41.07 billion) a year.  The EU said that it found some of the WTO findings “to be unsatisfactory”, and noted it had the right to appeal the ruling. Drug maker Mylan rose 1.6 per cent after chief executive Heather Bresch defended the company against tough questioning in a congressional hearing on price increases of EpiPens, which are used to counter allergic reactions.

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio September 19, 2016 The newly acquired helicopter maker is tapping into Lockheed Martin’s famed advanced tech division. If you ever wondered what Lockheed Martin’s famed Skunk Works might do with a helicopter, stay tuned. Lockheed and Sikorsky had worked together on rotorcraft long before the two companies became one last year, but the helicopter maker now has access to the secretive advanced projects division behind the U-2 spy plane, SR-71 Blackbird, stealth, and more. Now Sikorsky is looking to put some of those new technologies on its current and future helicopters. “One of the areas that we’ve seen some significant opportunities is working with Skunk Works and some of the technologies that they’ve invested heavily on and matching them up with some of the technologies that we’ve invested heavily in,” Sam Mehta, president of Sikorsky’s defense systems and services division, said in an interview on Monday at the Air Force Association’s Air, Space, and Cyber conference. Even when it was part of United Technologies, Sikorsky worked closely with Lockheed on the Navy’s MH-60R Seahawk, a new Air Force rescue helicopter, and the new Marine Corps presidential helicopter.

Over the past decade, Sikorsky’s research into high-speed compound helicopters with coaxial blades produced the X2 experimental helicopter and the larger S-97 Raider. Now the company is using that technology to build the SB-1 Defiant, a compound helicopter it is building with Boeing for an Army demonstration program. “Now we’re talking about mission systems and we’re talking about ways to weaponize that aircraft to give it greater offensive capability,” Mehta said of the SB-1. Previously, Sikorsky would have had to forge a partnering agreement with another company – an oft-lengthy process – to weaponize an aircraft. “Now all the answers I think we need for that technology and for that specific platform lie in our sister companies, and we have ready and full access to those,” Mehta said. Mehta also touted Lockheed’s work in helping Sikorsky install weapons on the Black Hawk helicopter, making that an option for the more than 3,000 helicopters flying around the world. The upgrade is specifically aimed at the thousand-plus Black Hawks flown by U.S. allies. “We can go to a customer now and say, ‘Instead of buying a dedicated attack helicopter, we have the ability to be able to sell you a kit and the ability to be able to provide you a solution for weaponizing you Black Hawk with various levels of integration,’” he said.

Larry Seidman, a rabbi in the southern California community of Irvine, will help the local Jewish community observe Rosh Hashanah, a 10-day period ending on the Day of Atonement, called Yom Kippur, which starts the evening of Oct. 12. Both of these Jewish traditions are rooted deep in the Bible and have been practiced by the Jewish faith dating back 3,000 years. The overriding themes behind these two events on the Jewish calendar are repentance, atonement and forgiveness from sin. Seidman said for Jews, it is a time to reflect on the past year of their lives, think about what they did that was right and wrong, and look to the year ahead with a focus on internal improvement. "We think about what we did the past year as individuals and what made us happy and what made us unhappy in the decision we made, and what changes we can make in the year ahead," said Seidman."The 10-days is meant as a period of reflection." Seidman said the OJC/Beth Shalom Synagogue is the only inclusive synagogue in the Okanagan Valley, so his Rosh Hashanah/Yom Kippur services will reach out to Jewish people of all backgrounds and beliefs. Seidman said he has been to Canada but never to the Okanagan, so he is looking forward to the trip, one that he along with many others were invited by the OJC to apply for. "The word was out there they were looking for a rabbi to visit during (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) to hold services and I replied I would be interested as did I think a number of others, and they decided they like me," Seidman said. "I'm looking forward to the opportunity." He said is duties in California also include visiting Jewish people in California's correction service facilities, weddings and funerals, and working with local community service groups. Seidman is a former Boeing aerospace engineer, who transitioned into becoming a full-time rabbi along with his wife Linda, a former NASA aerospace engineer herself who will be co-officiating the services in Kelowna. While the upheaval in the Middle East causes concerns for the state of Israel's safety and the Jewish faith in general, Seidman says it's important for Jews to try and focus what they can do as individuals to help their families and their communities. "We live an imperfect world…but much of what happens in that world is beyond our individual control, but we can control what we say and do as individuals, the charities we support, and to reach out and communicate with rational thinkers who share in an ambition to fix it," he said.       We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Photo: AFP New Delhi: With the deal for 36 Rafale jets in kitty, Dassault Aviation CEO Eric Trappier on Friday said the French company is open to manufacture the fighter aircraft in India if the plane is shortlisted for a bigger order. He said that with the Indian contract going through, the company feels that more international orders of the plane, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, will come in. “It is 36 at the moment. We feel that we can create a strong industrial partnership in India. We know very well the large number of aircraft that the IAF needs,” Trappier said in an interview to PTI in New Delhi. He said that Dassault Aviation, manufacturer of the Rafale jets, is committed to the Make in India initiative. “Yes, of course. We will see how we can carry forward with the ‘Make in India’ initiative. We are open to manufacturing Rafales in India,” Trappier said when asked if the French firm was willing to manufacture the fighter aircraft in India if the plane was shortlisted for a bigger order. Also Read: India signs $8.9 billion Rafale fighter jet deal with France The CEO said the company will work with the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the government to see how they can meet India’s needs. He said the focus was to build an industrial partnership in India for Rafale jets and the 50% offset clause will be of help. Defence sources have made it clear that the deal for 36 Rafale jets does not come with an option clause. This means that more orders will come only through fresh talks. India had originally wanted 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft for which Rafale was shortlisted. However, due to the delay over cost and other issues, the Narendra Modi government decided to go for 36 Rafale jets in fly away condition. With India reducing the number, a multi-billion dollar aircraft contract is still in play. This has led to fresh pitches from those who lost out on the first deal including Boeing, Saab and Lockheed Martin. Also Read: Rafale fighter jet deal comes with 50% offset clause The sources have said India is looking at shortlisting one more aircraft, besides Tejas, to be manufactured domestically. Dassault Aviation hopes that Rafale, a twin-jet fighter aircraft able to operate from both an aircraft carrier and a shore base, makes the cut. The fully versatile Rafale is able to carry out all combat aviation missions — air defence, interception, ground support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence. Rafale entered service with the French Navy in 2004 and with the French Air Force in 2006. In 2015, Egypt and Qatar ordered 24 Rafales each. As of 30 June this year, 152 Rafale aircraft had been delivered.

Written by Sushant Singh | New Delhi | Updated: September 24, 2016 3:01 pm Rafale deal: PM Narendra Modi looks on as Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian exchange documents of MoUs on the purchase of Rafale combat jets, at Hyderabad House in New Delhi. File/Express photo/Renuka Puri When the Prime Minister of a country personally announces a deal for a fighter aircraft in a foreign land, there can be no doubt that the deal will eventually be signed. That there were still doubts about the fate of the Rafale deal – suddenly announced by PM Narendra Modi in Paris in April last year – is a testimony to the level of confidence we have on our defence procurement system. But 17 months down the line, and for Rs 59,000 crore, the deal is finally done. India gets 36 Rafale fighters, the first one within 36 months and the entire complement within 67 months. There is no clause for a follow-up deal – usual practise is for 50 per cent of the contracted quantity to be bought on terms of the original contract — which means that if India wants to buy more Rafales, it will have to enter into a fresh negotiation with France. A fresh negotiation is always a scary proposition as seen from the Rafale deal itself. The IAF first mooted the idea in 2000 for new fighter aircraft to replace the MiGs, which were to go out of service, till HAL made the indigenous Tejas. The tender issued in 2007 was for 126 aircraft, and that number is important: 126 fighters mean eight squadrons. IAF wants 45 fighter squadrons to ward off a two-front collusive threat, and it is authrorised 42 squadrons. It currently has only 32, and the airworthiness and vintage of fighters in these squadrons is not satisfactory. IAF told the parliamentary standing committee that at this rate, it will be down to 25 squadrons by 2022. That is a scary scenario.

He has put all his weight behind the Tejas but it is an unproven fighter, with production facilities still not in place. Beyond the first squadron, there is no guarantee about induction of Tejas fighters. Also Read: Air Force’s 16-year wait over, Rafale deal done Meanwhile, SAAB, Boeing and Lockheed Martin have submitted their proposals for respectively making the Gripen, F-18 and F-16 in India. Reports suggest that their proposals are being evaluated by the IAF and the ministry. There is no idea as to when any of these proposals will be approved and when their first aircraft will be made available to India. But the IAF squadron strength will continue to deplete with every passing year. Rafale is not a bad deal for India. IAF needed an aircraft for the nuclear strike role to replace the French Mirages and Rafale is the best option. By all yardsticks, we negotiated hard to get the best possible price. It is understandable then that the Indian side would have popped the bubbly for the Rafale deal. But let us put an end to the celebrations, and focus on the real task ahead: building up the IAF to an adequate strength. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks open on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaDemonetisation: Cash against debit swipe takes off at 700 petrol pumps IndiaNavy rubbishes Pak Navy claim that it stopped Indian submarine from entering waters EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

It also slammed the EU for failing to rein in billions of dollars in illegal subsidies, despite being told to do so. Four EU member states - France, Germany, Spain and Britain - had not complied with WTO calls to phase out subsidies, the intergovernmental trade body said. The dramatic ruling has set the stage for the United States to seek up to $10bn (€8.9bn) in annual trade tariffs on EU imports, according to Boeing. It's the latest step in a more than decade-old trade spat between rivals Airbus and Boeing, pitting the European Union against the US. The Obama Administration hailed the decision an "important victory". US trade representative Michael Froman called on the EU, Germany, France, the UK and Spain "to respect WTO rules". "We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves. We will not tolerate our trading partners ignoring the rules at the expense of American workers and their families." In a blow to Europe's long-held argument that Airbus' most recent jet, the A350, fell outside the case, the WTO said funding for it had been subsidised, but rejected US claims that it fell into the most serious category of "prohibited" aid. Boeing executive vice president and general counsel J Michael Luttig said that "the day of reckoning for launch aid has finally arrived", adding: "The World Trade Organisation has now found that Airbus is and always has been a creature of government and of illegal government subsidy." The case is the biggest to go before the WTO. It began in 2006, when the US government brought a claim to the WTO against the EU, alleging unfair state support for Airbus. Since then, both sides have won and lost complaints filed against one another. Boeing's chairman and chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said the "historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules. This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for US aerospace workers, in particular." However, the win is likely to be short-lived for Boeing, as the WTO is due to make another ruling, which is expected to fault the US for indirect subsidies to Boeing through, among other things, state tax breaks. The EU has suggested it will appeal the WTO findings, saying it found some of the report "unsatisfactory. "We are closely analysing the report," the European Commission said. Airbus, for its part, claimed it conformed with most global trade commitments and denied that it broke WTO rules. "We only needed to make limited changes in European policies and practices to comply," a spokesman said. "The US started this dispute claiming Airbus was receiving illegal subsidies, but the WTO decided otherwise. "We did what we needed to do and did it in the agreed timeframe. Airbus and its European partners met their obligations to withdraw any subsidy elements or eliminate adverse effects. Airbus wants common sense to prevail. Whatever Boeing will say, nobody will have to go to the bank. There have never been any repayments and there never will be, it is not in the spirit of WTO."

Akhtar urges PPP chief to empower local bodies 18-Nov-16 KARACHI: Muttahida Quami Movem ... NEW YORK: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday sought preferential trade access to the US market to boost bilateral trade between Pakistan and the United States. "We seek preferential trade access to the US market so that Pakistan and US businesses get a fair chance of doing business with each other. Such an arrangement is necessary to boost bilateral trade," the prime minister said while speaking at a luncheon co-hosted by the US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC) and the US Chamber of Commerce. He expressed hope that the US Chamber of Commerce and the USPBC would play their role in bringing the two countries closer on this and in convincing the US administration and Congress for its need. "This will go a long way in strengthening the relationship between the two countries, their people and businesses," he added. The prime minister said he firmly believed that a strong trade and economic relationship was an essential pre-requisite for a stable, long-term people to people relations. The United States has remained an important economic and trading partner of Pakistan, he said, adding, this partnership has been beneficial for private businesses of both countries and instrumental in fostering growth in Pakistan. "However, the level of trade and investment between the two countries has not kept pace with global trends," he said and mentioned that recognising this, both President Obama and he agreed in their meeting in October 2013 to jointly work on developing a Joint Action Plan to expand bilateral trade and investment flows over the next five years. "I see tremendous potential to deepen trade, economic and investment cooperation between our two countries. Your role as business leaders, investors and entrepreneurs is critical in enabling our two governments to fully harness the potential," he added. He said turning around the economy, overcoming the energy crisis, combating extremism and terrorism and investing in education have been the key priorities of his government ever since assuming office in June 2013. "I am, therefore, particularly pleased to share with you the details of the progress achieved by Pakistan," he added. The prime minister said as a result of bold economic reforms, his government had achieved significant improvement in all major economic indicators. Pakistan's growth has increased and the budget deficit has been reduced, he added. He said with a young and vibrant population of 200 million, growing consumer demand, as well as a stable economy and improved security, Pakistan offered enormous opportunities for profitable investment and trade. Giving an overview of some of the key economic indicators in Pakistan, the prime minister said inflation is now well below 3% - the lowest in 47 years. The State Bank of Pakistan in its Monetary Policy Decision announced in May 2016 decreased the discount rate to 5.75% - again lowest in last 4 decades, he said, adding that upgradation of the Karachi Stock Exchange to Emerging Market Index by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) was an important development. The Boeing International Operations and Policy director expressed his desire that Boeing wanted to partner with PIA and was ready to offer 777 and 787 planes for PIA Premier Service through transparent and competitive process. The Proctor and Gamble Selling and Marketing Operations president said that the company has already achieved 20 percent increase in its growth in Pakistan. "We are ready to further invest $100 million in Pakistan." Besides US Chamber executive vice president, senior vice president of US Chamber of Commerce and USPBC president, Pepsi Co vice chairman, Motorolla Solutions senior vice president, APR Energy chairman, Citi Bank vice chairman, Visionnet Systems CEO, EPC executive vice president, Metlife associate general counsel, McLarty Associates senior adviser and Agilvy Public Northrop Grumman CEO were prominent attendees during the occasion.  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

The stealthy fighter, featuring advanced radar, electronic warfare and an internal weapons bay, is expected to play a key role in Japan's elevated security posture. JASDF ordered the F-35 after the unveiling in China of the Chengdu J-20, a new fighter with a stealthy profile in development for the People's Liberation Army Air Force. "As the security environment surrounding Japan has become increasingly severe, because of its excellence, it is very significant for the defense of Japan to commit to acquiring the F-35 year by year," Kenji Wakamiya, Japan's State Minister of Defence told an audience at Lockheed's production facilities in Fort Worth. Lockheed will build the first four Japanese jets in Fort Worth, AX-1 through AX-4, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) will produce the remaining 38 under license at its Nagoya facility. MHI, which built Tokyo's fleet of Boeing F-15Js under license, won the 2011 competition to build the F-35A. In December, MHI began work on the first F-35A assembled in Japan, dubbed the AX-5. Work at the Nagoya facility involves the mating of the aircraft's wings, fuselage and tail, replicating Lockheed's process in Fort Worth and Leonardo's final assembly and check out facility for the F-35 in Italy.

ALSO READ Rafale deal cleared, to be signed on Friday As Rafale pact is inked, many concerns remain India says talks on Rafale jet deal in final stage Rafale deal: All details fixed, IGA being finalised With the deal for 36 Rafale jets in kitty, Dassault Aviation CEO Eric Trappier on Friday said the French company is game for the ‘Make in India’ initiative and open to manufacturing the fighter aircraft in India if the plane is shortlisted for a bigger order. “Yes, of course. We will see how we can carry forward with the ‘Make in India’ initiative. We are open to manufacturing Rafales in India,” Trappier said when asked if the French firm was willing to manufacture the fighter aircraft in India if the plane was shortlisted for a bigger order. The CEO said the company will work with the IAF and the government to see how they can meet India’s needs. He said the focus was to build an industrial partnership in India for Rafale jets and the 50 per cent offset clause will be of help. Defence sources have made it clear that the deal for 36 Rafale jets does not come with an option clause. This means that more orders will come only through fresh talks. India had originally wanted 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft for which Rafale was shortlisted. However, due to the delay over cost and other issues, the Narendra Modi government decided to go for 36 Rafale jets in fly away condition. With India reducing the number, a multi-billion dollar aircraft contract is still in play. This has led to fresh pitches from those who lost out on the first deal including Boeing, Saab and Lockheed Martin. The sources have said India is looking at shortlisting one more aircraft, besides Tejas, to be manufactured domestically. Dassault Aviation hopes that Rafale, a twin-jet fighter aircraft able to operate from both an aircraft carrier and a shore base, makes the cut. The fully versatile Rafale is able to carry out all combat aviation missions — air defence, interception, ground support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence. Rafale entered service with the French Navy in 2004 and with the French Air Force in 2006. In 2015, Egypt and Qatar ordered 24 Rafales each. As of June 30 this year, 152 Rafale aircraft had been delivered.

We will see how we can carry forward with the ‘Make in India’ initiative. We are open to manufacturing Rafales in India,” Trappier said when asked if the French firm was willing to manufacture the fighter aircraft in India if the plane was shortlisted for a bigger order. The CEO said the company will work with the IAF and the government to see how they can meet India’s needs. He said the focus was to build an industrial partnership in India for Rafale jets and the 50 per cent offset clause will be of help. Defence sources have made it clear that the deal for 36 Rafale jets does not come with an option clause. This means that more orders will come only through fresh talks. India had originally wanted 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft for which Rafale was shortlisted. However, due to the delay over cost and other issues, the Narendra Modi government decided to go for 36 Rafale jets in fly away condition. With India reducing the number, a multi-billion dollar aircraft contract is still in play. This has led to fresh pitches from those who lost out on the first deal including Boeing, Saab and Lockheed Martin. The sources have said India is looking at shortlisting one more aircraft, besides Tejas, to be manufactured domestically. Dassault Aviation hopes that Rafale, a twin-jet fighter aircraft able to operate from both an aircraft carrier and a shore base, makes the cut. The fully versatile Rafale is able to carry out all combat aviation missions — air defence, interception, ground support, in-depth strikes, reconnaissance, anti-ship strikes and nuclear deterrence.

May 17th 2016 6 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ A turbine fan from an engine on the ground near Grabovo, the main crash site of flight MH17. Picture: Ella Pellegrini By CHARLES MIRANDAHerald Sun Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend A RUSSIAN arms supplier has finally agreed to hand over raw data including radar images of air traffic movements over east Ukraine on the day Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down two years ago. The surprise move comes just days ahead of the public release of the interim report by criminal investigators including the Australian Federal Police into the doomed flight which was shot down over east Ukraine killing all 298 people on-board including 38 Australian citizens and residents. For almost two years the multinational police Joint Investigations Team (JIT) had appealed to both Russian authorities and the State-owned arms manufacturer Almaz-Antey to release raw radar and Buk missile data involving the Ukraine-Russian border region where the Malaysian flight was downed on July 17, 2014. But the manufacturer had held out until yesterday when it announced through the Russian Foreign Ministry that it would now turn over all materials including critical “primary radar data”. Debris and objects found scattered on the ground where Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 fell from the sky in Rozsypne, Eastern Ukraine. Picture: Ella PellegriniSource:News Corp Australia DATA ‘DISCOVERY’ Almaz-Antey said it had only just “uncovered” the material including airspace radar images from one of its radar and control system production plants in Lianozovo when it was conducting an archive inspection. “The plant’s specialists scrutinised all archive data kept in store for the purpose of monitoring the quality of air traffic control radars to find information dated July 17, 2014 that may prove of interest to the investigators: namely, primary, unprocessed radar images of the airspace,” Almaz-Antey said in a statement. “This relates to so-called raw primary radar images of the airspace. Currently, all primary radar data stored at the Research and Production Corporation ‘Lianozovo Electromechanical Plant’ [part of Almaz-Antey] has been submitted to Russia’s competent authorities for examination and onward submission to the Netherlands.” Russia’s MH17 investigative committee spokesman Vladimir Markin confirmed the group had now received the apparent new material and would “soon” hand it over to the Dutch-led JIT investigators. Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to the director general of the state-controlled Almaz-Antei consortium, announcing in 2015 that Malaysian Airlines flight 17 was downed by an older version of the missile, which isn’t in service with the Russian military. Picture: APSource:AP PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR The move to hand over material now was being seen with a degree of scepticism since Almaz-Antey had done something similar last year. On the eve of the public release of the report from the air crash side of the MH17 tragedy, it released a report of its own including secondary source radar images, JIT investigators privately believed had been doctored, and field experiments. Russian authorities concluded the Buk missile that brought down the aircraft was an outdated 9M38 model with a specific warhead the stock of which had been decommissioned by Russia in 2011 and not supplied or in use “in the 21st century”. Instead Almaz-Antey said Ukraine still had 1000 of this armament in its arsenal as late as 2005. It is known stockpiles of Ukraine military hardware in east Ukraine was seized by the Russian-backed Ukrainian separatist rebels in the early days of the conflict. The Grabovo main crash site of flight MH17. Picture: Ella PellegriniSource:Supplied MOSCOW TOUTS ‘BREAKTHROUGH’ Yesterday Moscow said the discovery of the new material could be what the families of victims had been waiting for. “While the Ukrainian president was deciding the future of Syria at the UN Security Council session the website of the Almaz-Antey concern published a news release saying it has shared with Russia’s investigative authorities some data regarding the air traffic situation in the area of where the Malaysian Boeing was lost,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on her social media page. “As far as I understand, the radar information in question is precisely what the relatives of the disaster’s victims have been waiting for so long. Hopefully, this data will shed light on the circumstances of the Malaysian plane’s crash.” In June this year JIT revealed it had found a major component of the surface-to-air BUK missile that brought down the aircraft. But sources conceded the investigation had struggled to acquire key evidence from Russia and rebels in their self-declared capital Donetsk. The release of the preliminary MH17 criminal report, likely to detail the model type and from where the missile was fired from, is expected next Tuesday regardless of the new information. The question of who fired it is expected to be revealed at a later time and potentially coincide with a war crimes style prosecution in The Hague.

Among the fastest growing aviation economies of the current century, Turkey has become a major hub for air transportation. With a significant domestic market, a diversified geography that supports strong business and leisure demand and two major airlines on a growth trajectory, the country’s location on the border of Europe and Asia has enabled it to boost its standing on the world’s connectivity stage. Even looking back to the start of the Century you couldn’t predict the rapid rise of the country’s aviation sector. In 2000, Istanbul’s largest gateway, Atatürk International was handling less than 10mppa having just opened a new terminal building. Turkish Airlines was one of a number of flag carriers struggling against economic and competitive pressures and closely aligned to the soon to fail Swissair through its Qualiflyer alliance. Pegasus Airlines was a small charter airline and Istanbul’s Sabiha Gökçen International had only just opened to flights. Fast forward a decade and a half and last year Atatürk International had risen to the eleventh largest airport in the world handling 61.8 million passengers, Sabiha Gökçen was handling a further 28.1 million passengers, Turkish Airlines was the biggest airline in the world by network having grown passenger traffic six-fold and Pegasus Airlines was respected among the low-cost airline elite. Alongside this change and buoyed by enhanced connectivity, the tourism sector of Turkey now employs around 8% of the total workforce in the country, and accounts for as much as $71 billion of its GDP, a figure the World Travel and Tourism Council had forecasted will rise to $107 billion in 2025, around 12% of total GDP. But, just as quickly as things have grown, the environment has changed notably over the past couple of years. Political instability, resumed violence from the PKK Kurdish militants and the Islamic State group, and a president that has been regularly critical of western ways, has changed the climate. Terrorist attacks have increased in regularity, many targeting foreign visitors, with the June shootings and suicide bombings at Istanbul Atatürk International Airport that killed more than 40 people and injured hundreds having a further direct impact on the industry. A subsequent attempted military coup which saw at least 290 people lose their lives and military tanks on the runway at Atatürk has now resulted in a state of emergency being declared across the nation. Ahead of the attempted coup Turkey was suffering its deepest tourism decline on record. Tourist arrivals fell 40.9% year-on-year in June, with just 2.44 million people arriving during the month, data from Turkey’s Tourism Ministry showed. It was the biggest drop on record, according to the data, and broke the 34.7% year-on-year decline that was seen in May. In fact it was a eleventh consecutive month that arrivals have fallen, the longest streak of year-on-year declines in statistics that span over a decade. This is a far cry from the 37 million annual visitors recorded in 2014, which made Turkey the sixth most popular tourist destination in the world. The Russian market has dominated the traffic declines after Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet near the Syrian border last year, sparking a bitter feud between presidents Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This has led to accusations that Turkey are ‘accomplices of terrorists’ from Putin and claims the country have been buying oil from ISIS. While political officials in Ankara and Moscow have recently started to rebuild ties and charter flights between the countries resumed in July this year, tourist arrivals from Russia dropped 87 percent in the first six months of the year, according to data from the Tourism Ministry. Another worrying factor that has concerned international tourists is that Turkish borders have been the primary thoroughfare for fighters of all kinds to enter Syria and this has impacted flows from many traditional inbound markets across western Europe, including Germany (down 31.5% in May 2016 versus last year) and the United Kingdom (down 29.4% in May 2016 versus last year), the countries that send the most visitors to Turkey. Annual figures released by the Turkish Census Bureau indicate that in 2015, tourism revenues in the country dropped 8.3% compared to 2014, from $34.3 billion to $31.5 billion. This year’s declines will have a much bigger impact on the country’s Economy (analysts suggest a $6 billion dent), with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan urging Turkish citizens to take domestic holidays to offset these considerable losses. The situation in Turkey is fast-changing and its volatility is causing uncertain times across the aviation industry. Turkey is now is state of emergency as the country deals with a coup and numerous terrorist attacks. For the tourism industry this obviously has an immediate impact as people start to question their holiday bookings and consider alternative options. This will obviously impact passenger demand over the second half of the year. However, traffic data for the first half suggests that while tourist traffic is clearly down, the same assumption isn’t necessarily correct when you look at pre-coup scheduled demand data extracted from AirVision Market Intelligence from Sabre Airline Solutions. This shows that a 10.2% growth in domestic journeys within Turkey is helping to offset the decline in international passenger numbers, albeit the traffic loss in some foreign country markets is considerable, most notably Russia where demand is down 48.1%. This has seen it fall from the 4th to 13th largest international market in and out of Turkey. There are also declines in H1 2016 versus H1 2015 demand to/from Belgium (-24.5%), France (-17.4%), Switzerland (-7.9%), Azerbaijan (-7.3%), Spain (-6.6%), USA (-6.1%), Italy (-6.0%), Cyprus (-4.8%), Austria (-4.0%), Netherlands (-3.7%). Although much smaller O&D markets, notable declines in China (-16.2%) and South Korea (-34.8%) highlight why airlines in both countries have scaled back capacity to Turkey in H2 2016. Some of the larger markets in and out of Turkey remain resilient, however, according to the data. Scheduled demand to and from the UK was up 24.4% in H1 2016 despite travel companies reporting declines across the same period, due to significant capacity growth. Increases in arrivals and departures were also recorded by Ukraine (+51.6%), Germany (+0.9%) and many nations across North Africa, the Middle East and Gulf regions, including Algeria, Iran, Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Largest country markets for scheduled international passengers in and out of Turkey (H1 2016) Rank Country H1 2016 Demand % Change (vs H1 2015) 1 GERMANY 5,984,783 0.9 2 UNITED KINGDOM 2,147,292 24.4 3 CYPRUS 1,020,740 -4.8 4 NETHERLANDS 708,436 -3.7 5 IRAN 617,788 56.0 6 SWITZERLAND 615,576 -7.9 7 FRANCE 598,035 -17.4 8 ITALY 584,829 -6.0 9 AUSTRIA 496,585 -4.0 10 SAUDI ARABIA 451,293 -0.4 11 USA 432,097 -6.1 12 UKRAINE 430,364 51.6 13 RUSSIA 415,658 -48.1 14 UAE 336,356 1.6 15 SPAIN 332,521 -6.6 From a connectivity perspective the decline in demand has led many carriers to cut flights and capacity into Turkey this year. The number of charter flights is down considerably, while in the scheduled market Swiss has closed reservations for winter operation on Zurich – Istanbul and EVA Air and China Southern Airlines have already closed routes into Istanbul from Taipei and Urumqi in the past couple of months. Elsewhere, Asiana Airlines and Korean Air have cut frequencies on flights between Seoul and Istanbul, Singapore Airlines has reduced its summer schedule on Singapore – Istanbul and Etihad Airways has cancelled plans to upgrade the Abu Dhabi – Istanbul route from an Airbus A321 to a Boeing 787-9. While it is clear that charter providers, tour operators and those airlines serving the leisure segment are being hit hard by the fall in tourism demand, national carrier Turkish Airlines has become partly insulated from the impact by its hub and spoke model that supplements local demand with connecting passenger flows, now 44% of the carrier traffic at Istanbul Atatürk International Airport. However, this may appear to be just a short-term reprieve and we must await post-coup traffic data before we will fully understand. Much is made about how the big three Gulf carriers of Emirates Airlines, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways have changed the ways many people fly by offering new efficient connection options via hubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha. But, Turkish Airlines actually serves more destinations in the world than any other carrier and its strong network particularly across Turkey and Europe helps feed traffic to and from flights across Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is clear that the airline is not immune to Turkey’s crisis. A net loss of 1.24 billion liras ($432 million) in the first three months of the year, the worst quarter performance since under the stewardship of its respected CEO, Temel Kotil, in 2005 and worst result since 1999, highlights this issue and the recent planned coup and declaration of a state of emergency will certainly not help. However, with an increasing number of its passengers never actually arriving in Turkey but simply transiting at its Istanbul Atatürk International Airport hub from one flight to another (transfer demand was up 22% in the first quarter), the airline’s management team have taken an optimistic stance. This may put pressure on yields, but the airline still expects to post record revenue of $12.2 billion this year, although profits will be well down on last year’s performance. This is being supported by a continued rise in capacity. Available seat kilometers rose 14.6% to 81.8 billion from the start of the year through to the end of June due to growth in Africa and North America and passenger numbers rose 7.8% in the same period to 25 million. This growth is expected to continue through to the end of the season with capacity planned to rise a further 20% in the second half of 2016. As at the end of June 2016 the Turkish Airlines fleet had grown by 47 units since the same month last year to 329 aircraft, including 20 additional widebodies. Its network had grown from 276 to 290 destinations at the same time last year. This year the airline has already confirmed planned new flights to Cluj, Denpasar, Phuket, Seychelles and Zanzibar, based on aircraft availability, but plans to fly to Conakry in Guinea now appear to have dropped since Emirates Airline confirmed its return to the African market. These traffic figures highlight how the Turkish Airlines model is helping through the country’s crisis with international to international transfer passengers increasing 18.5%. Adjusting capacity has enabled domestic demand to rise 8.8% versus the first half of 2015, while a 3.9% growth was recorded in international traffic. Together this has boosted passenger numbers to 30.1 million, up from 28.5 million in the period last year. While this may be keeping demand up, there are underlying concerns on profitability with load factors slipping by 3.9 percentage points across the six months to 73.7% and international business class passengers falling 5.2% versus the first half of last year. As this issue closed for press the first signs of how strongly the tourism decline and political instability was impacting the national carrier became clear when it started to load its revised winter 2016/2017 schedules with significant cuts throughout its network, particularly across Europe.  As first revealed by Routesonline’s schedule blog Airlineroute in late August, Turkish Airlines is significantly cutting its winter schedule versus its 2015/2016 offer with frequency cuts across over 50 markets, including the removal of daily rotations into the likes of Baku, Budapest, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Hanover, London Gatwick, Madrid, New York, Rome and Stuttgart.  Winter flights have also been cut from Ankara to Berlin, Frankfurt and Vienna; Istanbul Ataturk and Aqaba, Bordeaux, Friedrichshafen, Gassim, Genoa, Ivano-Frankivsk, Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden, Muenster, Osh, Pisa and Rotterdam; and Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen and Baku, Erbil and Venice. The newly appointed chief executive officer of Pegasus Airlines, Mehmet Nane, believes the airline’s low-fare model has helped it - for now - to overcome the worst of the problems hitting the Turkish market this year. “Despite the challenging conditions of 2016, we are on target to surpass our 2015 guest traffic of 22.3 million to reach over 24 million in 2016,” he said. “One of our core advantages is our agility which means we are well placed to respond to changing market conditions and continue growing as a network Low-Cost Carrier connecting continents from the North to the South, East to the West,” he added. The near future of travel and tourism is Turkey looks bleak with economists believing that the country will fail to reach their growth targets in the next two years.

The EU has said it will appeal against the ruling from the WTO that European governments gave the aerospace giant billions of dollars in illegal support. It comes after years of disputes between the US and the EU and focuses on $22bn of launch aid provided by the governments of France, Germany, Spain and the UK. Read More Airbus Broughton gives 100 apprentices a flying start The aid came in the form of loans at uncommercial rates to help with the development of new models of airliner. The British Government is estimated to have provided around £3bn of such aid over the years. Help for A350XWB launch The WTO's compliance panel also found that the EU had allowed Airbus to borrow a further $5bn in launch aid for the A350XWB airliner while the dispute was in progress. This amount includes £340m from the British Government in 2009, when then trade secretary Lord Mandelson acted to ensure Airbus kept jobs in Broughton and Bristol. Read More Airbus chief won't rule out job cuts after reports of restructure But the WTO did reject the US arguments that support from the four governments for the A350XWB amounted to illegal export subsidies. The ruling opens the door to retaliatory tariffs from the US on imported EU goods and services up to a value of $10bn a year.

The EU said that parts of the compliance panels report were "unsatisfactory" and that it was "closely analysing" the findings. An EU spokesman said: "An important win for the EU is that the panel rejected new US claims that repayable support for the Airbus models A350 XWB and A380 are 'prohibited subsidies'.

Airbus said it would appeal. "We only needed to make limited changes in European policies and practices to comply," it said in a statement. "We will address the few still remaining points indicated by the report in our appeal," Airbus said.

Growing trust and liberalized regulation for Chinese firms in India could attract more firm from China to manufacture in India. New Delhi (Sputnik) — Chinese telecom giant Huawei will start manufacturing smartphones in India in the first week of October. The company has formally launched its manufacturing unit in Chennai in collaboration with the leading global electronics manufacturer, Flex India. The plant will have the capacity to make three million units by the end of 2017. Launched the @HuaweiIndia manufacturing unit in India.

As India is set to become the second largest smartphone market, our government would like to invite even more businesses to come and manufacture in India,” said Ravi Shankar Prasad, India’s Minister of Information & Technology. © Flickr/ Carlos Menendez San Juan American Boeing Considers Manufacturing F-18 Jets in IndiaThe smartphone manufacturing announcement is another milestone in Huawei’s 16-year journey in India which includes its largest overseas R&D Center and the recently inaugurated Global Service Center in Bengaluru. It is expected that following the easing of rules and regulations for Chinese companies and stagnancy in the domestic market, India could attract more Chinese firms to move their manufacturing to India. “China's low-end manufacturing industry is experiencing hard times as some multinationals move production from China to other Asian countries, India included. India's low labor cost advantage has rung an alarm for China's manufacturing sector. Now it is time for China to map out concrete measures to reduce production costs for manufacturers,” wrote Global Times, a Chinese state publication, only last week. It is estimated that 220 million mobile phones have been sold in India in 2015-16 alone out of these; 110 million had some form of manufacturing in Indian locations. ...

The official recounted that the disputed articles are about the compensation process if Airbus fails to meet its commitment or the sanctions snap back, “Although we believe that the sanctions will never be resumed as the Europe and the US do not share the same stance as before.” “We demand the same treatment from Airbus and naturally they have their own concerns,” highlighted the Iranian deputy minister, “but we will sign an agreement entailing national interests for us, so the remaining part of talks matters the most.” He also asserted that the representatives of Boeing have been to Tehran four times so far and they are slated to visit Tehran again in the next week to continue talks on a draft sent formerly by the company.

The Spokesman-Review Opinion Opinion Story FRIDAY, SEPT. 23, 2016 Rep. Riccelli clear choice in 3rd Twitter Facebook Reddit The 3rd Legislative District is a rare Democratic stronghold in Eastern Washington, and it has two effective representatives in the House. Rep. Timm Ormsby is the incumbent for the Position 2 seat, and he’s being challenged by Republican Laura Carder. We endorsed Ormsby in the primary, because of his greater experience, accomplishments and grasp of the issues. The Position 1 race is between Rep. Marcus Riccelli, a Democrat, and Libertarian Randy McGlenn, who also ran for the seat in 2014. Riccelli’s resume reflects a genuine concern for his constituents, who reside in a low-income district with pockets of extreme poverty. He is project manager for the Community Health Association of Spokane and was operations manager for the Northeast Community Center in Hillyard. He is also involved in Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Spokane, YMCA Youth Legislature Delegation and serves on the Daybreak Youth Service board. He is concerned that services for vulnerable populations could be cut as lawmakers hammer out the details of basic education funding. If social services are cut, it could hurt the state’s efforts to close the achievement gap between low-income and minority students and the rest. Riccelli touts his leadership in getting the Legislature to adopt a transportation funding package that works for Eastern Washington. He notes that the Spokane area will be getting $1.30 in projects for every dollar sent to Olympia. This includes the completion of the north-south freeway. Riccelli also worked to secure the state’s second medical school, on the WSU-Spokane campus. We disagree with his vote against charter schools, and he ranges to the left of the board on some business issues. We are intrigued by his idea of incorporating SAT scores to lighten the testing load in schools. An alternative assessment would still be needed for students who aren’t on the college track. Riccelli wants to pursue some ideas related to children’s health by improving school meals (and if locally sourced food can be included, all the better). He’d also like to see a greater emphasis on physical education. Both efforts are aimed at stemming rising obesity and diabetes rates. Randy McGlenn has the standard Libertarian agenda. Government is too big and inefficient. He says the regulatory environment is such that only large companies can thrive, which is fine for Seattle, but not for Spokane. He wants to end the tax favoritism for companies like Boeing. McGlenn would like to see the state move toward a consumption tax, which relies more on the sales tax or a value-added tax, while cutting business and property taxes. It would also preclude an income tax. He opposed the recent gas-tax increase, but he does want the north-south freeway completed. The problem with McGlenn’s agenda is that it doesn’t have a caucus, and it’s a particularly poor fit for his district, where government does provide valuable services. Rep. Marcus Riccelli is a rising star in the Democratic caucus and a better fit for the district. He has earned a return trip to Olympia.

Because of it, two of today’s preoccupations — infrastructure and globalization — are connected by a chain of events that began more than 60 years ago and today runs through Congress and to the wharves of Charleston’s booming port. In 1934, Malcolm McLean, a North Carolina high school graduate struggling in the Depression, spent $120 earned pumping gas to buy a used truck. In 1955, running what would become the nation’s fifth largest trucking company, McLean had an idea: The process of loading ships — swarms of stevedores stowing (and often pilfering) cargo packed into ships’ holds in different sizes of wooden crates — was so slow that ships often spent more time in ports than at sea. Cargo brought to docks on trucks or rail cars and sealed in standardized containers could be loaded 20 times faster per ton, and for one-20th the cost. McLean was no Steve Jobs. He was, however, one reason your smartphone is so affordable, and one reason billions of people around the world, having been swept into the global trade system that McLean’s boxes facilitate, can afford such phones. Protruding from one of the approximately 10,000 containers here are 13-foot- tall tires ($80,000 apiece) heading for off-road mining vehicles in Australia, Brazil and elsewhere. The tires are made in Lexington, S.C. About two-hundred miles inland, in the Greenville-Spartanburg area, there is a building boom ignited by the Charleston port, and now by the widening of the Panama Canal. Since June, the canal’s new lane has the ability to handle enormous ships that carry 14,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) rather than the 5,000 TEUs on ships using the canal before it was widened. The big ships bring Asian goods to America’s East Coast, and take American goods abroad. More than 6 million square feet of warehouse space is being built to enlarge the Greenville-Spartanburg area’s role as a distribution center for imports, and for exports from throughout America’s Southeast. Upstate South Carolina suffered when, beginning in the 1970s, Asian imports devastated the textile industry. But in that decade, Charleston’s port was one reason Michelin (France) began manufacturing tires there. Since then, four other tire companies have come — Giti (Singapore), Continental (Germany), Bridgestone (Japan) and Trelleborg Wheel Systems (Sweden). South Carolina manufactures 89,000 tires a day, and exports more tires than any other state. In the 1990s, BMW built an automobile assembly plant and this March exported its 2 millionth X-model vehicle through the Port of Charleston. Without the port, Mercedes and Volvo would not be building plants in South Carolina. Operators of the cranes that load the containers onto the ships often earn, with overtime, six-figure salaries. Every day, 3,500 trucks — 70 percent owner-operated — deliver and depart with containers. Do today’s anti-trade politicians wish that South Carolina was still making towels and T-shirts for Americans rather than cars and tires (and Boeing aircraft, manufactured by more than 7,500 South Carolinians) for Americans and the world? The University of South Carolina’s Moore School of Business estimates that more than 187,000 jobs — one of every 11 South Carolina jobs — and $53 billion in economic output are directly or indirectly related to Charleston’s port. It, however, needs further dredging in order to handle more of the biggest ships, which is where Congress enters the picture: Unless it authorizes the project and appropriates the federal portion of the $509 million cost to augment South Carolina’s already committed $300 million, the project will be delayed a year. The deepening project is only 14 percent of the $2.2 billion South Carolina is investing in its port facilities and related access. The biggest ships pay more than $1 million to transit the canal; if they miss their transit time, their fee is doubled. Until the port is deepened, too few can be handled here simultaneously, and they can only enter and leave the port at high tide. There is no controversy in Congress about this project. But unless Congress acts on it before the end of the year, the deepening will not be in the president’s 2018 budget and will be delayed for a year, with radiating costs — inefficiencies and lost opportunities. This a mundane matter of Congress managing its legislative traffic, moving consensus measures through deliberation to action. It will illustrate whether or not Congress can still efficiently provide public works to enhance private-sector efficiency. — George Will is a columnist for Washington Post Writers Group.

The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world’s largest trade dispute, still raging after 12 years of bitter arguments. The WTO said the EU had failed to comply with earlier rulings by the global trade body against all but two of 36 contested measures, including billions of euro of European government loans to Airbus stretching back decades. The loans were a “genuine and substantial” cause of significant lost sales for its US competitor Boeing, it said. In a blow to Europe’s long-held argument that the most recent Airbus plane, the A350, fell outside the case, the WTO said funding for the jet had been subsidised but rejected US claims it fell into the most toxic category of “prohibited” aid. The US said Airbus had failed to undo subsidies worth $22bn (€19.5bn), including $4bn for the A350. European industry officials dispute those numbers, saying they overstate the amount of support at stake within the loans.  READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS business, finance, economy, wto, airbus, eu © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Among leading bourses, the gains were greatest in Paris and Frankfurt, with both climbing 2.3 per cent, as European and Asian markets had their first opportunity to trade after the Wednesday central bank announcements.  The biggest winner in the US was the Nasdaq, which rose 0.8 per cent to post a fresh record. US stocks had also risen about one per cent on Wednesday just after the Fed decision. “With both the BoJ and the US Fed doing nothing to upset the apple cart, the markets got what they wanted,” said Chris Conway, head of research at Australian Stock Report. “This is a continuation triggered by the Fed meeting,” said Alan Skrainka, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth Management. On Wednesday the Bank of Japan overhauled its stimulus program to target inflation and held off cutting interest rates further into negative territory. That was followed in Washington with the Fed keeping the benchmark federal funds rate at an ultra-low 0.25-0.50 per cent.  Fed Chair Janet Yellen described the US economy as improving, but said she wanted to see more evidence of strength before hiking rates. “The markets as a whole continue to be very sensitive to the discourse of central banks,” said Thomas Vlieghe, senior portfolio manager at French asset management firm Mandarine Gestion. “The fact the Fed has confirmed its accommodating approach has boosted appetite for risk,” he added.  The Fed decision also lent pressure on the dollar, which retreated further yesterday against the euro and most other leading currencies. Commodity producers rally The weaker dollar in turn boosted prices of commodities sold in the US currency on international markets, including oil and copper. That gave a lift to mining giants BHP Billiton and Glencore, up 4.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, and Italian oil company Eni, up 1.1 per cent. US technology shares were strong, with Apple rising 0.9 per cent, Amazon 1.9 per cent and Google parent Alphabet 1.4 per cent.  Yahoo finished flat, missing the rally that lifted other technology companies, after disclosing that hackers, likely state-sponsored, penetrated its network in 2014, stealing data from some 500 million users. Dow member Boeing rose 1.0 per cent following a World Trade Organisation ruling that said the European Union had failed to end illegal subsidies for Airbus. Boeing said that under the ruling, the United States could levy retaliatory duties against the European Union of up to US$10 billion (RM41.07 billion) a year.  The EU said that it found some of the WTO findings “to be unsatisfactory”, and noted it had the right to appeal the ruling. Airbus shares in Paris gained 2.0 per cent. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Movie accent expert breaks down 32 actors’ accents Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Ringgit susut lagi, RM4.40 bagi setiap dolar Amerika Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market The monarch and politics in Malaysia — Jahaberdeen Mohamed Yunoos Report: Ringgit to remain volatile until Trump takes office Johari: We have enough reserves to weather ringgit plunge Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

But this year, the once simple job of passing temporary legislation has instead morphed into an object lesson in Congress' almost comical dysfunction. A campaign season shutdown is unlikely, even as a battle rages, but the path to success is unclear. Lawmakers alike see the bill — the only major legislation that President Barack Obama is likely to sign before Election Day — as a vehicle for a variety of hoped-for initiatives: Funding to help Flint, Michigan, fix its lead-tainted water system; give flood-ravaged Louisiana aid and provide long-overdue money to battle the mosquito-borne Zika virus. In the end, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opted for a stripped-down approach, shorn of most add-ons, though he approved a $500 million down-payment on flood aid to Louisiana — a move that upset Democrats demanding money for Flint. Now, Democrats are vowing to filibuster the must-do measure in a showdown vote on Tuesday. The White House said Friday it's not certain that Obama would sign the budget bill, reflecting the administration's disappointment about the money for Flint. Here's what's in and what's out of the GOP measure: ___ WHAT'S IN —Stopgap funding to keep the government open through Dec. 9. The move is opposed by some conservatives since it opens the door to a postelection, lame-duck session that they fear might feature a sausage-making process that could produce an omnibus spending bill and other legislation. But there are too many leftovers, and many decisions won't get made until they know who the next president will be. —Zika. The bill contains $1.1 billion to combat the threat of the Zika virus, which can cause significant birth defects and long-term health problems. Republicans have dropped contentious provisions to block anti-Zika funds from going to Planned Parenthood affiliates in Puerto Rico and ease Clean Water Act rules on pesticide spraying. It also contains a handful of mostly pain-free budget cuts to partially pay for the Zika aid. At least one Democrat is on board. "While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida," said Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida. "This bill provides a clean $1.1 billion to help stop the spread of Zika virus with no political riders, and I will support it." —Louisiana flood aid. Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and the state's GOP-dominated congressional delegation have won $500 million in community development grants to help Louisiana recover from last month's devastating floods. The flood aid wasn't controversial on its own, but Democrats say that if Louisiana gets flood relief, money for Flint should be added as well. —Corporate political giving. The bill retains a top McConnell priority, to block the SEC from requiring corporations to disclose political spending permitted under the Supreme Court's 2010 decision allowing unlimited political spending by businesses. That would extend a current ban that McConnell won last December — but that Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and other Democrats were eager to reverse. ___ WHAT'S OUT —Flint water. Democrats are demanding $220 million to help Flint and other cities repair aging water systems that are poisoned by lead. Many House Republicans are opposed to the idea of an earmark to help Flint, but the state's Republican governor shares responsibility for the city's problems, and it's a hot political topic in a state that GOP nominee Donald Trump hopes to reclaim from Democrats. Senior Democrats promise a filibuster in an effort to add money for Flint to the bill, but both sides hope subsequent negotiations could avert a shutdown. —Export-Import Bank. The Export-Import Bank, which finances purchases of U.S. goods from overseas buyers, is currently hobbled because it lacks enough board members to produce a quorum. It can't OK export deals exceeding $10 million, which is hurting top exporters like Boeing and General Electric. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is breaking with McConnell and opposing the bill over the omission of the Export-Import Bank. "We need a fully functioning Ex-Im Bank to help ensure American manufacturers are able to compete in the international marketplace on a level playing field," Graham said in a statement. —Internet domains. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump both demanded that the measure include a provision to block the U.S. government from transferring the U.S. Commerce Department's role in governing the internet's domain name addressing systems to a nonprofit consortium known as ICANN. Cruz said foreign governments such as China would potentially gain influence over content on the internet. Experts in the field, however, said his concerns were mostly groundless, and McConnell dismissed the proposal without public fanfare.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Saturday November 19, 2016 Life & Style Travel Larger / SmallerNight Mode Air travel: the next big things for 2017 Michael Gebicki 24 Sep 2016, 12:15 a.m. When it comes to change and the airline industry, there's something in the air. Air travel: the next big things for 2017 Air New Zealand's Skycouch. Inside the new Boeing 777-200LR Worldliner. Get in early to bag a bargain. Photo: iStock Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit AIRCRAFT STRETCHING THEIR LEGS Bragging rights for the world's longest scheduled commercial flight belong to Emirates with its daily A380 service between Christchurch and Dubai. Scheduled to begin on October 30, the new flight will shade the current record holder, Emirates' 14,193 kilometre service between Auckland and Dubai. Flight time from Christchurch to Dubai, which is longer than the opposite leg, will be a mere 19 hours. In the never-ending poker game that goes on between airlines, on February 2, 2017, Qatar Airways will steal the record when it begins nonstop flights between Doha and Auckland using Boeing 777-200LR aircraft, a distance of 14,536 kilometres. Perth to London is 14,470 kilometres. If Emirates can justify a daily service using the world's largest passenger aircraft between Dubai and Christchurch, a city with about the same population as Canberra, surely a non-stop service between London and Perth, with 1.8 million, can't be too far away. AUSTRALIA'S AIRLINES DISCOVER WI-FI In 2017, Qantas plans to offer Wi-Fi at speeds up to 10 times current airline standards. According to Qantas, passengers will be able to stream video and other data-hungry feeds to their device and make VOIP calls. The new service uses geo-stationary National Broadband Network  satellites, which limits Wi-Fi delivery to Qantas' domestic services. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia has promised to introduce inflight Wi-Fi on both its domestic and international services starting from mid-2017. Upping the stakes, British Airways will introduce high speed Wi-Fi on many of its international flights from 2017, including Singapore and Sydney flights. Known as 2Ku, the technology leverages next-generation satellites to deliver data at speeds up to 70 Mbps. CHINA ON THE MOVE The appetite for travel among the Chinese population continues to dazzle. In 2015, 120 million Chinese travelled overseas, more than any other nationality. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council those travellers spent $US215 billion, an increase of 53 per cent over 2014. The top five destinations for Chinese travellers are all within Asia. The first non-Asian country to appear in their popularity list is France, at No. 6, with Italy and Switzerland close behind. In 2015, the number of Chinese visitors to Australia topped 1 million for the first time. Australia still welcomes more visitors from New Zealand, although the Chinese spend of $7.7 billion was greater, with a projected value of up to $13 billion by 2020. CLASS STRUCTURE More and more airlines are chucking their first-class seats out the door, either deleting the service or halving the seats in their first-class cabins. Slackening demand is the reason, but there are few regrets from travellers who like to fly fancy. Business class is beginning to look more and more like first class of just a few years ago. A business class seat aboard Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines or Etihad is streets ahead of a first-class seat from 15 years ago. First class will survive on international routes favoured by expense-account business travellers, and Middle Eastern and some Asian carriers are still big fans, but expect it to wane among US and European carriers. Meanwhile premium economy is steadily jacking up its service to look like an old-style business class, kind of. Although a gulf still divides a premium economy seat from a bog-standard international business class seat, which is what travellers are crying out for. BARGAINS AHOY Air fares from Australia are lower than they've ever been in real terms. A decade ago, a return economy airfare from Sydney to London was equivalent to two weeks' work for someone on the average pre-tax adult wage. Today, that same trip can be had for just one week's work. Return airfares from Sydney to New York for travel next May start at just over $1100. Lower fuel prices, more efficient aircraft, more capacity in the market and strong competition among low-cost carriers with more empty seats to fill are all reasons for the fire-sale prices. Indications are that prices will head north in 2017 and anyone planning a holiday in Europe or North America should look for early-bird bargains. BEYOND THE SEAT-BACK SCREEN Travellers departing from Heathrow's Terminal 5 this summer have ben able to download the latest Warner Bros films, magazines and newspapers to their iPhone or iPad from EntertainMe kiosks. Downloads are lightning fast and passengers select from a wide range of free or paid-for content to enjoy during their flight. This could be the shape of things to come for flyers who are flying with a budget carrier that doesn't offer inflight entertainment, or who aren't interested in the content that their airline serves up. In Geneva Airport, SWISS has ben trialling a similar system, SWISS e-media, available to Android as well as i-devices, although in this case content is limited to Swiss radio and TV, plus selected magazines and newspapers. LIE-FLAT ECONOMY CLASS BEDS Air New Zealand's innovative SkyCouch, a row of three economy class seats that can be made into a horizontal "bed", has been licensed to a couple of other airlines, and now comes the Piuma Sofa from Italian seat manufacturer Geven. The Piuma Sofa converts a row of seats to a comfy bed by removing the headrests and attaching them to the seats' bottoms to create a flat surface. Spread a mattress cover over the base and you have every promise of several hours of comfortable sleep. Legroom and under-seat storage are not compromised since the design does not rely on an extending the footrests. The Piuma Sofa overcomes the lumpy profile of the seats, which is a drawback with the Skycouch, but it does not offer the same width, and a compact adult and child can sack out on the SkyCouch in modest comfort. ARE YOU BEING SERVED? A number of full-service carriers are allowing passengers to pre-order meals and drinks. Passengers get to lock in the meal of their choice while the airline reduces wastage, with a smile on both sides. Although most airlines offer pre-ordering only for business class and above, a couple of others are extending the privilege further down the aircraft. For premium economy passengers and above, Singapore Airlines has Book the Cook, with a wider choice of meals than that available to those who order on board. On outbound flights from Singapore the choice for business and first-class flyers is truly dazzling. Qantas has its own version, Select on Q Eat, available in business, premium economy and international economy on flights departing Australia. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Select on Q Eat works well for business flyers but the menu for economy flyers is some way down the gourmet ladder. A handful of other airlines including Air New Zealand allow passengers to order snacks and drinks between meals via the inflight entertainment system. A BETTER CLASS OF AIRCRAFT Aircraft that offer a more comfortable flying experience are appearing in our skies. Boeing's 787 Dreamliners and Airbus A350s are made extensively from carbon composite materials, which allow the cabin to tolerate a higher pressure than a standard aluminium fuselage. Instead of flying in a cabin pressurised at 8000 feet, you're flying at 6000 feet, so more oxygen and more humidity, and more comfort. Economy class seats in the A350 are an extra inch wider, and that's a big win for comfort and the aircraft has giant size overhead bins that allow every passenger to tote a carry-on of maximum dimensions, so no more fights over the luggage compartments. They're also quieter; much quieter in the case of the A350. LIKE TO SEE A fast, decent, modern rail system in Australia: OK, we're not a populous nation, but the Sydney-Melbourne air corridor is one of the world's busiest, does that not bode well for an ultra-fast rail line between the two? With stops at the Southern Highlands, Goulburn, a spur line to Canberra and Albury-Wodonga to garner yet more trade? Three hours would be the sweet spot, and that's achievable with current rail tech. Online travel agents that take my preferences into account: Searching for flights and accommodation is often made more cumbersome by the volume of choices they offer. Rather than trolling through all the options, what's needed is sites that allow me to construct a profile to take account of my preferences, which would tailor the choices they present.

Our colleagues Seung Min Kim and Ben Weyl have more here: “Mitch McConnell is playing hardball — forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month. Story Continued Below “With spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats — yet still isn’t enough to get the minority party on board. … The new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday — which funds the government until Dec. 9 — also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option.” — ALSO IN THE CR: A FULL-YEAR VA-MILCON APPROPRIATIONS BILL: The CR contains a full-year Military Construction-Veterans Affairs spending bill, which includes $74.4 billion in discretionary funding for VA programs and $7.7 for Pentagon infrastructure projects. As a result, a potential December omnibus package would only be 11 bills, instead of 12 — and will come with a lower price tag. — WHICH COMES FIRST, THE NDAA OR A SPENDING DEAL? The CR is setting the stage for a lame-duck fight over discretionary spending, which wraps around the pending National Defense Authorization Act. But Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) believes Congress will repeat last year’s scenario — reaching a spending deal first and then finishing the NDAA. “Once appropriators make a decision … and we get a [topline funding] number, it’ll get a lot easier to get it done,” the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee said at a Stimson Center forum Thursday. — THE FINE PRINT: The full CR text is here. A section-by-section analysis is here. And a summary of the VA-Milcon bill is here. HAPPY FRIDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we’re always on the lookout for tips, pitches and feedback. Email us at jherb@politico.com, and follow on Twitter @jeremyherb, @morningdefense and @politicopro. MORNING D TRIVIA: Last week’s winner, Shawn Barnes, has today’s question: The Air Force has just announced that the new B-21 bomber will be named the “Raider.” The Air Force now has three active bombers in service: When was the first time all three were deployed to the same location? The first person to email Morning D (jherb@politico.com) with the correct answer wins a mention in Monday’s edition. SPEAKING OF THE BOMBER ... HERE’S ALL THE OTHER NAMES THAT WERE SUBMITTED: War is Boring obtained through a public records request a list of all the names submitted for the Air Force’s contest to name the new bomber. There were 15 finalists — Boomerang, Ghost, Horizon, LeMay, Liberator II, Mitchell II, Night Fury, Phoenix, Raider, Shadow Fortress, Stingray, Valkyrie, Victory, Wraith and Zeus II — but the other 4,500-plus losing names are the most entertaining ones, from “Baconator” to “YouThinkWeWastedMoneyOnTheF35,hahahahahaha!!!” to “Sir Bombs-a-lot.” HAPPENING TODAY — AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ BRIEFINGS: The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Nicholson, briefs reporters this morning at the Pentagon. And in the afternoon, Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. John Dorrian holds a press briefing via Skype on U.S. operations in Iraq and Syria. WAR REPORT — THE BOMBINGS RESUME IN ALEPPO, as efforts to revive a cease-fire are ignored by the Syrian military, Reuters reports: “Warplanes targeted rebel-held areas of eastern Aleppo on Friday in a second day of heavy bombardment hours after the army announced the start of a military operation there, rescue workers and activists said. The Syrian military, which is backed by the Russian air force, said late on Thursday it was starting a new operation against the rebel-held east, which is home to at least 250,000 people and was also targeted in heavy air strikes on Thursday.” — U.S., RUSSIA NOT GIVING UP ON CEASE-FIRE, writes The Associated Press: “With prospects plummeting to revive an all but dead Syria cease-fire, the United States and Russia have grudgingly agreed to another round of talks to keep hopes alive. After a contentious two-and-a-half hour meeting with colleagues in New York, Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said they would meet again Friday in a bid to find a way forward. But frustration over recent developments, including the Syrian military's announcement of a new offensive in Aleppo, suggested that chances were slim for success.” — TEXT OF THE CEASE-FIRE DEAL: The AP obtained a copy of the agreement here. ** A message from the Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base Coalition: Help Save Taxpayers Up To $500 Million: Buying materials in advance for the construction of the next two new U.S. Navy aircraft carriers will save taxpayers up to $500 million over the course of their construction and will keep the industrial base strong. Learn more at acibc.org ** OBAMA’S AWKWARD DEFENSE OF SAUDI ARABIA, our colleague Nahal Toosi reports on President Barack Obama’s awkward situation of defending Saudi Arabia as he prepares to veto a bill that would allow 9/11 victims' families to sue the Saudis: “President Barack Obama has never had a great relationship with Saudi Arabia. Now, he’s the last man standing between the wealthy desert kingdom and billions of dollars in potential liabilities. “Obama has cast the Saudis as ‘so-called’ allies; bemoaned the terrorist-inspiring version of Islam they practice; and even suggested the oil-rich Arab state learn to ‘share’ the Middle East with rival Iran. The Saudis, meanwhile, consider Obama naive, sparring with him over the Iran nuclear deal and questioning his hands-off approach to Syria’s bloody civil war. Despite these differences, Obama has promised to veto a bill that Congress passed unanimously allowing families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia over alleged links to the 2001 terrorist attacks.” 2016 WATCH — TOP INTEL DEMOCRATS ARE CONVINCED RUSSIA IS ELECTION MEDDLING, writes our colleague Tim Starks: “The top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence panels said Thursday that they are convinced, based on briefings, that senior Russian officials are trying to sway or disrupt the U.S. elections. "Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Adam Schiff in a joint statement.” DOCUMENT DRAWER I — DOD DETAILS ARCTIC-RELATED SPENDING: The Pentagon says it’s spending roughly $6 billion on research, infrastructure and capabilities for the Arctic region, according to a new report to Congress. The Pentagon report, obtained by POLITICO, details the spending proposed in the fiscal 2017 budget that supports the Pentagon’s 2013 Arctic Strategy. The funding includes $461 million in research projects and $362 million in military construction initiatives, including basing the F-35A fighter jets at Eielson Air Force base in Alaska. The bulk of the spending, $5.2 billion, is listed as “capabilities that could be deployed to the Arctic or employed in the region.” DOCUMENT DRAWER II — SENATE REPUBLICANS PUSH BACK ON NUKE POLICY: A bloc of Senate Republicans is urging Obama to avoid what they call a "dangerous and irresponsible" no-first-use nuclear weapons policy.In a letter sent Thursday, 29 senators asked the president to shun any such policy as it "would severely reduce the value of our nuclear deterrent, limit the options of America’s future leaders to safeguard the legacy of peace, and undermine the credibility of our alliances."
