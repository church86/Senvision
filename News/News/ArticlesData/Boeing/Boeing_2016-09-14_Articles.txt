X Close Nation Home > News > Nation < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 16 September 2016 ‘Pemba debris is from MH370’ by tho xin yi SEPANG: Plane debris discovered on the island of Pemba off the coast of Tanzania is confirmed to be part of the missing MH370. This has been deduced after several numbers as well as its physical appearance and dimensions were found to match the ill-fated aircraft. Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said both the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the MH370 Safety Investigation Team had determined that the numbers, appearance, dimensions and constructions matched that of an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap. “A date stamp indicated that it was manufactured on Jan 23, 2002, and consistent with the May 31, 2002, delivery date for MH370. “Besides the Boeing part number, all identification stamps have a second “OL” number which are unique identifiers relating to the part. The Italian part manufacturer has confirmed that all numbers located on the recovered debris relate to the same outboard flap shipped to Boeing and delivered to Malaysia Airlines,” he said here yesterday. Experts from ATSB, said Liow, recently completed their examination of the debris discovered on June 20. “The investigation team will look into other details now and study how the accident happened – whether it was a controlled or uncontrolled ditch – into the sea,” he said after welcoming AirAsia’s latest aircraft, an Airbus A320neo, at the Sepang Aircraft Engineering hangar here yesterday. The ministry, said Liow, would continue to provide updates as and when new information became available. “We wish to extend our appreciation to the authorities in Tanzania and Australia for their support and assistance,” he said. MH370, a Beijing-bound flight carrying 239 people, disappeared on March 8, 2014. The search for the aircraft is ongoing in the southern Indian Ocean. Earlier, Liow said Malaysia wanted to seek re-election into the the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), adding that it would submit its candidature during the 39th session in Montreal later this month. “Malaysia was first elected to the council in 2007 and has taken on an active role. We have been reelected for the third consecutive term. “I look forward to the participation of airlines, regulators and industry in ensuring that Malaysia continues to retain the seat, and collaboration to further enhance the aviation industry in the country,” he said. On the Airbus A320neo, AirAsia group CEO Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said it delivered 15% in fuel savings and with additional range capacity of 500 nautical miles, this would translate into low fares.

Spirit AeroSystems Courtesy photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Officials at Spirit AeroSystems are paying attention to demand in the widebody jetliner market and how its largest customer reacts to it. That’s what Spirit president and CEO Tom Gentile said at Morgan Stanley’s Laguna Conference for investors on Thursday in California. Gentile was responding to a question about whether he had concerns regarding demand for widebody airliners and what a production rate cut by Boeing on its 777 would mean for the Wichita-based aerostructures supplier. Spirit builds the 777’s forward fuselage, wing leading edge, nacelles and struts. “We’re watching very closely … to what Boeing is saying and the rest of industry and being prepared to react,” Gentile said in a question-and-answer session with a Morgan Stanley analyst Thursday afternoon. Next year, Boeing plans to trim the rate from 8.3 777s a month to seven a month beginning in 2017. Since Boeing made that announcement earlier this year, demand for twin-aisle passenger jets has softened considerably, and many analysts think that could lead to another rate cut. “If there is a production cut, obviously that would reduce our revenue and profit in proportional amounts,” Gentile said. The effect of a second rate cut could be partially offset by an increase in production on the narrowbody 737 line – 737 production is expected to go from 42 airplanes a month to 47 next year – but not enough to fully offset it, he said. That would mean Spirit would look at how it could “accelerate some of our cost reduction initiatives,” Gentile said, including “how do we streamline some of our overhead and infrastructure, how do we combine things, how do we work with our supply base.” Spirit and Boeing officials also continue to work on a long-term pricing agreement for the manufacture of the 787-9 and the 737 Max. “We’re making good progress and we do expect to come to a resolution,” Gentile said, adding that there is no timetable for reaching an agreement.

Back To Top[*] China becomes first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing's forecast Sep. 16, 2016 - 05:30AM JST Boeing has forecast a demand for 6,810 new airplanes in China over the next 20 years. Boeing released its annual China Current Market Outlook (CMO) in Beijing, estimating the total value of those new airplanes at $1.025 trillion. China is the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing’s forecast. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4% annually in China over the next 20 years.” Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes, such as the new 737 MAX 8 and current 737-800, through 2035, accounting for 75% of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X. This year’s forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China’s single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18% of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China’s widebody fleet only represents approximately 5% of the global widebody segment. “The continuing expansion of China’s middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China’s long-haul market,” said Tinseth. Driven by China’s growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. Worldwide, Boeing projects investments of $5.9 trillion for 39,620 new commercial airplanes to be delivered during the next 20 years. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model – the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies. Back To Top[*] Switch to full browser version © 2016 GPlusMedia

In May, the Danish ministry concluded in a report that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, but Boeing disputes this, saying the aircraft would last 9,500 hours. The report also estimated the total cost of the Lockheed-made F-35 at 42.2 billion Danish crowns (about $6.4 billion), compared with 60.6 billion crowns for the Super Hornet. ...

Boeing curtails OT pay for 80,000 workers in latest cost-cutting move By Dominic Gates Seattle Times Twitter Facebook Email Reddit Payroll cut So far this year, Boeing has shed just shy of 4,000 jobs in Washington. The company has also curtailed business travel, reduced purchases of advertising and squeezed out supplier costs. In another move to cut costs, Boeing told white-collar, salaried employees across the company on Tuesday that starting next month overtime pay will be severely limited. Citing “Boeing’s highly competitive market,” an internal memo says the company will “discontinue” paid overtime for U.S.-based salaried employees “except in the case of preapproved production- or mission-critical work.” The new policy, effective Oct.14, includes both nonunion salaried employees and some groups of unionized employees – including engineers. It covers about 80,000 employees, the company said. The policy is generating a lot of buzz among white-collar staff, said one Commercial Airplanes nonunion employee, who asked not to be identified when speaking without company permission. “For many, this is a pay cut,” the employee said. Boeing has been on a cost-cutting binge all year. Commercial Airplanes boss Ray Conner warned in February that Boeing was being “pushed to the wall” under pressure from Airbus and that jobs would have to be cut. In the memo that went out to managers Tuesday, company executives emphasized that employees are expected to get their work done without paid overtime. Joelle Denney, vice president of human resources at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said “nonunion employees are paid an annual salary to cover the roles and work assigned them, including the need to work more than 40 hours in a week without extra pay when their job requires it.” Scott Drach, vice president of Human Resources in Boeing’s Defense and Space unit, said “this new policy helps us change the focus from paying for hours worked to paying for business results.” If critical overtime work is necessary, overtime will be paid only when approved in advance by the employee’s direct manager, says the memo. “On the rare exception that it is required, review overtime requests with each employee to validate that there are no other options,” the memo directs managers. Federal law requires employers to pay overtime above a 40-hour week at a rate of time-and-a-half unless an employment agreement or collective-bargaining contract mandates otherwise. Salaried workers are generally exempt from this federal law and are not automatically entitled to overtime pay. However, Boeing has offered an “extended workweek” policy to this exempt group of employees that pays for overtime at the employee’s regular rate plus $6.50 per hour. It is this extended-workweek policy that is being discontinued except for critically needed work. Engineers represented by the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace , who are salaried, are among those exempt from the federal overtime standard. Engineers will be affected by the new policy in that the amount of overtime available will be curtailed. However, under the SPEEA contract, any overtime they are granted must still be paid at the extra $6.50 per hour on top of their standard pay rate. Rich Plunkett, SPEEA’s director of strategic development, said in an interview Wednesday that many engineers are required to work mandatory overtime. He said the new policy suggests that might come to an end, “meaning that work won’t get done.” Plunkett added that the pressure on managers to justify any approval of overtime, and to do so only rarely, will inevitably drive managers to ask people to work extra hours without charging it to the company. The clampdown on overtime comes as Boeing engineers are scrambling to ramp up output, complete the designs of the 787-10 and 777X, and fix various production issues, including the new robotic system for 777 fuselage assembly. The memo states that nonunion employees will be paid for any overtime that is granted only if they work more than 44 hours in a week. There are no changes to overtime-pay policy for nonexempt employees such as the Machinists. Explaining the reason for the policy shift, Heidi Capozzi, Boeing’s senior vice president of human resources, said in the memo that “it really is a competitiveness issue.” “Today’s business environment requires us to become more efficient,” she wrote.

Finance Search Sat, Nov 19, 2016, 3:23 AM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Boeing challenges Denmark's choice of fighter jetsAFP – Thu, Sep 15, 2016 4:58 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo The Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter, was in the running for the Danish order, which had been debated for over 10 years Boeing accused the Danish government Thursday of overseeing a "fundamentally flawed" process to replace its fleet of fighter jets which saw the US defence giant lose out to competitor Lockheed Martin. In June, Denmark decided to replace its ageing fleet of F-16s with 27 US-built Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighters in a deal valued at 20 billion kroner (2.69 billion euros, $3.02 billion). Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Eurofighter's Typhoon model were also in the running for the order, which had been debated for over 10 years. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," Debbie Rub, a Boeing vice president, said in a statement. The company had submitted a request for the defence ministry to provide "all materials related to the fighter procurement evaluation and decision announced in June," it said. "We're taking this step because there's too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet," Rub said. She described it as "the first step toward bringing a formal legal challenge." Boeing said it had voiced concern earlier this year over the Danish evaluation process, in particular with a government estimate that "the Super Hornet would cost up to twice as much as detailed in US Department of Defense budget documents." Danish Defence Minister Peter Christensen said it was "natural" that only the company behind the winning bid would be happy with the outcome of the process. "I note that we have had a very thorough and transparent process," he told Danish news agency Ritzau. Denmark is one of nine partner countries, that also include Britain, Canada and Turkey, who are helping pay for the futuristic F-35A fighter jet's development. The country expects to take delivery of the F-35s between 2021 and 2026. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Water fight could drench backpacker billAAP A stoush over water reform could sink the government's hopes of getting its backpacker tax through parliament. … VW to cut 30,000 jobs, 23,000 in GermanyAAP Kogan welcomes prospect of AmazonAAP Crean enlisted to help Latrobe ValleyAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7335 -0.0081 -1.09% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5955 -0.0014 -0.23% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6934 -0.0043 -0.62% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Golden pheasant Health insurance ISIS Melbourne Cheap international flights 457 visa program Mobile phone Leonard Cohen Adelaide Accommodation Brendan Dassey iPad Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

The Presidential Aircraft Recapitalisation (PAR) programme will replace presidential air transport VC-25A in the 2024 timeframe. The RFP was released following authorisation from US under secretary of defence for acquisition, technology and logistics Frank Kendall, which will enable to continue a deliberate step-by-step approach to reduce programme and cost risk. "We are committed to providing the (Executive) Office of the President of the United States with safe, reliable air transportation that provides high levels of security and communication capability." The proposal will allow Boeing to apply the results of the ongoing risk reduction activities to the proposal for the contract modification. The 747-8 will be modified to include electrical power upgrades, a mission communication system, a medical facility, executive interior, a self-defence system, and autonomous ground operations capabilities. Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) programme manager colonel Amy McCain said: “This is a significant step forward for this programme, which emphasises cost control and risk reduction, in balance with system performance, to meet the requirements of the presidential mission. “We are committed to providing the (Executive) Office of the President of the United States with safe, reliable air transportation that provides high levels of security and communication capability.” A third production representative aircraft is still under consideration for future procurement. McCain added: “The results of our ongoing risk reduction efforts are providing data that we can use to make sound decisions regarding the requirements and design trade-offs. "These requirements decisions will then be applied to Boeing’s EMD proposal. “We are focused on driving out costs where we can, to ensure this programme is affordable.” Related Content Follow Us:   Related News Deals this week: Boeing, Technica, Raytheon The Boeing Company has secured a $478.79m-worth prime contract award from...

Charles Mudede Seattle Is the No. 1 City in North America for Chinese Buyer Inquiries: This claim was made in The Province, a daily newspaper in British Columbia. The claim is backed by data gathered by Juwai.com, "a popular website in China that connects investors with international home sellers and real estate agents." The thing is this: The biggest city in British Columbia, Vancouver, recently imposed a huge tax (15 percent) on home purchases by foreign buyers. Most of these buyers are from China, and most have long concluded that the market they helped to inflate is now too expensive. The tax came at a time when profits from this form financial speculation were getting too squeezed. In short, the tax came too late. This global money is now looking for markets that are hot and cheaper. Seattle fits the bill. The Province reports: [Dean Jones, owner of Realogics Sotheby’s International Realty in Seattle,] said his company’s top sales in August were for Chinese buyers who set new prices in two Seattle neighbourhoods. They bought homes for about Canadian $6.5 million that would have cost about twice as much in comparable Vancouver neighbourhoods... The post also points out that many in China actually sympathize with the "pissed off" and priced out citizens of Vancouver and respect the government's decision to tax foreign buyers. Why? Because they are also experiencing the same fucking thing in their own cities. Their housing markets have been insanely inflated by speculators. The problem is not Chinese people. The problem is surplus capital. It's a real thing and it's constantly looking for places to grow. Boeing Screws Its Workers Again: This time around, white-collar, salaried employees of Boeing, a recent recipient of history-making tax breaks, are to be turned upside down and vigorously shaken for spare cash. Boeing believes this money will help to "cut costs" and protect profits for its shareholders. The shaking, which will take the form of severe limits on overtime pay, begins on October 14. Boeing told these workers that blame must be placed not on the company but on the competitive market. So, don't take it personally. It's just business. But many of the workers are not buying this neoliberal reasoning. They see what is what. They know they are getting a cold pay cut. This is not about competition; it's about class struggle. E. coli Outbreak Associated with Mexican Restaurant in the University District: This outbreak, which King County Public Health has linked to Memo’s Mexican Food, is not connected with the recent outbreak linked to Matador restaurant in Ballard. The one thing you must do today is feel sorry for those going through this illness. It is no joke. It lasts for a week or so and subjects you to painful cramps that come in waves. Mother Charged for Throwing Her 4-Year-Old Boy From a Small-Town Bridge: She claims it was all done in the name of fun, and that her boy, who wore a lifejacket, and who survived the fall into the waters of Wynochee River, wholly enjoyed the wholesome experience. But the authorities in Montesano, Washington failed to see the fun in all of this. To their eyes, she and the man she was with at the time of the tossing committed a crime. Body of Fisherman Recovered From Columbia River: His boat was found drifting on the river on Sunday. His body was pulled from the river yesterday. It was near the tip of an island. It once belonged to a fisherman from Sandy, Oregon. He was killed by water. The river is a strong and sullen god. Donald Trump Gets No Love in New Hampshire: New York Times reports that the Union Leader, a New Hampshire newspaper that has been "a conservative bulwark for generations," will for the first time in over a century not be endorsing a Republican nominee for president. It is instead endorsing the Libertarian Gary Johnson. The paper sees in this candidate the "lesser of two evils."

Boeing said it had submitted a request to the country's ministry of defence that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision announced in June. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," said Boeing vice president Debbie Rub. In May, Boeing challenged the Danish government's recommendation to buy 27 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, questioning data which suggested its Super Hornet fighter jet was a more expensive option. Denmark's Defense Minister Peter Christensen confirmed that Boeing would get access to the requested information. "I note that we had a very thorough and transparent process before the Danish choice of fighter jet. This led to a broad political agreement," Christensen said in an email. A ministry report in May evaluating each fighter jet candidate was based on data estimating that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, while Boeing thinks the right figure for Denmark is 9,500 hours. The report also concluded that the total cost of the F-35 jet is 42.2 billion Danish crowns ($6.4 billion) while the Super Hornet would cost 60.6 billion crowns. ($1 = 6.6284 Danish crowns) (Reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen; Editing by Alexander Smith) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Posted 15 Sep 2016 22:40 Updated 15 Sep 2016 23:10 The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company Boeing (BA) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 22, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Enlarge Caption  Email More A A COPENHAGEN: Boeing formally challenged a decision by the Danish government to pick Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet over its own Super Hornet, saying on Thursday the choice was based on a "flawed evaluation process". Boeing said it had submitted a request to the country's ministry of defense that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision announced in June. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," said Boeing vice president Debbie Rub. In May, Boeing challenged the Danish government's recommendation to buy 27 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, questioning data which suggested its Super Hornet fighter jet was a more expensive option. Denmark's Defense Minister Peter Christensen confirmed that Boeing would get access to the requested information. "I note that we had a very thorough and transparent process before the Danish choice of fighter jet. This led to a broad political agreement," Christensen said in an email. A ministry report in May evaluating each fighter jet candidate was based on data estimating that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, while Boeing thinks the right figure for Denmark is 9,500 hours. The report also concluded that the total cost of the F-35 jet is 42.2 billion Danish crowns (US$6.4 billion) while the Super Hornet would cost 60.6 billion crowns.

The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 percent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range -- just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travelers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn't otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 2,000 miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The U.K. and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus's A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city.Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 -- dubbed the Max 10 -- that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. "But they're coming."     Next Article Loading comment count...

While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on transatlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current transatlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada’s WestJet Airlines and link St John’s, Newfoundland, with Dublin – distance 2,000 miles – and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The UK and Irish routes planned for Norwegian’s 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they’ll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus’s A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, Norwegian spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The US carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with “transatlantic range”. TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the US. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country’s sixth-largest city. Aer Lingus Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, chief executive of parent company IAG, said in July, adding that the jet represents a “fantastic opportunity”. It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favoured successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. “For the moment we haven’t really got the planes out there,” said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. “But they’re coming.”       Topics: Bjorn Kjos Lasse Sandaker Nielsen Willie Walsh Yan Derocles Aer Lingus Airbus Boeing British Airways Iag Jetblue Airways Norwegian Air Norwegian Air Shuttle SAS Group United Continental WestJet Read More Ryanair’s profit forecast faces pressure as the airline cuts fares Wow Air to fly Dublin-Miami via Rekjavik Aer Lingus smartens service for ‘guests’ – just don't be late Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Germany says Commission has no right to decide on its fiscal space Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

REUTERS/Lucy NicholsonMore COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Boeing <BA.N> formally challenged a decision by the Danish government to pick Lockheed Martin's <LMT.N> F-35 fighter jet over its own Super Hornet, saying on Thursday the choice was based on a "flawed evaluation process". Boeing said it had submitted a request to the country's ministry of defense that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision announced in June. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," said Boeing vice president Debbie Rub. In May, Boeing challenged the Danish government's recommendation to buy 27 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, questioning data which suggested its Super Hornet fighter jet was a more expensive option. Denmark's Defense Minister Peter Christensen confirmed that Boeing would get access to the requested information. "I note that we had a very thorough and transparent process before the Danish choice of fighter jet. This led to a broad political agreement," Christensen said in an email. A ministry report in May evaluating each fighter jet candidate was based on data estimating that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, while Boeing thinks the right figure for Denmark is 9,500 hours. The report also concluded that the total cost of the F-35 jet is 42.2 billion Danish crowns ($6.4 billion) while the Super Hornet would cost 60.6 billion crowns.

Boeing and Saab revealed their entry for the US military's T-X trainer replacement program. The new jet, simply called T-X, is like the lovechild of a F/A-18 Hornet and an F-16 Falcon, and as Boeing tells it, will provide "performance, affordability, and maintainability advantages" over the competition. "Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come," Leanne Caret, Boeing Defense, Space, and Security's President and CEO said in an official statement. And Caret isn't not kidding about the Boeing T-X being both real and ready – Boeing is so confident that it built two examples before the official unveiling on Tuesday. The first jet, which Defense News reports will fly by the end of the year, debuted to media with the kind of pomp usually reserved for automotive debuts. Boeing/Saab will use the second jet – also featured on Tuesday – for structural proof testing. The needs of a training aircraft are quite different than those of a traditional fighter. The T-X features stadium-style seating, so the instructor riding in back has nearly as good a view as the student in front. Student evaluations should be easy, too, as the open software transmits data effortlessly between ground training systems and the jet itself. Functionally, Boeing claims the twin-tail layout provides more agility than a single-tail design – remember, the military's newest jets, the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II both use twin-tail layouts – while the Air Force can mount two weapon hard points on the jet's wings. According to Defense News, four manufacturers – Boeing/Saab, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin/KAI, and Raytheon/Leonardo/CAE – are vying for the contract to build 350 new trainers to replace the Air Force's fleet of aging T-38 Talons.

(Reuters/Toby Melville) Share Written by Caitlin Dwyer September 15, 2016 The couple sat at a steakhouse, a good bottle of merlot between them. Outside the big bay windows, boats were moored to a dock, rocking gently on Puget Sound’s tinfoil blue. Mike Sanders gazed at his wife across the table and thought about how he wanted to do something special for next year’s 15th anniversary. Lifting a glass of wine, he found himself unexpectedly proposing a trip to Hawaii. His wife’s eyes lit up. “There’s times when you say something and you’ll do anything to stuff those words back in your mouth,” Sanders recalls ruefully. Sanders was desperately afraid of flying. Not only of flying, but of airports, airport security, elevators and bridges—anything that forced upon him the sense of being stuck in a tight space. He often had anxiety attacks just picking people up from the airport, and the sound of the flight attendants closing plane doors triggered panic. He couldn’t imagine how he was going to sit inside an airplane for five hours over open ocean, with no way of getting out or getting off until the craft landed. But now he’d planted the idea of Honolulu in her head, and he knew he had to try. *** Clinical aviophobia affects about 6.5% of the US population, and about 15% of us have at least some anxiety about flying, according to a 2015 survey by Chapman University. But our fears are largely misplaced. In 2013, over 32,700 Americans died in highway fatalities. Only 443 Americans that year died in all sectors of aviation, including skydiving, air shows, and those little charters that haul prospectors to remote rivers in Alaska, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Yet these statistics are of little comfort to nervous fliers. They tend to pay more attention to the highly-publicized crashes that happen every so often: the Germanwings flight flown into a mountain in the French Alps by a suicidal pilot in 2015; the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014; the EgyptAir jet that crashed into the Mediterranean in 2016. Those high-profile disasters are extremely rare. But they can dominate the 24-hour news cycle, sending media consumers into loops of anxiety. Luckily, there are people who devote their careers and volunteer their weekends to educate the anxious and help them recapture some of the joy of flying–or at least endure the bumps with equanimity. Breaking the cycle of fear requires a combination of coaxing, practice, and sitting through a good old-fashioned science class. *** Sanders hadn’t always been afraid of flying. His father was an amateur pilot, and as an adult, he often traveled for work. But when he was in his 30s, his mother became ill, and he began flying to see her between legs of business trips. “I never connected the dots. I wasn’t a big drinker, but I’d have a couple glasses of wine on the plane to dull the anxiety,” he recalls. Then he started adding prescription pills. Then he stopped flying altogether.  “They construct elaborate first-person, intense stories about their worst fears, then read them over and over until they cease to be anxious.” “Somebody who develops an anxiety disorder around flying reacts to it in a kind of catastrophic way,” says Dr. Jason Guy Richards, a psychologist who specializes in anxiety disorders. “They are distracting themselves rather than processing it out. If you find ways to reify its danger, that’s what causes it to grow.” Dr. Richards adds that “escape and avoidance behaviors”—such as refusing to even drive near the airport, much less fly—are common. But confronting the fear is actually the best way to manage it. In Dr. Richards’ office, patients do disaster scripting. “They construct these really elaborate first-person intense stories about their worst fears of flying, then read them over and over until they cease to be anxious about the words and images,” says Dr. Richards. It may sound cruel to force already-skittish fliers to contemplate engine failure and fiery crashes. But desensitizing patients to their fears can actually help them to stop avoidance behaviors. Sometimes, the patient and psychologist sit inside a parked, locked car—mimicking the claustrophobia of a plane—and read the scripts together. “We get very good results from that,” he says. With Hawaii looming, Sanders also decided to face his fears. He signed up for a course at SeaTac’s Fear of Flying clinic, where a volunteer team of pilots, psychologists, flight attendants, and clinic graduates would help him control his phobia. At the clinic, clients learn from experts like Captain Robin Boone, who flew for Northwest Airlines for 35 years. Boone is both utterly convinced of the safety of planes and passionate about correcting misinformation. “So many people are just wracked with fear about flying, and it’s chiefly due to myths, falsities, lack of knowledge,” says Captain Boone. “I’ve never met a fearful pilot. Why aren’t pilots afraid? They know how flying works!”  “I’ve never met a fearful pilot. Why aren’t pilots afraid? They know how flying works!” Over two full weekends, clinic clients pick up the skills they need to take to the skies. Armed with binders full of diagrams and explanations, they tour air traffic control towers and maintenance facilities to see the complex ground systems that support flight. Some of the most common anxiety triggers for fearful fliers are crowds, enclosed spaces, and anticipation of motion sickness. So a psychologist teaches visualization, breathing, and body relaxation techniques to cope with those situations. A meteorologist explains why lightning strikes won’t harm an airplane. Pilots demonstrate the redundancies built into mechanical systems. Sanders particularly responded to understanding the science behind flying: “You’re arming yourself with knowledge,” he says. “With a little bit of knowledge, all of a sudden you can fight the anxiety.” The clinic’s graduation is a short flight together, often from Seattle to Spokane, Washington. For many, this is trial by fire. Captain Boone recalls one man who “had pulled the window shade all the way down, eyes closed, gripping his hands … I said, ‘Come on let’s raise it just a little bit.’ He raised it about an inch and saw a little daylight. Then a little more. Finally he said, ‘Look at that! There’s cars out there! There’s people!‘ He had a smile on his face as big as a Cheshire Cat.” Airplane manufacturers are also doing their part to help anxious fliers cope. Turbulence, for example, is one of the big triggers in aviophobia. As Captain Boone puts it: “Turbulence can’t hurt you, period.” But for many of us, jolts of rough air trigger some innate urge to grip the seat cushions and pray—or at the very least, complain that the beverage cart can’t come around. As manufacturer of many of the world’s commercial airplanes, Boeing has studied passenger response to turbulence. Boeing’s 787 “Dreamliner” planes incorporate a “smooth ride technology” that helps the plane anticipate high-amplitude pops. By monitoring changes in airflow and sending that information to the flight controls, the plane can adjust accordingly before the turbulence hits. “It’s kind of like putting the airplane on Prozac,” says Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing.  Boeing decided to make cabin windows 65% bigger after research showed that people who sit by the windows often feel calmer. Mechanics aside, the size of windows, lighting in the cabin and size and location of overhead bins all create a holistic feeling that can affect how anxious passengers get on a flight. Boeing decided to make cabin windows 65% bigger after research showed that people who sit by the windows often feel calmer. Tucking overhead bins away from the seats creates a more spacious feeling for passengers, relieving claustrophobia. Colorful interior lighting which modulates throughout the flight is intended to alleviate the hard shock of entering a new time zone. Boeing even spent time redesigning the bin latches to blend into the new aesthetic. Obviously, there’s a commercial advantage to such a philosophy—happier passengers fly more frequently. So Boeing’s design and engineering aims to reconnect people to the marvel of flight. “It’s already in their brains. We want our designs to re-trigger that,” says Emery. “Just about every feature that we have, if it opens up the sky to you, that’s what we’re going for.” *** There is one group of people for whom the delight and discovery of flying seems never to fade: pilots. “I saw the Northern Lights from 40,000 feet, flying west during one of the meteor showers in the fall,” says Captain Boone. He adds that in 21,000 hours in the air, he has never once been bored in the cockpit. “From coast to coast, for four hours, we were just regaled by this display.”  “The ordinary things we thought we knew become new or more beautiful.” In Skyfaring, his poetic memoir of life as a pilot, Mark Vanhoenacker muses that flying, at its best, reconnects us to a sense of wonder: “Airplanes raise us above the patterns of streets, forests, suburbs, schools, and rivers. The ordinary things we thought we knew become new or more beautiful, and the visible relationships between them on land, particularly at night, hint at the circuitry of more or less everything.” Perhaps that sense of wonder is a stretch for most passengers. The simple ability to fly without fear is a good enough goal. Sanders—now a volunteer for the Fear of Flying clinic—did go to Hawaii with his wife for their anniversary, and they have returned every year since. That said, he’s still not thrilled by flying. “About partway through the first leg to Honolulu, I started to become anxious,” says Sanders. “I told myself hey, you don’t have to be euphoric.” Nowadays, he just tries to watch a movie and eat some peanuts “in reasonable comfort.” By now Sanders has settled into a routine. He crosses the sliver of open air between the jetway and the plane and feels, for a brief moment, the blast of wet Seattle cool; enters the tight, recycled tautness of the machine’s interior atmosphere; smiles, perhaps slightly nervously, at the flight attendants. And then he does one more thing: he always shakes hands with the pilot. Something about looking the pilot in the eyes, seeing his uniform and feeling a firm grip, comforts him. And then he straps in and rises, fast and furious, through the Seattle drizzle, bumps through the thick coating of clouds and bursts into unexpected sunlight. The sky is endless and pearl-blue, the clouds ripped open by the tips of mountains. Then the plane banks, and people shift their gazes from the sparkle of sunlight to the dull glow of screens and magazines. They turn toward open ocean. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.

They hope the single-engine two-seat aircraft will be able to replace the US Air Force's ageing fleet of T-38 trainer jets and meet the growing demand for future pilots capable of flying fifth-generation fighters. Recently, Sweden's Air Force itself experienced trouble in that the trainer planes it currently has in use have become far too obsolete to provide for the instruction of future Gripen pilots. Consequently, Saab, which previously suffered a row of painful setbacks when trying to sell its fifth-generation Gripen E jets across the globe, is now pinning its hopes on the T-X becoming a fixture in the US Air Force, which would obviously serve as its best advertisement in large parts of the world. The T-X is a "blank sheet" aircraft, specifically designed to meet US Air Force requirements for the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning. According to Boeing, the design is inexpensive, flexible and easily upgradeable. Remarkably, its twin tails were derived from Saab's Gripen and offer greater maneuverability and a higher attack angle.

Since a minimum order of 350 aircraft is anticipated, the major contract, worth 11 billion dollars, has attracted other major players as well.

The whole deal is estimated to be worth about $8 billion, and the Finnish military and politicians are looking at five different options, namely Saab's Gripen, Lockheed Martin's F-35, Boeing's F-18 Super Hornet, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault's Rafale. Saab's competitive edge is, first and foremost, its price. "A small nation like Finland needs to be able to afford to both purchasing and actually flying its jets. You do not buy something you can ill afford to use. But above all, it is important to have a plan that is capable of doing the job," Kim Jäämeri, the head of Finland's air force, told Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. Another competitive advantage of the Gripen is that Sweden and Finland traditionally maintain a very high level of cooperation. It could be further facilitated if the two countries used the same fighter jet. According to circulating rumors, the Gripen and the F-35 are the two hottest candidates. The F-35 is scheduled for use in the US and by a number of its allies, including Norway. ...

Dubstep music played while flashing lights illuminated a drop cloth unveiling of the aircraft model. Then company executives had one more surprise: two of the actual jets. The first Boeing T-X trainer aircraft was revealed to the public in St. Louis, Sept. 13th, 2016. This aircraft will represent Boeing in the upcoming competition for the U.S. Air Force Training Mission. Photo: Boeing “Our T-X design features: twin tails, a modern design that allows better maneuverability than a single tailed aircraft, stadium seating that provides rear visibility to the instructor … and a maintenance friendly design,” Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said at the event in St. Louis, according to Defense News. “Just as impressive is what you can’t see. What you can’t see is the advanced design and manufacturing that went into this.” Boeing partnered with Swedish firm Saab to make the trainer, which is powered by a single GE 404 engine made by General Electric. The aircraft has a glass cockpit and open software to communicate across the trainer’s systems and with the ground, according to a release from Boeing. The plane comes with a non-required perk, as well: the potential to accommodate two hardpoints where external or internal loads can be placed. Trainees will also be able to practice refueling in the air if the Air Force chooses to do so. Related Stories Boeing Signs $6.2B Defense Deals With UK Boeing, India Ink $1B Deal The two planes shown at the St. Louis event haven’t flown yet but one is expected to fly by the end of the year. The first one is currently undergoing ground tests while the other is set to begin structural proof tests soon to evaluate its strength and integrity. The company also mentioned that there were several new methods they were using to cut costs on the plane. That includes the use of 3-D printed polymer parts and assembling the plane without tools. “I don’t want to give away all of the competitive secrets here,” he said. “But we’re going to shatter that cost curve.”  The total contract offered by the Air Force is worth $11 billion, according to Popular Mechanics. Defense manufactuerer Lockheed Martin is also competing for the contract. Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Smallest jets from Boeing, Airbus offer 15% fuel saving and will open up new direct routes Thu, Sep 15, 2016, 12:57 Irish travellers are likely to be among the first to fly across the Atlantic in smaller planes. Photograph: Reuters         The smallest aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus are about to find a new role operating transatlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world’s biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 per cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range – just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern United States and western Europe. While eight hours on a 130ft plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travellers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that would not otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Cork and Shannon Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal’s TAP are among airlines buying the jets for transatlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing’s Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Cork and Shannon and Edinburgh and Birmingham in England to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. “The Max is very competitive,” Norwegian Air chief executive Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. “It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can’t go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure.” Boeing’s 757, the world’s longest single-aisle jetliner with about 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess modern models. ADVERTISEMENT Shorter flights The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on transatlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current transatlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada’s WestJet Airlines and link St John’s, Newfoundland, with Dublin – distance 2,000 miles – and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The UK and Irish routes planned for Norwegian’s 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they’ll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus’s A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, Norwegian spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The US carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with “transatlantic range”. TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the US. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country’s sixth-largest city. Aer Lingus Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, chief executive of parent company IAG, said in July, adding that the jet represents a “fantastic opportunity”. It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favoured successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. “For the moment we haven’t really got the planes out there,” said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. “But they’re coming.”       Topics: Bjorn Kjos Lasse Sandaker Nielsen Willie Walsh Yan Derocles Aer Lingus Airbus Boeing British Airways Iag Jetblue Airways Norwegian Air Norwegian Air Shuttle SAS Group United Continental WestJet Read More Ryanair’s profit forecast faces pressure as the airline cuts fares Wow Air to fly Dublin-Miami via Rekjavik Aer Lingus smartens service for ‘guests’ – just don't be late Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Germany says Commission has no right to decide on its fiscal space Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Among its plans is the 'double bubble' D8, which is a twin-hull plane that is designed to make the experience of flying more fuel efficient, with faster loading and unloading and a quieter, more comfortable takeoff. The design was initially developed by Aurora Flight Sciences and MIT in 2008, and now Nasa has awarded the company a $2.9 million (£2.19 million) contract to make a scale model of the aircraft.

A subscale model is shown being tested in a wind tunnel at MIT The design has the potential to cut fuel burn by 71 per cent, reduce noise and cut LTO NOx emissions by 87 per cent compared to a Boeing 737-800 narrow-body aircraft. A subscale model is shown being tested in a wind tunnel at MIT 'The idea there is to take some of the lift that you would normally get from the wings and try and move that to the fuselage,' said Michael Rogers, a research at Nasa's Ames Research Center.  'Another thing that's done to enable laminar flow on this vehicle is to reduce the sweep of the wings.  'It is easier to maintain laminar flow if the wings, instead of being swept back like a lot of modern commercial transports, are more sort of perpendicular to the side of the body of the plane.' According to Aurora, the D8 takes its inspiration from the famed Boeing 707 of 1958, which not only introduced the public to single-day world travel, but also used a tube-wing design that redefined passenger aircraft. The D8 is designed to fly at 582 mph (936 km/h) with 180 passengers over a range of 3,500 miles (5,500 km).

A scale version of the 'Blended Wing Body' (BWB) aircraft is currently being tested at a Nasa facility. The triangle-shaped plane, that could one day be used by the US military, is reminiscent of spy planes and designed to cut through the air more efficiently. Boeing is developing the plane alongside Nasa, and testing at the Nasa Langley Research Center in Virginia, in a 14- by 22-foot (4.2 by 6.7 metre) subsonic tunnel, and will continue testing until the end of September. In the BWB design, the wing blends seamlessly into the body of the aircraft, which makes it extremely aerodynamic and creates dramatic cuts in fuel consumption, noise and emissions. Boeing and Nasa researchers are using a 6 per cent scale, 13-foot-wingspan model to test their designs. The researchers will be mapping the flow of air over the aircraft using lasers and smoke with a technique known as particle imagery velocimetry (PIV).

ROS LBoard 1 ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Liow confirms flap found in Tanzania belongs to MH370 Tarrence Tan | September 15, 2016 Transport minister says the serial number and date stamp on the debris was confirmed by Boeing and its retailing manufacturer to belong to the ill-fated Boeing 777. VIDEO INSIDE SEPANG: Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai today confirmed that the large piece of plane debris found off the coast in Tanzania in July belongs to flight MH370, which went missing two years ago. Liow revealed that the serial number and the date stamp on the debris – which was an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap – was confirmed by both Boeing and the retailing manufacturer as belonging to the Malaysia Airlines’ aircraft. “This means we have to study how the accident happened. Was it a controlled or uncontrolled plunge into the sea? “All this will be analysed in detail and we hope we can get more details from this debris,” he told reporters after officiating AirAsia’s Airbus A320NEO welcoming ceremony today. Present were AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes, British High Commissioner to Malaysia Victoria Marguerite Treadell and Ambassador of France to Malaysia Christophe Penot. In July, a piece of aircraft debris, believed to be the outboard wing flap, was found on Pemba island, Tanzania, in the Indian Ocean. The part was then transported to Australia and analysed by its Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB). In the same month, Australia’s Infrastructure and Transport Minister Darren Chester said that the debris was very likely from the missing MH370. So far, debris believed to be from MH370 has washed up on Reunion Island, Mozambique, Mauritius and South Africa. Flight MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 passengers and crew on board after taking off from Kuala Lumpur and heading for Beijing. Most of the passengers on board MH370 were from China. There were 50 Malaysians on board the plane. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story. We welcome your opinions to allow a healthy debate.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google September 14, 2016 Boeing 737 Max jets will launch the age of $69 one way trans-Atlantic fares and it should start in March 2017 airplanes, economic impact, europe, future, tourism, united states, world Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA hopes to sell one-way tickets to Europe for $69 as early as 2017 by flying from U.S. airports that have low fees, Chief Executive Officer Bjørn Kjos said in an interview. Norwegian has 100 737 MAX jets from Boeing on order and expects to receive five in 2017. Boeing has said the 737 Max jets could be ready for delivery as early as March 2017. The 737 max 8 will have a range of a little over 4000 miles. According to Norwegian Air chief commercial officer Thomas Ramdahl, his airline is awaiting Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplanes to begin offering $69 trans-Atlantic flights. Ramdahl told Business Insider that his airline plans to make an announcement around November or December of this year with firm details of the $69 fares. "I can promise you that you will see trans-Atlantic flights on the 737Max next year," Ramdahl told us in an interview last week. "And that's when you will see the $69 fares." The 737 MAX 8 features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. As as result, the new jet offers airlines the range and performance to operate trans-Atlantic service with the lower cost of a narrow-body jet. the Boeing Co. is talking up ideas with potential customers that could include stretching the fuselage of the coming 737 MAX 9. The stretched MAX, the so-called MAX 10 — which would also include some engine upgrades — would reportedly be ready as early as 2020. The other option would involve larger CFM Leap-1A engines and could enter the market in 2022. Boeing is slated to deliver its first 737 MAX, one of the smaller Dash 8 models, to Southwest Airlines next year. Personal Norwegian Experience I have personally flown Norwegian three times on round trips. During off season prices from Oakland to Stockholm can be about $500 round trip. There is Vegas to Oslo flights in Nov as little as $300 round trip. Buying the tickets direct or with a discounter, the meals and checked bags are all extra (except the carry on bag). Picking the seat is extra. So we did not pick the seat and checked only one bag. Meal price comparable to price at a european airport. It is possible to bring sandwiches and snacks on board. The Dreamliner is fantastic. With air pressure and humidity like you are at a lower altitude than other planes. I felt less jet lag. Jumbo and other large jets are not giving you more space in most cases.

The challenge is identifying what in the various reports is directly relevant to the New Zealand aviation sector, and then determining how New Zealand companies can pursue the opportunities they present. Some of the interesting announcements included: Boeing predicts China will need 6810 new aircraft in the next 20 years Boeing’s 2016 market outlook estimates 15,130 new aircraft will go into Asia/Pacific in the next 20 years, Airbus puts it at 13,460. Asia/Pacific is predicted to need between 232,000 and 248,000 new pilots and between 217,700 and 268,000 new engineers in commercial aviation in the next 20 years, according to Boeing and Airbus China needs 2800 – 3000 new pilots per year but trains less than half that number Vietnam ordered 40 new aircraft from Airbus earlier this month, bringing total aircraft on order to 151. It has minimal domestic training capability New Zealand is well placed to take advantage of many of the training opportunities that are arising. In 2016, the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand introduced a new Part 147 maintenance training organisation rule and a new integrated professional pilot training programme. The new training rule and programme are aligned to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) rules which are followed in much of the Asia/Pacific region. ‘We can now provide training that our customers are familiar with, we have become more relevant and more credible to them’, said Nicholson. This is an important step in realising some of the new business opportunities. A number of our trainers are now recognised by the aviation regulators in several Asia/Pacific markets and several have been approved to train for specific markets. ‘Approval by overseas markets is another positive step’, said Nicholson.. While India and the UK have been important markets for our training industry for many years, we are seeing markets such as China, Japan, Indonesia, the Middle East, PNG and Vietnam becoming increasingly important. In many cases, the ability to open and build markets works best when Government and Industry work collaboratively. Vietnam is a good case in point where a Government to Government aviation collaboration agreement was signed last November and a good number of Vietnamese are now being trained by New Zealand companies, both in Vietnam and New Zealand. Developing opportunities presented by recent announcements in the Asia Pacific region is not for the faint hearted. It requires commitment, can be helped by collaboration between New Zealand companies, and can be accelerated where Industry and Government address one of the biggest challenges faced: ‘Why New Zealand’. ‘Get things right and our aviation training industry has a very bright future’, said Nicholson. -- Key facts about Aviation New Zealand Aviation New Zealand exists to lead, inspire and grow the New Zealand aviation industry.

The airline will run a twice-weekly service operated by an A330-200 aircraft with 250 seats. (AP) BEIJING, Sept 14, (AFP): China will become the world’s first trillion-dollar aviation market as its expanding middle class takes to the skies in ever greater numbers, US manufacturer Boeing predicted Tuesday. The world’s most populous country is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet worth $1.03 trillion by 2035, Boeing said in its annual China Current Market Outlook. Passenger traffic is estimated to increase 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years as the country reforms its economy to rely more on consumption and the service industry to drive growth, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” he said. Chinese carriers have been expanding their fleets and adding new point-to-point services to cater to both leisure and business travel demand from an increasing number of affluent consumers in China and throughout Asia, Boeing said. “The continuing expansion of China’s middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China’s long-haul market,” said Tinseth. Of the 6,810 new aircraft it will need during the 2016-2035 period, 75 percent will be single-aisle planes with 90-230 seats, Boeing said. A total of 1,560 widebody aircraft are seen as needed, according to the company. China’s rapidly growing e-commerce business — already the largest in the world — also drives demand for cargo planes, with 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters forecast to be added over the next two decades. A quarter of Boeing’s deliveries over the last three years were to Chinese airlines, it says. Boeing, maker of the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, competes with Europe’s Airbus for global dominance in the aircraft market. The US firm says it made more than half of China’s commercial jetliners currently in operation, while Airbus says it has an almost 50 percent share. But both Boeing and Airbus are facing rising competition from Chinese rivals, who are supported by the government as Beijing sees the lucrative, technology-intensive industry as of strategic importance and a symbol of national pride. In November last year, state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) rolled out the C919, China’s first domestically developed narrow-body passenger plane that would compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320. Airbus in March started construction on a new facility to deliver wide-body planes in China while Boeing has reportedly submitted to the Chinese government plans for a factory in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Tinseth said Boeing was “absolutely” vigilant about Chinese competitors. “With such a large domestic base, there is an opportunity” for a Chinese airplane maker, he told reporters. “There are areas with COMAC where we’re partners, and there are areas where we compete. We will be strong partners and we will be strong competitors,” he said. Boeing said in July it expected a combined 39,600 jets worth $5.9 trillion will be needed globally over the next 20 years.

QuickTake Jumbo Jets The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 percent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range -- just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. A Boeing Co. Max 737 jet. Photographer: Mike Kane/Bloomberg While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travelers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn’t otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Portugal’s TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing’s Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. “The Max is very competitive,” Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. “It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can’t go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure.” Boeing’s 757, the world’s longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS AB serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada’s WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John’s, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 2,000 miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The U.K. and Irish routes planned for Norwegian’s 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they’ll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus’s A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. Irish Interest JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with “trans-Atlantic range.” TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country’s sixth-largest city. Ireland’s Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a “fantastic opportunity.” It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 -- dubbed the Max 10 -- that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade’s end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It’s also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. “For the moment we haven’t really got the planes out there,” said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. “But they’re coming.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Starting Oct. 14, Boeing will halt overtime for salaried employees not entitled to overtime pay by law "except in the case of pre-approved production- or mission-critical work," according to an internal memo confirmed by a company spokesman. When such work is needed, "Boeing organizations that pay exempt overtime - and most don't - will pay it only when it is discussed with and approved in advance by the employee's direct manager," the memo said. Pay for Boeing's union employees will follow existing labor contracts and overtime for those workers is already managed. "This new policy is another step in the company's efforts to improve our affordability and competitiveness so that we can better position ourselves to grow sales to customers," spokesman Chaz Bickers said in an email. Boeing is under intense pressure to win sales over rival Airbus, as airlines have slowed buying new jetliners. Weak sales, particularly of twin-aisle jetliners, may make Boeing miss its target of selling about 740 plane sales this year, Boeing's chief executive said on Wednesday. The overtime memo told managers of U.S.-based exempt salaried employees that they should arrange staffing to reduce the use of overtime through such measures as sharing work across similar teams, training employees or using flexible schedules. "By curbing exempt overtime pay, Boeing is challenging leaders and employees to come up with work solutions that curb the need to work overtime," said the memo, which was first reported by the Seattle Times. Boeing's white-collar engineering union said the new policy likely would not affect many of its 19,000 members, since they are governed by labor contracts. Professional engineers receive regular pay plus $6.50 an hour when they work past 40 hours. A group of about 20 pilots do not have that provision. A spokesman for the machinists union said it was not immediately clear what impact the change would have on its 31,000 members.

LOUIS, Sept. 14 (UPI) -- Boeing and its partner Saab have displayed a new production trainer aircraft to be offered to the U.S. Air Force. The aircraft put on display Tuesday is the T-X, designed specifically for the U.S. Air Force training mission. Boeing said the aircraft takes advantage of the latest technologies, tools and manufacturing techniques. "Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come," said Leanne Caret, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and chief executive officer. The Boeing T-X aircraft is a twin-tailed, single-engine jet with an advanced cockpit with embedded training. "It's an honor to build the future of Air Force training," said Saab President and CEO Hakan Buskhe. "We have created the best solution thanks to great cooperation and a clear strategy since day one." The U.S. Air Force plans to replace its fleet of aging T-38 aircraft. The Boeing-Saab partnership is one of several competitors for the contract.

The plane manufacturer lifted its forecast for China, and said the nation is likely to become the first country with an aviation market exceeding $1 trillion in the next two decades. Chinese airlines are estimated to purchase 6,810 airplanes valued at $1.025 trillion in the next 20 years. Among the new deliveries, Boeing predicts that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total, and China's widebody fleet is to triple in size over the next two decades. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Meanwhile, low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services between smaller cities to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. In the last five years, the number of direct international flights to and from China saw a surge of 150 percent. Direct flights between second-tier Chinese cities and overseas cities have been the main driving force of the growth. Tinseth said the continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new relaxed visa policies and a wide range of wide body airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives Boeing sufficient reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market. Li Xiaojin, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said China is expected to have a surge on international travel volume. By 2020, China is likely to witness 200 million international trips annually. "The trend of airlines to add more international flights between first-tier Chinese cities and second-tier foreign cities, and vice-versa, is likely to continue to grow rapidly, since the direct flights between first-tier cities are nearly saturated, and demand is keeps growing." On the other hand, driven by China's growing e-commerce business－already the largest in the world－air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. In the past five years, the express delivery services saw an average annual growth rate in their total volume of 55 percent, and sales revenues grew by an annual average of 39 percent, according to the State Post Bureau.

Dennis Muilenburg said Boeing also might miss its target of selling about 740 jetliners this year, having booked just 355 net orders so far. Airlines have cooled on buying new planes, especially large twin-aisle models, and some analysts had already factored a sales miss into their forecasts. While Boeing is still aiming for its target, "there's nothing that's driving us with a sense of urgency that we have to hit" it, Muilenburg said at an investor conference hosted by Morgan Stanley. Boeing's near-record backlog of about 5,700 plane orders will keep the factories humming, and Boeing will not cut prices just to generate sales, he said. Still, Muilenburg said Boeing may cut production of 777 jets further than its current projections if sales of the twin aisle model continue to lag. The 777, one of Boeing's most successful and profitable planes, is undergoing a makeover that will add new engines and wings and other refinements. Boeing makes 777s at a rate of 8.3 a month, and had already announced plans to cut output to seven a month next year as it shifts to the new 777X model, which enters production in 2018. But Boeing has sold just eight 777s this year, far short of the 40 to 50 needed to sustain production at those levels. "So, obviously, pressure there," Muilenburg said. "We need to be successful on some (777 sales) campaigns over the next two to three months to hold that seven-a-month rate," he said. "If we don't, we'll have to adjust." Cutting 777 production would "add pressure" to Boeing's goal of hitting its profit-margin target and would reduce revenue, Muilenburg said. But Boeing's ramp up in production of single-aisle 737s, also very profitable, would offset the decline. Defense sales also are expected to be "flattish" next year, he said. But there are signs that U.S. defense spending could rise, and "strong pockets of growth" in Middle East and Asia Pacific regions could help. Cost cutting and streamlining across all of Boeing and its supply chain, and rising deliveries, should keep profits and cash flow rising, he said.

From the point of view of the assailants the attacks were near miracles of logistical calculation, timing, courage in execution and devastation inflicted upon the targets. The Pearl Harbor base containing America’s naval might was thought to be invulnerable, yet in half an hour 2000 were dead, and the cream of the fleet destroyed. This week, within an hour on the morning of September 11, security at three different airports was successfully breached, the crews of four large passenger jets efficiently overpowered, the cockpits commandeered, navigation coordinates reset. In three of the four missions the assailants attained successes probably far beyond the expectations of the planners. As a feat of suicidal aviation the Pentagon kamikaze assault was particularly audacious, with eyewitness accounts describing the Boeing 767 skimming the Potomac before driving right through the low lying Pentagon perimeter, in a sector housing Planning and Logistics. The two Trade Center Buildings were struck at what structural engineers say were the points of maximum vulnerability. The strength of the buildings derived entirely from the steel perimeter frame, designed — so its lead architect said only last week — to withstand the impact of a Boeing 707. These buildings were struck full force last Tuesday morning by Boeing 737s, with fuel tanks fully loaded for the long flights to the West Coast. Within an hour of the impacts both buildings collapsed. By evening, a third 46-story Trade Center building had also crumbled. Not in terms of destructive extent, but in terms of symbolic obliteration the attack is virtually without historic parallel, a trauma at least as great as the San Francisco earthquake or the Chicago fire. There may be another similarity to Pearl Harbor. The possibility of a Japanese attack in early December of 1941 was known to US Naval Intelligence and to President Roosevelt. Last Tuesday, derision at the failure of US intelligence was widespread. The Washington Post quoted an unnamed top official at the National Security Council as saying, “We don’t know anything here. We’re watching CNN too.” Are we to believe that the $30 billion annual intelligence budget, immense electronic eavesdropping capacity, thousands of agents around the world, produced nothing in the way of a warning? In fact Osama bin Laden, now prime suspect, said in an interview three weeks ago with Abdel-Bari Atwan, the editor of the London-based al-Quds al-Araby newspaper, that he planned “very, very big attacks against American interests.” Here is bin-Laden, probably the most notorious Islamic foe of America on the planet, originally trained by the CIA, planner of other successful attacks on US installations such as the embassies in East Africa, carrying a $5 million FBI bounty on his head proclaiming the imminence of another assault, and US intelligence was impotent, even though the attacks must have taken months, if not years to plan, and even though CNN has reported that bin-Laden and his coordinating group al-Qaeda had been using an airstrip in Afghanistan to train pilots to fly 767s. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, when hijacking was a preoccupation, the possibility of air assaults on buildings such as the Trade Center were a major concern of US security and intelligence agencies. But since the 1980s and particularly during the Clinton-Gore years the focus shifted to more modish fears, such as bio-chemical assault and nuclear weapons launched by so-called rogue states. This latter threat had the allure of justifying the $60 billion investment in Missile Defense aka Star Wars. One of the biggest proponents of that approach was Al Gore’s security advisor, Leon Fuerth, who wailed plaintively amid Tuesday’s rubble that “In effect the country’s at war but we don’t have the coordinates of the enemy.” But the lust for retaliation traditionally outstrips precision in identifying the actual assailant. By early evening on Tuesday America’s national security establishment was calling for a removal of all impediments on the assassination of foreign leaders. Led by President Bush, they were endorsing the prospect of attacks not just on the perpetrators but on those who might have harbored them. From the nuclear priesthood is coming the demand that mini-nukes be deployed on a preemptive basis against the enemies of America. The targets abroad will be all the usual suspects: rogue states, (most of which, like the Taliban or Saddam Hussein, started off as creatures of US intelligence). The target at home will of course be the Bill of Rights. Less than a week ago the FBI raided Infocom, the Texas-based web host for Muslim groups such as the Council on Islamic Relations, the Islamic Society of North America, the Islamic Association for Palestine, and the Holy Land Foundation. Palestinians have been denied visas, and those in this country can, under the terms of the CounterTerrorism Act of the Clinton years, be held and expelled without due process. The explosions of Tuesday were not an hour old before terror pundits like Anthony Cordesman, Wesley Clark, Robert Gates and Lawrence Eagleburger were saying that these attacks had been possible “because America is a democracy,” adding that now some democratic perquisites might have to be abandoned? What might this mean? Increased domestic snooping by US law enforcement and intelligence agencies; ethnic profiling; another drive for a national ID card system. Tuesday did not offer a flattering exhibition of America’s leaders. For most of the day the only Bush who looked composed and control in Washington was Laura, who happened to waiting to testify on Capitol Hill. Her husband gave a timid and stilted initial reaction in Sarasota, Florida, then disappeared for an hour before resurfacing at a base in Barksdale, Louisiana, where he gave another flaccid address with every appearance of bring on tranquilizers. He was then flown to a bunker in Nebraska, before someone finally had the wit to suggest that the best place for an American president at time of national emergency is the Oval Office. Other members of the cabinet were equally elusive. Secretary of State Colin Powell, who has managed to avoid almost every site of crisis or debate, was once again absent from the scene, in Latin America. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld remained invisible most of the day, even though it would have taken him only a few short steps to get to the Pentagon press room and make some encouraging remarks. When he did finally appear the substance of his remarks and his demeanor were even more banal and unprepossessing than those of his commander in chief. At no point did Vice President Cheney appear in public. The presidential contenders did expose themselves. John McCain curdled the air with threats against America’s foes, as did John Kerry, who immediately blamed bin-Laden and who stuck the knife firmly into CIA director George Tenet, citing Tenet as having told him not long ago that the CIA had neutralized an impending attack by bin-Laden. Absent national political leadership, the burden of rallying the nation fell as usual upon the tv anchors, all of whom seem to have resolved early on to lower the emotional temper, though Tom Brokaw did lisp a declaration of War against Terror. Tuesday’s eyewitness reports of the collapse of the two Trade Center buildings were not inspired, at least for those who have heard the famous eyewitness radio reportage of the crash of the Hindenberg zeppelin in Lakehurst, New Jersey in 1937 with the anguished cry of the reporter, “Oh the humanity, the humanity.” Radio and tv reporters these days seem incapable of narrating an ongoing event with any sense of vivid language or dramatic emotive power. The commentators were similarly incapable of explaining with any depth the likely context of the attacks; that these attacks might be the consequence of the recent Israeli rampages in the Occupied Territories that have included assassinations of Palestinian leaders and the slaughter of Palestinian civilians with the use of American aircraft; that these attacks might also stem from the sanctions against Iraq that have seen upward of a million children die; that these attacks might in part be a response to US cruise missile attacks on the Sudanese factories that had been loosely fingered by US intelligence as connected to bin-Laden. In fact September 11 was the anniversary of George W. Bush’s speech to Congress in 1990, heralding war against Iraq. It was also the anniversary of the Camp David accords, which signaled the US buy-out of Egypt as any countervailing force for Palestinian rights in the Middle East. One certain beneficiary of the attacks is Israel. Polls had been showing popular dislike here for Israel’s recent tactics, which may have been the motivation for Colin Powell’s few bleats of reproof to Israel. We will be hearing no such bleats in the weeks to come, as Israel’s leaders advise America on how exactly to deal with Muslims. The attackers probably bet on that too, as a way of making the US’s support for Israeli intransigence even more explicit, finishing off Arafat in the process. “Freedom,” said George Bush in Sarasota in the first sentence of his first reaction, “was attacked this morning by a faceless coward.” That properly represents the stupidity and blindness of almost all Tuesday’s mainstream political commentary. By contrast, the commentary on economic consequences was informative and sophisticated. Worst hit: the insurance industry. Likely outfall in the short-term: hiked energy prices, a further drop in global stock markets. George Bush will have no trouble in raiding the famous lock-box, using Social Security Trust Funds to give more money to the Defense Department. That about sums it up. Three planes are successfully steered into three of America’s most conspicuous buildings and America’s response will be to put more money in missile defense as a way of bolstering the economy.

The aircraft is expected to achieve initial operational capability in 2024. Through the T-X programme, the USAF will be able to acquire new two-seat jet trainer for fast-jet training to replace the Northrop T-38 Talon, which is in service for more than 43.5 years. More than 350 aircraft are expected to be ordered to replace the T-38, with plans to increase the overall purchase to more than 1,000. Image: The T-X aircraft. Photo: courtesy of Boeing.

El Al Israel Airlines Ltd. (TASE: ELAL) continues to move forward with its Boeing Dreamliner airplane purchase mega-deal worth $1.025 billion. On Monday, the company reported signing a sale and lease back agreement with an undisclosed foreign company for two of the 787-8 planes purchased from Boeing. RELATED ARTICLES El Al profit doubled in Q2 El Al blames pilots for delays and disruptions El Al begins marketing cruises El Al to buy and lease 15 Boeing Dreamliners Once Boeing delivers the airplanes, they will be sold to the foreign company and leased back to El Al, which announced that this agreement is not expected to a have any material financial effect and that the deal could be terminated under certain conditions. El Al has also signed a 787-9 lease deal with the same company and is expected to lease four Boeing Dreamliner airplanes for 12 years, with the option of stopping the lease on some of them after 10 years. Two of the airplanes are to be delivered to El Al in 2018 and two more in December 2019 and August 2020. This deal with Boeing, which El Al CEO David Maimon CEO has called, "The largest procurement plan in El Al history," comprises the purchase of 16 787-7 and 787-9 Dreamliner planes, motors and spare parts. The payment for each plane will be provided upon handover to the company, excluding an advance payment provided earlier on, under the terms of the deal. In March, El Al published a request for proposals for financing entities, for the funding of advance payment for three planes it owns and is expected to receive in 2018, but has not yet provided any updates on this issue. In June, the airline offered several companies to buy its Boeing 747-400 fleet, as part of preparations for the receipt of the Dreamliners, and has been examining the proposals received. In the past few months, El Al, controlled by Knafaim Holdings Ltd. (TASE: KNFM), held by spouses Tami and Dedi Borovich and Poju Zabludowicz, has been enjoying the slump in global oil prices. Last month, it reported its results for the first half of 2016, with a net profit of almost $14 million, after making a profit of slightly more than $1 million in the corresponding half in 2015. Its semi-annual revenue remained stable, at $934 million. Following these strong results, El Al share prices have soared 125% in the last year, reflecting a market cap of NIS 1.7 billion. In the past three years, El Al shares had the second highest return on the stock exchange (second only to electric appliance importer Tadiran Appliances Ltd.), shooting up 740%.

The single-engine, two-seater aircraft is the focus of a major competition worth billions of dollars to replace the US Air Force's aging fleet of T-38 trainers with a modern design for future pilots of fifth-generation fighters. Boeing and Saab revealed two production T-X aircraft, which will be used to demonstrate the aircraft's capabilities to the Air Force and the US Defense Department. The T-X is a "blank-sheet" aircraft designed specifically to meet Air Force training requirements for pilots of fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Lightning II. Boeing says the design is inexpensive, flexible, and easily upgradeable as new technology comes online. Like most trainers, the T-X has a sleek, greyhound-like design with a single-engine and twin tails derived from Boeing's F/A-18 for greater maneuverability and a high angle of attack. It also has stadium seating and an advanced cockpit with embedded training as well as the ability to blend with state-of-the-art ground-based training. In addition, it is maintenance-friendly in anticipation of decades of service. The two production T-X aircraft have already been built will be followed by three more to demonstrate competitiveness in terms of quick delivery against competitors that are offering off-the-shelf aircraft. If successful, the T-X will replace the Air Force's fleet of 400 T-38 aircraft that have been in service for over half a century and the first T-X would enter service in 2024. Since the program anticipates a minimum order of 350 aircraft, this is a major contract worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Such a win would not only look good on Boeing's books, but it would also allow the company to reassert itself in the warplane market after losing out on the F-35 fighter and the Long Range Strike Bomber competitions to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, respectively. In addition, training aircraft often find secondary overseas markets as light fighter aircraft, so another revenue stream is possible. But this is far from a done deal. The Boeing/Saab T-X faces stiff competition from the partnership of Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries, as well as Northrop Grumman, Alenia Aermacchi, and Textron AirLand. The videos below show the T-X being prepared for rollout and an animation of a pair strutting their stuff.

Boeing released its annual China Current Market Outlook (CMO) today in Beijing, estimating the total value of those new airplanes at US$1.025 trillion. China becomes the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing's forecast. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes in a statement today. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Tinseth said the backlog from Chinese customers demonstrates that the new 737 MAX 8 and the current Next-Generation 737-800 are at the heart of the single-aisle market. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X. This year's forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China's single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China's widebody fleet only represents approximately 5 percent of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business - already the largest in the world - air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. Worldwide, Boeing projects investments of US$5.9 trillion for 39,620 new commercial airplanes to be delivered during the next 20 years. The complete forecast is available at www.boeing.com/cmo. Today, Boeing jets are the mainstay of China's air travel and cargo system. More than 50 percent of all the commercial jetliners operating in China are Boeing airplanes. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model - the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the world's most technologically advanced airplane, the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies. --BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Najib Condemns Missile Attack On Makkah Zahid Discusses Strengthening Bilateral Ties With Japan Rally Theatrics Of The Opposition - Najib Other News Headlines Selangor Umno Cannot Stop Members From Participating At Tomorrow's Rally - Noh- politic Labuan IBFC To Offer Cost-effective & Lucrative Solutions To Local Businesses- business Seeded Players Progress Into National Squash Tourney Semi-finals- sports Malaysia's Halal Products Welcomed In China- features Former Sri Lankan Diplomat Arrested For Corruption- world Most Read News Democracy Means Follow The Constitution - Salleh Minimum 3A, 3B In UPSR For Fully Residential Schools' Admission Former Bernama Executive Editor Hurt In Robbery By Two Armed Men Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

The Boeing T-X is an all-new aircraft designed specifically for the U.S. Air Force training mission, and takes advantage of the latest technologies, tools and manufacturing techniques. It is an advanced aircraft designed to evolve as technologies, missions and training needs change. The design is more affordable and flexible than older, existing aircraft. “Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come,” said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret.

Boeing and its partner Saab are competing against several other military contractors to win the bid to build a replacement for the aging T-38 used by the U.S. Air Force to train pilots. (Jeff Roberson/Associated Press) By Julie Johnsson, Bloomberg Published: September 13, 2016, 4:54 PM A   A Boeing’s future in the fighter-jet business may ride on the Air Force’s $11 billion contest for a new trainer aircraft, with the planemaker’s factory hub in St. Louis on the line. The world’s largest aerospace company faces a dogfight with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon for the contract to produce about 350 jets through the T-X advanced trainer program. The winning entry would replace the aging T-38 fleet on which U.S. military pilots have honed their flying skills since 1961. Boeing is the last of the major defense contractors to reveal its concept, developed with Sweden’s Saab, for the competition that kicks off late this year. And there’s more than a little symbolism to the site the company chose for Tuesday’s event to unveil the design: the manufacturing center where it churns out F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-15 fighter jets. “This is their last chance to provide a next-generation dedicated military aircraft for the company and St. Louis,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace and defense analyst with Teal Group. “The Super Hornet can go on for another five years easily, and ditto for the F-15. But the bridge to a sixth-generation fighter would depend on some kind of combat version of this.” Military aircraft contests are few and far between in an era of budget constraints, and the Chicago-based planemaker needs new orders to preserve the Missouri industrial base and engineering acumen gained with the 1997 acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. Boeing’s military arm has been eclipsed by the rapid growth of the commercial jet unit this decade, with the defense division accounting for 31 percent of sales last year compared with 50 percent in 2010. The manufacturer has suffered high-profile losses: last year’s stealth bomber competition to Northrop Grumman, and the joint strike fighter contest to Lockheed’s F-35 in 2001. Boeing’s largest recent contract win, valued at $51 billion, is for an aerial refueler derived from its 767 jetliner, which is manufactured outside Seattle. The winning T-X design may go on to claim hundreds of overseas orders and spare parts stretching over decades. The Pentagon program is expected to spur other countries to upgrade their trainer fleets. Teal Group forecasts a global market for 2,737 turbine trainers valued at $32.3 billion over the next decade, a large increase from the $19.9 billion of the aircraft delivered from 2006 through 2015, according to a June research report. The Air Force isn’t expected to release final contest criteria until December, picking a winner next year who would begin production in fiscal 2018. While the need for a modernized training fleet is certain, funding may be squeezed by programs like the F-35 fighter, KC-46A tanker and a new stealth bomber, the Congressional Research Service said in a December 2015 report. What’s also uncertain is how the Air Force will weigh an aircraft’s performance against its production costs. Boeing and Northrop may be at a disadvantage since they are bidding clean-sheet designs against in-service models: the T-50A offered by Lockheed and Korea Aerospace Industries, and Raytheon’s T-100, based on Leonardo’s M-346 trainer. Aboulafia thinks the Lockheed aircraft has an edge “as the only off-the-shelf, supersonic design.” By teaming with Sweden jet-fighter manufacturer Saab, Boeing gained a way to tamp down costs and jump-start sales in international markets, said George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview. “There’s a reason why a number of these teams teamed up with foreign participants,” he said.

A large piece of debris found in Tanzania recently which has been confirmed as a part of a wing flap from missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet MH370. Photo: Australian Transport Safety Board The fragment, said to be the inboard section of the right, outboard flap of the plane, was recovered in June. MH370, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, had 239 people on board when it vanished in March 2014. The Boeing 777 is presumed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean after veering off course. The piece is now being examined for any evidence that may indicate how the flap was operating at the time of separation from the wing, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a report. This could help throw light on whether the plane was being flown when it came down in the sea. The part numbers and a date stamp on the piece, recovered on Pemba island, helped the investigation. Aircraft debris, suspected to be part of the missing MH370 Malaysian airlines plane, found at the Gris Gris public beach near Souillac, in the southern part of Mauritius Island on May 24. Photo: AFP PHOTO / Mauritius National Coastguard In addition to the Boeing part number, the report said, the identification stamps had an "OL" number, both unique identifiers to part construction. The Italian part manufacturer then recovered build records for those numbers, confirming that they belonged to the missing plane. A number of other pieces of debris, some confirmed to have come from MH370, have been found in recent months off the coast of neighbouring Mozambique and Madagascar. They include a section of the wing called a flaperon, found on Reunion Island, and a horizontal stabilizer from the tail section and a stabilizer panel with a "No Step" stencil discovered in Mozambique. All the debris are believed to have been driven westwards from the presumed crash site on ocean currents. Australia has been leading the search for the missing aircraft, using underwater drones and sonar equipment deployed from specialist ships. The search, also involving Malaysia and China, has led to more than 105,000 sq km of the 120,000 sq km search zone being scoured so far. But countries have agreed that in the absence of "credible new information" the search is expected to end later this year. - BBC Tags: transport MH370 Malaysia Airlines Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Google Plus Share on Reddit Share on Linked In Copyright © 2016, Radio New Zealand Next story in World Suicide blast kills Pakistan worshippers Related Stories Malaysian authorities 'ignoring' new MH370 evidence 10 Aug 2016 A group representing the families of those onboard missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 say the Malaysian Government isn't interested in investigating what could be crucial new evidence.

Saturday, November 19, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Nation  Malaysia confirms Tanzania debris came from MH370 September 16, 2016, Friday PUTRAJAYA: Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) experts have concluded that the debris discovered on the island of Pemba, off the coast of Tanzania, in June this year originated from the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 aircraft, said Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai. He said the ATSB, with the concurrence of the MH370 Safety Investigation Team, made the conclusion based on thorough examination and analysis of the debris, an outboard flap which was found on June 20 this year. Liow said ATSB had identified several part numbers, along with physical appearance, dimensions and construction, and confirmed the piece to be an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap. “A date stamp associated with one of the part numbers indicated manufacture on Jan 23, 2002, which was consistent with the May 31, 2002, delivery date for MH370,” he said in a statement here yesterday. In addition to the Boeing part number, he said, all identification stamps had a second “OL” number that were unique identifiers relating to parts construction. Liow said the Italian parts manufacturer had confirmed that all numbers located on the part related to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404. He said the manufacturer also confirmed that aircraft line number 404 was delivered to Malaysian Airlines and registered as 9M-MRO (MH370). “As such, the experts have concluded that the debris, an outboard flap originated from the aircraft 9M-MRO, also known as MH370,” he said. Liow said further examination of the debris would continue in hopes that further evidence might be uncovered to provide new insight into the circumstances surrounding flight MH370. He said the Transport Ministry would continue to provide updates as and when new information becomes available. Liow also extended the ministry’s appreciation to the authorities in Tanzania and Australia for their support and assistance. Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board. The plane has yet to be found despite a massive search operation in the southern Indian Ocean where it was believed to have ended its flight. – Bernama What do you think of this story?

Denmark this year said it would buy the Lockheed Martin Co. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon's biggest weapons program. Boeing had offered its F/A-18 Super Hornet. The Eurofighter Typhoon, built by a consortium of Airbus Group SE, BAE Systems PLC, and Leonardo-Finmeccanica SpA also lost out. Though U.S. contractors often challenge Pentagon decisions, such action is rare overseas. "We believe the Ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," Debbie Rub, vice president and general manager for global strike programs at Boeing, said Thursday. The Danish Defense Ministry in May recommended the purchase of 27 F-35 combat planes to replace the country's aging F-16 jets. Denmark has been using the F-16, also made by Lockheed Martin, in the Middle East as part of the coalition striking Islamic State targets. The decision was later endorsed by the government in June. Denmark said it planned to take delivery of the planes between 2021 and 2026. The decision was a setback for Boeing, which has been scrambling for export orders to keep the F/A-18 in production. U.S. orders for the plane are nearing an end. "We're taking this step because there's too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet," Ms. Rub said. Boeing has slowed production to just two jets a month, though the company has become more confident over the past year that it can keep the line in St. Louis open into the 2020s. Dan Gillian, the jet's program manager, said this week Boeing was confident about securing additional orders from the U.S. Navy. It is also trying to complete an order for as many as 28 planes from Kuwait that is still awaiting final U.S. government approval after Israel raised concerns about the planned deal. Boeing also remains hopeful it can secure a share of Canada's plan to update its fighter fleet after shelving an initial plan to acquire F-35s from Lockheed Martin Corp. The Danish Defense Ministry published its selection criteria and said the F-35 won in all categories covering everything from military performance to industrial aspects. The document angered both losing bidders. Boeing said it has submitted a so-called Request for Insight to the Danish Defense Ministry, requiring it to turn over documents related to the decision. The ministry said Boeing would be given access to the information. A spokeswoman said the process had been "transparent" and led to broad political agreement. "It is natural that in a process like this only the company that wins ends up being satisfied," she said. Airbus, which led the losing Eurofighter bid, Wednesday said it noted Boeing's move "with interest." The Toulouse, France-based plane maker said "we have similar concerns about the rigor of the competition and the quality of the technical assessment of the candidates." Airbus said it remained in talks with the Danish government to have those concerns addressed.

Your next trans-Atlantic trip may be on Boeing's humble 737 (Bloomberg)—The smallest aircraft made by Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE are about to find a new role operating trans-Atlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world's biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 percent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest intercity services. At the same time the revamp has added about 500 miles to their range—just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 3,000 miles between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. While eight hours on a 130-foot plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travelers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn't otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. At the same time, people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh; Birmingham in England; and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic Coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 4,000 miles, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of more modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1,200 miles. While ranges have increased, the 3,300-mile reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operates services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS AB serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City Airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with near-normal loads are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin—distance 2,000 miles—and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The U.K. and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 3,000 miles. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway as well as Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus' A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 4,000 miles using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. IRISH INTEREST JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 3,500 miles from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city. Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9—dubbed the Max 10—that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of midrange aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. "But they're coming." Boeing Co. United Continental Holdings Inc.

Boeing said it had submitted a request to the country's ministry of defence that would require it to provide all materials related to the procurement evaluation and decision announced in June. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," said Boeing vice president Debbie Rub. In May Boeing challenged the Danish government's recommendation to buy 27 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, questioning data which suggested its Super Hornet fighter jet was a more expensive option. A ministry report in May evaluating each fighter jet candidate was based on data estimating that the Super Hornet would have a service life of 6,000 flying hours, while Boeing thinks the right figure for Denmark is 9,500 hours. The report also concluded that the total cost of the F-35 jet is 42.2 billion Danish crowns ($6.4 billion) while the Super Hornet would cost 60.6 billion crowns.

Plane Part Found Off Tanzania From Flight MH370 International Business Times 15-09-2016 Suman Varandani © Provided by IBT US A large flap section found on the island of Pemba, off the coast of Tanzania, belongs to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said Thursday. The announcement by ATSB, which is leading the search for the Flight MH370, comes as the search for the missing plane is set to be suspended in December. ATSB released photos of the flap section and explained why they believe the debris piece was from the outboard flap of a Boeing 777, the same aircraft as Flight MH370. Over the last few months, several debris pieces have been found, with some being linked to the missing jet. However, there is still no evidence as to what happened to the place which disappeared from radar on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board while on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. "On arrival at the ATSB, several part numbers were immediately located on the debris that confirmed the preliminary identification. This was consistent with the physical appearance, dimensions and construction of the part," ATSB wrote. "All of the identification stamps had a second “OL” number, in addition to the Boeing part number, that were unique identifiers relating to part construction. The Italian part manufacturer recovered build records for the numbers located on the part and confirmed that all of the numbers related to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404. Aircraft line number 404 was delivered to Malaysian Airlines and registered as 9M-MRO." © Photo: ATSB Exemplar part number and date stamp. Exemplar part number and date stamp.

(Photo: ATSB)  Enlarge Caption  Email More A A KUALA LUMPUR: A large piece of debris that was discovered on Pemba island off the Tanzanian coast on Jun 20 came from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai confirmed on Thursday (Sep 15).  In a statement, Mr Liow said this was deduced by experts from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) with the concurrence of the MH370 Safety Investigation Team. Earlier, in July, Australia's Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Darren Chester had said that it was "highly likely" the part came from the ill-fated Boeing.  One of the reasons was that "several part numbers, along with physical appearance, dimensions and construction confirmed the piece to be an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap", said the minister. He added that a date stamp associated with one of the part numbers indicated manufacture on Jan 23, 2002, which is consistent with the May 31, 2002 delivery date for MH370.   Other clues include how the Boeing part number and all the identification stamps had a second "OL" number that uniquely identify part construction. The Italian manufacturer of the flap also supported that all the numbers located on it relate to the same serial number part that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404 - tacked to a delivery to Malaysian Airlines registered as 9M-MRO or MH370.  "Further examination of the debris will continue," the statement read.  - CNA/hs Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

The US planemaker is deep in talks with customers over ways to fill the gap in its offerings between the narrow-body 737 and wide-body 787 Dreamliner families, as Airbus Group SE grabs sales with the A321neo jet. Talks are focused on two potential planes: The so-called Max 10, a stretched version of the largest 737 model that could reach the market by decade’s end, and the first of a family of mid-range jets to debut about five years later. “We could potentially do both,” Muilenburg said yesterday at a Morgan Stanley conference, noting that sticking with its current portfolio is also an option. “We’re looking across all of those scenarios. We don’t see any of those changing our R&D and capex profile over the five-year time period because of the timing.” Keeping new airplane spending in check is crucial for Boeing, which is finally breaking even on the 787 Dreamliner after a decade of production and about US$30 billion (RM123.8 billion) in deferred costs. The Chicago-based company’s research and development spending should peak this year, Muilenburg said, as Boeing starts to make the first 787-10, prepares for the 737 Max’s debut next year and finalises design for the 777X, which is targeted for a 2020 market entry. Cash challenges Since he took over as chief executive last year, Muilenburg has sought to improve efficiency within Boeing’s sprawling factories and through its supply chain. Raising profit margins to the “mid-teens” by decade’s end would give the aerospace company the means to invest in products while still handing over a cash bounty to shareholders. But Boeing could be hard-pressed to hit cash-flow targets as it counts on the 787 Dreamliner and higher narrow-body output to offset lower production rates for the 777 and the costs of developing the initial 777X, David Strauss, an analyst at UBS Group AG, said in a Sept 12 report. He estimates the 777X will burn US$7 billion to US$8 billion prior to initial delivery in 2020. “We think BA cash generation will come through below expectations as 787 progress is offset by initial 777X investment, tougher pricing in the backlog, pension, customer advances and cash taxes,” Strauss wrote. ‘Viable option’ Muilenburg is confident Boeing could develop a new narrow-body quickly and without much strain on its resources if there is sufficient interest from airlines and lessors. The new model, dubbed the Max 10, would enter service by 2019 or 2020 and be a “relatively minor development program,” he said. “That’s a viable option and a potential opportunity for us in the marketplace,” Muilenburg added. “We’re thinking through the business case right now, talking with customers.” Bloomberg reported Sept 8 that Boeing and CFM, the engine maker for the Max, have focused in recent weeks on a simple redesign of the 737 that would approach the range and capacity offered by Airbus’s hot-selling A321neo. The new, longer jet would need a relatively uncomplicated new landing gear and would benefit from a performance upgrade that increases the thrust of the Leap-1B engines developed for the latest 737 models. Boeing also is studying a more extensive revamp of the aircraft that would use a larger engine created for Airbus by CFM, which is a venture of General Electric Co and Safran SA. The engineering and design work on the proposed models would come as Boeing wraps up the most intensive planning for the planes already in its new-product pipeline. “I like the sequencing,” Muilenburg said. “If we need to, we can do a Max stretch or a middle-of-market airplane or both and they would feather in very nicely and give us a nice, stable R&D profile.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Prospect of US interest rates hike weighs on ringgit With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Neil Patrick Harris stars as Count Olaf in trailer for ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ Jessica Chastain in ‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Joe Sutter, father of the Boeing 747, dies at 95 Boeing says it will cut more than 4,500 jobs by mid-2016 United reported to have ordered 25 more Boeing 737s worth US$2b Boeing wins US$1.3b 737 order from China’s Okay Air Boeing forecasts 2016 earnings below estimates as shares tumble Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Boeing to curb overtime for US salaried workers to reduce costs Reuters 9/14/2016 By Alwyn Scott Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Wednesday it is curbing use of paid overtime by 80,000 salaried workers based in the United States, part of a company-wide effort to reduce costs to deal with intense competition. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 146.04 +0.71 +0.49% Starting Oct. 14, Boeing will halt overtime for salaried employees not entitled to overtime pay by law "except in the case of pre-approved production- or mission-critical work," according to an internal memo confirmed by a company spokesman. When such work is needed, "Boeing organizations that pay exempt overtime — and most don't — will pay it only when it is discussed with and approved in advance by the employee’s direct manager," the memo said. Pay for Boeing's union employees will follow existing labor contracts and overtime for those workers is already managed. "This new policy is another step in the company’s efforts to improve our affordability and competitiveness so that we can better position ourselves to grow sales to customers," spokesman Chaz Bickers said in an email. Boeing is under intense pressure to win sales over rival Airbus (AIR.PA), as airlines have slowed buying new jetliners. Weak sales, particularly of twin-aisle jetliners, may make Boeing miss its target of selling about 740 plane sales this year, Boeing's chief executive said on Wednesday.© REUTERS/Robert Sorbo/File Photo File photo of fuselage of a Boeing 787 in Everett The overtime memo told managers of U.S.-based exempt salaried employees that they should arrange staffing to reduce the use of overtime through such measures as sharing work across similar teams, training employees or using flexible schedules. "By curbing exempt overtime pay, Boeing is challenging leaders and employees to come up with work solutions that curb the need to work overtime," said the memo, which was first reported by the Seattle Times. Boeing's white-collar engineering union said the new policy likely would not affect many of its 19,000 members, since they are governed by labor contracts. Professional engineers receive regular pay plus $6.50 an hour when they work past 40 hours. A group of about 20 pilots do not have that provision. A spokesman for the machinists union said it was not immediately clear what impact the change would have on its 31,000 members.

The T-X aircraft is designed to specifically prepare pilots for duty in the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II environments, among others. What's great about this training aircraft is that it has been 'future-proofed', thanks to flexible technological architecture that can be upgraded and evolved as technology moves forward. This training aircraft features a single-engine setup and an advanced cockpit for exceptionally immersive training, and features a structure and engineering setup that makes it easy to maintain and repair. While aircraft devoted to military campaigns receive all the attention, training aircraft play a crucial role in preparing pilots for duty, which is why the T-X aircraft is such an important development.

View Latest Posts >>> Leaked Report Blows Lid Off Bellingcat’s Systematic Lying in MH17 Investigation By Ian Greenhalgh on September 14, 2016 We hate to say we told you so, but we did... [Editor’s note: This leaked report doesn’t tell us anything new, however it does confirm several things that we have been saying since the tragic downing of MH17, primarily that the Western narrative was complete lies and that neither Russia nor the Donbass rebels were guilty of shooting down the Boeing. There is still a lot of unknowns in the MH17 case and we do not have a clear picture of the actual events; the same can be said of the MH370 case and there is a good deal of circumstantial evidence that these are not unrelated cases and in fact, the disappearance of MH370 and the destruction of MH17 may well be very closely linked indeed. It bears repeating that MH370 was never lost, that Rolls Royce knew where the plane was and the truth is being hidden from us by a cover story involving the most unlikely scenario of the plane mysteriously flying off into the empty southern ocean to eventually meet a watery end far from land. Nothing we have been told about MH370 bears scrutiny and the same can be said of MH17, in both cases we have been fed a steady diet of lies and deceit. We may never know the whole truth behind these two airliners (or is it just one airliner?) and what is really tragic is that the families of those onboard MH370 will probably never get answers as to what happened to their loved ones. Ian] __________ Sputnik Leaked Report Blows Lid Off Bellingcat’s Systematic Lying in MH17 Investigation Later this month, Dutch prosecutors will publish the second part of their probe investigating the July 2014 destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 in east Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian media have gotten ahold of a separate report breaking down the lies and half-truths used by the Bellingcat group to blame Russia for the catastrophe. On July 17, 2014, at the peak of fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and anti-Kiev militia, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, on route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was destroyed, killing all of 298 passengers and crew onboard. Kiev and independence supporters in Ukraine’s southeast quickly blamed each other for the catastrophe. Last October, Dutch investigators published a report which said that MH17 appeared to have been shot down by a Buk surface-to-air missile system, produced by Russia’s Almaz-Antey defense concern. Investigators could not conclusively determine the precise area that the missile was fired from. Dutch Gov’t Feared ‘Impotence’ in Wake of MH17 Crash Could Lead to Unrest Almaz-Antey went ahead with its own investigation into the crash, finding that the missile which hit the plane could only have been launched from the settlement of Zaroshchenske, Donetsk Region, which was under the control of Ukrainian forces at the time of the incident. Last month, Dutch officials announced that their Joint Investigation Team, working on the criminal investigation into the catastrophe, would release the first results of their investigation on September 28. Headed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor, the investigation is expected to show precisely the kind of weapon that was used, and from where it was fired. On Tuesday, the Novaya Gazeta newspaper published a 31-page leaked document, signed by Almaz-Antei representative Mikhail Malyshevsky. The paper suggested that the report’s conclusions may very well serve as the basis for Russia’s possible response to the Dutch investigation; the document, prepared on the basis of an investigation by specialists from Almaz-Antei, breaks down in great detail the erroneous and sometimes outright falsified evidence presented by Bellingcat, a group of Western journalists heavily engaged in investigating the plane’s destruction. The downing of Flight MH17 has turned into one of the organization’s main pet projects, and according to Dutch media, Bellingcat’s work is being actively considered by Dutch investigators for their investigation. Despite Russian investigators’ thorough efforts to counter Bellingcat’s claims in the past, the group has continued to persist in suggesting that anti-Kiev militia, and indirectly, Russia, were responsible for the downing of the Malaysian Boeing. As a result, Russian experts have been forced to go through great lengths to refute the misinformation presented by Bellingcat. Among its most recent claims is footage from a car video recorder, said to have been shot on July 17, 2014, ostensibly showing a rebel-controlled Buk moving toward what Bellingcat’s account says was the likely launch site of the missile that downed MH17. In reality, this video could not have been shot any later than July 15, 2014, since the road the DVR-equipped car was traveling on was damaged by a rebel motor column including heavy tracked vehicles on that day. Another of Bellingcat’s charges revolves around a satellite image showing a white transport truck carrying the rebel Buk allegedly used to shoot down the MH17 on its trailer. But that image was proven to be a fake, given that three of the vehicles Bellingcat claims were part of the Buk convoy are actually pictured going in the opposite direction along the highway depicted. Moreover, the shadow given off by the truck and its cargo is not characteristic of the Buk’s distinctive shape, and is facing in the wrong direction relative to the time of day the shot was said to have been taken (11:08 AM on July 17, 2014). Next, Russian experts dissected the claim made by Bellingcat regarding a photograph purporting to show launch smoke coming from the Buk missile in an area near the alleged launch site on July 17. According experts, this photo was either digitally altered or taken at another date, since other photo and video evidence from July 17 have confirmed that the weather in the area was cloudy, not clear, as claimed by Bellingcat. Another Bellingcat claim revolves around the suggestion that a missile defense space-based infrared system (SBIRS) successfully pinpointed the launch site. In fact, detecting a Buk launch using SBIRS system is virtually possible, given that detecting and determining a fired ballistic missile’s trajectory requires more time than the Buk would be expected to fly. As to the crucial Bellingcat claim – that MH17 was hit by a single Buk SAM in the hands of the Donbass militia, the report reiterated that this is a practical impossibility, since the detection range of a single Buk is limited to 120 degrees in azimuth and 7 degrees in elevation, and its effectiveness of fire is limited. A single Buk system can guard only a pre-assigned airspace sector with knowledge of its potential targets’ parameters, up to and including enemy flight time (that is, to wait in ‘ambush’ mode). Independently and without this information, normally provided by support systems elsewhere in the military command, a single Buk is not capable of precisely locating and then hitting its target. The detailed, technical and expert-oriented 31 page report leaked by Novaya Gazeta also revealed that Almaz-Antei took the unprecedented step of providing Dutch investigators with the genuine specifications of the Buk system. This, the report suggested, was meant to preclude the use of erroneous or otherwise inaccurate data which investigators obtained from various sources, including publically available materials. “The use of such materials inevitably led to erroneous results and conclusions. Precisely in order to avoid these mistakes, the decision was made to transfer the real technical characteristics of the Buk missile to the Dutch Safety Board,” the report explained. As for Bellingcat, the report saved a special criticism for them regarding the variant of the Buk missile used to shoot down MH17, suggesting that the group does not have and cannot know the precise technical characteristics and technical documentation which would enable them to make an accurate distinction between the variants of the 9M38 missile. As for Almaz-Antei, their report from October 2015 not only included this information, but even showed the results of two full-scale experiments to recreate the crash, conclusively demonstrating that the Malaysia Airlines Boeing was downed by an old Buk model fired from Ukrainian territory.

FaceBook Comments 9 Responses to "Leaked Report Blows Lid Off Bellingcat’s Systematic Lying in MH17 Investigation" William Bourne  September 16, 2016 at 12:05 pm The truth that MH-370 is actually MH-17 (proven by its unique paint scheme) would have been common knowledge by now if not for our censored news. Zionist monopoly Western MSM suppressed this to protect their own including the likely Israeli hijackers. If it had been widely known, public pressure would have demanded tracking satellite telemetry data for both engines (known to exist) be requisitioned to reveal where and when MH-370 has been flown or parked since it disappeared. That would lead to finding out the fate of passengers on board, finding the hijackers, and finding out who else may have been involved. Log in to Reply William Bourne  September 16, 2016 at 12:43 am The first photo at: veteranstoday.com/2016/04/25/russian-lawmaker-praises-new-bbc-documantary-on-boeing-crash-in-donbass displays evidence proving that this wreck was indeed the long missing MH-370. If you were to examine previous online photos of this airplane, you will find that it was purchased new about two years prior to the crash. The paint and graphics were never changed since new, so any photo of MH-370 will be correct, whereas MH-17 was about 12 years old on its third repaint (and other of this airlines 777’s were older as well). We are only interested in comparing these two using the third (and last) repaint scheme of MH-17. The paint schemes are alike to the casual glance, but certain identified anomalies are present only on MH-370. One of these is that the flag on previous photos of MH-370 is different than on MH-17. It shows noticeably less tilt, whereas when extended downwards, the left and right edges align far differently with the windows below.

Many familiar names involved. Freestone makes cloaking devices. The Chinese co-owners of an 80% interest in the patent, based on increasing the efficiency of semiconductor fabrication, were killed in the crash, leaving Jacob Rothschild as sole owner. http://www.voltairenet.org/article183486.html Garry Compton  September 15, 2016 at 9:29 am As soon Obama’s Boys wouldn’t produce the truth that they said they had that the Russians shot it down – should have finalized the outcome – NATO/ Ukies shot it down for a FF. The pics i saw showed that the crew got shot in the back – also – and then there was the other senario that the MH-17 was carrying germ war-far virus’s and was headed to Krashnadar or Rostov and it needed to be eliminated — either way a western ” act of war’. A whole bunch of Rats know who shot it down – but the Rats are well paid with american bucks and euros. The Americans saved most of the Nazi’s after WWII — it ain’t going to happen this time because the Americans/ EUers are the rats that no one will save.

The third-largest budget airline in Europe have announced that they're considering $69 (£52) flights to Edinburgh and Bergen, Norway, from US airports such as New York's Westchester County Airport and Connecticut's Bradley International Airport Average prices on such routes are likely to be closer to $300 (£228) round trip according to the airline's Chief Executive Officer Bjørn Kjos. Currently, many of Norwegian's fares can be as high as $500 (£380) because of higher fees levied by busier airports. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Is this the best birthday present ever?

Share this article Share 117 shares The potential plans are part of Norwegian's broader move to cut prices and take a share of the market from traditional flag carriers that dominate trans-Atlantic flights. While airlines such as Lufthansa offer travelers hundreds of destinations via connections in airport hubs, Norwegian is aiming to make nonstop service to small cities that straddle the Atlantic more common, which keeps costs low. The 737 MAX features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics which means these planes are equipped to traverse the Atlantic but are smaller than most jets that currently do so, making them a better size for international flights to cities such as Birmingham in Britain WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF BOEING 737 MAX JETS?  By increasing the fleet to 100 737 MAXs, Norwegian estimate over 65,000 passengers will experience fewer delays Passenger capacity has been increased by 12 people by accommodating two more seat rows than the 737-700 The aircraft also boasts superior fuel efficiency which will reduce carbon emissions It has a 40% smaller noise footprint than today's single-aisle airplanes. Boeing Sky Interior intends to enhance travelling experience featuring improvements such as overhead bins and LED lighting as well as split scimitar winglets Planes will feature four new large-format display screens that will increase pilots' situational awareness and efficiency. There will also be a new digital regulator for the engine bleed air systems to improve its reliability The new and smaller engine has an advanced core and larger turbine fan Kjos said: 'I think you will see a lot to that effect within five years' time. What will happen to [Lufthansa] when everyone starts to fly direct?' Norwegian has 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets on order and expects to receive five in 2017. The 737 MAX 8 features new fuel-efficient engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. It means these planes are equipped to cross the Atlantic but are smaller than most jets that currently do so - making them a better size for international flights to cities such as Birmingham in Britain according to Kjos. Regulators will have to agree to set up customs stations at US regional airports to handle international traffic - although Kjos said he is confident this can be arranged. Norwegian is not the only airline to market cheap fares across the Atlantic. Iceland's Wow Air recently offered one-way fares between Boston and Paris for £75.  Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Eurowings is also starting cheap long-haul flights. The potential plans are part of Norwegian's broader move to cut prices and take share from traditional flag carriers that dominate trans-Atlantic flying Kjos downplayed the competitive threat of Eurowings, saying, 'I don't believe in their being able to operate low cost with a Boeing 767,' in part because the widebody planes save less fuel and have smaller range than planes such as Boeing Dreamliners in Norwegian's fleet. Norwegian separately reported on Tuesday that it filled 96 per cent of long-haul plane seats in September, helping the airline post better-than-expected results.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 117 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

The project takes advantage of the latest technology, tools and manufacturing techniques. The design specifications make the aircraft more affordable and flexible than older iterations. “Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come,” said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret. The Boeing T-X aircraft has one engine, twin tails, stadium seating and an advanced cockpit with embedded training. The system also offers state-of-the-art ground-based training and a maintenance-friendly design for long-term support. “It’s an honor to build the future of Air Force training,” said Saab President and CEO Håkan Buskhe. “We have created the best solution thanks to great cooperation and a clear strategy since day one.” The Air Force’s aging T-38 aircraft have a limited service life and the the new Boeing design has been slated to replace them when they enter into service in 2024. www.boeing.com Share Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Tags Boeing Saab T-X Related Boeing, Airbus offer positive outlook for aircraft demand Boeing designs autonomous underwater vehicle Study shows aerospace giant Boeing contributes $3 billion to Canadian economy Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The customer, Cayman Islands-based Global IP, will use the satellite to deliver streaming media, digital broadcast and other communications services to Sub-Saharan Africa. GiSAT will have a coverage area encompassing 35 countries and 750 million people. “Our vision for GiSAT is to provide end users with connectivity and services that are affordable, rich in local content and truly broadband in nature,” said Bahram Pourmand, CEO, Global IP. “With the ability to reconfigure the GiSAT on-board processor, the Boeing digital payload will allow us to broadcast different channels to different beams from different locations, providing better service to broadcasters, mobile operators and ISPs.” Scheduled to enter service in 2019, GiSAT is designed to operate with more than 10 gateways in Europe and multiple gateways within Africa. Privately owned Global IP was founded by three satellite industry veterans with 75 years of combined experience providing satellite products and services in emerging markets.  The company CEO, Bahram Pourmand, was until recently Executive Vice President and General Manager, International Division of Hughes Network Systems LLC.  The other two founders, Emil Youssefzadeh and Umar Javed were founders and executives of STM, one of the VSAT industry pioneers with a 15 year track record in Africa before sale of STM in 2013 in a private equity transaction.

It projected a demand for 6,810 new airplanes in the country over the next two decades, estimating the total value of the new aircraft at US$1.025 trillion. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing with Boeing Commercial Airplanes, was quoted as saying in a company statement. With travel and transportation becoming key services, passenger traffic is expected to grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the coming 20 years, he said. China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to the statement. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business, air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in the country, with a need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters in the future, said the statement. Globally, Boeing predicted investment of US$5.9 trillion for 39,620 new commercial airplanes to be delivered during the next 20 years, with China accounting for 17 percent of the total in both value and number.

The breakthrough towards developing commercially viable low carbon fuel is the result of a partnership between Virgin Atlantic and LanzaTech. Since 2011 they have been committed to producing the world’s first jet fuel derived from waste industrial gases from steel mills via a fermentation process. The Lanzanol was produced in China at the Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials certified Shougang demonstration facility. The innovative alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process was developed in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Lab with support from the US Department of Energy and with the help of funding from HSBC. LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic are now set to continue to work with Boeing and a host of industry colleagues to complete the additional testing aircraft and engine manufacturers require before approving the fuel for first use in a commercial aircraft. Assuming all initial approvals are achieved, the innovative LanzaTech jet fuel could be used in a first of its kind proving flight in 2017. Following a successful ‘proving flight’ the data collected will enable the partnership to seek approval to use the fuel on routine commercial flights. This would also help pave the way for LanzaTech to fund and build their first commercial jet fuel plant to supply fuel to Virgin Atlantic and other airlines. As a U.K. based partnership it is hoped the first LanzaTech jet fuel plant would be based in the U.K. Sir Richard Branson said, “This is a real game changer for aviation and could significantly reduce the industry’s reliance on oil within our lifetime. Virgin Atlantic was the first commercial airline to test a biofuel flight and continues to be a leader in sustainable aviation.” “We chose to partner with LanzaTech because of its impressive sustainability profile and the commercial potential of the jet fuel. Our understanding of low carbon fuels has developed rapidly over the last decade, and we are closer than ever before to bringing a sustainable product to the market for commercial use by Virgin Atlantic and other global airlines.” Dr Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive of LanzaTech, said, “We can now truly imagine a world where a steel mill can not only produce the steel for the components of the plane but also recycle its gases to produce the fuel that powers the aircraft. This program illustrates that such breakthroughs are only possible through collaboration. In this case, it is governments (US DOE, FAA, DARPA), laboratories (PNNL, AFRL, SWRI, MTU, UDRI), NGOs (RSB) and industry (Virgin, HSBC, Boeing, Shougang, Airlines for America) coming together to disrupt our current global carbon trajectory.” “We look forward to working with colleagues past, present and future to make this pioneering new fuel a commercial reality."       Related Articles UPM joins below50 coalition to scale up sustainable fuels White House decarbonization report addresses biofuels, biomass Groups celebrate Navy’s first ‘net-zero’ energy base ICM: Flight powered by biofuel made from residual wood Changing cell behavior could boost biofuels, medicine Gevo: Cellulosic ATJ fuels flight, isobutanol blend sold in Texas       Join Our Mailing List ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT   ADVERTISEMENTS Home Subscribe Now Advertising Magazine Blog E-Newsletter Events About Us Contact Us Ethanol Producer Magazine Biodiesel Magazine © Copyright 2016 - BBI International - All rights reserved.

Nicole Gelinas September 15, 2016 Public safety Sully—the Clint Eastwood-directed movie about US Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger’s crash-landing of a passenger plane in the Hudson River seven years ago—is a hit. The story carries a comforting message: flying is so safe that even a crash is just an inconvenience. But safety itself breeds danger. This week, federal regulators released their report into the near-catastrophe of Delta Flight 1086 from Atlanta to New York 18 months ago. The litany of human errors that investigators catalogued got little attention. But the report should serve as a reminder: flying is not inherently safe. It is safe only when people respect the system that keeps it safe. If Delta Flight 1086 had crashed at LaGuardia on a snowy day last March, killing some of the 132 people on board, the tragedy would have generated front-page headlines for weeks. Americans can be thankful that they haven’t seen such headlines in more than seven years. No American airliner has fatally crashed since 2009, when 50 people died as a Continental commuter flight crashed near Buffalo. Americans who fly today fear terrorism, not mechanical or human error. This safe stretch is unprecedented. Before 2007, America rarely had a year without a major plane disaster. In November 2001, American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in Queens, killing 265 people. In 1996, TWA Flight 800 crashed off Long Island, killing 230. In 1990 and 1985, Americans saw three major air crashes in the news. Go back further, and commercial flight was truly dangerous. Last year, Judy Blume published her novel, In the Unlikely Event, based on her experience growing up in the 1950s near Newark Airport, when three planes crashed in just eight weeks. Delta’s flight last year came close to breaking the current streak. On March 5, the airliner’s plane was “substantially damaged,” investigators from the National Transportation Safety board concluded this Tuesday, when the Boeing MD-88 ran off the runway and stopped just short of Flushing Bay. Almost everything that can go wrong on an airplane did go wrong on Flight 1086. The pilots faced an immediate challenge: bad weather. With plenty of experience, they knew that landing at LaGuardia in the snow would be a challenge. As the NTSB reports, they spent “considerable time” during the flight analyzing whether they’d be able to stop the plane on the runway. They also asked for braking reports 35 minutes before landing. But crews from the Port Authority, which runs the airport, were clearing snow, so no one was landing planes to report conditions. Plus, the Port Authority wasn’t using the best technology to measure “friction,” even though it said it was doing so. The airport operator’s “policies . . . need clarification,” investigators said. Pilots, then, didn’t get braking reports until 16 and eight minutes before landing, when they learned that conditions were good. Upon emerging from clouds, though, “the flight crew expected to see at least some of the runway’s surface,” the NTSB reports. Instead, “the flight crew saw that the runway was covered with snow.” Faced with “situational stress,” the captain essentially panicked. Because of that stress and “operational distractions,” investigators say, he landed the plane with an “aggressive” move, putting the engines into reverse to help stop the plane. The move exceeded the setting for a “contaminated runway” by 59 percent. That abrupt strain on the plane caused a “loss of aerodynamic directional control”—basically, Flight 1086 was a runaway plane. What ultimately saved the passengers and crew was dumb luck. After the crash-landing, it took 17 minutes to get everyone off the plane. The crash broke a wing and knocked out the plane’s communications, but the plane didn’t catch on fire or explode. The captain—likely still rather stressed out—“did not convey a sense of urgency to evacuate the cabin,” investigators concluded. Flight attendants were “confused” and didn’t follow proper procedures. The fact that passengers “climbed off the plane dressed in their heavy winter coats and scarves”, as ABC7 reported, shows either that flight attendants didn’t clearly instruct them to leave everything behind, or that passengers didn’t listen, wasting time that could have been critical. After the evacuation, the plane’s crew couldn’t give rescuers an accurate passenger count, leaving out two infants. “Flight and cabin crews . . . should be able to provide emergency responders with an accurate passenger count . . . upon exiting the airplane,” investigators noted, because such information could be lifesaving in a rescue effort. Federal investigators painstakingly set out this chain of events as a warning. Had just a few things gone differently, their report could easily have become a document of the banal series of actions, inactions, and errors that caused dozens of people to die. In a crisis, frightened crew members and passengers did the wrong thing, multiple times, with their errors compounded by the fact that they and others didn’t do their jobs properly before it became an emergency. The NTSB account is a useful reminder: airplanes are not magical machines, and they cannot land in any weather. Plane and runway engineers build in room for error. But ground and flight crews still can make enough errors to use up all of that room. The crew and passengers of Delta Flight 1086 were fortunate that their bad day never became more than a news blurb. Sometimes fate is on your side. But sometimes, it isn’t. When flying is this safe, it’s easy to forget that it’s not safe at all—and that it’s better for professionals to depend on good practices, not good luck, to save lives.   Nicole Gelinas is a City Journal contributing editor, the Searle Freedom Trust Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the author of After the Fall: Saving Capitalism from Wall Street—and Washington.

SpaceX says accident probe will not slow space taxi effort SpaceX on Thursday said efforts to develop and certify a space taxi for NASA are not being slowed by an investigation into a launch pad fire that destroyed its rocket and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite. Boeing Co and SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, are building spaceships to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. Asterias stem cell therapy shows promise in spinal cord paralysis: U.S. study An experimental stem cell therapy developed by Asterias Biotherapeutics restored some movement to patients paralyzed by recent spinal cord injuries, according to interim data from a small study being presented on Wednesday. One of the five patients in the trial regained use of both arms and hands, and is now able to feed himself, send texts on a phone and operate a wheelchair, the Fremont, California-based company said. Endangered Hawaiian crow shows a knack for tool use An endangered crow species from Hawaii that already is extinct in the wild displays remarkable proficiency in using small sticks and other objects to wrangle a meal, joining a small and elite group of animals that use tools. Scientists said on Wednesday that in a series of experiments the crow, known by its indigenous Hawaiian name 'Alala, used objects as tools with dexterity to get at hard-to-reach meat, sometimes modifying them by shortening too-long sticks or making tools from raw plant material. China launches second experimental space lab module China launched its second experimental space laboratory on Thursday, part of a broader plan to have a permanent manned space station in service around 2022. Advancing China's space program is a priority for Beijing, with President Xi Jinping calling for the country to establish itself as a space power, and apart from its civilian ambitions, Beijing has tested anti-satellite missiles. Possible air pollution link to Alzheimer's A possible causal link between air pollution and Alzheimer's disease has been suggested by scientists after they conducted detailed studies of brain tissue, in a joint British-Mexican project. Study co-author Professor Barbara Maher, of Lancaster University, and her research team examined the brain tissue of 37 individuals who had lived in either Mexico City or Manchester, both air pollution hotspots. SpaceX aims to resume launches in November, president says SpaceX is aiming to resume flights in November following a launch pad fire that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket and an Israeli communications satellite it was due to lift into orbit, the company's president said on Tuesday. The space services company suspended Falcon 9 flights while it investigates why the rocket burst into flames on Sept 1 as it was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Scientists decipher color of 'super cute' bristly dinosaur Scientists guided by small structures preserved in fossilized skin have deciphered the color and camouflage pattern of a little dinosaur with a parrot-like beak and bristles on its tail that roamed thick forests in China about 120 million years ago. Psittacosaurus was mainly brown but with a paler underside of the tail and belly, a pattern called countershading that may have helped the 5-foot-long (1.5-meter) bipedal plant-eater go unnoticed by hungry predators, the scientists said on Thursday.

NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- "Closed molding composites market projected to register a CAGR of 7.45% during forecast period" The closed molding composites market is projected to reach USD 66.58 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 7.45% between 2016 and 2021. The major driver stimulating the closed molding composites market is high demand from the aerospace & defense industry, as they have the ability to reduce weight and increase fuel efficiency. The advantages of closed molding processes over traditional molding processes (open mold process) such as improvement of productivity through innovative engineering approaches, minimization of energy consumption, and reduction of emission levels also drive the market. "Aerospace & defense is the fastest growing application segment in the closed molding composites market, in terms of value." The key drivers of closed molding composites in the aerospace & defense industry are the rise in number of airplane deliveries, high performance properties such as lightweight, excellent safety & acoustic features, and government regulations. Advanced closed molding composites offer higher fatigue tolerance, which helps in improving or increasing the structure of components. To comply with regulatory norms, aerospace manufacturers such as Boeing (U.S.), Airbus (France), GE Aviation (U.S.), and others have started using these composites to manufacture primary & secondary structures and interior components of aircraft. Thus, aerospace & defense application is likely to be the most profitable investment pocket for stakeholders. "Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing market of closed molding composites." Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing market for closed molding composites in the next five years. The market in this region is driven by increasing consumption of closed molding composite in various industries such as wind energy, construction, electrical & electronics, and transportation. China leads the market in Asia-Pacific. Its consumption has grown remarkably owing to growth in the wind energy, sporting goods, and aerospace & defense industries. The wind energy industry in China witnessed the highest number of wind energy installations in 2015; it added 30.8 GW of new capacity.

Boeing Co and SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, are building spaceships to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is looking to turn over crew transport to SpaceX and Boeing before the end of 2018, breaking a Russian monopoly. SpaceX is aiming for its first test flight to the station in 2017. "We're full-steam head for certification. We're still trying to remain on schedule," Abhishek Tripathi, director of certification for SpaceX, said during a webcast panel discussion at an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Long Beach, California. "I know what I need to do in the next day and in the next month," Tripathi said, adding that his work is not being affected by the accident investigation. SpaceX, with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration, is working to figure out why one of its Falcon 9 rockets burst into flames on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The blaze destroyed the communications satellite, owned by Israel's Space Communication Ltd, which was scheduled to be carried into orbit two days later. SpaceX has not yet disclosed how much damage was done at its primary launch site. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Wednesday the company was hoping to resume flights in November at a second, nearly complete launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, adjacent to the Air Force base. The company, which has a backlog of 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than $10 billion, also flies from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Samsung’s recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after several dozen caught fire and exploded may stem from a subtle manufacturing error, but it highlights the challenge electronics makers face in packing ever more battery power into ever thinner phones, while rushing for faster release dates. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) Click here to watch both videos in this story on your mobile app.  BETHESDA, Md. (AP) — U.S. regulators issued an official recall of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 phone on Thursday because of a risk of fire. Samsung already has voluntary recalled the devices after a few dozen devices exploded or caught fire. That was out of about 2.5 million phones sold. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is stepping in on a formal recall. Its chairman, Elliot Kaye, blasted Samsung for trying to do the recall on its own, saying that anyone who believes that to be adequate “needs to have more than their phone checked.” FILE – In this Thursday, Aug. 11, 2016, file photo, models hold Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones during a launch event at the company’s headquarters in Seoul, South Korea.  (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) Samsung promised replacement devices, but that was put on hold while regulators reviewed the situation. Kaye said customers will now be offered full refunds, not just replacement devices, if they choose. Note 7 owners need to contact Samsung and provide a number from the back of the phone to determine whether that unit is at risk. Kaye said about 1 million devices are affected. The recall comes at a crucial time for Samsung, as its rival Apple just announced its own latest versions of the iPhones, which go on sale Friday. The Note series is one of Samsung’s most expensive, and demand for the phone had been high. U.S. aviation safety officials also have taken the unusual step of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge the phone during flights, or put them in checked bags.

Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 percent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Sept. 19. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and — not least — the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a "tiny error" in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. "If Koh's argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company," Park said. "But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem." Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple's September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 percent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 percent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That's what happened with the Note 7, Samsung's Koh explained. "The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together," he told reporters in Seoul. It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7's design that it compromised safety. "There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity," said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute's battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. "Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode," Doh said. "It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety." The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone's battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is "one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we've seen in a phone," said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. "We don't think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries — more likely just a manufacturing defect," IFixit's Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. "You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else," he said, adding that the two rivals are "constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping." While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung's smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. "The security of the battery isn't directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not," Cho Joon-ho, head of LG's mobile business, told reporters. "But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand." __ AP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechMultimedia How ‘better, faster’ batteries backfired for Samsung 2016-09-15 15:02 - Mark Gurman and Alexandre Boksenbaum-Granier Post a comment 0 share: Samsung's Note 7 has experienced exploding battery problems. (Ariel Gonzalez / YouTube) RELATED ARTICLES Samsung struggles with critical Note 7 recall Exploding phones? Samsung's heir apparent has bigger challenges Samsung 'fixes' Note 7 by limiting recharges to 60% Tokyo - Samsung Electronics, under pressure from consumers for longer-lasting batteries that charge faster, pushed the limits of lithium-ion technology. The effort backfired when some of its new Note 7 handsets caught fire and exploded. Building a better battery has long bedeviled the tech industry. Smartphones are constantly improving, with sharper displays, improved software and cameras rivaling those used by the pros. Not so the batteries, which despite advances still die faster than consumers like and take too long to recharge. “It’s the race to add new capabilities and features to the phone that demands a more capable battery,” said Martin Reynolds, a Gartner analyst. On top of the demands placed on their performance, batteries are getting slimmer and smaller, as smartphone makers try to win over consumers with thinner devices. That’s putting strain on the manufacturing process, and raising the risk of defects that can lead to the kind of malfunctions seen in Samsung’s phones. The Note 7 was supposed to stand out with its stylus, large edge-to-edge display and faster charging technology. Samsung rolled out the device in August, just before Apple unveiled a new batch of iPhones. It was an opportunity for the Suwon, South Korea-based company to outshine its biggest smartphone rival. Instead, it backfired. Usually, smartphone makers and wireless providers rigorously test products before they reach customers, although the process is mainly focused on making sure the devices are compatible with wireless networks. Samsung provided carriers with the typical amount of testing time before the launch date, according to people familiar with the matter. Samsung first showed prototypes of the Note 7 to carriers in April and testing began in May, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements aren’t public. At least one major Samsung partner is reassessing its testing procedures to catch issues like this in the future, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The South Korean manufacturer is holding multiple meetings each week with major carrier partners to discuss the latest details from its investigation and assist in mitigating the issue, the person said. Headaches involving the production of lithium-ion batteries aren’t unique to the smartphone industry. Overheating battery packs made by Sony led to the recall of millions of laptops made by Dell, Toshiba and others in 2006, while Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner suffered from electrical fires after the airplane’s 2011 debut. “Based on our investigation, we learned that there was an isolated issue with the battery cell,” Samsung said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Overheating of the battery cell occurred when the anode-to-cathode came into contact with each other, causing a very rare manufacturing process error.” Samsung is working to fix the problem. While only about three dozen cases were reported, the company is seeking to replace 2.5 million Note 7 phones, an endeavor that could cost as much as $2bn. On Wednesday, Samsung placed advertisements in South Korea’s major newspapers to apologise for the incident. In an effort to prevent any more device explosions, the company is also rolling out a software update on September 20 that will limit the battery charge at 60%. Availability of that update outside South Korea will vary depending on each market, Samsung said. The Note 7 features a larger battery than its predecessor, one that can store 3500 milliamp hours of electric power, compared with 3000 mAh for the Note 5 (Samsung skipped a number this year, to match its flagship Galaxy S7). By comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus, the Note 7’s main competitor, has a 2900 mAh battery. While Apple has also sought to upgrade its battery technology to support better screens and faster graphics, it hasn’t often promoted battery life as a feature itself. Last week’s iPhone event was an exception, when the company highlighted that the iPhone 7 can last almost two hours longer than its predecessor thanks to better software and processor design. Samsung SDI was the main battery supplier for the Note 7, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The batteries failed because a separator within the cells was too thin and electrodes weren’t properly insulated, according to a government quality inspection agency in China, where almost 2,000 Note 7s were distributed as test devices. Samsung, which is preparing to get replacements into the hands of customers from Sept. 19, said in a statement that “all Galaxy Note7 replacement devices will be equipped with the battery from other suppliers.” For the past few years, Samsung has adopted Quick Charge, a technology developed by Qualcomm Inc., throughout its product lineup, including the Note 7. Using specialised chips, circuits and software, the mechanism works in tandem with a specific charger to speed up the process. While that has enabled rapid charging - up to 50 minutes faster than its predecessor - it’s also pushing up against the physical limits of the materials and design used in battery technology. Gartner’s Reynolds noted that fast charging is essentially a solution to the problem of short battery life. “It’s a feature driven by short battery life in general, not something that people really want,” he said. The first batch of Note 7 batteries probably had a flaw in their design that didn’t work properly with the chemistry in some units, according to Kyle Wiens, creator of iFixit, a popular website that dissects the innards of gadgets to gauge the ease of repairing the devices. Fast charging “crams as much energy as possible into the battery, and the closer you push it to the edge, the more of a potential safety issue there is,” he said. share: More In This Category PICS: Inside one of SA's biggest TV manufacturing plants Exploding Note 7 costumes steal Halloween's scariest do-ups WATCH: Xiaomi to sell a borderless concept smartphone WATCH: Nintendo offers sneak peek of its 'Switch' console Most Popular Read Top 5 smartphones for under R300 a month Top tips on protecting your devices from hackers Here's how to go Ninja mode on social networks R11m French tech lab launched in Cape Town Airbnb includes Cape Town in new ‘Trips’ offering Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

"Because this product presents such a serious fire hazard, I am urging all consumers ... to take advantage of this recall right away," said Elliot Kaye, chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Samsung had already initiated a voluntary recall, but the company has been criticized for not offering clear information about the problem or how it would be resolved. While speaking with reporters, Kaye appeared to blast Samsung for not co-ordinating with his agency. "As a general matter it's not a recipe for a successful recall for a company to go out on its own," he said, adding that anyone who believes a unilateral effort would be sufficient "needs to have more than their phone checked." Samsung has said the problem involves about 2.5 million smartphones worldwide; authorities say that includes about 1 million in the United States. While the company was previously offering to replace the phones, it will now offer consumers the choice of a replacement or a full refund. The recall comes as Samsung is locked in a fierce battle with Apple for the attentions of high-end smartphone buyers. Apple just introduced the latest versions of its iPhone, which go on sale Friday. Samsung had beaten Apple to market with the Note 7 by several weeks. It was drawing favourable reviews for the phone, which started at $850 in the U.S., before consumers began reporting problems with the battery overheating, sometimes causing fires or explosions. One family in St. Petersburg, Florida, said a Galaxy Note 7 left charging in their Jeep had caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung has received 92 reports of the batteries overheating in the U.S., including 26 reports of burns and 55 of property damage, according to the U.S. commission's website. It said property damage included fires in cars and a garage. Meanwhile, U.S. aviation safety officials have taken the unusual step of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge the phone during flights, and not to put them in checked bags. A top Samsung executive in the United States on Thursday apologized to customers and pledged to expedite the recall. "We did not meet the standard of excellence that you expect and deserve," said Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics America, in a video released by the company. Critics say Samsung didn't follow commission rules that call for companies to co-ordinate the handling of recalls with the commission, including the use of joint public announcements, although Baxter said Thursday that his company notified the commission before it announced it would stop selling the Note 7 on Sept. 2. Samsung announced then that it would replace any Note 7 phones it had sold, with replacements available within a week. But its press releases didn't tell consumers to stop using the device. A week later, the company and the commission issued separate statements that urged consumers to stop using the Note 7. At that point, Samsung said it would offer replacement Note 7 devices once the commission had approved them. Samsung's statements left many customers confused, said Tuong Nguyen, a tech industry analyst with Gartner, "and that might have an impact on overall consumer confidence, especially since we're talking about a high-end device, their flagship phone." People who bought the phone did so to get the best possible quality and service, he said, adding that the handling of the recall "kind of seems like a strike on both counts." Some purchasers of the Note 7 say they're willing to try another Samsung device. "I think I would," said Robert Lerner, a 64-year-old financial consultant who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. "But I'm not going to go get it the first week," he added, because he wants to make sure there aren't more problems with the Note 7 replacements. Brooklyn office worker Joe Franco said he was frustrated, especially after getting conflicting information from his cellphone carrier, Sprint, about how to get a replacement. "I love the phone. It's an excellent phone. But I'm scared it's going to explode," said Franco. The 23-year-old said he's currently using an old phone borrowed from a friend, which he said was "really impractical." Samsung said Note 7 owners who don't want a refund can choose to get a new Note 7 -- which the company now says will be available in the U.S. by Wednesday -- or the smaller and cheaper Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge right away, with a refund of the price difference. Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Kaye at the consumer safety commission said Note 7 purchasers should check the back of their device for an identifying number, and visit Samsung's recall website or call a hotline at 1-844-365-6197 to find out if the device needs to be turned in. If so, consumers can take the device back to Samsung or to the phone carrier that sold it. About 97 per cent of phones sold in the U.S. are being recalled. Anderson reported from New York.

Her success didn't come easy but her domination in a typically male-dominated industry is inspiring. Going to college was never an option for Jan Smith. In fact, she was the first in her family to graduate from a university. "Which was a huge thing for my family back in the 60's," said Jan Smith. With her math degree, she started her career working for Boeing's Space Program. "To work the space program that was going to lead to a man on the moon, was the most exciting opportunity," said Smith. That job would eventually lead Smith to a career as a software engineer, spanning 35 years. In 1989, she decided to leave the big business world and start her woman-owned small business, S-Cubed. "I started S cubed really as a consultant, believe it or not, thinking I would slow down and enjoy life a little more," added Smith. +1  S-Cubed is a technical services company that maintains helicopters and also has military contracts with companies in the country and worldwide. The company now employs more than 500. "We have a safety record that is three-times better than the army, and it's those kinds of performance that's enabled us to continue to grow," said Smith. Smith says it hasn't always been easy to achieve success in a predominately male-field. "You have to be committed and you have to be able to accept a lot of 'no's'and not give up," said Smith. But being named as an honoree for "Women Honoring Women," is one of her most proud accomplishments. "Pretty much a dream come true for me... there are so many other women in this community that are looking for that opportunity to grow and expand their company," added Smith. Now, S-Cubed has 50 operations worldwide. The "Women Honoring Women" event will be Thursday, September 15th, at the Von Braun Center. It kicks off at 5:30.

Liow said the debris found was confirmed to be an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap with a date stamp consistent with MH370’s delivery date, with the Italian manufacturer also confirming that all numbers on the said part relates to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404, the same aircraft line number that was delivered to Malaysian Airlines registered as 9M-MRO (MH370). “As such, the experts have concluded that the debris, an outboard flap originated from the aircraft 9M-MRO, also known as MH370,” he said in a statement today. “Further examination of the debris will continue, in hopes that further evidence may be uncovered which may provide new insight into the circumstances surrounding flight MH370,” he added. Liow said that the ministry will continue to provide updates as and when new information becomes available. The examination of the debris was conducted by the Australian Safety Bureau (ATSB). The debris was found on June 20 on the island of Pemba off the coast of Tanzania this year, with authorities suspecting early on that it was “highly likely” from MH370. Previously, investigators had also confirmed a piece of plane debris found on the shores of Reunion Island on July last year to be part of MH370. More debris found in Mozambique, South Africa and Mauritius’s Rodrigues Island have also since been said to be likely parts of the missing plane. Flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew onboard. The Malaysia-China-Australia tripartite had in July announced it would be suspending the search of the vanished aircraft after completing the priority 120,000 sq km search area, which is estimated to completed between October and December.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts More arrests on Bersih 5 eve, Maria and Mandeep may miss rally, Red Shirts leader missing Cops detain Bersih 2.0 chairman, committee member ahead of rally Police road diversions in KL from 7am Now, DAP MP arrested for sedition, taken to Seremban High Court: Duty of police to prevent clash between Bersih 5, Red Shirts Rafizi sentenced to 18 months’ jail, might lose MP seat Do Malaysians trust the news they read?

The Dow industrial and the S&P 500 closed in negative territory Wednesday in the wake of slumping crude-oil prices, erasing earlier gains for the major benchmarks, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq bucked the losing trend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 31.98 points, or 0.2%, to close at 18,034.77. The S&P 500 index fell 1.25 points to end at 2,125.77, weighed by a 1.2% drop in the energy sector. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 18.52 points, or 0.4%, to close at 5,173.77. In the tech sector, Apple climbed 3.6% as analysts outlined reasons the tech giant is still a buy. However, the tech giant's gains were overshadowed by big declines in IBM and Boeing. The economic calendar was relatively thin on Wednesday. Market reaction to the August import-price index was muted. Import prices slipped 0.2% due to lower oil, while export prices dropped 0.8%, driven by a fall in farm crop prices. Shares of Monsanto rose 0.6% after Bayer raised its offer for the U.S. seeds major to $128 a share. Both companies announced Wednesday that they had approved the deal. Ford Motor Co. fell 1.9% after the car maker outlined plans to deliver profitable growth for the next several years, including investing in electric and autonomous vehicles. The benchmark 10-year Treasury slid 4.3 basis points to 1.691%. But as crude oil's decline accelerated, stocks failed to capitalize on their gains. A report on oil supplies published by the Energy Information Administration showed inventories declined by 600,000 barrels last week, much smaller than the 14.5 million barrel drop from the week before. Oil prices briefly spiked after the report, but have since turned lower as analysts concluded that the sector is still bogged down by excess inventory. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery settled at a two-week low. Bullion prices ended higher at Comex. Gold futures settled higher on Wednesday, as support from a retreat in the U.S. dollar prompted prices to snap a five-day slide. But investors remained wary ahead of next week's meetings for the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan that may yield changes to monetary policy. December gold rose $2.40, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,326.10 an ounce. December silver rose 9.1 cents, or 0.5%, to $19.066 an ounce. Today's participation was above the recent average as more than 878 million shares changed hands on the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will include weekly initial claims, Retail Sales for August, PPI for August, the Philadelphia Fed Survey for September, the second quarter Current Account Balance and Empire Manufacturing for September each crossing the wires at 8:30 ET. Separately, Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization for August will be released at 9:15 ET while Business Inventories for July will cross the wires at 10:00 ET.

Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 per cent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Sept. 19. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and — not least — the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung’s mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a “tiny error” in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research centre at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. “If Koh’s argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company,” Park said. “But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem.” Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple’s September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 per cent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 per cent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favoured by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That’s what happened with the Note 7, Samsung’s Koh explained. “The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together,” he told reporters in Seoul. It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7’s design that it compromised safety. “There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity,” said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute’s battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. “Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode,” Doh said. “It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety.” The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone’s battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is “one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we’ve seen in a phone,” said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. “We don’t think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries — more likely just a manufacturing defect,” IFixit’s Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. “You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else,” he said, adding that the two rivals are “constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping.” While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung’s smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. “The security of the battery isn’t directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not,” Cho Joon-ho, head of LG’s mobile business, told reporters. “But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand.” __ AP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco. __ Lee can be reached on Twitter: www.twitter.com/YKLeeAP Her previous works can be found on: http://bigstory.ap.org/content/youkyung-lee shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Officially, it is slated to end its operational life in 2024, about the time that NASA’s Journey to Mars program is scheduled to shift into high gear with “proving ground” missions in cislunar space near the Earth’s moon. The assumption had been that the space station, conceived over 30 years ago during the Reagan administration, would be abandoned and taken out of orbit so that it would burn up harmlessly over the ocean. But NASA official Bill Hill recently suggested that the space agency and its international partners would hand off the ISS to a private company. Commercializing the space station makes sense. It’s bipartisan, for a start. President George W. Bush set into motion the commercialization of human space travel, President Obama has embraced the idea, and the transition is under way. The last NASA-operated crewed flight of the space shuttle occurred in 2011. The first commercially-crewed spacecraft, operated by Boeing and SpaceX, are due to start flying in 2018. FLORIDA TODAY Trump vs. Clinton: Who wins on space? On the other hand, some problems may crop up from the move to “hand off” the International Space Station. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees the space agency, wants to extend the operational life of the ISS to 2028 in a new NASA authorization bill. He would have to be convinced that commercializing the ISS is a good deal for American taxpayers. If the bill is pushed back to next year, which would not be surprising, there could be a new chairman to convince. One obstacle to commercialization may be price. The space station cost about $100 billion to build. Even considering depreciation and a short expected remaining operational life (perhaps four more years to 2028, perhaps longer), the ISS is a valuable piece of real estate. Congress may balk at the idea of giving it away. At the same time, where do you find a buyer for a used space station? Few customers likely could afford it. Also, there’s the question of whether a slightly used space station would prove to be unfair competition for proposed private space facilities. Bigelow Aerospace and a new startup called Axiom Space are planning commercial space stations. Does enough business exist to support a commercial ISS and one or more purely private space stations? The answer to that question depends on how low launch costs go by the mid-2020s. SpaceX, Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance are all working to create reusable launch vehicles and spacecraft. As the cost of space travel decreases, the number of possible customers for commercial space stations increases. FLORIDA TODAY Schedule of upcoming Florida rocket launches FLORIDA TODAY Blue Origin to launch 'New Glenn' rockets from Cape Canaveral The destruction of a SpaceX Falcon 9 along with its payload, an Israeli communications satellite, during a static test fire this month underscores the fact that space travel is not yet as routine and free of accidents as air travel. But as commercial companies gain more experience and refine their technology, their safety record and ability to reuse spacecraft should improve. One way to win broad support for commercializing the International Space Station may be to lease it rather than sell it or give it away. The idea is that the international partners would receive rental payments from a commercial operator which, in turn, would sell time on the ISS for profit. NASA and its partners could plow the rents from the ISS into other programs, say the Journey to Mars that seeks to put astronaut boots on the ground of the Red Planet by the 2030s. Can the ISS be turned into a profit-making enterprise? The answer depends on a lot of currently unknowable unknowns. But absent a hefty budget increase that would allow NASA to both run a space station and send astronauts to Mars, it is going to have to get creative if it expects to prosper in the 2020s and beyond. The space agency will have to unload the ISS one way or another. If it can turn it into commercial space and make a little money in the process, so much the better. Mark R. Whittington is a Houston-based writer and former computer analyst who writes frequently on space and politics. He just published Why Is it So Hard to Go Back to the Moon?, a political study of space exploration. 25 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/2coGgkG TOP VIDEOS Reviewing your options in Brevard elections 28:01 How do school \u0022vouchers' actually work? 28:00 Meet the candidates for Florida House District 53 26:30 Hurricane Matthew: The Beaches, The Evacuation and The Coverage 28:59 What improvements are coming to Cocoa? 27:30 Is Brevard really a GOP dominated county? 29:00 Is a third party vote a 'wasted' vote? 28:30 Recapping the primary election 28:00 School board chair defends decision to remove speaker 27:30 Brevard superintendent on standardized testing, school software and a strategic plan 27:00 Is the League of Women voters a liberal organization? 28:30 Amendment 4 looks to make solar energy more accessible 4:31 Episode 2: Did He Do It? 2:18 Should resident be taxed to save the lagoon? 28:00 The Making of Murder On The Space Coast 29:00 More Stories Palm Bay police will close The Compound for 10 days Nov. 18, 2016, 11:03 a.m. Melbourne urges residents to avoid Eau Gallie River Nov. 18, 2016, 7:44 a.m. Before taking office, Trump signals campaign promises are negotiable Nov. 17, 2016, 3:21 p.m.

The company stated that it has suspended Falcon 9 flights until it completes its investigation into why the rocket burst into flames during fueling for a routine prelaunch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. SpaceX had previously stated that a nearly-completed second launch site in Florida, located at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC), would be finished in November. The pad was last used to launch NASA’s space shuttles five years ago. Boeing has landed a $700 million US defense contract for Small Diameter Bomb Increment 1 weapons. The USAF deal will see the company deliver the munitions by December 12, 2021 and includes foreign military sales. Documents endorsed by retired top US military officers and former national security officials warn of the potential danger posed to US military operations by climate change. A statement in support of the findings was released yesterday and signed by more than a dozen former senior military and national security officials, including retired General Anthony Zinni, former commander of the US Central Command, and retired Admiral Samuel Locklear, head of the Pacific Command until last year. They called on the next US president to create a cabinet level position to deal with climate change and its impact on national security. The first units of the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead rocket has rolled off Lockheed Martin’s production line. A company statement said the warhead was designed to engage the same target set and achieve the same area-effects requirement as the old MLRS submunition warhead, but without the lingering danger of unexploded ordnance. Lockheed received a US Army initial production contract for the warheads in June 2015. Middle East & North Africa A Yemeni industrial site, supposedly a rebel missile manufacturing site, has been bombed by Saudi-led coalition forces. The bombing, which occurred on Tuesday in the capital of Sanaa, caused a fire that destroyed half the premises and resulted in several million dollars worth of damage. Local businessmen claim that plants located on the site were only used for the manufacture of piping and building supplies. Africa South Africa’s Defense Minister announced plans to update the country’s indigenous Rooivalk attack helicopter. Speaking at this year’s African Aerospace & Defence Show, Nosiviwe Masipa-Nqakula said the helicopter has “blooded” itself having carried out a series of successful operations as part of the United Nations’ peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Manufacturer Denel is also working on marketing the helicopter to other African governments who are fighting insurgencies, namely Nigeria and Egypt, and further afield governments like India and Brazil. Europe Deliveries of the Leonardo Aermacchi M-346 advanced jet trainer destined for Poland will soon be underway following the successful conclusion of electromagnetic testing in an anechoic chamber. The next phase of experimental and certification flights will see two Polish aircraft have their communications and avionics systems tested, before moving on to trials of their embedded tactical training simulation (ETTS) equipment. The first of eight aircraft will touch down in Poland in November. Asia Pacific Weapons Experts have warned of the ramping up of uranium enrichment by North Korea. The new uranium, when combined with current plutonium stocks, will give the regime enough material for 20 nuclear warheads. Pyongyang’s ability to evade a decade of UN sanctions has allowed it to develop the uranium enrichment process, enabling it to run an effectively self-sufficient nuclear program that is capable of producing around six nuclear bombs a year.

Photo / AP New Zealand-born company LanzaTech has made an aviation biofuel breakthrough with partner airline Virgin Atlantic. The company has produced nearly 5700 litres of low-carbon ethanol produced from waste gases for the airline, founded by Sir Richard Branson. The company was founded in New Zealand 11 years ago and the parent company remains New Zealand-registered while its headquarters have moved to Illinois. LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic say they will work with Boeing and others in the aviation industry to complete the additional testing that aircraft and engine manufacturers require before approving the fuel for first use in a commercial aircraft. "Assuming all initial approvals are achieved, the innovative LanzaTech jet fuel could be used in a first of its kind proving flight in 2017," LanzaTech and Virgin Atlantic say. The two companies have been working together since 2011. The Lanzanol fuel was produced in China at the RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified Shougang demonstration facility. The alcohol-to-jet process was developed in collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Lab with support from the US Department of Energy and with the help of funding from HSBC. Sir Richard Branson said: "This is a real game changer for aviation and could significantly reduce the industry's reliance on oil within our lifetime." In 2008 Virgin Atlantic was the first commercial airline to flight test bio-fuel flight - derived from coconut and babassu oil. Continued below.

The airline's understanding of low carbon fuels had developed rapidly over the last decade. The company, which has received more than $14 million in New Zealand Government funding, shifted much of its previously Auckland-based research and development workforce to Chicago in 2014. LanzaTech has raised more than US$200m from investors including Silicon Valley-based Khosla Ventures and the NZ Superannuation Fund, which has invested US$75m. Other investors included Sir Stephen Tindall's K1W1 fund and Mitsui. Its technology is based around steel production, which produces waste carbon monoxide (CO) gas, frequently flared to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The process involves capturing carbon from the waste gas via fermentation to ethanol, which is recovered to produce ethanol feedstock for a variety of products, including aviation fuel. Other airlines have trialled biofuel made from waste cooking oil, and in the case of Air New Zealand the Jatropha plant. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Life Buy/Sell The Platform Close Post-Dispatch Corn growing in greenhouse at Chesterfield campus of Monsanto Co. on Dec. 1, 2015 (Post-Dispatch) Editorial: Monsanto's transition from old economy to new economy to German economy By the Editorial Board Sep 14, 2016 (…) Post-Dispatch Corn growing in greenhouse at Chesterfield campus of Monsanto Co. on Dec. 1, 2015 (Post-Dispatch) The proposed $66 billion purchase of Monsanto Co. by Germany’s Bayer AG announced Wednesday surely has profound national and international implications, some heartening, some troubling. Locally, the news, while not unexpected, still comes as a blow. Yes, Bayer has announced that, pending regulatory approval, the combined company’s agricultural headquarters for seed and “traits” (the characteristics imparted by biotechnology), as well as its North American commercial operations, will remain in St. Louis. But another Fortune 500 headquarters will be gone, along with whatever bragging rights are attached to that. St. Louis didn’t do anything wrong — global economic trends and federal policy decisions drove the decision — and most jobs are created by small businesses, anyway. But we didn’t do anything to lose two NFL teams, either. The insult to civic self-esteem still stings. We adjusted to McDonnell Douglas being swallowed by Boeing and Anheuser-Busch being swallowed by InBev and Ralston Purina being swallowed by Nestle. The key for the St. Louis economy is to constantly reinvent itself, and there, Monsanto’s history can be instructive. Monsanto traces it roots to a saccharin company founded by John F. Queeny in 1901. His son, Edgar Queeny, gave the company his wife’s family name and took it into drugs, fertilizers and detergents. As other industries did, he built a company town across the Mississippi River, the better to make its own rules. Monsanto, Ill., was later named Sauget, and St. Louisans of a certain age can still remember the odors from the Monsanto plant. It made polychlorinated biphenyls and dumped the PCB sludge into the aptly named Dead Creek. It became one of dozens of Monsanto Superfund sites. Monsanto reinvented itself after World War II as an agricultural pesticide company and in the 1960s turned its focus to pesticides. Having invented effective weedkillers in the old economy, it became a new-economy firm engineering seeds for plants that could resist its herbicides. In 2002, Monsanto spun off its pharmaceutical and chemical business and reinvented itself as an agriculture seed and crop chemical company. In this incarnation it helped feed the world and created a measure of prosperity for millions of developing-world farmers. It also became a global villain for aggressively protecting its patents and for those suspicious of genetically modified crops. By helping farmers get bigger yields, it helped create a commodity glut that cut into its profits. Global agricultural and seed companies decided to take the uncertainty out of their business by combining. The Monsanto-Bayer combine, in the works since May, will leave but three competitors where, five years ago, there were six. Federal regulators must decide whether this leaves farmers, and eventually consumers, with reasonable prices. Like it or not, such is the way of the world. Smart companies adapt. So do smart cities.

First quarter fiscal 2017 resulted in a net income of $224,000 compared to a net income of $19,000 in the first quarter fiscal 2015.  The increase in net income was primarily due to a decrease in costs and expenses.  Butler National Corporation is working to exceed previous revenue levels while continuing to focus on our margin expansion initiatives, including efficiencies in our implementation and operational processes and controlling expenses. During the three months ending July 31, 2016, we invested approximately $299,000 in projects focused on the development and acquisition of new products.  We feel this expenditure for design and development engineering, testing, and certification of new products is required to grow Aerospace Products and help stabilize our long-term revenue and enhance our profits. We are excited about the future.  Management and all employees are focused on the development of new products, execution of our numerous business development opportunities as well as increasing revenue while managing costs. We believe we are positioned for the future as we focus on serving the needs of our customers and enhancing shareholder value," commented Clark D. Stewart, President of the Company.  Business Segment Highlights Professional Services: Revenue from Professional Services decreased 2% for the three months ended July 31, 2016 to $7.5 million compared to $7.6 million in the three months ended July 31, 2015.  Costs of Professional Services remained constant in the three months ended July 31, 2016 at $4.5 million compared to $4.5 million the three months ended July 31, 2015.  Costs were 60% of segment total revenues in the three months ended July 31, 2016, as compared to 59% of segment total revenues in the three months ended July 31, 2015.  Expenses decreased 6% in the three months ended July 31, 2016 to $2.5 million compared to $2.7 million in the three months ended July 31, 2015.  Expenses were 34% of segment total revenues in the three months ended July 31, 2016, as compared to 35% of segment total revenues in the three months ended July 31, 2015.  Operating income from Professional Services increased 3% to $445,000 in in the three months ended July 31, 2016 from $430,000 in the three months ended July 31, 2015.

Tell me your name and asked are you planning on going war. I'm Brian Jacobi. I really know humbly for yet I have done enough users but probably not either of them mean mainstream candidates wary where Williams out here in Ohio are wearing practically. I'm from want to tell us all be here. Okay grades than we. We episode organs and it you know she account. What is one issue candidate should be talking about but isn't it there's something that you feel like it's been left out of the conversation. I think a lot of it David talking about immigration I obviously out of Miami immigration allies everyone with Hillary Clinton there's talk about her I'd pass. Like the email scandal others like that I think. My major's environmental and yeah I think the environment has been left out of conversation a little bit excessive with Donald Trump was that climate changed and iron. So I cannot morally Beaufort Donald Trump because of its. You know policy on the environment I don't know I don't really know where it stands is again I don't know who's has been inaccuracies and much. All right so an environmental engineer would like more conversation about the environment and global warming. It was wonderful to me which classy and it often a history of rock girl how much I liked it got the united. That sounds pretty and thank you some it's a case necks that read out. Tell me your name and and much last name is you have that means violently you have a political hat on. But the story for Christmas. It's from Jersey it does things by not users isn't. It as a human rights. And what year you are you planning on voting I am here linguistics its major. Millennium. For him. Come. Decided the angels'. Gary. Time. Ills and the Green Party and yes. In just a wonderful what he's going to be out. Rates. Oh and that one seat I think wheels kind of weeded Fannie what is the first thing the next president should do after taking office what would be your first priority. Comic there so many things okay come I think. I say it like an issue that's really central to me right now health care. And reforming not just so everyone can like really get access health care is there some people in this country that just. Can't get the things that they need to do. Make themselves healthy and make themselves mentally stable in this country whether. Whether you that's up from like that gun rights standpoint or whether approach that from. Trans rights stuff like that. Up to you buy health care is. Okay when we first when he first got you said so many things health care about your second meeting day to. TT. I think. A lot of candidates haven't really addressed very well. Racial climate in this country and I'd think. That needs to be addressed as well. Wonderful thank you so much for stopping by really thoughtful. I am in no way it surprised we have had such awful responses all across Ohio and again here. On campus at deal highest it's a date is next even waiting. Step right up we really hate when I tell me who you are. Brendan weary frown a suburb about fifteen minutes OK your local and what you're you might I am voting. Every times a year for me there's this. Wonderful out. Would you spend. I got a big hefty spent. That's. Boeing had plenty like this Moneyline it's like okay. Yeah I think wheels like but. I just fine what's one thing you dislike most about the candidates what really funny and night party now. I'm between Clinton and Johnson because I'm mostly. I Dennis strong okay ankles to keep them away anymore so they get somebody else. Well tell what's one thing that you just like Canadian got Hillary Clinton makes you have pods she seems. They should be very intervention lists him only about under the cover internationalist and do a lot of things most likely a Middle East disaster there's a lot of oil internal. Turmoil. And just generally. Going there do more things raiders. Overthrowing. Dictatorship possibly other government but and setting up our own the kind of serves our own means of letting them actually develop their own and one networks heard their culture and the way. They have of thinking because it is significantly different from ours as far as I can tell not necessarily wrong but. Not saying because it has the world can always be a saint. So you're worried about Hillary Clinton's foreign policy sounds like. Now I'm hours. About things don't cover up and I think that foreign policies would be one of the bigger things you would cover up just because I feel a rarity have a problem with Powell involved we are just what everybody else's affairs specifically militarily. So interesting to Aspin and again that catching the question. Just stop it we'll get a random national other Atlantic do you think the two parties needed change after this election you are considering voting for Gary not so in what way. I think they need to have some limit on how much money they receive so they changed from a fund raising machine to something acts as a political interest of their voters' minds. Because. I think that's a good a lot of light. Dehumanized. And candidates is because they all have to have this massive amounts of money to even run for president. Or any other this happens. And that concerned him yeah right that's out this way Gary Johnson seems so human and so normal because of saying deep debts grass roots he doesn't have like. The biggest of multibillion dollar companies backing him and shoving money down this through until he does what they want them to you. And this and wonderful well thank you so much a ticket had attacked. OK good next up I had. Primary Dallas has the meet and thank you but it did indeed Villa ended yet you've had your flag and yes politician and make no I'm not work at the Ohio Statehouse Thompson page.

At. Property. That's so good okay US Italy officer. Okay you. Allen's kind of tricky. You are you want that land. If you can give a fashions it either candidate what would it be.

Are you high and I'm ballclub for downtrodden he originally it was my first stories I was a vote protectors in the primary and bus this is the Republican Omnia what was gonna vote Republican in this they would Donald Trump.

Everyone thinks he's hatred against immigrants come in the country which is not true each is talking about the illegal immigration coming into our country that you know the criminals.

That are come across the border in the drugs in the you know the cocaine is coming over here the drug enforcement tells us the only thing he wants to stop he has a stop immigration completely he just wants to find out what was going on in the border and stop the illegal immigration and has come here illegally nasty thing he would just address.

Lifkin Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at 5:11 pm | י"א אלול תשע"ו The coach-class cabin of a A Boeing 787 Dreamliner. YERUSHALAYIM - El Al’s plans for a billion-dollar fleet of Dreamliners are coming to fruition as a deal was closed for procurement of two of the 787-8 planes from Boeing, Globes reported. Proclaimed by CEO David Maimon as “the largest procurement plan in El Al history,” it calls for the purchase of 16 787-7 and 787-9 Dreamliner planes, motors and spare parts in an agreement valued at $1.025 billion. On Monday, El Al confirmed signing a sale and leaseback agreement with an undisclosed foreign company for two of the 787-8’s. Like other carriers, El Al has benefited from the worldwide slump in oil prices. Last month, it reported for the first half of 2016 a net profit of almost $14 million, after making a profit of slightly more than $1 million in the corresponding half of 2015. Its semi-annual revenue remained stable, at $934 million. Accordingly, El Al share prices have increased 125 percent in the last year, reflecting a market cap of NIS 1.7 billion. In the past three years, El Al shares had the second highest return on the stock exchange (second only to electric appliance importer Tadiran Appliances), surging by 740 percent.

(Source: Samsung/CNN) COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - Samsung Electronics still scrambling today to come up with short and long-term solutions to its exploding battery problem. The company's stock price and reputation have taken a hit after reports of explosions and fires from the batteries in its new Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. A researcher at the University of South Carolina says the battery issue is partly due to faulty manufacturing and not confined to that particular phone. The Samsung Note 7 is getting a lot of attention right now, but the basic problem with the battery in that phone has turned up in many other devices and forms. You might remember not long ago when the hot consumer item was the hoverboard. Wen people began buying and using them by the thousands, some of those hoverboards were hot in another way. They had a tendency to catch on fire. We've also seen similar issues with laptop batteries and even batteries on Boeing's 757 Dreamliner aircraft, which is partially built in North Charleston. The common thread here is lithium-ion batteries -- a technology that allows a lot of energy to be squeezed into a very small package, but with that sometimes come increased risks. "We know how to make them so they don't explode but, of course, there's a lot of manufacturers that cut corners and don't have the tolerances that they should have," USC professor John Weidner said. "So yeah, unfortunately, we will probably continue to happen. But it's not, I don't think that's an indictment on the technology. We can make safe lithium-ion batteries." Samsung has recalled its Note 7 phones and also has begun offering a software update that will limit to 60 percent the amount that a battery in one of their phones can be charged. But experts say the explosions and fires are likely to crop up in other devices as the use of the lithium-ion battery continues to become more common in all kinds of electronic devices. The New York Times says, meanwhile, the FAA has been tracking battery related problems in aircraft and the paper says one estimate suggests a plane carrying 100 passengers could also have more than 500 lithium-ion batteries on board -- a problem that could continue to pose risks for air travel.  Copyright 2016 WIS.

US dignitaries included Ambassador Patrick Gaspard and US Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force, Heidi Grant, among others. The delegation represented almost 30 key industry players, including Lockheed Martin, Honeywell and the State of Maryland, one of 50 that make up the United States. The state is home to many historic places and institutions, including the US Naval College in the state capital, Annapolis. The US Air Force (USAF) has brought the C-17 Globemaster III, the latest model C-130J Hercules medium transport and the KC-135 Stratotanker air-to-air refueller and the MQ-9 Reaper UAV. Ambassador Gaspard said: “I have to say that, though we are advancing the impressive wares that US companies have come with, this also presents a remarkable opportunity to sow the seeds of growth here in Africa as well, I want to remind everyone that this trade runs to both sides of the Atlantic. It’s absolutely remarkable that American companies like Boeing are able to partner with South African firms like Thompsons to create opportunity in this growing manufacturing sector and it is also remarkable that South African companies like Aerosud that are based here in Pretoria are growing industry, transforming the next generation of industry leaders.” Paul Ausley, CEO of Terraview 360, a UAV manufacturer, said: “To us, Africa is a huge opportunity and without Maryland’s help we would never get exposure to it.” READ MORE Paramount Advanced Technologies unveils tethered UAV First African Unity Pavilion for AAD Reutech out in force at AAD aad Jessica Reynolds, Regional Manager for the state’s investment and trade, said of her small state: “Not only are we close to Washington D.C. and have 20-plus federal facilities but we also are top in terms of federal funding so that attracts a lot of the top talent, in all industries but particularly in defence so research and development is really one of the top areas.” The delegation spoke of their potential target markets. Reynolds said: “So of course South Africa’s very high up there especially in terms of aerospace and defence just because of the capabilities in the country. Broadly – not necessarily industry specific – Nigeria is also a top focus for Maryland because we have a pretty strong Nigerian population and other countries of interest would be in East Africa would be Ethiopia, Kenya.” Tom Jarboe, also of Ausley Unmanned Aviation, added: “In our county in southern Maryland we have about 300 defence contractors…We’re trying to take what we do extremely well and also expand it into a global presence in defence but also look at how to migrate the technology into commercial applications too.” Some of the companies at the US International Pavilion, organised by Kallman Worldwide Inc, include Harris, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin and Rockwell Collins. ....

The energy sector did its best to drag the rest of the market down with it, but the tech and utilities sectors resisted. The blue chips have dipped below the break-even line as Apple’s gains were not enough to offset weakness at IBM and Boeing, two more heavyweights in the price-weighted DJIA. WTI crude oil for October delivery settled at $43.58 a barrel, down 2.9% for the day following a small drop in U.S. inventories. December gold closed up 0.2% on the day to settle at $1,326.10. Equities were headed for a mixed close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down by 0.21% for the day, the S&P 500 traded down by 0.09%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up by 0.35%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Wednesday was American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) which traded down 1.34% at $63.50. The stock’s 52-week range is $50.27 to $78.40. Volume was about 20% below the daily average of around 4.5 million shares. The company had no specific news, but continues to trail off on lack of faith that the Fed will raise interest rates next week. International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) traded down 1.23% at $153.90. The stock’s 52-week range is $116.90 to $164.95. Volume was about 15% below the daily average of around 3.4 million shares. The company had no specific news Wednesday. Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) traded down 1.18% at $98.26. The stock’s 52-week range is $75.10 to $107.58. Trading volume was about equal to the daily average of around 6.4 million. Falling oil prices hurt Chevron again Wednesday. The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) traded down 1.00% at $127.47. The stock’s 52-week range is $102.10 to $150.59. Volume was about 15% below the daily average of around 3.6 million shares. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said that production of the 777 may be cut below the already planned cut from 8.3 a month to 7 per month. This could have a significant impact on cash flow, and has been a concern for months. Of the 30 Dow index stocks 8 are on track to close higher Wednesday and 22 are set to close lower.

By SueChang Markets reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 closed in negative territory Wednesday in the wake of slumping crude-oil prices, erasing earlier gains for the major benchmarks, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq bucked the losing trend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.18% slid 31.98 points, or 0.2%, to close at 18,034.77 even as Apple AAPL, +0.10%  climbed 3.6% as analysts at RBC Capital Markets outlined five reasons the tech giant is still a buy. However, the tech giant’s gains were overshadowed by big declines in International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.29%  and Boeing Co. BA, +0.52% The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.23% fell 1.25 points to end at 2,125.77, weighed by a 1.2% drop in the energy sector. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.26% advanced 18.52 points, or 0.4%, to close at 5,173.77. A rebound in Treasury prices had earlier buoyed the market, according to Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. “The stable bond market gave investors some comfort, encouraging them to buy some of the dip,” he said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.76%  slid 4.3 basis points to 1.691% after touching its highest level since June 23 on Tuesday. But as crude oil’s decline accelerated, stocks failed to capitalize on their gains. A report on oil supplies published by the Energy Information Administration showed inventories declined by 600,000 barrels last week, much smaller than the 14.5 million barrel drop from the week before. Oil prices briefly spiked after the report, but have since turned lower as analysts concluded that the sector is still bogged down by excess inventory. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery US:CLV6 settled at a two-week low. All three stock-index gauges on Tuesday suffered big losses on a sharp slump in energy prices and rate increase fears. “There is not a strong driver or a data point for investors to trade on and there is a lack of a conviction in the market,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve, who expects the market to remain choppy going into the Federal Reserve meeting on Sept. 20-21. The overall narrative, in his opinion, hasn't really changed significantly over the past several months, with investors still preoccupied with central bank policies, global growth and corporate earnings. Read: Is this the real culprit behind the stock and bond selloff? “September is probably an easier time for the Fed to raise rates than December, but it really does not matter. Markets by now know that there will be a rate hike in the next six months,” said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. Trump unveils plan to make child care cheaper(1:36) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed new subsidies for child care in Philadelphia on Tuesday evening, hoping to reach out to women and suburban swing voters. The CME FedWatch Tool is showing a 15% probability of a rate increase next week. Goldman Sachs on Monday cut its September hike odds to 25% from 40% following dovish comments from Fed Gov. Lael Brainard. “It seems to be all about the Fed and other central banks. Ironically, I think the market will rally when [the rate hike] happens,” said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners. “The market, like you and me, would rather go out in the rain rather than when it’s not sure if it’s going to precipitate.” The economic calendar was relatively thin on Wednesday. Market reaction to the August import-price index was muted. Import prices slipped 0.2% due to lower oil, while export prices dropped 0.8%, driven by a fall in farm crop prices.

Meanwhile, Russian media have gotten ahold of a separate report breaking down the lies and half-truths used by the Bellingcat group to blame Russia for the catastrophe. On July 17, 2014, at the peak of fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and anti-Kiev militia, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, on route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was destroyed, killing all of 298 passengers and crew onboard. Kiev and independence supporters in Ukraine's southeast quickly blamed each other for the catastrophe. Last October, Dutch investigators published a report which said that MH17 appeared to have been shot down by a Buk surface-to-air missile system, produced by Russia's Almaz-Antey defense concern. Investigators could not conclusively determine the precise area that the missile was fired from. © Sputnik/ Maksim Blinov Dutch Gov't Feared 'Impotence' in Wake of MH17 Crash Could Lead to UnrestAlmaz-Antey went ahead with its own investigation into the crash, finding that the missile which hit the plane could only have been launched from the settlement of Zaroshchenske, Donetsk Region, which was under the control of Ukrainian forces at the time of the incident. Last month, Dutch officials announced that their Joint Investigation Team, working on the criminal investigation into the catastrophe, would release the first results of their investigation on September 28. Headed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor, the investigation is expected to show precisely the kind of weapon that was used, and from where it was fired. On Tuesday, the Novaya Gazeta newspaper published a 31-page leaked document, signed by Almaz-Antei representative Mikhail Malyshevsky. The paper suggested that the report's conclusions may very well serve as the basis for Russia's possible response to the Dutch investigation; the document, prepared on the basis of an investigation by specialists from Almaz-Antei, breaks down in great detail the erroneous and sometimes outright falsified evidence presented by Bellingcat, a group of Western journalists heavily engaged in investigating the plane's destruction. The downing of Flight MH17 has turned into one of the organization's main pet projects, and according to Dutch media, Bellingcat's work is being actively considered by Dutch investigators for their investigation. Despite Russian investigators' thorough efforts to counter Bellingcat's claims in the past, the group has continued to persist in suggesting that anti-Kiev militia, and indirectly, Russia, were responsible for the downing of the Malaysian Boeing. As a result, Russian experts have been forced to go through great lengths to refute the misinformation presented by Bellingcat.  © Sputnik/ Maksim Blinov Russia Regrets US, Ukraine’s Failure to Share MH17 Investigation DetailsAmong its most recent claims is footage from a car video recorder, said to have been shot on July 17, 2014, ostensibly showing a rebel-controlled Buk moving toward what Bellingcat's account says was the likely launch site of the missile that downed MH17. In reality, this video could not have been shot any later than July 15, 2014, since the road the DVR-equipped car was traveling on was damaged by a rebel motor column including heavy tracked vehicles on that day. Another of Bellingcat's charges revolves around a satellite image showing a white transport truck carrying the rebel Buk allegedly used to shoot down the MH17 on its trailer. But that image was proven to be a fake, given that three of the vehicles Bellingcat claims were part of the Buk convoy are actually pictured going in the opposite direction along the highway depicted. Moreover, the shadow given off by the truck and its cargo is not characteristic of the Buk's distinctive shape, and is facing in the wrong direction relative to the time of day the shot was said to have been taken (11:08 AM on July 17, 2014). Next, Russian experts dissected the claim made by Bellingcat regarding a photograph purporting to show launch smoke coming from the Buk missile in an area near the alleged launch site on July 17. According experts, this photo was either digitally altered or taken at another date, since other photo and video evidence from July 17 have confirmed that the weather in the area was cloudy, not clear, as claimed by Bellingcat. Maksim Blinov MH17 Crash Probe Initial Results to Be Unveiled September 28Another Bellingcat claim revolves around the suggestion that a missile defense space-based infrared system (SBIRS) successfully pinpointed the launch site. In fact, detecting a Buk launch using SBIRS system is virtually possible, given that detecting and determining a fired ballistic missile's trajectory requires more time than the Buk would be expected to fly. As to the crucial Bellingcat claim – that MH17 was hit by a single Buk SAM in the hands of the Donbass militia, the report reiterated that this is a practical impossibility, since the detection range of a single Buk is limited to 120 degrees in azimuth and 7 degrees in elevation, and its effectiveness of fire is limited. A single Buk system can guard only a pre-assigned airspace sector with knowledge of its potential targets' parameters, up to and including enemy flight time (that is, to wait in 'ambush' mode). Independently and without this information, normally provided by support systems elsewhere in the military command, a single Buk is not capable of precisely locating and then hitting its target. The detailed, technical and expert-oriented 31 page report leaked by Novaya Gazeta also revealed that Almaz-Antei took the unprecedented step of providing Dutch investigators with the genuine specifications of the Buk system. This, the report suggested, was meant to preclude the use of erroneous or otherwise inaccurate data which investigators obtained from various sources, including publically available materials. "The use of such materials inevitably led to erroneous results and conclusions. Precisely in order to avoid these mistakes, the decision was made to transfer the real technical characteristics of the Buk missile to the Dutch Safety Board," the report explained. As for Bellingcat, the report saved a special criticism for them regarding the variant of the Buk missile used to shoot down MH17, suggesting that the group does not have and cannot know the precise technical characteristics and technical documentation which would enable them to make an accurate distinction between the variants of the 9M38 missile. As for Almaz-Antei, their report from October 2015 not only included this information, but even showed the results of two full-scale experiments to recreate the crash, conclusively demonstrating that the Malaysia Airlines Boeing was downed by an old Buk model fired from Ukrainian territory. ...

Reply RedBanner 00:01 15.09.2016 | 0 | Edit | Delete All available evidence points to Kiev. At some point I remember reading the testimony of a man who worked on a military airbase, about a Ukrainian fighter jet pilot who went out with missiles loaded on his aircraft, and after returning to the base he didn't have his missiles anymore (so they were fired). The witness claims hearing him saying that he had shot down an aircraft (the Donbass militia never had aircraft, as far as I know, so it couldn't have been a rebel fighter) that, according to his words "was at the wrong place at the wrong time"... So maybe the Buk theory is all wrong from start! I wonder why this theory has never been fully investigated!

She said the full details of the investment will be disclosed soon after fulfilling certain conditions.   "What we can be revealed is that the investors are promoters of new commercial aircraft," she said.   “The investor is coming in at a time when the African aerospace market has been dominated by Airbus and Boeing, with only limited competition in the regional jet market from Bombardier and Embraer." READ: Transformation key to grow SA aviation - Skywise In her view, aligning with an airline like Skywise would provide a good marketing window for the aircraft promoters to tap into the growing and vast African market. "With the right-sized aircraft balanced with sound top level management, Skywise and other African carriers would be able to offer a better combination of capacity and frequency in core, as well as, low-to-mid-density markets," said Qadir. "Rapidly evolving aviation product offerings and growth in emerging markets are broadening the geographical balance of airplane demand for which entering the commercial space will have to be done with crucial knowledge transfer and test programmes together with Skywise Airlines." READ: Acsa hits back at Skywise allegations She said Skywise is appointing a new management team as both she and her co-chair Javed Malik are stepping down. “As aviators we ought to take much more challenging roles in the industry,” the co-chairs said in a statement. Malik is considering an offer as CEO at an African carrier, while Qadir said she is now at Pakistan International Airlines. As chief customer experience officer she is heading up the airline's recently launched premier service. Airports Company SA (Acsa) suspended Skywise's flights on December 2 2015 due to unpaid airport charges for landing, take off, parking of aircraft and related service charges. At that time Skywise had already appealed to President Jacob Zuma, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Minister of Transport Dipuo Peters, Acsa and South African Airways for assistance. It also sought investors. In April this year Skywise said six companies had expressed interest in a sizeable acquisition in Skywise. Of the six, four were foreign-based, while two were from South Africa, Skywise said at the time. Skywise brand ambassador at the time, Ndileka Mandela, a granddaughter of Nelson Mandela, also expressed the wish that the authorities would resolve the issue of the grounding of Skywise flights. Acsa has maintained all along that its decisions regarding Skywise were taken in its own best commercial interests, and to ensure the sustainability of the aviation industry.

The plan will cover a decade’s worth of aid, beginning in fiscal year 2019. The memorandum of understanding between the U.S. and Israel will be made public today during a signing ceremony in the State Department’s Treaty Room. Story Continued Below Reuters reports that the $38 billion deal “also involves major concessions granted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to officials on both sides. Those include Israel’s agreement not to seek additional funds from Congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually in the new package and also to phase out a special arrangement that has allowed Israel to spend part of its U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons, the officials said.” — CAN THE AGREEMENT BUY OBAMA THE LOVE OF HIS PRO-ISRAEL CRITICS? Not a chance, write our colleagues Nahal Toosi and Bryan Bender: “Some hawkish U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy commentators are raising questions about aspects of the deal, especially reports that it limits Israel's ability to lobby for more aid from Congress. They also insist Obama's Middle East policies, including his embrace of a nuclear deal with Iran, have endangered Israel enough that in the long run the larger aid package may not make a difference. “Conservative Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin, for one, called the deal ‘one more kick in the shins to Israel.’ Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who pointedly notes that Congress didn't play a role in crafting the agreement, has suggested he wants to appropriate even more aid to Israel. Others, too, say that with the future uncertain in an increasingly chaotic Middle East, the agreement should be seen more as a guideline than anything binding.” WAR REPORT — SO FAR, SYRIAN CEASE-FIRE STILL HOLDING, reports The Wall Street Journal: “Syria’s cease-fire appeared to take firmer hold on its first full day Tuesday, with the main opposition monitoring group reporting calm in major provinces. The truce sponsored by the U.S. and Russia went into effect Monday evening, but there were accusations of violations by both rebels and the regime just a few hours into it. Both sides traded more such accusations on Tuesday, but the battlefields were noticeably quieter, according to residents and activists on the ground.” — SYRIAN ACCORD WIDENS THE RIFT BETWEEN KERRY AND THE PENTAGON, reports The New York Times: “The agreement that Secretary of State John Kerry announced with Russia to reduce the killing in Syria has widened an increasingly public divide between Mr. Kerry and Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, who has deep reservations about the plan for American and Russian forces to jointly target terrorist groups. “Mr. Carter was among the administration officials who pushed against the agreement on a conference call with the White House last week as Mr. Kerry, joining the argument from a secure facility in Geneva, grew increasingly frustrated. Although President Obama ultimately approved the effort after hours of debate, Pentagon officials remain unconvinced.” — WHAT ARE THE DEAL’S DETAILS? “The new Syria cease-fire is rich in detail on the mechanics of ending violence in Aleppo. It says little about how the United States and Russia will establish a new military partnership that is seen as key to the long-term sustainability of the deal,” The Associated Press reports.

HAPPENING TODAY — JUSTICE’S NATIONAL SECURITY DIVISION AT 10: Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough speak at a daylong conference on the Justice Department’s National Security Division. This month is the 10-year anniversary of the division, which was created after the 9/11 attacks to integrate law enforcement, intelligence and other tools in the national security fight. The full schedule for the conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies is here. ALSO TODAY — CARTER RETURNS TO AUSTIN: The defense secretary visits Austin, Texas, where he’ll stop at the Capitol Factory, a tech incubator he also went to earlier this year. There, he’s expected to “provide an update” on the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, his tech outreach initiative with offices in Silicon Valley and Boston. And he’s hinted he’ll be announcing the third outpost in Austin today. “Stay tuned, you’ll see us doing more — in fact, very soon — in this same area,” Carter said Tuesday at the TechCrunch Disrupt SF conference while discussing opening the Boston office. — SOPKO TALKS AFGHANISTAN CORRUPTION: The special inspector general for Afghanistan, John Sopko, speaks today at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on his office’s first “lessons learned” report titled “Corruption in Conflict: Lessons from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan.” The House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee holds a hearing on next-generation air space control. And the Senate Aerospace Caucus has a reception on Capitol Hill this evening with Sens. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Defense Security Cooperation Agency Director Vice Adm. Joseph Rixey and Aerospace Industries Association CEO David Melcher. IN A BUDGET FIGHT, THE SENATE SQUEEZES THE HOUSE, our colleague Ben Weyl reports on the latest as Congress works to keep the government running past Sept. 30: “As the Senate grinds toward a bipartisan deal to keep the government open, House Republicans are increasingly resigned to accepting whatever the upper chamber decides to send their way. "The growing fatalism comes as the Senate is on track to pass legislation in the coming days to fund the government through early December — amid chatter that senators could soon leave town for a lengthy recess, effectively forcing the House to either pass the Senate bill or allow a government shutdown weeks before the presidential election.” ** A message from the Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base Coalition: Help Save Taxpayers Up To $500 Million: Buying materials in advance for the construction of the next two new U.S. Navy aircraft carriers will save taxpayers up to $500 million over the course of their construction and will keep the industrial base strong.

Currently, Adm. Michael Rogers serves in a "dual-hat" role as the head of both agencies. "I do not believe rushing to separate the dual hat in the final months of an administration is appropriate given the very serious challenges we face in cyberspace and the failure of this administration to develop an effective deterrence policy,” he said Tuesday. NBC News reported last week that Carter and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper have endorsed a plan to eliminate the dual-hat leadership position. Asked about the split on Tuesday, Carter said no decisions have yet been made, while explaining the arrangement, “has worked very well, but it’s not necessarily the right approach to those missions overall in the long run.” Our colleague Martin Matishak has more on the dispute here, for Pros. PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT REJECTS JOINT PATROLS IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA, the AP reports on the latest incident that could rankle U.S.-Philippine relations: “Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday he won't allow government forces to conduct joint patrols of disputed waters near the South China Sea with foreign powers, apparently scrapping a deal his predecessor reached with the U.S. military earlier this year. Duterte also said he was considering acquiring defense equipment from Russia and China. The Philippines has traditionally leaned on the U.S., its longtime treaty ally, and other Western allies for its security needs.” INDUSTRY INTEL — BOEING UNVEILS ITS T-X TRAINER OFFERING: Boeing on Tuesday unveiled its offering for the new Air Force two-seat T-X trainer jet program, announcing it has already made two production-level aircrafts instead of the expected prototype. The world's largest aerospace company is paired with Swedish firm Saab on the jet, with an engine made by General Electric. Boeing, who touted the plane in a flashy event in St. Louis, hopes the design will replace the Air Force's T-38 jets, made by Northrop Grumman and used to train pilots to fly fighter jets. Among the features revealed in the Boeing-Saab design is "one engine, twin tails, stadium seating and an advanced cockpit with embedded training," according to the company statement. The T-X program is considered one of just a few large-scale Air Force procurement efforts in the foreseeable future and a big priority for many defense companies. The service plans to buy 350 new trainers, with a final solicitation set to be released by December.

EPA/ATSB/ HANDOUT EDITORIAL USE ONLY Menéame Newly discovered debris potentially from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people onboard, may be the first piece of evidence supporting the theory that there was a fire onboard the plane, according to Australian media reports. Five pieces of debris were handed to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) in Canberra on Monday morning by American amateur sleuth Blaine Gibson, ABC broadcaster reported. Gibson, who has previously brought 13 of the 27 suspected and confirmed pieces of wreckage from the flight to MH370 investigators, said two of the pieces were burned and singe marks on them. "If those are found to be from Malaysia 370 and if it is discovered that the fire took place before the crash, then this is a real game changer that could help identify what was the cause of the plane's demise," he told ABC. The debris, which was found on the coast of island nation Madagascar, located off the southeast coast of Africa and where the majority of the suspected debris had already been discovered. The pieces resemble some of the paneling used in Boeing 777 planes and have the honeycomb pattern of Boeing's composite materials, and the burn marks could support the theory that the plane was downed by a fire. Flight MH370 went missing on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, with available data indicating that the plane flew into the sea in the southern Indian Ocean. More than 110,000 square kilometers of the seafloor have been searched so far. Content providers. Contact EFE.

Samsung Electronics Co., under pressure from consumers for longer-lasting batteries that charge faster, pushed the limits of lithium-ion technology. The effort backfired when some of its new Note 7 handsets caught fire and exploded. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Photographer: Jannis Mattar/EPA Building a better battery has long bedeviled the tech industry. Smartphones are constantly improving, with sharper displays, improved software and cameras rivaling those used by the pros. Not so the batteries, which despite advances still die faster than consumers like and take too long to recharge. “It’s the race to add new capabilities and features to the phone that demands a more capable battery,” said Martin Reynolds, a Gartner analyst. On top of the demands placed on their performance, batteries are getting slimmer and smaller, as smartphone makers try to win over consumers with thinner devices. That’s putting strain on the manufacturing process, and raising the risk of defects that can lead to the kind of malfunctions seen in Samsung’s phones. The Note 7 was supposed to stand out with its stylus, large edge-to-edge display and faster charging technology. Samsung rolled out the device in August, just before Apple Inc. unveiled a new batch of iPhones. It was a opportunity for the Suwon, South Korea-based company to outshine its biggest smartphone rival. Instead, it backfired. Usually, smartphone makers and wireless providers rigorously test products before they reach customers, although the process is mainly focused on making sure the devices are compatible with wireless networks. Samsung provided carriers with the typical amount of testing time before the launch date, according to people familiar with the matter. Samsung first showed prototypes of the Note 7 to carriers in April and testing began in May, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the arrangements aren’t public. At least one major Samsung partner is reassessing its testing procedures to catch issues like this in the future, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The South Korean manufacturer is holding multiple meetings each week with major carrier partners to discuss the latest details from its investigation and assist in mitigating the issue, the person said.  Headaches involving the production of lithium-ion batteries aren’t unique to the smartphone industry. Overheating battery packs made by Sony Corp. led to the recall of millions of laptops made by Dell Inc., Toshiba Corp. and others in 2006, while Boeing Co.’s 787 Dreamliner suffered from electrical fires after the airplane’s 2011 debut. For an explanation of how batteries work, click here. “Based on our investigation, we learned that there was an isolated issue with the battery cell,” Samsung said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Overheating of the battery cell occurred when the anode-to-cathode came into contact with each other, causing a very rare manufacturing process error.” Head of Samsung Electronics Koh Dong-jin during a press briefing to announce the global recall on Sept. 2. Photographer: Yonhap via EPA Samsung is working to fix the problem. While only about three dozen cases were reported, the company is seeking to replace 2.5 million Note 7 phones, an endeavor that could cost as much as $2 billion. On Wednesday, Samsung placed advertisements in South Korea’s major newspapers to apologize for the incident. In an effort to prevent any more device explosions, the company is also rolling out a software update on Sept. 20 that will limit the battery charge at 60 percent. Availability of that update outside South Korea will vary depending on each market, Samsung said. The Note 7 features a larger battery than its predecessor, one that can store 3500 milliamp hours of electric power, compared with 3000 mAh for the Note 5 (Samsung skipped a number this year, to match its flagship Galaxy S7). By comparison, the iPhone 7 Plus, the Note 7’s main competitor, has a 2900 mAh battery. While Apple has also sought to upgrade its battery technology to support better screens and faster graphics, it hasn’t often promoted battery life as a feature itself. Last week’s iPhone event was an exception, when the company highlighted that the iPhone 7 can last almost two hours longer than its predecessor thanks to better software and processor design. Samsung SDI Co. was the main battery supplier for the Note 7, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The batteries failed because a separator within the cells was too thin and electrodes weren’t properly insulated, according to a government quality inspection agency in China, where almost 2,000 Note 7s were distributed as test devices. Samsung, which is preparing to get replacements into the hands of customers from Sept. 19, said in a statement that “all Galaxy Note7 replacement devices will be equipped with the battery from other suppliers.” Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter For the past few years, Samsung has adopted Quick Charge, a technology developed by Qualcomm Inc., throughout its product lineup, including the Note 7. Using specialized chips, circuits and software, the mechanism works in tandem with a specific charger to speed up the process. While that has enabled rapid charging -- up to 50 minutes faster than its predecessor -- it’s also pushing up against the physical limits of the materials and design used in battery technology. Gartner’s Reynolds noted that fast charging is essentially a solution to the problem of short battery life. “It’s a feature driven by short battery life in general, not something that people really want,” he said. The first batch of Note 7 batteries probably had a flaw in their design that didn’t work properly with the chemistry in some units, according to Kyle Wiens, creator of iFixit, a popular website that dissects the innards of gadgets to gauge the ease of repairing the devices. Fast charging “crams as much energy as possible into the battery, and the closer you push it to the edge, the more of a potential safety issue there is,” he said.

By adding too much engine power for what is known as “reverse thrust” to help with braking, the crew caused the plane to skid to the left, the National Transportation Safety Board ruled. While other planes landing shortly before had stopped with no issues, the pilots were hampered by outdated runway condition reports and vague guidance in their manuals, the NTSB found. “Make no mistake: This was a very close call,” NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said at the hearing in Washington. The Boeing Co. MD-88 carrying 127 passengers and five crew members slid onto a retaining wall and its nose came to rest over Flushing Bay on March 5, 2015. While no one was seriously hurt, 29 people suffered minor injuries. Steering Loss The captain used too much engine power while trying to stop, which can cause a loss of steering on a slick runway, according to NTSB documents. After being told the runway was “good” for braking, he was surprised when he descended through clouds to see that it was covered in snow, he told investigators. The safety board found that the pilot’s “situational stress” and high work load as he tried to stop contributed to the mistakes. “The pilots in this accident found themselves without timely and accurate information,” Hart said. It was unfair to simply cite the crew when they were battling marginal weather conditions and LaGuardia’s relatively short runways surrounded by the bay, said Captain Steve Jangelis, vice president for safety at the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents them. Morgan Durant, an airline spokesman, said “Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation.” After Flight 1086 came to rest, it wasn’t fully evacuated for more than 17 minutes, surveillance video of the plane showed. Even though firefighters who arrived on scene were urging the flight crew to evacuate because of a fuel leak, the exit was delayed due to poor communication, according to the NTSB. The crash had knocked out the plane’s intercom, making it difficult for the pilots to talk to the flight attendants. Six Minutes It took six minutes from the time an evacuation was ordered until the first passenger left the plane. Flight attendants allowed passengers to retrieve winter coats and weren’t urging an immediate exit, the safety board concluded. Evacuations are supposed to occur as quickly as possible in case fire breaks out. The captain, in landing, used a common technique known as reverse thrust, in which devices within the engines push air forward instead of toward the back of the plane. That helps the brakes slow a plane down. On the MD-80 series of aircraft, pilots are advised not to use too much engine power during reverse thrust because it can create swirling winds that engulf the tail, where both engines are mounted. If that happens, the tail can no longer keep the plane pointed straight. The engines on Flight 1086 were revved to higher levels than were permitted in the flight manual, according to the NTSB. The captain told investigators he didn’t look at the thrust setting on the engine after touchdown while concentrating on trying to stop. The copilot noticed the issue and twice told the captain to back off the power, according to NTSB records. Voice Recording “Come out of reverse,” the copilot said about eight seconds after landing, according to a transcript of the voice recording. “Come out of reverse.” As the plane skidded off the runway and onto a retaining wall, the recording captured the pilots uttering several expletives and the sound of rumbling or scraping. The plane stopped about 36 seconds after it first touched down, according to the recording. Use of too much reverse thrust is common, the NTSB found. In a sample of flights on the accident plane and another Delta jet that had landed just before it, crews used too much reverse thrust in all 14 cases in which runways were wet and skidding was a risk. Pilot Manual NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt faulted Delta for not being precise enough in its pilot manuals. They advised pilots that using too much thrust could “potentially” cause skidding, while Boeing documents said it definitely would. “It’s not a maybe, might, could,” Sumwalt said. “It looks like Delta downgraded this in their training material.” The accident has some similarities to a fatal runway crash in Little Rock, Arkansas, on June 1, 1999, when an American Airlines MD-82 slid off the airport grounds into an adjacent riverbed in a downpour. Eleven people died when the plane broke apart and a fire erupted. While it wasn’t the main cause of the accident, the NTSB concluded that a pilot’s attempt to use too much reverse thrust was one reason the plane skidded off the runway. On Oct. 1, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is introducing new standards for describing how slick a runway is in rain, snow or icy conditions. The action is designed to give pilots a clearer sense of the potential risks and it stems from a 2005 crash in Chicago in which a Southwest Airlines Co. plane slid through a fence and hit a passing car outside the airport.
