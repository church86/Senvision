Cooper case USA Today Network Chris Ingalls, KING-TV, Seattle Published 11:53 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 | Updated 11:54 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 This is a 1973 file photo of a drawing of D. B. Cooper who became a legend when he jumped out of a Northwest Airlines Boeing 727 with $200,000 in ransom money 25-years-ago between Seattle and Portland, Ore. Cooper hasn't been heard of since; however, some $5,880 of the loot was found along the Columbian River in 1980. (Photo: Associated Press) SEATTLE — A band of amateur scientists selected by the FBI to look for clues in the world’s most infamous skyjacking may have found new evidence in the 45-year-old case. They’re asking for the public’s help because of potential leads that could link the hijacker known as D.B. Cooper to the Puget Sound aerospace industry in the early 1970s. The scientific team has been analyzing particles removed from the clip-on tie left behind by Cooper after he hijacked a Northwest Orient passenger jet in November 1971. A powerful electron microscope found more than 100,000 particles on old the JCPenny tie, including cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium. “These are what they call rare earth elements. They’re used in very narrow fields, for very specific things,” said Tom Kaye, lead researcher for the group that calls itself Citizen Sleuths. USA TODAY FBI closes D.B. Cooper hijacking case Kaye said the elements were rarely used in 1971, during the time of Cooper’s daring leap with a parachute from the passenger jet. One place they were being used was for Boeing’s high-tech supersonic transport plane, which was being developed with government funding in the 1960s and 1970s. Kaye wonders if Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor who wore the tie to work. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines). He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye said. Kaye says Boeing was developing cutting edge monitors, like radar screens, that used some of the elements found on the tie. Kaye says the public’s help is needed, particularly from old-timers with experience in the aerospace industry in the Pacific Northwest. USA TODAY How will 'Mad Men' end? The internet's 3 best theories The scientists would like to hear theories from the public on what those materials could have been used for. They hope the information can help build a profile of Cooper. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say ‘Oh my gosh. I know what that means having those particles on the tie,” Kaye said. Tipsters can reach the group through the “contact” tab on the Citizen Sleuth website. On Thanksgiving Eve 1971, a man aboard a Portland to Seattle flight told the flight attendant he had a bomb in his suitcase. He demanded $200,000 and four parachutes, which the FBI delivered when the plane landed at Sea-Tac Airport in Seattle. When the plane was airborne again, headed south, the man who became known as D.B. Cooper jumped from the back staircase of the Boeing 727 with a parachute on his back into the frigid night sky and vanished. The FBI closed the case last year unsolved.   2413 CONNECTTWEET 15 LINKEDIN 276 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iuUlm3 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

BlackRock managed to increase profits in the fourth quarter, though revenue barely grew. The firm was a prime beneficiary of a record year in exchange-traded funds. BlackRock attracted $140 billion to its iShares business last year, including $60 billion in fixed-income exchange-traded funds. Vanguard Group Inc., the second-biggest player in the exchange-traded funds business, gathered $93 billion. "In 2016, it is fair to say across all investor types there was a movement more toward passive strategies," Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink said in an interview Friday after the earnings were released. "When I am able to increase margins and increase market share through price cuts I am going to do that. The key element is scale." BlackRock expanded its operating margin from a year earlier by keeping company costs down. The shares gained $1.06 to close Friday at $379.35. The company's fourth-quarter earnings of $5.14 a share exceeded estimates. Revenue rose 1 percent to $2.89 billion, falling short of analyst estimates of $2.93 billion. Lower performance fees and a stronger dollar contributed to the modest revenue growth. -- Bloomberg News Fireworks firm fined $200,000 for thefts NEW CASTLE, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania fireworks business used for many national events has been fined $200,000 by federal agents and ordered to close for two weeks after an employee stole fireworks. Family-owned Zambelli International Fireworks of New Castle blamed poor record-keeping on its failure to detect the theft. It has been ordered to improve its record-keeping. Zambelli said state police discovered the missing fireworks in 2014. Nobody has been charged. Zambelli was founded in 1893 and produces about 1,600 shows annually. Its fireworks have been used for presidential inaugurations, the National Mall Fourth of July celebration and state dinners. The company said none of its shows are scheduled during the two-week shutdown. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives won't comment because the investigation is continuing. -- The Associated Press Uber drivers in Russia quit over taxes MOSCOW -- Uber Technologies Inc. has asked its Russian drivers to temporarily bear the load of a new tax charge, causing some of them quit to avoid paperwork and tax filings. President Vladimir Putin signed a law in July to levy an 18 percent value-added tax on electronic goods and services provided by global Internet giants starting in 2017. Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. are registered with Russia's tax service, according to newspaper Vedomosti. Uber has passed these duties on to its drivers, requiring them to pay the tax on the company's service fee. Uber will later reimburse them these payments, it said in an emailed response to questions. The company will refrain from raising prices for passengers, it added. The move has caused some drivers to quit Uber, said Stanislav Shvagerus, head of lobby group Taxi 2018. Losing drivers is bad news for Uber, which has struggled to catch Yandex.Taxi, the market leader. "Most drivers only pay a unified annual tax linked to turnover," Shvagerus said. "Why should they start paying [value-added taxes] and become tax agents for a multinational firm? This requires weekly paperwork and also makes them subject to tax audit." -- Bloomberg News Indian airline, Boeing reach $22B deal CHICAGO -- Boeing Co. won a $22 billion deal from budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd., notching the plane-maker's largest-ever order from an Indian airline and strengthening its hold in a market dominated by Europe's Airbus Group SE. The order includes 100 of Boeing's 737 Max single-aisle jets and renegotiated terms for 55 previously ordered aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement Friday. The airline also has options to purchase another 50 Boeing aircraft, including the 777 and 787 Dreamliner wide-bodies. The commitment, which was included in Boeing's 2016 order tally, comes as the Chicago-based plane manufacturer races to catch Airbus in narrow-body sales, the largest source of profit for the companies. The deal for the Max, which competes with Airbus's A320neo workhorse, also helps Boeing widen its footprint in the fast-growing South Asian market. Most of SpiceJet's low-cost rivals fly the European company's aircraft. "India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can't ignore," said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order gives Boeing "a lifeline. There's a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia." -- Bloomberg News Developer calls for Gettysburg casino GETTYSBURG, Pa. -- A Pennsylvania businessman wants to build a harness racing track and casino near Gettysburg, the site of the 1863 battle that turned the tide of the American Civil War. David LeVan said Thursday he will apply for a harness racing license and a license to operate a casino with slots and table games. The proposed location on about 700 acres is just east of where U.S. 15 crosses the Maryland-Pennsylvania line. It's about 3 miles from the border of Gettysburg National Military Park. It's LeVan's third attempt to bring gambling to Gettysburg. He is a former Conrail Inc. chairman who owns a nearby Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealership. Previous proposals sharply divided the community, and opponents argued it was not appropriate for the historic region. -- The Associated Press Business on 01/14/2017 Print Headline: Business news in brief Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Profits at 2 big banks climb in '16 Renault's market value dives after emissions ...

SpiceJet plans to buy 155 planes, of which 55 were carried over from old orders after renegotiations, the airline based in Gurgaon near New Delhi said in a statement on Friday. It also has options for 50 more, including wide-body aircraft. The commitment, the largest ever for Boeing from an Indian airline, comes at a time when both the Chicago-based planemaker and Airbus are facing slowing sales and the highest level of delivery deferrals in at least 15 years following a decadelong shopping spree by jetliners. It will also help Boeing widen its footprint in the South Asian country, where most of SpiceJet’s low-cost rivals fly Airbus planes. “Outside of India, Boeing has been doing reasonably well in Asia, with the exception of China,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “Airbus has enjoyed a strong advantage in India, particularly since Airbus is strongest in single aisles, and the Indian market is heavily weighted towards single aisles.” Though Boeing sold fewer jets than it delivered last year as it navigated a market downturn, demand for the narrow-body planes such as the 737 Max remained strong. India needs 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in 20 years, with single-aisle planes making up a bulk of the new deliveries, according to Boeing forecasts. Asia Pacific will need 15,130 new airplanes valued at $2.3 trillion in the next 20 years, as economic growth in the region boosts middle-class population. That’s 38 percent of the global estimate of 39,620 aircraft, according to Boeing’s outlook. Friday’s deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the Chicago-based planemaker in India. SpiceJet and AirIndia Express are the only budget carriers to use Boeing aircraft in India, while IndiGo, Go Airlines India and the local unit of AirAsia all fly Airbus jets. SpiceJet shares jumped as much as 4.2 percent after the deal was announced. The order signals the company’s resurgence after almost collapsing more than two years ago.

A joint statement by the two companies Friday said the planes booked at the end of 2016 include 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs as well as purchase rights for 50 additional planes. SpiceJet is India’s fourth-largest airline by number of passengers carried with a market share of 12.9 percent. It flies more than 300 daily flights to 41 Indian and international destinations. “The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began (in 2005), with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort,” said Ajay Singh, Spicejet chairman and managing director. Ray Conner, a top Boeing official, said the economics of the 737 MAXs would allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond. India’s booming economy and growing middle class have helped to make it the world’s fastest-­growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year, and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations in the country almost every week.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy We are evaluating many financing options for Boeing order: Ajay Singh Ashwini Phadnis comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh addressing a press conference to announce the purchase of 205 airplanes from Boeing Company in New Delhi on Friday. -- PTI New Delhi, Jan 14:   A short while after placing an order for over 205 Boeing aircraft, Ajay Singh, promoter SpiceJet, and Dinesh Keskar, Senior Vice-President, Sales, Asia Pacific and India, Boeing, met the media to clarify the details of the contract. Edited excerpts How will the deal be financed? Dinesh Keskar: Commercial markets for financing are the most liquid today. People who are investing in aeroplanes are getting good returns on their investments. There are three types of financing --- Sales and Lease Back; then, where the bank loans money against an asset, which is the aircraft; and the third is what Ajay Singh talked about, EXIM financing. These three financing options are available in plenty. Of all the aeroplanes out there, the 737 and (Airbus) 320 type are the most liquid because there are thousands sold. So if for any reason you take one back for non-payment, it can be placed (with another vendor) very quickly. With the Boeing 777 and Airbus 350 and those kind of aircraft it is very difficult to take aircraft from one airline and move them to another airline. It is too expensive. That is why I do not see any issue in financing this deal. What about the pre-delivery payment? Generally it is 1-10 per cent, which will be anything from Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 15,000 crore, in this case. How will you raise that kind of funds? Ajay Singh: You will find out over a period of time. We are well equipped to pay whatever we need to pay by way of our commitment in this contract. Obviously, we have booked an order… whatever we have paid we have paid from our internal resources. I want to reiterate there will be no dilution of equity, there will be no raising of significant debt for the purpose of this particular order, at least for the next few years. We are in a very comfortable position. We see absolutely no challenge in terms of financing the aircraft. The task before us is to ensure that financing happens in the most cost-efficient manner possible. How much of the financing has been tied up for the aircraft that have been ordered? Ajay Singh: We have just started the process. We have several options for financing. We are evaluating those offers. The first deliveries are 18 months from now. We will find the best. Obviously, some advances have been paid by the company. Whatever is required under contract will be paid. What is the net worth of the company? Ajay Singh: The net worth has been negative. It has become far less negative than it was in the last two years. I think it is about negative by Rs 400 crore or so. What is the idea of low-cost long-haul flights? Ajay Singh: It is still in its infancy. We are focusing on the narrow-body. The narrow-body order -- the MAX aircraft in itself gives us a bigger range -- up to one more hour of flying. The four-hour flights can now be done for up to five hours. That opens up several new destinations for us to explore. In terms of wide-body there are models around the world where people have attempted low-cost long-haul and some are doing well. We believe that with a market as large as India where there is a large population and an increase in disposable incomes that is forecast for the coming years, the GDP is bound to grow so we feel that there is little reason why people will not want to travel to different parts of the world, provided those flights come at an affordable cost. If we can stimulate that market with lower fares, and that stimulation is only possible if you bring down costs on a unit basis. If we find there is a model that works for SpiceJet, we will certainly explore it. By when can we expect an outcome on the LCC long-haul? Ajay Singh: We are doing it. I do not want to put a time line. What did Boeing do to support you? Ajay Singh: In 2014, one of our largest partners was Boeing. Boeing took a lot of trouble to advise us on what we could do to keep the airline flying. They refunded some of the advances that we had paid for aircraft for a period of time. They helped us procure aircraft as we sought to grow. Boeing played the most important role in trying to assure lessors that SpiceJet would remain flying. Are the legacy issues behind you? Ajay Singh: I think we have pretty much cleaned up all the legacy issues. We inherited a lot of legacy stuff. Today we have zero bank debt, we have no dues to the Government, we have no dues to the leasing community…. We have pretty much paid off all our creditors. We have paid all taxes, all private airports, all Airports Authority and all banks. We have completely cleaned the slate as far as SpiceJet is concerned. We have zero debt other than the debt which is a consequence of putting the Bombardier on our books.

Mobile version Sign Up Login Home Lebanon Middle East World Business Sports Climate Change & Environment Entertainment Offbeat Culture Science Obituaries Technology Health Entrepreneurship Roundup En ع India's SpiceJet Buys Up to 205 Boeing Jets Worth $22bn إقرأ هذا الخبر بالعربية by Naharnet Newsdesk 13 January 2017, 13:38 Comment 0 Tweet Indian low-cost airline SpiceJet said Friday it would buy up to 205 Boeing planes worth $22 billion as it seeks to increase its share of the world's fastest-growing passenger aviation market. SpiceJet, which currently has just 49 planes, said the order would enable it to boost its domestic operations and potentially expand into long-haul international flights. India's aviation market is growing at double the pace of China's, as an emerging middle-class takes to the skies. "This is the largest deal for SpiceJet, it's one of the largest in Indian aviation and is the largest for Boeing in India," SpiceJet Chairman Ajay Singh told journalists as he announced the deal. "We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations, which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations." The deal marks a major turnaround for SpiceJet, whose planes were briefly grounded in 2014 after suppliers refused to refuel them due to unpaid bills. It has a 13-percent share of the Indian market, behind rivals Indigo, Jet Airways and Air India. - Vast potential -The Indian market is seen as having vast untapped potential with fewer than 100 million of India's 1.2 billion citizens flying on domestic routes last year. Train travel remains slow and demand for low-cost flights has boomed in the past decade. The latest industry figures from the International Air Transport Association show India’s domestic air traffic grew 22.3 percent year-on-year in November, followed by Russia at 15.5 percent and China at 14.9 percent. But most of the country's airlines are still loss-making and laden with debt, while state carrier Air India has long relied on government support. Analysts say lower fuel prices and a rise in economic growth have boosted the sector, with domestic traffic up 21 percent last year. "The airline has done really well from being almost on the brink of closure to nearly seven quarters of profit," said industry analyst Kapil Kaul. "The new aircraft order is on expected lines and gives them long-term direction. A positive and long-term story is likely to emerge with this order." SpiceJet, the only Indian low-cost carrier with a Boeing fleet, said the first of the new planes would arrive in early 2018. It currently has just 49 aircraft, putting it well behind the market leader Indigo, India's only consistently profitable carrier, with 400.  Singh said the deal included 100 737 jets from Boeing's new Max family of aircraft, which he said would help reduce fuel costs by up to a fifth. It also includes the option to buy 50 wide-body aircrafts suitable for long-haul flights. The airline currently only flies short-haul international routes. SpiceJet put the value of the planes at $22 billion at list prices, although it will likely pay less as discounts for large orders are customary. The company's shares have more than tripled since December 2014. The deal is a boost for Boeing in India, where rival manufacturer Airbus has traditionally dominated. "India needs 1,850 planes worth $265 billion in the next 20 years," said Boeing India President Dinesh Keskar. "We do expect more orders out of India."

Cooper who became a legend when he jumped out of a Northwest Airlines Boeing 727 with $200,000 in ransom money 25-years-ago between Seattle and Portland, Ore. Cooper hasn't been heard of since; however, some $5,880 of the loot was found along the Columbian River in 1980. (Photo: Associated Press) SEATTLE — A band of amateur scientists selected by the FBI to look for clues in the world’s most infamous skyjacking may have found new evidence in the 45-year-old case. They’re asking for the public’s help because of potential leads that could link the hijacker known as D.B. Cooper to the Puget Sound aerospace industry in the early 1970s. The scientific team has been analyzing particles removed from the clip-on tie left behind by Cooper after he hijacked a Northwest Orient passenger jet in November 1971. A powerful electron microscope found more than 100,000 particles on old the JCPenny tie, including cerium, strontium sulfide and pure titanium. “These are what they call rare earth elements. They’re used in very narrow fields, for very specific things,” said Tom Kaye, lead researcher for the group that calls itself Citizen Sleuths. USA TODAY FBI closes D.B. Cooper hijacking case Kaye said the elements were rarely used in 1971, during the time of Cooper’s daring leap with a parachute from the passenger jet. One place they were being used was for Boeing’s high-tech supersonic transport plane, which was being developed with government funding in the 1960s and 1970s. Kaye wonders if Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor who wore the tie to work. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these (manufacturing machines). He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants,” Kaye said. Kaye says Boeing was developing cutting edge monitors, like radar screens, that used some of the elements found on the tie. Kaye says the public’s help is needed, particularly from old-timers with experience in the aerospace industry in the Pacific Northwest. USA TODAY How will 'Mad Men' end? The internet's 3 best theories The scientists would like to hear theories from the public on what those materials could have been used for. They hope the information can help build a profile of Cooper. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say ‘Oh my gosh. I know what that means having those particles on the tie,” Kaye said. Tipsters can reach the group through the “contact” tab on the Citizen Sleuth website. On Thanksgiving Eve 1971, a man aboard a Portland to Seattle flight told the flight attendant he had a bomb in his suitcase. He demanded $200,000 and four parachutes, which the FBI delivered when the plane landed at Sea-Tac Airport in Seattle. When the plane was airborne again, headed south, the man who became known as D.B. Cooper jumped from the back staircase of the Boeing 727 with a parachute on his back into the frigid night sky and vanished. The FBI closed the case last year unsolved.   2413 CONNECTTWEET 15 LINKEDIN 276 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2iuUlm3 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.

A joint statement by the two companies Friday said the planes booked at the end of 2016 include 100 new Boeing 737 MAX 8s, 42 MAXs, 13 additional 737 MAXs as well as purchase rights for 50 additional planes. SpiceJet is India's fourth-largest airline by number of passengers carried with a market share of 12.9 percent. It flies more than 300 daily flights to 41 Indian and international destinations. "The Boeing 737 class of aircraft has been the backbone of our fleet since SpiceJet began (in 2005), with its high reliability, low operation economies and comfort," said Ajay Singh, Spicejet chairman and managing director. Ray Conner, a top Boeing official, said the economics of the 737 MAXs would allow SpiceJet to profitably open new markets, expand connectively within India and beyond. India's booming economy and growing middle class have helped to make it the world's fastest-growing air travel market. The number of passengers grew 20 percent last year, and airlines are announcing flights to new destinations in the country almost every week. Domestic air passengers are expected to jump from the current 70 million to 300 million by 2022, and to 500 million by 2027. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The deal is a welcome boost for Boeing in India, where SpiceJet is the US company’s only major customer among the budget carriers now dominating the country’s air industry. “As part of this transaction they (Boeing) have not only been kind enough to give us good commercial terms but have worked hard to reduce the maintenance cost of the fleet going forward,” Ajay Singh, SpiceJet’s chairman, told a news conference in New Delhi. Asian airlines are driving much of the growth in big planemaker order books, and analysts expect India’s market to grow substantially over the next decade as millions fly for the first time each year. Indian airlines such as the biggest, InterGlobe Aviation’s IndiGo, as well as GoAir have collectively ordered hundreds of new planes from Airbus. SpiceJet said it had signed a deal for buying up to 205 planes from Boeing — worth up to $22 billion at list prices — but the announcement includes 55 jets already announced in a 2014 deal and the possible follow-on order of 50 more. A source said on Thursday that SpiceJet was set to announce an order for as many as 100 new planes. It was not immediately clear if the order adds to Boeing’s previously announced tally. However, the company previously posted an order for 100 737 MAX jets from an unidentified customer that counted as part of its 2016 tally. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Muscat port operator posts 25pc jump in 2016 revenues China’s exports fall for second year as US trade war fears mount → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent HM condolences to Saudi King HM issues 7 Royal Decrees ROHM marks inauguration by His Majesty Military football World Cup kicks off Read More ...

Home India news Ajay Singh led SpiceJet to buy 205 Boeing jets, inks $22 bn order Ajay Singh led SpiceJet to buy 205 Boeing jets, inks $22 bn order Budget airline SpiceJet said on Friday it would buy up to 205 new aircraft from Boeing for $22 billion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore) in what will be one of the largest aviation deals By: FE Bureau | New Delhi | Updated: January 14, 2017 8:10 AM Taking wing: SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh exchanges plane models with Boeing vice-chairman Raymond Conner at a press conference to annouce the deal in New Delhi on Friday. Budget airline SpiceJet said on Friday it would buy up to 205 new aircraft from Boeing for $22 billion (Rs 1.5 lakh crore) in what will be one of the largest aviation deals. The addition to SpiceJet’s fleet would help it grow market share from the current level of about 13%. The carrier plans to expand its fleet nearly fivefold to 155 aircraft by 2024 from 32 narrow-body planes it currently operates. SpiceJet has topped up its existing order for 55 Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft placed in 2014 with an order for an additional 100 jets. It has also secured the purchase rights for 50 more jets along with wide-body aircraft. The conversion of purchase rights to acquisition would be contingent upon market conditions, SpiceJet officials said. Chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said the company will neither dilute its equity nor borrow to finance the deal. “Although the ‘sale and leaseback’ option is a standard practice we could also look at financing from Exim banks as interest rates across the world are low,” Singh added. Singh also said the transaction had built in an option to buy wide-body planes as the airline was mulling operating low-cost, long-haul flights. The model is currently being used by a few airlines including subsidiaries of Singapore Airlines and Air Asia. “The induction of the new aircraft, which burn 20% less fuel, would help SpiceJet reduce costs and enhance its ability to compete,” Singh said. He added the new aircraft would increase the range of flights by up to one hour, opening up many more destinations, including international ones. SpiceJet will receive the first aircraft in the third quarter of 2018, and the rest of the jets would be delivered at an average of 20 every year till 2024. “Acquiring 20 aircraft every year is a manageable task as India needs about 80 aircraft every year to cater to the passenger growth. We would also install a flight simulator to train more pilots for deployment,” Singh said. Currently, the budget carrier has 32 B737s and 17 Bombardier Q400s. According to Boeing’s estimates, India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. You may also like to watch this video The deal is also a boost to the American aircraft manufacturer Boeing as SpiceJet remains the only low-cost carrier to operate these aircraft. Other budget airlines like market leader IndiGo and GoAir have a fleet of Airbus planes. After being on the verge of going belly-up two years ago, the airline has been in the black for the past seven straight quarters. In the 2016 July-September quarter, the airline had posted its highest-ever quarterly profit of Rs 59 crore. However, due to depressed fuel cost, most airlines have made a profit during the same period. Please Wait while comments are loading...

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Spicejet Ltd. x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ SpiceJet x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Anurag Kotoky and Kyunghee Park Boeing Co. won a $22 billion deal from budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd., notching the planemaker’s largest-ever order from an Indian airline and strengthening its hold in a market dominated by Europe’s Airbus Group SE. The order includes 100 of Boeing’s 737 Max single-aisle jets and renegotiated terms for 55 previously ordered aircraft, SpiceJet said in a statement Friday. The airline also has options to purchase another 50 Boeing aircraft, including the 777 and 787 Dreamliner wide-bodies. The commitment, which was included in Boeing’s 2016 order tally, comes as the Chicago-based planemaker races to catch Airbus in narrow-body sales, the largest source of profit for the companies. The deal for the Max, which competes with Airbus’s A320neo workhorse, also helps Boeing widen its footprint in the fast-growing South Asian market. Most of SpiceJet’s low-cost rivals fly the European company’s aircraft. “India is an important market both Airbus and Boeing can’t ignore,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. The SpiceJet order gives Boeing “a lifeline. There’s a lot more to grow in India than other parts of Asia.” Rapidly expanding Indian carriers will need 1,850 new planes valued at $265 billion in 20 years, according to a Boeing forecast. Single-aisle planes will make up the bulk of the new deliveries. The Asia-Pacific region, which is eclipsing North America as the world’s largest aircraft market, will need 15,130 new aircraft valued at $2.3 trillion in the next 20 years, as economic growth boosts middle-class travel, according to Boeing. That represents 38 percent of the global requirement. Extending Reach Friday’s deal adds to the 348 jetliner sales garnered by the U.S. planemaker in India. SpiceJet, which is based in Gurgaon near New Delhi, and AirIndia Express are the only budget carriers to use Boeing aircraft in the country. SpiceJet shares climbed 2.5 percent to 65.50 rupees in Mumbai. Boeing rose less than 1 percent to $159.02 at 9:55 a.m. in New York. The airline placed firm orders for 100 737 Max 8 aircraft, with a cumulative list price of $11 billion, before the discounts that are customary for large customers. Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 6 that the carrier was close to signing a deal for at least 92 planes valued at $10.1 billion and that the total could rise based on negotiations for discounts and service contracts. “We spent a considerable amount of time negotiating and finalizing the commercial terms, including maintenance of the aircraft,” Chairman Ajay Singh said in an interview. “It was important for us to get all the commercial terms right.” Deliveries will begin in July 2018 and continue through 2024. The carrier and Boeing also discussed a proposed stretch of the largest Max, Singh told reporters. The so-called 10X, Boeing’s response to Airbus’s fast-selling A321neo, would be available in 2020 and seat as many as 230 travelers. The order signals a resurgence for SpiceJet after it almost collapsed more than two years ago. The expansion also sets up sharpened competition against IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., which has about 400 Airbus aircraft awaiting delivery. IndiGo dominates the world’s fastest-growing major aviation market, with a 42 percent share. SpiceJet has 13 percent. A representative for Airbus declined to comment. The world’s two biggest planemakers are vying to serve a crucial market with an emerging middle-class that is flying for the first time and where passenger traffic is growing at twice the pace of nearest rival China. While the growth is prompting India airlines to order planes, they also have to contend with airport infrastructure that hasn’t kept pace. Limited landing and parking slots extend the time circling above airports such as Mumbai during peak hours, wasting fuel. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

(File photo by Andy Holzman/Daily News Staff Photographer) By Susan Abram, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: 01/13/17, 8:22 PM PST | Updated: 1 day ago # Comments Visitors make their way by the remains of VTS-1 at the Santa Susana Field Lab Thursday, August 12, 2010. Many community members and former Rocketdyne employees were on hand for the tour.(Andy Holzman/Daily News Staff Photographer) A clean-up plan for a contaminated portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory has been released by a federal agency, with some saying the options don’t go far enough while others call some alternatives just right. The Department of Energy released the draft environmental impact statement earlier this month to outline how the agency would move forward with cleaning the soil within Area IV, the roughly 280 acres of land within the Santa Susana Field Lab where rocket engines and nuclear power were once tested. The agency also presented plans for removing contaminated structures and to a lesser extent, dealing with groundwater. “The release of the draft (environmental impact statement) is an important step in our mission to clean up the former DOE site at the Santa Susana Field Lab in a way that protects human health and the environment,” said John Jones, federal project director at the Department of Energy in a statement. “Public input on the cleanup alternatives is a critical next step to achieve this mission.” There are several alternatives presented on how to deal with the soil, including traffic in and out of the site and the effects of a cleanup on the natural surroundings. Options range from doing nothing until the chemical compounds in the soil deteriorate over time, to a strict remediation plan that would clean the soil beyond federal standards. That option was agreed upon between the DOE, NASA and state regulators in 2010. Based on that agreement, the cleanup should have been completed this year. But in the draft environmental impact statement, the DOE said those standards may do more damage than good. “DOE also determined that implementing the 2010 AOC requirements and remediating soil to meet the (agreement of consent) would have the potential for adverse environmental impacts due to the large area of land that would be disturbed and the large volume of soil that would be removed,” according to the statement. That the DOE has presented alternatives means it has backed away from what it agreed upon, said Dan Hirsch, president of Committee to Bridge the Gap, a group that has worked for about 30 years to pressure owners and regulators to decontaminate the site. “They’ve broken out of the cleanups entirely,” Hirsch said. “It’s a complete breach of 2010.” Hirsch said the agreement included a thorough environmental clean-up plan to be drafted by the Department of Toxic Substances Control. That report was due last year and is still pending. The DTSC, however, agreed Friday that the DOE should not have consulted with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife on its own to justify a clean-up option that is inconsistent with what all the agencies agreed upon in 2010. Advertisement “First, and most importantly, we note that it appears DOE is proposing clean-up approaches that fail to fully recognize the AOC provisions that apply to sensitive plant and animal species located at SSFL,” said DTSC director Barbara Lee in a letter to the agency. “These provisions allow limited exceptions to clean-up activities to safeguard protected species. As you know, DTSC is committed to implementing and enforcing the (agreement).” In a statement, a DOE spokesman said Friday the agency is still committed to working with the DTSC. Nestled between Simi Valley and Chatsworth, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory is a remote, 2,900-acre site developed in the 1940s. It was used to test rocket engines and conduct nuclear research. The Boeing Co. now owns a majority of the land. Boeing officials have said the company is committed to cleaning its portion to residential standards, then leaving the land as open space. In May 1989, surveys from the Department of Energy, reported exclusively in the Daily News, revealed that radioactive and toxic contamination from decades of nuclear experiments and rocket tests had leaked into soil, groundwater and bedrock at the hilltop site. Kept secret from the public was the partial meltdown of one of the reactors in 1959, an accident that released radiation into the air. That the meltdown ever occurred is still disputed among some, but no one disagrees that there are portions of the land that are contaminated. Results of a federal radiological survey released in 2012 showed that of the 437 samples collected, 75 exceeded standards agreed upon by the DOE and the DTSC. Abe Weitzberg, who worked for the DOE for 40 years and continues to consult for the agency among others, said he sent a letter praising it for considering more options. He said one thing he liked was that they admitted the clean-up standard agreed upon in 2010 was unworkable. “They came up with one (option) that is basically reasonable,” Weitzberg said of the DOE’s plan to clean the land to residential standards — similar to Boeing’s. “You clean everything up to suburban residential, which still cleans up higher concentrations of stuff and doesn’t do too much damage to the site,” he said. That doesn’t bring too much traffic and effects to surrounding areas, he added. Hirsch said if the DOE is allowed to get away with its alternate clean-up standard, then state regulators have failed the public. He listed Vernon’s Exide and the natural gas leak in Aliso Canyon as examples of lax regulations. “The press and many policymakers have woken up to the fact that we have terrible pollution like in Santa Susana with regulators asleep at the switch,” Hirsch said. “I think Santa Susana is the poster child.

(File photo by Andy Holzman/Daily News Staff Photographer) By Susan Abram, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: 01/13/17, 8:22 PM PST | Updated: 1 day ago # Comments Visitors make their way by the remains of VTS-1 at the Santa Susana Field Lab Thursday, August 12, 2010. Many community members and former Rocketdyne employees were on hand for the tour.(Andy Holzman/Daily News Staff Photographer) A clean-up plan for a contaminated portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory has been released by a federal agency, with some saying the options don’t go far enough while others call some alternatives just right. The Department of Energy released the draft environmental impact statement earlier this month to outline how the agency would move forward with cleaning the soil within Area IV, the roughly 280 acres of land within the Santa Susana Field Lab where rocket engines and nuclear power were once tested. The agency also presented plans for removing contaminated structures and to a lesser extent, dealing with groundwater. “The release of the draft (environmental impact statement) is an important step in our mission to clean up the former DOE site at the Santa Susana Field Lab in a way that protects human health and the environment,” said John Jones, federal project director at the Department of Energy in a statement. “Public input on the cleanup alternatives is a critical next step to achieve this mission.” There are several alternatives presented on how to deal with the soil, including traffic in and out of the site and the effects of a cleanup on the natural surroundings. Options range from doing nothing until the chemical compounds in the soil deteriorate over time, to a strict remediation plan that would clean the soil beyond federal standards. That option was agreed upon between the DOE, NASA and state regulators in 2010. Based on that agreement, the cleanup should have been completed this year. But in the draft environmental impact statement, the DOE said those standards may do more damage than good. “DOE also determined that implementing the 2010 AOC requirements and remediating soil to meet the (agreement of consent) would have the potential for adverse environmental impacts due to the large area of land that would be disturbed and the large volume of soil that would be removed,” according to the statement. That the DOE has presented alternatives means it has backed away from what it agreed upon, said Dan Hirsch, president of Committee to Bridge the Gap, a group that has worked for about 30 years to pressure owners and regulators to decontaminate the site. “They’ve broken out of the cleanups entirely,” Hirsch said. “It’s a complete breach of 2010.” Hirsch said the agreement included a thorough environmental clean-up plan to be drafted by the Department of Toxic Substances Control. That report was due last year and is still pending. The DTSC, however, agreed Friday that the DOE should not have consulted with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife on its own to justify a clean-up option that is inconsistent with what all the agencies agreed upon in 2010. Advertisement “First, and most importantly, we note that it appears DOE is proposing clean-up approaches that fail to fully recognize the AOC provisions that apply to sensitive plant and animal species located at SSFL,” said DTSC director Barbara Lee in a letter to the agency. “These provisions allow limited exceptions to clean-up activities to safeguard protected species. As you know, DTSC is committed to implementing and enforcing the (agreement).” In a statement, a DOE spokesman said Friday the agency is still committed to working with the DTSC.

SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said the order, which is part of the companys ambitious expansion plan, includes the acquisition of 100 737 MAX 8 aircrafts  in addition to 42 MAX planes, and 13 737 aircrafts ordered earlier  and the purchasing rights to 50 other large-size aircrafts. With the next generation of B737 and the B737 MAX, we are sure that we can be competitive and grow profitably, said Singh. We are now in a very good position to expand our network and operations, which includes both domestic and international routes and destinations, he added. He added SpiceJet has recorded profits for seven consecutive quarters, has highest on-time performance and the lowest cancelation rates currently. Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner stressed the agreement comes after more than a decade of partnership between the two companies. Spicejet operates 336 flights daily to 45 destinations, 39 within India and 6 abroad, with a current fleet of 32 Boeing 737NGs and 17 Bombardier Q-400s.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

The low-cost carrier, set up in 2011, grabbed headlines with bikini-wearing flight attendants. Photo by VnExpress VietJet's CEO plans to push into China, Australia and Russia. VietJet Air has gone from start-up to Vietnam's largest private airline in five years. Now it is pushing overseas to keep up that growth and absorb a bumper order of more than 200 planes: no easy task in a cutthroat Southeast Asian market. The airline, which was set up in 2011, grabbed headlines with its bikini-clad flight attendants. It tapped a rich vein - a fast-growing economy and a young population that was starting to travel more. But VietJet's next step will be more challenging, industry analysts and executives say, as it expands further beyond Vietnam into choked southeast Asia, competitive China or Russia, where VietJet's fleet of narrowbody jets would confine it to the country's east. Infrastructure in the region is clogged and new airport slots are rare. Even Kuala Lumpur, a less crowded airport, is highly competitive, thanks to airlines like Air Asia. That has raised questions about VietJet's ability to absorb one of the region's largest aircraft orders. "(VietJet) have been extremely successful in the first five years but what they have done has been entirely domestic," said Singapore-based analyst Brendan Sobie at consultancy CAPA. "The domestic market will start to slow and it is more difficult to expand internationally – some people doubt that they can continue (growing) at the current rate." According to CAPA, Vietnam’s domestic aviation market grew 30 percent in 2016 to 28 million passengers - nearly five times the growth rate of the broader economy. At VietJet's gleaming offices in Ho Chi Minh City, its chief executive and founder, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao - also Vietnam's first female billionaire - outlines plans to push into China, Australia and Russia, where she studied and first worked. She dismisses concerns of excess competition, even in China, where local airlines have boomed. More than 10 Chinese carriers have begun flying since the aviation regulator relaxed a six-year suspension on new airline licences in 2013. "Other countries are still doing business with China and VietJet also has its own advantages," she told Reuters. "We can ally with Chinese airlines when wanting to expand in the country’s local market." Unlike other new generation carriers in the region who have sought to set up alliances to gain clout without merging, VietJet has resisted. VietJet Air CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao speaks behind a model of a VietJet aircraft during an interview in her office in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, January 10, 2017. Photo by Reuters Too many planes? Among the airline's most imminent concerns will be its large aircraft order - more than 200 planes, including more than 100 Airbus A320 family aircraft and 100 Boeing 737 Max 200s - a mixed approach rarely taken by low-cost or new generation airlines, who prefer to streamline engineering needs. The Boeing order in particular, announced during a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama, prompted questions over whether the order was placed for political reasons. Thao dismissed this. Industry sources, however, say some of the 200 planes on order may be subject to reconfirmation or other get-out clauses. Thao says the airline has support to finance its orders, worth over $20 billion, but has given no detail. The group has VND5 trillion ($221 million) in debt. A Boeing spokesman said it had no change to its order. Airbus, which analysts say is most exposed to budget airlines in Southeast Asia including VietJet, declined to comment. VietJet ended 2016 with some 40 aircraft but is targeting more than 200 by 2023. And it is not without growth potential. Asia Pacific passenger growth is the fastest in the world. The carrier's pre-tax profit almost doubled last year to over $100 million and it sees its bottom line rising by almost a third this year, thanks to a low cost base. An initial public offering to raise $170 million valued VietJet at $1.2 billion. Shares start trading in February. "So far, so good," said analyst Shukor Yusof of Endau Analytics, describing growth so far as 'a feat'. "But I'm a bit skeptical if this rapid growth can be sustained without affecting the airline's bottom line."

Sleep. MORE’s inaugural committee has raised a record $90 million to cover the steep costs of next weekend's festivities, the Associated Press reported.  That far outpaces President Obama’s $55 million in 2009 and $43 million in 2013, the AP reported.  Donations include $1 million from Boeing and $500,000 from Chevron. The inauguration committee will have 90 days after Jan. 20 to disclose the rest of the donors.  ADVERTISEMENT The cash haul will likely be more than enough to cover what is expected to be a leaner inauguration — the chair of the inauguration committee, Tom Barrack, has said he wants to avoid a “circus-like atmosphere.”  Trump will hold three inaugural balls to Obama’s 10 in 2009, and the entertainment lineup doesn’t feature the major stars that have joined Obama.  Trump spokesman Boris Epshteyn said that excess money will be donated to charity, but didn’t give specifics.  Tags Donald Trump, Inauguration   View the discussion thread.

Lockheed wouldn’t be the first major corporation to fold under the barrage of Trump’s blistering tweets, but none of the others were sitting on a weapons program estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over its lifetime, either. The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016 Trump tweeted twice about the F-35 in December. First he called the cost "out of control," and then 10 days later announced that he challenged Boeing to offer a "comparable F-18 Super Hornet." Trump has seemingly discarded that latter idea, after many critics pointed out there was no way an F-18 could replace the F-35’s stealth capabilities. Read more Pentagon prepares ‘misleading’ response to Senate’s F-35 concerns – report Lockheed also plans to add 1,800 jobs at its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, where the F-35s are built, Hewson said Friday, Reuters reported. Those would in turn lead to “thousands and thousands of jobs” being added in 45 states to fill out the company’s supply chain, the CEO said. While this development may please the president-elect, the whole program is still over budget and way behind schedule. In a December 19 letter to Senator John McCain (R-Arizona), Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall wrote that development of the F-35’s software was being delayed seven months, resulting in a cost of “at least $500 million more than previously budgeted.” Where to watch Schedule Where to watch Schedule News America UK Russian politics Business Sport Op-Edge More Live Where to watch In vision In motion RT360 Shows Schedule Business projects Legal disclaimer Privacy policy Feedback About us Vacancies Contact info On-Air Talent RT NEWS APP Android iOS Windows phone Windows 8 العربية Español Русский Deutsch Français ИНОТВ RTД RUPTLY Applications RSS facebook twitter youtube google-plus instagram soundcloud coub © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2017.

Airport Executive Director Carl R. Beardsley noted recently that “load factors,” the percentage of sold seats per flight, average about 85 percent. Local travelers, it seems, have begun to consider the ancillary costs — tolls, time, fuel and lodging — that go with using other airports. For many Schuylkill County travelers, the airport in Avoca is the closest option. However, for many years, convenience wasn’t enough to offset ticket costs. Now, the growing service at the airport helps to create more competitive fares. Meanwhile, the Lackawanna and Luzerne county governments that control the airport should examine an intriguing trend. European carriers have begun to establish service at smaller East Coast airports to reduce costs and escape the congestion at major airports. Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier, began service last fall between Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, and Shannon International Airport — a major European gateway. And Norwegian, a discount carrier, plans to begin service to Ireland this year from Stewart International Airport in Newburg, New York, 98 miles from Scranton. T.F. Green Airport, in Warwick, Rhode Island, also is in talks with Norwegian. Because of a new generation of highly fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 737Max and the Airbus 321Neo, carriers profitably can cover longer distances with fewer passengers. The 737Max and 32Neo are single-aisle, two-engine jets that carry 180 to 220 passengers. Larger, two-aisle jumbo jets such as the new Boeing 787 and Airbus 350 usually carry at least 100 more passengers. The smaller passenger loads eliminate the need to funnel hundreds of passengers from many locations through big hubs. Ground services — aircraft maintenance, crew lodging and so on — also typically are much cheaper in secondary markets. As reported by The New York Times, a record 18,000 city pairs were connected by direct air service in 2016. Many of them are major cities, but there has been substantial growth among secondary markets. As new secondary market routes become established, other carriers likely will consider joining the market. The airport should be ready to attract that service.

Based on documents Klea filed beginning in 2007, the federal government decided that those who were employed by the DOE to work at the Santa Susana Field Lab and related offices from 1948 to 1988 should be compensated for illnesses they may have suffered as a result of working there. (Photo by Dean Musgrove, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG) By Susan Abram, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: 01/13/17, 6:33 PM PST | Updated: 1 day ago # Comments This 1954 file photo shows Verticle Test Stand (VTS-1) at Rocketdyne’s Santa Susana Field Lab. (Andy Holzman/Daily News Staff Photographer) As a secretary who worked for rocket engine maker Rocketdyne in the 1960s and 1970s, Bonnie Klea knew part of her job was to keep the federal government’s space exploration developments a secret. But years later, when the pain in her bladder became too much, when a doctor told her the cancer she suffered from was likely due to an occupational hazard, Klea learned the government also kept secrets from her and hundreds of employees who clocked into work each day at the facility high atop the hills near the San Fernando Valley. The battle to save her own life turned into a fight for justice for those who worked in Area IV, a portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory where top scientists tested rocket engines and nuclear power for decades. After learning that the Department of Labor had denied most of the claims for compensation filed by cancer-stricken workers under the 2000 Energy Employees Occupational Illness Program Act, Klea compiled letters, press releases, news articles and documentaries about radioactive and chemical contamination at the site. She delivered the petition to the federal government in 2007, which led to a victory: In 2009 the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH granted a special designation for those assigned to the field lab’s 280-acre Area IV. The designation applied to workers who were exposed to radiation for at least 250 days, between Jan. 1, 1955, and Dec, 31, 1958. Later, the time expanded to 1965. Last month, on its own, NIOSH agreed to widen the designation for those who worked in Area IV up until 1988. “NIOSH determined that health may have been endangered for the workers exposed to radiation in Area IV during the time period in question,” according to a letter sent to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. The panel also admitted it couldn’t reconstruct the radiation doses that qualified workers for compensation. Reconstructions often include simulating the worker’s exposures to radiation, using samples from other nuclear sites. But there was little information from the Santa Susana Field Lab and panelists couldn’t do it. Advertisement “It’s unbelievable,” Klea, a West Hills resident said. “The benefit of my petition to the workers was they will no longer have the burden of proof or have NIOSH do ‘dose construction’. They all get paid if they have a covered cancer and worked for 250 days in a covered area.” • RELATED STORY: Rocketdyne plant that built world’s most powerful rocket engines being razed Nestled between Simi Valley and Chatsworth, the Santa Susana Field Lab is a remote, 2,900-acre site developed in the 1940s. It was used to test rocket engines and conduct nuclear research. Boeing now owns a majority of the land. In 1989, the Department of Energy released a report admitting that a partial meltdown of a sodium reactor had occurred in 1959 in Area IV, which the DOE still oversees. The work left contamination in some parts of the area in soil and groundwater, specifically perchlorate and dioxin, the report said. A draft of a plan of options to clean up Area IV was recently released by the DOE and awaits public comment. Almost 1,500 claims were filed by cancer-stricken employees of Area IV or their families to the federal Department of Labor. So far, more than $58 million has been paid out. Klea estimates the claims are higher — more than 3,800 — since NIOSH also included workers who clocked in at the Rocketdyne headquarters in Canoga Park, a second facility in the West Valley and in Downey. Those who qualify under the new designation may be receiving letters advising them of what to do to make those claims. Her work also provides a strong foundation and leverage for former employees with cancer who worked in other areas of the Santa Susana Field lab, said D’Lanie Blaze, whose father worked for North American Aviation, one of the companies contracted by the Department of Energy. Her father became ill with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but because he didn’t clock in at the Area IV site, his claim was denied. She was able to prove and win that he was assigned to work in Area IV and still could be compensated even though he clocked in elsewhere across the Santa Susana Field Lab. She said she’s working on helping those like her dad qualify for compensation. She submitted a petition to ask the Department of Labor to acknowledge the inability to track workers movements through the Santa Susana Field Lab. “I believe it’s going to be considered,” said Blaze, who is a paid, authorized representative for the Department of Labor’s compensation worker program. Those interested in speaking with her can go to CORE Advocacy for Nuclear & Aerospace Workers at http://www.coreadvocacy.org/. “It’s my goal to see to it that it’s corrected and workers get a fair shake,” Blaze added. Klea called all the progress made and the designation expanded a “fabulous feeling.” “This was so special to get that many years without having to fight for it,” Klea added. “There may be workers from out of state who may qualify.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Susan Abram covers public health news for the Los Angeles Daily News and Los Angeles News Group.

Cooper case Fri Jan 13th, 2017 8:07pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Associated Press SEATTLE — Amateur scientists chosen by the Seattle FBI to search for clues in the mystery of the skyjacker known as D.B. Cooper may have found new evidence. KING-TV reported a team has been analyzing particles taken from a clip-on tie left by Cooper after he hijacked a passenger jet in 1971 and then vanished out the back wearing a parachute and pack with $200,000. An electron microscope located over 100,000 particles including Cerium, Strontium Sulfide and pure titanium. Lead researcher Tom Kaye said the elements could have been found in the manufacturing of Boeing’s high-tech Super Sonic Transport plane. Kaye wonders if Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor who wore a tie to work and said the public’s help is needed to discern whether that’s possible. The FBI closed the case last year.

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

The Wall Street Journal. 2:10 Legal experts: Trump's business plan falls short CNN Money 3:21 UP NEXT The chief executive of Lockheed Martin, Marillyn A. Hewson, said Friday that the company was “very close to a deal” to slice the costs for the new F-35 fighter jet, after weeks of talks with President-elect Donald J. Trump and his team about the jet. Speaking after meeting at Trump Tower, Ms. Hewson also pledged to add 1,800 jobs to the contractor’s Fort Worth location, although she did not go into specifics about whether the positions would be new or if they would be shifted from elsewhere. Lockheed was already expected to build more planes. “It’s going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States,” Ms. Hewson said. “I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price.” Lockheed Martin depends on the F-35 for nearly a quarter of its revenue. But the cost of building the military’s next-generation fighter jet, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, has been a sore point for the Defense Department for years. Mr. Trump has criticized the cost and promised to make changes to the program. At an estimated $400 billion for 2,443 planes — which are being built in different versions for the Air Force, the Marines and the Navy — the high-tech fighter is by far the military’s largest weapons project, and it is long overdue. But even before the latest pronouncement, the price of the plane had typically been dropping with each batch produced. In early November, days before the election, the Pentagon said it had unilaterally imposed a 3.7 percent price cut on the average cost of the planes over the previous batch after Lockheed had refused to agree to the decrease. The contract is valued at $6.1 billion for 57 planes. © Kevin Hagen for The New York Times Marillyn A. Hewson, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, leaving a meeting with President-elect Donald J. Trump at Trump Tower on Friday. Even without Mr. Trump’s pressure, the Pentagon would most likely have pushed for further price cuts. Mr. Trump has been pressing the cost issue very publicly over the last couple of months in a variety of ways, including on Twitter and in meetings with military contractors. In a Twitter post in December, Mr. Trump attacked the cost overruns for the fighter jet and pledged to save money. At one point, the president-elect said he had asked Lockheed’s rival, Boeing, for a price quote on the most comparable version of its older F/A-18 Super Hornet, although military analysts do not see the two planes as equivalent. Mr. Trump is just the latest in a long line of critics in both parties who have beaten up on the 15-year project only to see it survive, owing to its deep political support across the country. Lockheed has spread work on the F-35 to hundreds of subcontractors in most of the 50 states, and members of Congress typically oppose any cuts that would cost jobs in their states or districts. The F-35 was designed as a state-of-the-art aircraft for all branches of the military, with the goal of overwhelming adversaries with technological superiority. The jet would be able to evade radar and dodge sophisticated antiaircraft missiles while giving pilots a better picture of enemy threats advancing toward them.

Cooper case SEATTLE (AP) -- Amateur scientists chosen by the Seattle FBI to search for clues in the mystery of the skyjacker known as D.B. Cooper may have found new evidence. KING-TV reports (https://goo.gl/hp3fNR ) a team has been analyzing particles taken from a clip-on tie left by Cooper after he hijacked a passenger jet in 1971 and then vanished out the back wearing a parachute and pack with $200,000. An electron microscope located over 100,000 particles including Cerium, Strontium Sulfide and pure titanium. Lead researcher Tom Kaye says the elements could have been found in the manufacturing of Boeing's high-tech Super Sonic Transport plane. Kaye wonders if Cooper could have been a Boeing employee or a contractor who wore a tie to work and said the public's help is needed to discern whether that's possible. The FBI closed the case last year. --- Information from: KING-TV, http://www.king5.com/ © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Based on documents Klea filed beginning in 2007, the federal government decided that those who were employed by the DOE to work at the Santa Susana Field Lab and related offices from 1948 to 1988 should be compensated for illnesses they may have suffered as a result of working there. (Photo by Dean Musgrove, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG) By Susan Abram, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: 01/13/17, 6:33 PM PST | Updated: 1 day ago # Comments This 1954 file photo shows Verticle Test Stand (VTS-1) at Rocketdyne’s Santa Susana Field Lab. (Andy Holzman/Daily News Staff Photographer) As a secretary who worked for rocket engine maker Rocketdyne in the 1960s and 1970s, Bonnie Klea knew part of her job was to keep the federal government’s space exploration developments a secret. But years later, when the pain in her bladder became too much, when a doctor told her the cancer she suffered from was likely due to an occupational hazard, Klea learned the government also kept secrets from her and hundreds of employees who clocked into work each day at the facility high atop the hills near the San Fernando Valley. The battle to save her own life turned into a fight for justice for those who worked in Area IV, a portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory where top scientists tested rocket engines and nuclear power for decades. After learning that the Department of Labor had denied most of the claims for compensation filed by cancer-stricken workers under the 2000 Energy Employees Occupational Illness Program Act, Klea compiled letters, press releases, news articles and documentaries about radioactive and chemical contamination at the site. She delivered the petition to the federal government in 2007, which led to a victory: In 2009 the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH granted a special designation for those assigned to the field lab’s 280-acre Area IV. The designation applied to workers who were exposed to radiation for at least 250 days, between Jan. 1, 1955, and Dec, 31, 1958. Later, the time expanded to 1965. Last month, on its own, NIOSH agreed to widen the designation for those who worked in Area IV up until 1988. “NIOSH determined that health may have been endangered for the workers exposed to radiation in Area IV during the time period in question,” according to a letter sent to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. The panel also admitted it couldn’t reconstruct the radiation doses that qualified workers for compensation. Reconstructions often include simulating the worker’s exposures to radiation, using samples from other nuclear sites. But there was little information from the Santa Susana Field Lab and panelists couldn’t do it. Advertisement “It’s unbelievable,” Klea, a West Hills resident said. “The benefit of my petition to the workers was they will no longer have the burden of proof or have NIOSH do ‘dose construction’. They all get paid if they have a covered cancer and worked for 250 days in a covered area.” • RELATED STORY: Rocketdyne plant that built world’s most powerful rocket engines being razed Nestled between Simi Valley and Chatsworth, the Santa Susana Field Lab is a remote, 2,900-acre site developed in the 1940s. It was used to test rocket engines and conduct nuclear research. Boeing now owns a majority of the land. In 1989, the Department of Energy released a report admitting that a partial meltdown of a sodium reactor had occurred in 1959 in Area IV, which the DOE still oversees. The work left contamination in some parts of the area in soil and groundwater, specifically perchlorate and dioxin, the report said. A draft of a plan of options to clean up Area IV was recently released by the DOE and awaits public comment. Almost 1,500 claims were filed by cancer-stricken employees of Area IV or their families to the federal Department of Labor. So far, more than $58 million has been paid out. Klea estimates the claims are higher — more than 3,800 — since NIOSH also included workers who clocked in at the Rocketdyne headquarters in Canoga Park, a second facility in the West Valley and in Downey. Those who qualify under the new designation may be receiving letters advising them of what to do to make those claims. Her work also provides a strong foundation and leverage for former employees with cancer who worked in other areas of the Santa Susana Field lab, said D’Lanie Blaze, whose father worked for North American Aviation, one of the companies contracted by the Department of Energy. Her father became ill with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but because he didn’t clock in at the Area IV site, his claim was denied. She was able to prove and win that he was assigned to work in Area IV and still could be compensated even though he clocked in elsewhere across the Santa Susana Field Lab. She said she’s working on helping those like her dad qualify for compensation. She submitted a petition to ask the Department of Labor to acknowledge the inability to track workers movements through the Santa Susana Field Lab. “I believe it’s going to be considered,” said Blaze, who is a paid, authorized representative for the Department of Labor’s compensation worker program. Those interested in speaking with her can go to CORE Advocacy for Nuclear & Aerospace Workers at http://www.coreadvocacy.org/. “It’s my goal to see to it that it’s corrected and workers get a fair shake,” Blaze added. Klea called all the progress made and the designation expanded a “fabulous feeling.” “This was so special to get that many years without having to fight for it,” Klea added. “There may be workers from out of state who may qualify.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Susan Abram covers public health news for the Los Angeles Daily News and Los Angeles News Group.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Watch Trump Raises Millions to Cover Inauguration's Steep Costs By nancy benac, associated press WASHINGTON  Jan 13, 2017, 5:30 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email The inauguration of a new president requires the recitation of a 35-word oath. That's it. Dress it up with some hoopla and glitz, though, and pretty soon you're talking real money. Donald Trump will have it to spend. Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee has raised a record $90 million-plus in private donations, far more than President Barack Obama's two inaugural committees. They collected $55 million in 2009 and $43 million in 2013, and had some left over on the first go-round. But while Trump has raised more money for his inauguration than any president in history, he's aiming to do less with it. Lead inaugural planner Tom Barrack said this week the Trump team wants to avoid a "circus-like atmosphere" in favor of a more "back to work" mindset that surrounds Trump "with the soft sensuality of the place." Trump's committee has declined to provide details on how it's aiming to spend its hefty bankroll. Steve Kerrigan, CEO for Obama's inaugural committee in 2013 and chief of staff in 2009, said the $90 million fundraising haul looks like overkill. "I can't imagine how they are going to spend that amount of money — and why they would even keep raising money," he said. "We planned the two largest inaugurations in the history of our country and we never spent anywhere near that." Trump this week promised a "very, very elegant day" with "massive crowds." They'll arrive to find a party that isn't nearly as involved as Obama's. Trump is holding three inaugural balls; Obama had 10 balls at his first inaugural. Trump's team also hopes to keep its parade to 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than four and half hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first inauguration, in 1953. The president-elect's inaugural team has also failed to attract the kind of A-list performers who turned out in force for Obama. Trump's announced headliners are teen singer Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and the Radio City Rockettes. Spokesman Boris Epshteyn said the inaugural committee is "fully focused on organizing world-class events that honor our nation's tremendous history and reach every corner of the globe." Any excess money raised will be donated to charity. Obama used his excess inaugural dollars to help pay for the White House Easter egg roll and other events in his first term, Kerrigan said. Trump hasn't specified what charities might benefit from any leftovers, but some of his past pledges to donate to charity haven't always immediately panned out. Trump's committee has 90 days after the inauguration to reveal its donors, although some presidents have reported donations as they came in. A few contributors already are known. Among corporate donors, Boeing has given $1 million and Chevron, $500,000. AT&T says it has made both cash and in-kind donations, including quintupling phone capacity on the National Mall. Alex Howard, deputy director of the private Sunlight Foundation, said the Trump inaugural committee is a "major vector for corporations and individuals who wish to make donations and have influence on the presidency." He said the big donations and the lack of speedy disclosure "set a tone" that has implications for the transparency and accountability of the new president. To be sure, the inaugural lineup of balls, parade, reviewing stands, concert, dinners, bleachers and all the rest doesn't come cheap. John Liipfert, who helped produce the Obama inaugurals, said big outdoor events in winter are particularly expensive, requiring robust sound and video systems, warming tents, fencing, barricades, security screeners and much more. As for the balls, halls must be rented, stages built, lighting systems constructed and draperies and floral arrangements brought in to dress up the decor. "You'd be amazed," he said. "There are a million factors going into it." And don't forget all those portable toilets. There were 1,100 along the parade route in 2013. While a big share of the cost is covered by the private donations, taxpayers provide a considerable amount as well. They're on the hook, for example, to cover the close to $5 million cost of building the bunting-decorated 10,000 square-foot platform built on the West Front of the Capitol for the swearing-in. The public also pays security costs for an event that brings together a big chunk of the U.S. political leadership, hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans and a fair share of protesters. Because those expenses are scattered throughout the federal budget, it's hard to get a fix on just how much the day will cost. Some tabs are spelled out: $1.25 million for the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, which is responsible for the swearing-in ceremony, inaugural luncheon and review of troops, and $2.5 million for overtime for U.S. Capitol Police. More than 5,000 active duty service members and 7,500 National Guard members will take part, too. In 2009, spending by the military's inaugural joint task force and the Defense Department totaled $21.6 million. District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser says the city expects to spend at least $30 million, with the federal government reimbursing the full amount. So far, Congress has appropriated $19 million, and the city will go back to Congress after the swearing-in to ask for the rest. ——— Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Ben Nuckols contributed to this report. ——— Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac 0 Shares Email Star Comments Trump Raises Millions to Cover Inauguration's Steep Costs " Trump Suggests CIA Director 'Leaker' Behind Unsubstantiated Report " Central US Ice Storm Falls Short of Dire Forecasts " Meet Thumbelina, a Tiny Chihuahua Who Weighs Only 1.54 Pounds " 8-Year-Old Battling Cancer Gets Birthday Wish to See Amazon Facility " Twin's Mom Reacts to Emotional Reunion: 'It Didn't Feel Real' " Man Finds Forgotten Lotto Ticket, Wins $1 Million " Newlyweds Nail Iconic 'Dirty Dancing' Routine at Wedding " 2 Women Share How They Collectively Lost 100s of Pounds " Americans Think Obama, Kennedy, Reagan Gave Best Inaugural Speeches " Standing in for the Incoming President and First Lady at Inauguration Rehearsal " Jennifer Holliday Pulls Out of Trump's Inauguration After Backlash President Obama's Inauguration Day Plans " 5 Takeaways From Scathing Department of Justice Report on Chicago Policing " When Working 2 Fast Food Jobs, 16 Hours a Day Still Isn't Enough " Paris Jackson Pleased, 'Surprised' Network Canceled Michael Jackson Episode

He hopes to go into the defense industry, and wants to work on an airplane or spacecraft. Photo: Marcus Yam, TNS Aerospace firms start recruiting in prekindergarten 1 / 1 Back to Gallery University of Southern California mechanical engineering junior Stephanie Balais developed a passion for aerospace after joining the university’s AeroDesign team and helping to construct an airplane fuselage hours before transporting the plane to a competition in Kansas. As internships beckoned, she applied to many top defense and aerospace firms. But Microsoft Corp. snagged her first. This summer, Balais, 20, will spend 13 weeks in Redmond, Wash., working in the tech giant’s manufacturing and supply chain department. Silicon Valley and other tech centers have always been popular landing places for young engineers, with their lure of cutting-edge technology and top-notch pay. But aerospace companies are facing an even stiffer challenge as Web and computer companies, and other sectors like the auto industry, move into areas like drones and autonomous systems. Aerospace employers are realizing they have to dig deeper to capture top tech talent. They are starting to reach out earlier to potential employees — as early as elementary school or even prekindergarten — to get them interested in science and math. And they’re recognizing the challenge they have in building awareness with people from a generation that never had a real space race, but grew up with Google, Snapchat and Apple as part of their daily lives. “This is something that’s very critical to our member companies,” said Dan Stohr, spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association trade group. “They’re putting serious money into this, to the tune of millions of dollars a year.” Lockheed Martin Corp. has started a program called Generation Beyond to encourage middle school students to study deep space exploration. It includes a class curriculum, a Mars weather app and a traveling school bus modified so that children riding it can see the Martian landscape through the windows. “One of the things we’ve been seeing is that this generation of students doesn’t necessarily know (about) Lockheed Martin, as their parents did,” said Steve Hatch, the company’s director for central talent acquisition, of current college students. In early 2015, Northrop Grumman Corp. opened an innovation center called NG Next in Redondo Beach (Los Angeles County), where it is doubling down on basic research to find solutions to problems that may be years in the future. The organization takes a more aggressive approach to experimentation, which can be attractive to potential employees looking for a creative work environment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 26,000 aerospace engineers were employed as of May 2015 in product and parts manufacturing, a category that covers about 70 percent of the aerospace and defense industry. Joining them were about 5,900 electrical engineers, about 14,000 mechanical engineers and 12,000 developers of systems software. In computer and electronic product manufacturing, there were about 5,700 aerospace engineers, 30,300 electrical engineers, 18,400 mechanical engineers and 48,600 software developers of systems software. Defense firms have long maintained a presence on college campuses, whether at career fairs, sponsoring student engineering competitions, serving on advisory boards or providing scholarships. “Students encounter Google and Amazon frequently on the Web,” said Jayathi Murthy, dean of UCLA’s Engineering School. “So in order for (defense companies) to be heard above that, they really need to engage with us on campus, and they do.” A meeting with a Northrop Grumman executive during a USC recruiting event piqued Justin Jameson’s interest in working at the company. It ended up being the only place he applied to after graduating from USC in 2009. Jameson, 29, has now worked at Northrop Grumman for more than seven years. “I looked at a lot of the big consulting companies as well, but at Northrop Grumman, they offered me the chance to come in and work on real problems,” he said. “At a consulting company, I would be solving someone else’s problems.” That aspect attracted Addison Salzman, 21, who will graduate from USC in May with a degree in aerospace engineering. Salzman, who is interested in higher-level aircraft design, has already landed a full-time job at Boeing Co. and will start in July. “One of the big reasons that I chose it is because they have their hands in not just defense, but they have a very large commercial airplanes business,” he said. “It gives me a cool opportunity to explore the different applications of aerospace technologies.” Timothy John, an aerospace engineering student at UCLA, has been interested in space exploration since elementary school and has sent out a number of job applications to defense companies. John, 25, said he’s looking for longevity and growth in potential employers, but also hopes to work on an airplane or spacecraft. “I’m pretty indiscriminate,” he said. “Any projects that include planes, like anything with a jet turbine, like a F-16 or F-22 or stealth bombers. Or even missiles.” Though Northrop Grumman’s NG Next was not established specifically for recruiting, it has become a useful tool in hiring, Hernandez said. New employees can be part of an environment of rapid development and experimentation not generally associated with large defense contractors. “For us to achieve the great things that we need to achieve to solve the nation’s toughest problems, we have to push hard,” Hernandez said. The organization’s four main components — basic research, applied technology, advanced design and rapid prototyping — employ about 800 full- or part-time people, though faculty from research universities can also collaborate with NG Next scientists. The organization was also designed to have a larger tolerance for risk than what might be assumed for a big government contractor. “We want to move fast and hard, cautiously and consciously, but it’s OK if we fail every now and then,” Hernandez said, voicing a credo that aerospace engineers say held for the space program long before it became popular in Silicon Valley. “If we don’t, we’re probably not pushing hard enough.” Samantha Masunaga is a Los Angeles Times writer.
