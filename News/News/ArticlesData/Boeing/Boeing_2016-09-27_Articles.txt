Share story By Katherine Long Seattle Times higher education reporter Boeing is giving $6 million to a wide-ranging group of nonprofits and education institutions throughout the state in an effort to boost tech training and skills. The company is aiming to reach a diverse group of high school and college students, many of whom historically haven’t pursued STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education. In a phone interview Wednesday, Boeing CEO Ray Conner said the company wants to provide opportunities for tech jobs to a generation that’s growing more racially and ethnically diverse. “We’re trying to reach out to the population that has been a little bit underserved over the course of time,” he said.

Conner, a graduate of Highline High School in Burien and Central Washington University, said he hoped the grants would help better prepare Washington students for jobs at Boeing and other tech-centered companies in the region. “We talk about being a company that’s committed to the community, to our young people, and we want to put our money where our mouth is,” he said. The grants include $500,000 to the University of Washington to help underrepresented high school students plan their college careers, and be successful in school. It includes money to expand the Dream Project, an 11-year-old mentorship project started by a UW student that trains undergraduate UW students to help high-school students study for the SAT, apply for college and secure financial aid. Another $250,000 will go to Washington State University’s Everett campus, WSU North Puget Sound, to build a state-of-the-art lab space in the university’s new building that opens in about a year. The 900-square-foot lab will include a 3D printer and scanner, computer-controlled machining mill and laser cutter, and will be known as the Boeing Innovation Studio. And $250,000 will go to Seattle University’s College of Science and Engineering, to improve retention rates of nontraditional students in undergraduate engineering and computer science. In all, 50 institutions and nonprofits will receive money from the grants. Among the major recipients are Thrive Washington, which focuses on early learning; Washington STEM, which works with K-12 schools; and SkillUp Washington, which works with community and technical colleges. Some grants are so small as to be experimental in nature, and are meant to encourage new and different ideas, a Boeing spokesman said. Conner said he hopes the programs supported by the grants will give students “more of a near-term vision of what they could do right away” after graduating from high school or college. About half of Boeing’s technical workforce will be eligible for retirement in the next five to seven years. Boeing has 77,000 workers in Washington state, so it will need to fill tens of thousands of jobs in the coming years. “We don’t want to go anywhere else to make that happen,” Conner said. “That would be a real failure.” Katherine Long: 206-464-2219 or klong@seattletimes.com.

(AP Photo/Bob Edme) A dozen years after the U.S. first dragged the European Union to the WTO, the trade body ruled Thursday the EU hasn’t done enough to remedy the harm done by Airbus subsidies. Boeing declared victory while Airbus scoffed. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter A World Trade Organization (WTO) compliance panel ruled Thursday that the European Union has fallen dramatically short of remedying the harm to Boeing from illegal subsidies to Airbus. The decision opens a path for the U.S. to implement trade sanctions against the EU — potentially imposing billions of dollars in tariffs on its goods or services. In an early-morning news teleconference, the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Michael Froman, called the ruling “a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers.” “We will not tolerate our trading partners, even our closest trading partners, ignoring the rules at the expense of American workers,” Froman said.

Yet Airbus officials and some independent analysts shrugged off the ruling as another empty step in a tortuous proceeding that’s going nowhere — very slowly. It’s now more than a dozen years since the U.S. first dragged the European Union (EU) before the WTO dispute-settlement panel, and the EU will almost certainly appeal the new ruling. Scott Hamilton, Bainbridge Island-based aviation expert with Leeham.net, said he would be “shocked if tariffs are imposed on any Airbus or Boeing products and it would be stupid to impose tariffs against unrelated industries.” Still, Ted Austell, Boeing vice president for trade issues, declared the ruling a comprehensive legal beating for Airbus. He summarized the WTO report as saying “the EU and Airbus did essentially nothing at all to come into compliance” after the trade organization found the European jet maker had received illegal subsidies from France, Germany, the U.K. and Spain. The subsidies came largely in the form of “launch aid” — upfront loans to fund Airbus’ development of new jet programs. Boeing says Airbus used about $15 billion in launch aid to develop all its planes up to the A380 superjumbo, plus about $2 billion in other subsidies. In 2010, the WTO ruled those loans illegal because the European governments gave Airbus the money on highly favorable, noncommercial terms. In a surprise step, Thursday’s WTO ruling also declared illegal nearly $5 billion in additional government loans that Airbus used to launch its latest jet, the A350, which competes with Boeing’s 787 and 777 airplanes. Though those loans were granted after the U.S. filed its original case, the WTO decided they should be covered by the same ruling. “It is apparent that the A350XWB could not have been launched and brought to market in the absence of launch aid,” the WTO report said. In assessing the competitive harm done, the report said that, as a result of the Airbus launch aid, Boeing lost 50 orders in the 787/777 large-aircraft category, 54 in the 747 very-large jet category and 271 in the 737 narrowbody-jet category. Airbus reacts In a statement, Boeing Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said the ruling “finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules.” In response, Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said Muilenburg “should be careful throwing stones at us while he himself sits in a glass house.” “Boeing might later be hit by a rock when the next WTO ruling comes,” Enders added, referring to the EU’s parallel countersuit against Boeing. In an email after the U.S. Trade Representative’s news conference, Airbus Senior Vice President Rainer Ohler derided the WTO process as “pathetic,” saying it has so far produced no material result for Boeing. He said “only tiny tweaks” will be required to make the A350 launch-aid terms compliant with WTO rules. Ohler praised the European “public-private partnership model,” based on providing reimbursable loans, as “stronger than ever.” In contrast, he was cynical about the U.S. alternative of government funding. He characterized Boeing as tapping “the U.S. military-industrial complex” for money. Ohler also mocked the Boeing 787 as a “subsidy-liner” and said the U.S. jet maker “has laid the biggest egg in subsidy history” with the $8.7 billion in tax breaks for the 777X from the state of Washington. Protracted procedures Inescapably, though, Thursday’s ruling zeroed in on the Airbus subsidies. It has been six years since the world trade body ruled that European government subsidies to Airbus were illegal. A year later, an appeals panel reduced the charges somewhat, but retained major findings against Airbus and required the EU to remedy the harm done to Boeing. The new report undercut the European claim that only “limited changes” in its practices will suffice to fix its funding model. Only two of 36 actions Airbus took toward meeting its WTO obligations qualified as steps toward compliance, the report said. Austell, of Boeing, pointed to the Airbus A380 program as a clear example of how launch aid distorts the market. The A380 program faces potential closure unless the jet maker gets significant new orders in the next couple of years — a situation Boeing also faces with the 747. If the A380 is terminated, Austell said, Airbus’ ability to walk away from its launch-aid loans on that program without fully repaying them is an unacceptable advantage. “Programs like the A380 need to have a commercial consequence,” he said. “The last thing we want is for Airbus to pirouette away from that loan obligation … and have no economic consequence on the balance sheet.” Countersuit vs. Boeing Meanwhile, a countersuit the EU brought against U.S. for subsidies to Boeing is moving in parallel. In that case, the WTO ruled five years ago that a much lower level of Boeing subsidies were also illegal. Boeing was found guilty of receiving about $2.7 billion in subsidies, including NASA research grants and state subsidies such as the 2003 tax breaks granted by the state of Washington. However, the EU filed that suit more than a year after the U.S. filed its case against Airbus, and its outcome is still lagging. A ruling on U.S. compliance with the remedies demanded in that ruling is expected by next spring. Bob Novick, former general counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative during President Clinton’s administration, insisted the two cases are as comparable as an elephant is to a mouse. Novick, now a managing partner at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr and outside counsel to Boeing on the WTO dispute, argued that the impact of those subsidies is tiny compared with the impact of the billions Airbus received upfront every time it developed a new plane. “The nature of launch aid, the effect it has had in allowing Airbus to build all of its airplanes, and the harm the WTO found it caused to Boeing are not matched by anything even alleged by the EU that the U.S. gave to Boeing,” Novick said. Trade war? Michael Lutting, Boeing executive vice president and general counsel, said that “whatever happens in the European cases against the United States,” Airbus needs to end its launch-aid programs. But a European source close to the Airbus case, who asked not to be identified, characterized the whole WTO process as a waste of time and money that will not produce any enforceable outcome. This person said Boeing has merely succeeded in proving the toothlessness of the WTO to the Chinese, the Russians and other competitors. He pointed out that Canada recently poured $2 billion directly into Montreal-based Bombardier’s new CSeries jet program, unafraid of any consequences at the WTO. Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst with the Teal Group, agreed. “It’s a nice moral victory. It validates what Boeing has been saying. But how does it produce anything tangible?” he asked. “It won’t change much.” Leeham.net’s Hamilton was even more cynical. “Only the lawyers get rich,” he said. An Airbus spokeswoman said any appeal of the ruling will likely center on the narrow issue of whether the interest rates for its government loans correspond to commercial terms. “We are confident that we will win that point on appeal,” the spokeswoman said. “Whatever Boeing will say, nobody will have to go to the bank. There have never been any repayments and there never will be. It is not in the spirit of WTO.” Assuming an EU appeal failed and the WTO approved retaliatory tariffs — which could potentially amount to more than $10 billion — the U.S. government could then move to slap tariffs on EU products or services. Political reality is that a trade war would not begin without serious negotiations between the EU and U.S. Such negotiations are unlikely until the case against Boeing reaches the same stage as the one against Airbus and all appeals in both are exhausted.

Boeing jet deal means big boost for St. Louis jobs By Chuck Raasch St. Louis Post-Dispatch Chuck Raasch Sep 28, 2016 (…) Courtesy Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. WASHINGTON • The administration of President Barack Obama has approved $7 billion in long-stalled sales of Boeing Co. fighter jets to Kuwait and Qatar, a decision that could preserve thousands of jobs in the St. Louis area. The deal had been delayed for more than two years, amid concerns by Israel that the planes posed a threat to that nation’s security. But members of Missouri’s delegation had long touted the sale as a jobs boost for the St. Louis region, where F/A-18E/F Super Hornets and F-15 Eagles are produced. The Navy also is considering building an additional 14 or more Super Hornets to replace aging ones and add to the Pentagon’s strike-force capabilities, although funding for them has been caught in the ongoing debate over spending bills now stalled in Congress. Reuters reported earlier this month that the sale had essentially been approved and that the next step would be notifying members of Congress. U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin, was among lawmakers applauding the decision. The fighter jet sales, she said, “will help our allies located within a volatile region fight the growing threats of Islamic extremism.” “These jets are also critical to the St. Louis manufacturing base and support 5,000 families whose loved ones build these jets, as well as thousands of additional jobs across Missouri,” she said. “I am thrilled that this sale was approved, which will keep the Super Hornet production line in St. Louis running into 2020.” U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis, agreed. “The administration’s approval of additional foreign sales of Boeing F-15 Eagles and Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets will not only strengthen our Gulf allies, it will protect thousands of skilled manufacturing jobs in north St. Louis County and at Boeing suppliers across Missouri and Illinois,” Clay said in a statement. U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said via Twitter, “I’ve been proud to back the F-15 and F-18 programs and the thousands of jobs they support, and will continue to do so.” The sales were delayed amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington’s closest Middle East ally. U.S. officials have also criticized Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Earlier this month, the U.S. pledged to provide $38 billion in military assistance to Israel over the next decade, the largest such aid package in history. The state of Qatar requested to buy at least 36 of the F-15 air-superiority jets, and possibly 72. Boeing is busy building F-15s for Saudi Arabia, and those orders would keep production lines in north St. Louis County running into 2019. The Qatari orders, worth $4 billion, would extend that into the early 2020s. Kuwait had requested 28 F/A-18 Super Hornet attack jets, with an option for 12 more. Boeing has enough orders to keep that line running into 2018. The $3 billion Kuwaiti order, combined with orders requested by the Navy, would extend production into 2020.

Check our People in Business See how St. Louis stocks are faring Boeing employs nearly 15,000 people in the St. Louis area. Boeing has never specified the number employed on the fighter programs, but it reaches several thousand. The White House also approved a sale of 17 Lockheed F-16 fighters to Bahrain, Reuters reported. The sales will be announced formally once the informal 40-day congressional notification period has ended. Then lawmakers will have 30 days to block the sales, although such action is rare. The approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House tries to bolster relations with Persian Gulf Arab allies who want to upgrade their military capabilities. They fear the United States is drawing closer to Iran, their archrival, after Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers last year. Qatar, home to the largest U.S. air base in the Middle East, and Kuwait have ramped up military spending after uprisings across the Arab world and amid rising tension between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states and Iran, the region’s Shiite power. Both Qatar and Kuwait are part of a 34-nation alliance announced by Saudi Arabia in December aimed at countering Islamic State and al-Qaida militants in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan. Sources said both the U.S. State Department and Pentagon had largely agreed to the deals some time ago but had been awaiting final approval from the White House.

By Richard Tomkins   |   Sept. 28, 2016 at 4:08 PM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter SEATTLE, Sept. 28 (UPI) -- The first of 12 P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force has been unveiled by Boeing at a rollout ceremony in Seattle, Wash. The maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft, based on the design of Boeing's 737-800 fuselage, will fly to Australia in November. "It is a privilege to accept the first Australian P-8A Poseidon aircraft," Australia's Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Leo Davies, said at the rollout ceremony. "The P-8A is the latest in a pedigree of Boeing aircraft that have provided important and significant operational capability to Australia." The aircraft, used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and shipping interdiction, features a weapons bay as well as under-wing and under-fuselage hard points for weapons. It has a maximum speed of 564 miles per hour, a combat radius of 1,200 nautical miles and a service ceiling of 41,000 feet. Australia's Director Maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Response Transition Office, Group Captain Roger McCutcheon, says the P-8A will be a fundamental element of Australia's future maritime patrol and response strategy in replacing the country's AP-3C Orion aircraft, which are slated for retirement in 2018-2019. Boeing said the remaining 11 Poseidons for Ausstralia will be delivered by 2020.

Boeing churns out P-8 sub hunters based on 737 Originally published September 27, 2016 at 6:09 pm Updated October 4, 2016 at 1:21 pm Boeing rolled out the Royal Australian Air Force’s first P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft Tuesday. The plane — a rare military-procurement program delivering on time and under budget — is already in service with both the U.S. Navy and the Indian Navy. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Boeing on Tuesday rolled out the first P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft — based on its 737 commercial jet — destined for the Royal Australian Air Force. On a tour of the plant at Boeing Field where mechanics install the plane’s military systems, Steve Tripp, who heads P-8 sales to foreign militaries, touted the efficiency of Boeing’s P-8 manufacturing operation. The program is going so smoothly that Boeing has been able to drop the base price of the aircraft by about 30 percent from about $170 million to $115 million. “It’s good to be a major defense acquisition program that delivers on time and under budget,” Tripp said.

The Australian jet, the first of 12 for that nation, is the 60th flying P-8 built. The U.S. Navy has already taken six flight-test P-8s and 45 production aircraft, and has deployed those on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in the western Pacific, the Mediterranean and North Atlantic. The Indian Navy took eight P-8s. Boeing also built two ground-test planes at the program’s outset. At the rollout ceremony, Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, commander of U.S. Naval Air Forces, said Boeing has been delivering a “tremendous quality” aircraft. Air Marshal Leo Davies, head of Australia’s Air Force, said the 220 Australians currently training on the P-8 in the U.S. are excited to finally get their hands on the P-8’s advanced technology. The P-8 bristles with antennae and fins used to detect radio or acoustic signals. Sonobuoys are deployed from tubular holes in the jet’s underbelly to listen for submarines. The wings are fitted with pylons to carry Harpoon missiles for striking surface ships. A bomb bay carries Mark 54 torpedoes. Inside the plane, operators sit at five computer work stations with touch screens, monitoring the data from sensors and weapons systems and networking with other aircraft and military assets. An unusual blister on the casing of the standard 737 CFM engine covers a powerful generator that runs all the mission systems on board. Built differently The jets are assembled and painted in Renton, then flown to Boeing Field and moved at night across East Marginal Way South to the old Thompson building — where in the 1960s the first few 737 airliners were built. Because the old building isn’t quite wide enough, the P-8’s raked wingtips are removed before it enters, then put back on when it emerges. A tour of the Thompson site Tuesday — no photos allowed due to military restrictions — indicated how Boeing has been able to achieve the cost efficiency that’s impressed the U.S. Navy. The old way Boeing manufactured a military derivative aircraft — say a 707-based Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane — was to build a basic commercial airframe, then deliver it to a special completion center where holes would be cut out of it for weapons and structural parts beefed up as needed for the mission load. For the P-8, Boeing introduced “in-line production,” meaning that all those structural changes to the airframe are incorporated as it is built, not afterward. So for example, the aluminum skin of a P-8 is almost twice as thick as a regular 737 because the airframe has to withstand much more stressful maneuvers. So from the beginning of production, a different gauge of metal is used. “From the day this was a roll of aluminum, it was always going to be a P-8, not a 737,” Tripp said. Likewise the fuselage and wings have many more stiffening stringers and frames, meaning many more rivets. The holes in the fuselage for regular passenger windows are absent. But one big picture window on each side of the fuselage accommodates a spotter looking for surface vessels. The large bomb bay is cut out of the belly. That’s the way the fuselage is built by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kan. “We don’t build it, unbuild it and rebuild it,” said Tripp. “We build it from day one with this end state in mind.” As a result, the Thompson building is very quiet. Instead of riveting or metal work, the mechanics are installing, plugging in and testing the systems. Between 1,000 and 1,300 defense-side employees work on the P-8 program in Seattle, with hundreds more staffing the P-8 assembly line in Renton. They are producing 12 of the jets per year now, and moving to 18 per year. The U.K. ordered nine P-8s at the Farnborough Air Show near London in July. Boeing expects more foreign sales.

The serious conclusions, which have been announced today, require serious arguments and moreover facts," the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said. "The data, which the investigation group presented at a briefing on Wednesday, had been taken from two main sources: the Internet and Ukraine’s security services.

"For our part, we want a maximum objective investigation, which will help identifying persons who are really responsible for the July 17, 2014 crash. We will continue rendering all the necessary assistance to the investigation," he added. Russian air defense systems never crossed Ukrainian border According to Konashenkov, no Russian air defense systems have ever crossed the Ukrainian border.

RT takes a look at what we know so far from investigators and experts. Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777 flight MH17 left from Amsterdam for the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014. The airliner was shot down over the war-torn Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board, from 10 countries, were killed, 80 children among them. The plane was directed by Ukrainian air traffic control to fly over the armed conflict zone, where Ukrainian government forces had been battling rebels, opposing a coup-imposed government in Kiev. By July 2014, Kiev had lost at least 16 military aircraft in the crackdown, including two that went down just days prior to the MH17 tragedy. The airspace, however, had not been closed to civilian flights. There are two official probes into the MH17 disaster - a technical inquiry led by the Dutch Safety Board, and a separate criminal investigation by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT). It consists of investigators and experts from the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Malaysia and Ukraine, and is set to determine who was responsible for the incident. Read more Final MH17 crash report ‘unsubstantiated, inaccurate,’ new Russian probe says Dutch Safety Board report The biggest public report to come out on the downing of MH17 so far was released by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) in October 2015. According to the DSB’s findings, the Boeing 777 was shot down by a Buk missile with a 9N314M warhead. The Dutch experts were unable to determine which side in the conflict – the Ukrainian government forces or the rebels – was responsible for firing the missile. At the same time the 279-page report, which focused on the technical details connected with the incident and their implications for flying over conflict zones, stressed that the aviation authorities “did not adequately recognize the risks of the armed conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine to overflying civil aviation,” adding that there was “sufficient reason for closing the airspace above the eastern part of Ukraine as a precaution.” The DSB report provided no explanation for Ukraine’s failure to close the airspace over the conflict zone. Read more MH17 downed by outdated BUK missile fired from Kiev-controlled area – Defense system manufacturer Buk producer experiment Two unprecedented large-scale experiments, conducted by the Russian Almaz-Antey defense company in order to recreate the MH17 tragedy, concluded that the missile that downed the flight was an old model last produced in the Soviet Union in 1986 and fired from a Ukraine-controlled area, contesting the theory by Dutch investigators. The Dutch investigators said the missile came from somewhere within a 320 square kilometer area within eastern Ukraine, which would mean it could not establish the side of the conflict which had controlled that launch site. Meanwhile, the experiment conducted by Almaz-Antey (the producer of the Buk missile system) reportedly demonstrated that the aircraft could only have been hit by a Buk missile if it had come from the village of Zaroshchenskoye in Ukrainian military-controlled territory. Read more MH17 could have been downed unintentionally – int’l investigation team Joint Investigation Team comments from June Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 could have been downed “unintentionally,” a preliminary report by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in June, adding that experts working on the case often lack the experience and data needed. “An important question for the criminal investigation is whether a missile can be launched unintentionally. Did anyone accidentally push a button which caused the missile to be launched? Or can this only be done by means of a conscious act?” reads a JIT report, published on the Dutch Public Prosecution Service’s website. The Dutch report gives no answers, complaining that it is often hard to find the relevant information while the investigators involved in the enquiry are simply “untrained” for dealing with such issues. Read more Russian radar data shows no missile attack on MH17 from rebel side, indicates Ukraine involvement New radar data Newly discovered raw data picked up by a civilian radar station on the day of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash shows no signs of a missile being fired at the plane from territory controlled by rebels, the Russian military and radar producer Lianozovsky Electromechanical Plant reported earlier this week. The plant is the producer of the Utyos-T civilian radar station and one such station is deployed near the village of Ust-Donetsky in western Russia. The data showed three civilian aircraft in the vicinity, including the MH17. The one closest to it was flying about 30km from the Malaysian Boeing at the time it was shot down. “The Ust-Donetsky radar picked up no foreign objects near the Malaysian plane which could have caused its destruction,” said Viktor Meshcheryakov, the company’s deputy chief radar designer. This contradicts the scenario maintained by Kiev, in which a Buk missile could have been fired from the rebel-controlled village of Snezhnoye. The missile could have not been picked up by the radar if it had approached from a direction along the line connecting the radar station and the airliner, Meshcheryakov noted. Gen. Andrey Koban, head of the Russian Air Force radar troops, said that “the fact that Ukraine has not published radar data leads us to the conjecture that the missile, if it was a Buk, was launched from territory under the control of the Ukrainian military.” Read more MH17 downing anniversary: Two years of accusations & few facts Blame game Ukraine and its foreign sponsors accuse Russia of arming and supporting the rebels, an accusation that Moscow denies. Amid the hostilities, Kiev regularly accused Russia of invading Ukraine, claiming that it could not seize control of its eastern territory because of the Kremlin’s fighter jets, tanks, and multiple rocket launchers. Almost immediately after the MH17 was downed, Western media and some governments blamed Russia, claiming Moscow had either provided the Buk system to the rebels or sent its regular troops to take down Ukrainian warplanes on their behalf. In response to the accusations, Moscow has demanded that a thorough investigation be carried out and suggested plausible scenarios that contradict the Western narrative. It has also challenged Kiev’s claims that Ukraine had neither warplanes nor Buk systems in the area by producing public satellite and radar images showing evidence to the contrary. While the US claims to have evidence proving the rebels’ complicity, that data, if it does indeed exist, has never been declassified or shared with the public or investigators. Read more ‘Reading tea leaves’: German expert questions Bellingcat’s MH17 photo scoop Activists’ analysis The mystery behind the MH17 crash has prompted many to launch their own investigations. Among them was British online investigative activist group Bellingcat, which tried to prove that the Malaysian Boeing was shot down by a Buk missile system belonging to the Russian Army. It also accused Russia of altering satellite images from the MH17 disaster. German image forensics expert Jens Kriese criticized their methods and conclusions. “What Bellingcat is doing is nothing more than reading tea leaves. Error Level Analysis is a method used by hobbyists,” Kriese, a professional image analyst and former scientific researcher, said. This month, a group of Russian activists also released what they say is a fresh batch of discrepancies spotted in Bellingcat’s MH17 investigation.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: September 28th, 2016 >> Story Satnews Daily September 28th, 2016 Future Leaders & Mentor Of The Year Named By SSPI The Society of Satellite Professionals International (SSPI) will present their 2016 Promise Awards to: Dr. Jennifer Dawson of Space Systems Loral (SSL) Pascale Dumit of SES Erin Feller of Boeing Network & Space Systems   The Promise Awards honor three satellite executives age 35 and under for outstanding achievement in the early stages of their career. The three recipients will be honored on November 9th in New York City at SSPI’s 11th Annual Future Leaders Dinner. On that night, SSPI will also honor its 2016 Mentor of the Year, David Myers of DataPath, for the encouragement, support, and inspiration he has provided to young professionals throughout his career. “We received a large number of nominations from the US and Europe this year,” said SSPI executive director Robert Bell, “and the choice was particularly difficult.  The three winners represent the most outstanding of an extraordinary group. whom we will be honoring through the rest of the year and into 2017.  And there’s something just as extraordinary about them in this male-dominated industry: on average, three-quarters of winners over the past four years have been women, compared with only one-quarter in the prior four years.” The 2016 Future Leaders Dinner (www.satfuture.com) takes place at The Penn Club in Manhattan on Wednesday, November 9th, on the first night of the 2016 NAB New York Show. The proceeds of the dinner go to fund SSPI’s educational, professional development and industry growth initiatives. During the 2016 NAB New York Show, the three Promise Award winners will participate in the November 10 keynote panel, “Pathways to the Future - A Dialogue Between Today's Industry Leaders and the Promise of the Future,” featuring Mark Spiwak, the President of Boeing Satellite Systems International. The panel will be presented at 11:30 a.m. The SSPI 2016 Promise Award Winners: Dr. Jennifer Dawson Director, Marketing & Sales, Space Systems Loral (SSL) Dr. Jennifer Dawson of Space Systems Loral (SSL). Before joining the company, Jennifer was a researcher at Stanford University, where she developed a cryogenic test facility, conducted experiments on a superconducting position sensor, defined requirements, and fabricated and tested customized electrical connectors. While at Stanford, Jennifer received a NASA Group Achievement Award in 2005 for her work on the Gravity Probe B relativity gyroscope experiment developed by NASA and the university. After finishing her PhD, she went on to teach for two years at York College in Pennsylvania. Jennifer joined SSL in 2010 as a Senior Spacecraft Systems Engineer. In that position, she performed critical analysis of satellite design and led teams in design, test, and anomaly resolution. In particular, she led the mechanical design and environmental accommodation team for a NASA-hosted payload. In 2012, Jennifer became the Chair of SSL’s Shock Committee. The Committee defines company-wide shock qualification requirements and oversees design and test for shock caused by the extreme environment that a satellite has to withstand at launch. As Chair, she redefined the company’s qualification requirements, simplifying them and eliminating over-specification. Jennifer became Product Assurance Program Manager in 2015 and was one of the youngest employees at SSL to ever take on this position. In this role, she led the mission assurance team for one of SSL’s satellites to ensure spacecraft quality and reliability.  She oversaw all analysis, design, integration, and testing, and helped the customer directly with their own oversight. In September 2016 Jennifer assumed her current role as Director of Marketing and Sales, where she channels her technical and customer-focused experience into helping satellite operators develop systems that strengthen their businesses. Her experience as a teacher and researcher has helped Jennifer drive SSL to establish new technical standards and to educate her colleagues in putting these new practices into place. She is known for looking beyond established practices for solutions to problems and is always offering fresh approaches and ideas when confronted with a challenge. According to Senior Vice President of Program Management David Bernstein, Jennifer is “dedicated to doing things the right way” and “explains things very well and is always open to teaching what she knows.” She excels at managing and training others both inside and outside the company and is currently mentoring students through both Bucknell University and Stanford University. Pascale Dumit Manager, Spectrum Management and Development, Americas, SES Pascale Dumit of SES. Pascale began her career in the satellite industry in 2005 at Hughes, where she designed and commissioned broadband satellite networks in Africa and the Americas. Pascale went on to work as a consultant at ITT Exelis (now the Harris Corporation) where she supported NASA as well as the Department of Defense on a broad range of international spectrum management issues and contributed to the overall development and implementation of strategy in national and international spectrum regulatory environments. As a Manager of Spectrum Management and Development at SES, Pascale manages spectrum matters both at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and is responsible for the development and protection of spectrum assets for select SES projects over the Americas. She is currently leading all domestic and international spectrum-related activities, including coordination and licensing for SES-15, a new high throughput satellite to be launched in 2017 and expected to serve SES’s leading aeronautical customers and other traffic intensive data applications such as government, VSAT networks and maritime. Throughout her career, Pascale has demonstrated a natural leadership as well as an inherent ability to bring together various parties and drive collaboration among them to achieve successful results. According to Kimberly Baum, Vice President of Spectrum Management and Development for the Americas and Pascale’s manager, she regularly has “government representatives request that Pascale attend their meetings; they know she is the most reliable, effective advocate they could have to achieve the US’s objectives at any given meeting.” In a particularly exemplary display of coordination and leadership, Pascale was instrumental in coordinating efforts among the satellite industry representatives at the international meetings leading up to the ITU World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15) and led major advocacy efforts that resulted in the protection of existing spectrum for SES’s customers and regulatory certainty for the industry. In addition to her many achievements at SES, Pascale is an active member of her community. For the last 10+ years, she has consistently dedicated herself to helping other engineers succeed. Pascale was recently recognized by her alma mater, The George Washington University, for her service to the university community and received the university’s 2016 Alumni Outstanding Service Award. She served as Chair of the Engineering Alumni Association (GW EAA) from 2013 to 2015, and held several other positions within the GW EAA in previous years. Pascale remains involved in the GW EAA to this day. Erin Feller Advanced Government Space Systems Project Manager, Boeing Network & Space Systems Erin Feller of Boeing Network & Space Systems. During her time at Boeing, Erin has led space and ground architecture studies aimed at revolutionizing the future of the industry. She has consistently demonstrated her strong communication and leadership skills both within the company and with government customers. According to her direct manager, Matt Richards, Erin “is regularly sought after within the Boeing satellite business as one of the top proposal leads” and he has been “approached by Boeing executives across government and commercial satellite systems organizations requesting Ms. Feller by name to support their highest priority new business campaigns.” Early in her career at Boeing, Erin was instrumental in establishing the Concurrent Integrated Engineering Laboratory (CIEL), used for rapid satellite design development at the Boeing Satellite Design Center. Using the experience and insight she gained from working on the CIEL, she went on to perform many design-to-cost exercises for the development of commercial-like concepts for military satellite communications spacecraft. Erin has led several critical programs at Boeing, recently including one of the company’s largest business orders for 2016. Erin is also spearheading an effort to develop new commercial-like offerings for international partners on military satellite communications (MILSATCOM). As part of this effort, she led the team in developing three different technical spacecraft offerings as well as business strategy. In addition to her technical, leadership, project management, and business skills, Erin brings energy, creativity, and focus to the greater satellite enterprise, and she is known for inspiring the same in others who work with her. She has consistently developed innovative teams as a leader at Boeing, teams that her customers acknowledge as focused and efficient. Erin has been selected for Boeing’s Emerging Leader Development Program and hopes to take on more leadership roles and responsibility in the future. Beyond her many achievements, Erin has consistently worked to help other engineering students beginning during her days as one of them. While working on her Mechanical Engineering degree at the University of Nebraska, she spent two years as a resident assistant and leading recruiting and social activities in the engineering department as an Engineering Ambassador. While at Boeing, Erin has dedicated much of her personal time to helping newly hired Boeing engineers. She is a founding member of “Boeing Spacecraft and Flight Systems Engineering Early Career Think Tank” as well as part of the original team that developed and implemented a campus-wide new hire and early career summer training program. The SSPI 2016 Mentor of the Year David Myers President & CEO, DataPath David Myers, the President and CEO of DataPath. As President & CEO of DataPath, David Myers is leading a renewed privately-owned company that emerged after a spin-out from publically traded Rockwell Collins.  Over the past two-plus years, the revitalized DataPath has developed an array of new offerings including satellite antenna systems, remote management software, connectivity services, and cyber security solutions.  These investments are fueling an overall strategy to provide end-to-end communications solutions for the aerospace, broadcast, defense, and infrastructure markets.  To date, the reinvestment in DataPath has resulted in over $400M in new contract awards. Prior to joining DataPath, David held a number of senior level positions across the satellite industry, developing brands, launching new products and entering new markets.  David spent several years at Harris CapRock (formerly CapRock Communications), as Vice President of Marketing & Product Management, President of Government Solutions, and ultimately Chief Commercial Officer.  One of his proudest accomplishments was the development of “CommandAccess®,” the industry’s first military-grade satellite subscription service. David also previously served as Chief Marketing Officer for ITC Global, where he expanded the company’s market presence from a relative unknown to among the top three brands in the oil & gas and mining markets.  David first entered the satellite industry at Spacenet, where he worked his way up from business development and product management roles to eventually serve as the company’s Senior Vice President of Marketing & Corporate Development. In addition to product and market innovation, David believes the core foundation for any successful company is a highly collaborative culture.  The key is encouraging initiative and creativity from every employee, regardless of title or tenure.  To foster this culture, David regularly walks the factory floor and holds skip level lunch meetings, so he can hear first-hand what “real people” think about their jobs and how the company is doing.  These live interactions often result in a new idea for a product or process.  David’s favorite approach is to empower the person who championed the idea to build a task force and “make it happen.” In a manager’s meeting shortly after taking over as CEO David remarked, “Rapidly growing organizations must be dynamic. You don’t necessarily need to have all the right players in all the right positions, right away.   Making a team successful is about recruiting great all-around athletes and then helping them find something to own, where they can apply their talents and passion to drive the company’s performance.” When notified about his selection for the SSPI Mentor of the Year award, David said, “I consider myself a life-long student of the industry and fortunate to have worked with and learned from some amazing people.  I am a true believer in the SSPI mission to encourage new talent to build impactful careers in the exciting and dynamic industry that is satellite communications.” www.sspi.org   Topical Tags :  Events    Business Moves    Executive Moves    Service Provider          Regional Tags :  North America    Global                 FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News Thrusting Galileo Update: Thursday Evening's Status...ULA's Atlas V Gets Ready To GOES-R Better Satellite World Award Honorees Brought To Light By SSPI Core Concerns Regarding Cybersecurity For The Satellite Industry Voiced By SIA & GVF Pairing Up For Multi-Screen Goodness Are Broadpeak & Eutelsat Communications More News AST Involved In Weather Warning Implementation System In Malaysia Rock Seven Is Buoyed Up For Seafaring SATCOM Solutions The Rebirth Of A UK Satellite Broadcasting Group Care To Chip In To Project Blue?

Speaking at a press conference, held on September 27, Oman Air’s chief executive officer Paul Gregorowitsch delivered a key report on the airline’s progress and plans for continued expansion. Additional details were supplied by chief commercial officer Abdulrahaman Al Busaidy, and executive vice president, Products and Brand Development, Abdulaziz Alraisi. Gregorowitsch said: “I am pleased to report that Oman Air has achieved important progress over the last two years and I am optimistic about the company’s future. With the invaluable support of Oman Air’s board of directors, we have a clear vision, achievable objectives and a set of values to which all our employees are committed. We are also delivering an ambitious and dynamic programme of fleet and network expansion. This has seen the company take delivery of outstanding new aircraft, introduce a range of exciting new destinations and launch new products and services which contribute to a seamless passenger experience. “Despite substantial economic challenges, Oman Air is in a strong position to continue its progress towards becoming a successful, sustainable company of the highest quality: in other words, To Become the Best.” Oman Air’s fleet expansion programme has already made significant progress. With the first of the new aircraft being delivered in the last quarter of 2014, Oman Air fleet size stood at 35 aircraft by January 2015. One year later, in January 2016, the fleet had increased in size to 41 aircraft. Currently Oman Air’s fleet consists of four Boeing 787 Dreamliners, six Airbus 330-300s, four Airbus 330-200s, five Boeing 737-900s, 21 Boeing 737-800, one Boeing 737-700 and four Embraer 175s. Oman Air has operated B737s for many years and the aircraft provide the backbone of the airline’s long and medium haul fleet. Furthermore, Oman Air was the first carrier in the Middle East region to operate the B737-900ER aircraft type. Meanwhile, the introduction of the first of many B787 Dreamliners – initially on the Muscat to Frankfurt service - represents a step-change in the Oman Air long haul passenger experience. The aircraft offers guests more natural light, increased cabin pressure, cleaner cabin air and reduced noise. Benefits for the airline include outstanding fuel economy, reduced emissions and a lower noise footprint. Oman Air’s fleet size stands at 45 aircraft, with at least two more B737s expected to be delivered before the end of the year, and four more B787s due for delivery over the next two years. Gregorowitsch also described how Oman Air’s network has grown in parallel with its fleet expansion. "Recent international destinations to be added to the airline’s network include Manila, Jakarta, Singapore, Goa, Dhaka and Mashhad, while Guangzhou in China will be launched on December 9, 2016. Frequencies have also been increased on many established routes, including Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich and London, whilst all Indian destinations now enjoy at least daily or double-daily services. In addition, we will be launching, Manchester, our second destination in the UK in our Summer 2017 schedule.” Customer choice has been further broadened through the strategic use of codeshare agreements with airline’s that share Oman Air’s commitment to quality. The company currently operates codeshare partnerships with Emirates Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Royal Jordanian, Turkish Airlines, Sri Lankan Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Garuda Airlines, Saudia and Thai Airways. Gregorowitsch continued: “Oman Air has enjoyed a long history of working closely with commercial partners to deliver added value for our customers. The positive and productive codeshare partnerships that we have entered offer an expanded range of choices and increased convenience, and are also an excellent way of introducing more air travellers to Oman Air’s onboard products, hospitality and network. “We have no current plans to seek membership of one of the global airline alliances, but we will be developing some exciting tactical partnerships. As a result, we will be working closely with One World; with Star Alliance members Lufthansa, United Airlines, Turkish Airlines and with SkyTeam members Kenya Airways and KLM. “Furthermore, we remain committed to the partnerships we have successfully developed elsewhere within our business. These include our work with Cargolux, moving freight between Europe, East Africa, the Middle East and India; with freight handling specialists SATS; and with Menzies Aviation, for ground handling in Oman. In addition, Oman Air has signed agreements with service providers such as Sixt, Bank Muscat, Shangri La hotels and resorts, Rocketmiles, Al Nahdha Resort and Spa, and Muscat Duty Free, among various others that increase the mileage earnings of our FFP members. The accelerated fleet and network growth has required significant investment in new aircraft and landing slots, reported Gregorowitsch. However, further major investment has also been made in many other areas of Oman Air’s operations. Additional investments in a forthcoming new crew village at Muscat, crew reporting, flight simulators, headquarters infrastructure and management information systems are facilitating more efficient and effective delivery of Oman Air’s services, he added. Such investments have been made against a challenging economic background, warned Oman Air’s CEO. Year-on-year reductions in the levels of support offered to Oman Air by the government in 2014, 2015 and 2016 are set to continue and over-capacity within the air travel market is driving prices down, leading to a cut into potential yields. Fleet and network expansion has seen a parallel expansion in the number of staff employed internationally, resulting increases in payroll and on-costs. However, an important positive outcome is that the proportion of Omani citizens employed by Oman Air has continued to grow and now stands at 64 per cent, underlining the airline’s ongoing commitment to Omanisation. In conclusion, Gregorowitsch expressed his concern regarding the existing infrastructure at Muscat Airport which is affecting the growth initiatives of the National airline. He clearly identified the need to have a second runway available as soon as the new passenger terminal is inaugurated to cater for the planned growth and ongoing contribution to the national economy. The CEO’s remarks were followed by those of Al Busaidy. He provided details of Oman Air’s forthcoming Winter 2016/17 flight schedule, including anticipated new destinations, and offered an outline of what customers may expect of the Summer 2017 schedule. Al Busaidy commented: “Having launched many attractive and extremely popular destinations over recent months, we look forward to further expanding Oman Air’s network in the course of the Winter 2016/17 and Summer 2017 schedules. Perhaps the most notable of these will be Guangzhou, our first destination in China, the operations of which will start from December 9.   “The service will initially offer four flights per week on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday from Muscat to Guangzhou and on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from Guangzhou to Muscat. Oman Air will serve customers on the new route using award winning Airbus 330-200s, configured with 196 Economy Class seats and 30 Business Class seats. As a result of our new service, we anticipate welcoming many more visitors from China to Oman. In addition, Guangzhou offers access for air leisure travellers from Oman, and from throughout our international network, to a myriad of business and leisure opportunities within South China. “Furthermore, the new Muscat to Guangzhou route will strengthen the important political, economic and trade relations between Oman and China. We are confident that the service will be a great success and we look forward to a long and prosperous presence within the Chinese market. “A major highlight of our Summer 2017 schedule will be our daily flights to Manchester, complementing the double-daily service we currently offer to London. The new service will offer easy access for international visitors to the north of the UK, and many more British travellers will enjoy the convenience of connecting with Oman Air’s global network.” The strategic developments set out by Mr Gregorowitsch and Mr Al Busaidy were followed by a presentation on the subject of ‘Meeting customer expectations’, which was given by Abdulaziz Alraisi. Alraisi went on to detail major changes in cabin service and branding at Oman Air. These include the introduction of improved inflight entertainment systems, which offer an increased choice of recently-released Hollywood movies and a broader range of TV programmes. A new safety video which showcases the destination of Oman, together with its rich historical and cultural heritage will also be introduced. In addition, cabin crew will undergo enhanced training to ensure that all customers are offered the very best inflight service. Alraisi continued: “We are delighted to announce that Oman Air will unveil a brand-new First Class cabin aboard our Boeing B787-900 Dreamliner aircraft, which will be delivered in 2018. The new cabin will build on the powerful reputation that Oman Air has attracted for the luxury and exclusivity of our current First Class cabin. “Furthermore, Oman Air is set to become the launch customer for brand new Business Class seats, which will be fitted to our single aisle aircraft from 2018. “So, in fact, we do not aim to meet our customers’ expectations. Instead, we aim to exceed them. The products and services that we have introduced since 2014, and those we will be introducing in the near future represent exciting progress towards achieving the vision that our CEO  has described to you: To Become the Best.” - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Oman | Expansion | Plans | Air | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Turkish Airlines to fly thrice to Cuba, Venezuela AirBaltic lowers checked-in baggage charges UAE National Day celebrations at Al Maryah Island Ramada Downtown Dubai launches new anniversary promotion Premier Inn ME deploys Ideas solutions for revenue growth SR Technics opens training centre in Abu Dhabi Dutch chef wins Etihad's 'Taste The World' title Dubai Miracle Garden all set to 'bloom' this winter ME airlines to spend $345bn to boost capacity Emirates offers LinkedIn Learning courses on ice Sharjah’s Al Bait Hotel $27m revamp on track WTM London 2016 most successful edition in event history Etihad, Hong Kong Airlines expand codeshare New executive chef for Alila Jabal Akhdar Rotana launches second hotel in Amman Etihad, Airbus to develop A380 MRO services Boeing to consolidate defence and space sites Hala Arjaan by Rotana wins top accolade Premier Inn Dubai Ibn Battuta Mall gains popularity among visitors Oman Air celebrates national day with free upgrades DoubleTree Hilton Riyadh moves ahead with Saudisation plan Dubai 'committed to global aviation growth' Omran keen on developing sultanate's hospitality sector Fairmont Nile City, Cairo receives two top awards Conrad Makkah to implement eco-friendly measures Dubai voted world’s 'Best Airport for Layovers' SPG offers members new points earning opportunity Booming’ business travel industry key to ibtm china success Casa Mia appoints new restaurant manager Gulf Air increases Hyderabad flights Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Etihad Airways B787 Dreamliner to fly Abu Dhabi - Riyadh route 28 September, 2016 28 September 2016 RIYADH – Etihad Airways is to deploy a Boeing 787 Dreamliner on one of its twice-daily scheduled flights between Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, with effect from Oct. 30,. The upgrade from a single aisle Airbus A321 aircraft will cater to strong demand to and from the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, offering guests more seats on a wide-body aircraft. Together with the other daily Riyadh service operated by a Boeing 777, Etihad Airways will have more than 8,700 weekly seats on the route. Flight EY317 will be operated with a B787, departing Abu Dhabi at 10:15 hrs, arriving into Riyadh at 11:15 hrs. The return flight EY318 departs Riyadh at 16:25 hrs, arriving into Abu Dhabi at 19:10 hrs. The flights will provide optimal timings for guests in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, and convenient connections to and from destinations across key markets in Europe, Indian subcontinent, Asia and Australia. The 299-seat aircraft, configured in two classes, offers award-winning cabin interiors with 28 seats in Business and 271 in Economy. Advertisement Guests will be able to experience the airline’s renowned Business Studio on board. The seat, which provides guests with direct aisle access, is also equipped with an in-seat massage and air cushion control system. Business Class guests using the service can choose from three main courses, with further dine-on-demand options available. There are also specialized services onboard, including a Food & Beverage Manager in the premium cabin, multi-national cabin crew and Flying Nannies, who are able to provide support to parents travelling with young children. For B787 Economy Class passengers, the airline’s commitment to providing the best guest experiences is showcased by its ‘Smart Seats’. They have been designed to provide additional comfort through simple design features such as a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard Wi-Fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available. Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways Chief Strategy and Planning Officer, said: “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million guests since 2004. Etihad Airways’ flights to Riyadh, Jeddah, Madinah and Dammam are complemented by Saudi codeshare partner flynas, whose dedicated services between Abu Dhabi and both Riyadh and Jeddah provide travellers with even more choice. Riyadh becomes Etihad Airways’ newest B787 destination this year following the induction of the aircraft on flights to Perth, Dusseldorf and Shanghai, with Abu Dhabi – Johannesburg set to become a Dreamliner route on 1 November. Etihad Airways’ current fleet of nine B787s also operates to Singapore, Washington DC, Brisbane and Zurich. © The Saudi Gazette 2016 © Copyright Zawya. All Rights Reserved.

Conner, called, on Tuesday in Tangiers, on Boeing suppliers to take advantage of Morocco’s incentive program. “We have signed an agreement for the setting up of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco that will allow us to develop an incentive program to bring new Boeing suppliers to settle in the country,” said Conner in a statement to the press after the audience granted to him by HM King Mohammed VI at the Royal Palace in Tangiers. “We will work closely with the government, notably the ministry of Industry to encourage our suppliers to settle in Morocco and develop their aerospace industry, already present in the kingdom, and to benefit from the incentive program introduced by Morocco,” he added. This ecosystem will generate an additional annual turnover from export of one billion dollars and create 8,700 specialized jobs, said the president of Boeing “Commercial Airplanes”. The audience was attended by minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy, Moulay Hafid Elalamy. HM the King had earlier chaired the signing ceremony of a draft agreement for the establishment of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco. Join the Conversation. What do you think?

Boeing churns out P-8 sub hunters based on 737 Originally published September 27, 2016 at 6:09 pm Updated October 4, 2016 at 1:21 pm Boeing rolled out the Royal Australian Air Force’s first P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft Tuesday. The plane — a rare military-procurement program delivering on time and under budget — is already in service with both the U.S. Navy and the Indian Navy. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Boeing on Tuesday rolled out the first P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft — based on its 737 commercial jet — destined for the Royal Australian Air Force. On a tour of the plant at Boeing Field where mechanics install the plane’s military systems, Steve Tripp, who heads P-8 sales to foreign militaries, touted the efficiency of Boeing’s P-8 manufacturing operation. The program is going so smoothly that Boeing has been able to drop the base price of the aircraft by about 30 percent from about $170 million to $115 million. “It’s good to be a major defense acquisition program that delivers on time and under budget,” Tripp said.

The Australian jet, the first of 12 for that nation, is the 60th flying P-8 built. The U.S. Navy has already taken six flight-test P-8s and 45 production aircraft, and has deployed those on intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions in the western Pacific, the Mediterranean and North Atlantic. The Indian Navy took eight P-8s. Boeing also built two ground-test planes at the program’s outset. At the rollout ceremony, Vice Admiral Mike Shoemaker, commander of U.S. Naval Air Forces, said Boeing has been delivering a “tremendous quality” aircraft. Air Marshal Leo Davies, head of Australia’s Air Force, said the 220 Australians currently training on the P-8 in the U.S. are excited to finally get their hands on the P-8’s advanced technology. The P-8 bristles with antennae and fins used to detect radio or acoustic signals. Sonobuoys are deployed from tubular holes in the jet’s underbelly to listen for submarines. The wings are fitted with pylons to carry Harpoon missiles for striking surface ships. A bomb bay carries Mark 54 torpedoes. Inside the plane, operators sit at five computer work stations with touch screens, monitoring the data from sensors and weapons systems and networking with other aircraft and military assets. An unusual blister on the casing of the standard 737 CFM engine covers a powerful generator that runs all the mission systems on board. Built differently The jets are assembled and painted in Renton, then flown to Boeing Field and moved at night across East Marginal Way South to the old Thompson building — where in the 1960s the first few 737 airliners were built. Because the old building isn’t quite wide enough, the P-8’s raked wingtips are removed before it enters, then put back on when it emerges. A tour of the Thompson site Tuesday — no photos allowed due to military restrictions — indicated how Boeing has been able to achieve the cost efficiency that’s impressed the U.S. Navy. The old way Boeing manufactured a military derivative aircraft — say a 707-based Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) plane — was to build a basic commercial airframe, then deliver it to a special completion center where holes would be cut out of it for weapons and structural parts beefed up as needed for the mission load. For the P-8, Boeing introduced “in-line production,” meaning that all those structural changes to the airframe are incorporated as it is built, not afterward. So for example, the aluminum skin of a P-8 is almost twice as thick as a regular 737 because the airframe has to withstand much more stressful maneuvers. So from the beginning of production, a different gauge of metal is used. “From the day this was a roll of aluminum, it was always going to be a P-8, not a 737,” Tripp said. Likewise the fuselage and wings have many more stiffening stringers and frames, meaning many more rivets. The holes in the fuselage for regular passenger windows are absent. But one big picture window on each side of the fuselage accommodates a spotter looking for surface vessels. The large bomb bay is cut out of the belly. That’s the way the fuselage is built by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita, Kan. “We don’t build it, unbuild it and rebuild it,” said Tripp. “We build it from day one with this end state in mind.” As a result, the Thompson building is very quiet. Instead of riveting or metal work, the mechanics are installing, plugging in and testing the systems. Between 1,000 and 1,300 defense-side employees work on the P-8 program in Seattle, with hundreds more staffing the P-8 assembly line in Renton. They are producing 12 of the jets per year now, and moving to 18 per year. The U.K. ordered nine P-8s at the Farnborough Air Show near London in July. Boeing expects more foreign sales.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out travel Search Destinations Themes News Travel Troubles Cruising Snow Kiwi Traveller An airline pilot reveals why the Boeing 757 is truly a unique aircraft BENJAMIN ZHANG Last updated 13:29, September 28 2016 Supplied The Boeing 757s are known for their versatility, speed and reliability. Twelve years after Boeing discontinued the 757, the long-time 'tweener" in the company's lineup is still popular among airlines. The Royal New Zealand Air Force has two of the aircraft, used as VIP transport and government services since 2003. Even though the US planemaker booked more than 1000 orders for the jets over its two decades in production, it was never a hot seller. NEWSFLARE Shocking footage of a man and his quad bike flying backwards and rolling into the sea after he parked it behind a Boeing 757 about to take off. By the early 2000's, sales of the 757 had all but dried up, and Boeing put the plane out to pasture in 2004.

Although many of the planes are pushing 25 years of service, airlines are hanging onto their 757s. For instance, Delta, who has spent big bucks on a fleet of new jets, recently refurbished the cabins of its ageing 757s instead of replacing them with newer planes. So why are its customers so loyal? Is the 757 that good? To get some answers, we recently spoke with author and Boeing 757 pilot Patrick Smith about the plane. "There's no denying the 757 is an old plane that was designed in the late 1970s, but the versatility of the plane is remarkable and unmatched," Smith, the author of the book Cockpit Confidential, said. DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX NZ The same RNZAF Boeing 757 was used to ferry the Duke and Dutchess of Cambridge on their tour of NZ. "It's profitable on both short-haul domestic as well as trans-Atlantic routes." Ad Feedback During it's production life, the 757 was always a bit of an oddity — a 'tweener of sorts. It's larger and offers greater range than the average narrow body jet, but smaller and cheaper to operate than a wide-body. Boeing and its customers, for many years, didn't quite know how to take full advantage of the plane's capabilities. However, when they did figure it out, it became an integral part of the operators' fleets. Boeing is currently marketing a new stretched variant of its long-serving 737 — called the MAX 9 — as a potential replacement for the 757. Now, there's talk that Boeing may make the 737 even larger to get closer to the 757's capacity. HAMAD I MOHAMMED A DHL International Boeing 757-225 freighter. "Boeing is trying to push the 737 as a viable 757 replacement," Smith said, "In some respects it can and in some respects it can't." For instance, the 737 simply isn't capable of the same kind of engine performance as the 757. According to Smith, the 737 falls way short of the 757 in terms of runway performance. The 737 requires a much higher takeoff speed and much more runway to get off the ground. Sign up for the Two Minutes of Stuff newsletter "The 757 can be off the ground in 4,000 ft. and under 140 knots," he told us. However, Smith recounts being in the cockpit jump seat of a 737 as two other pilots were flying. During takeoff, the author noticed that the plane didn't lift off until 160 knots and used up much more runway. Furthermore, the 757 can comfortably climb straight to its cruising altitude. On the other hand, the 737 requires a step climb procedure that calls for the plane to climb to a certain altitude and burn off some fuel to lighten the load before climbing to a higher altitude. Runway performance matters. Especially when it comes to the type of flying the 757 and the 737 are asked to perform — trans-continental or oceanic flights with a full payload from smaller secondary airports. "The 737 falls short when you're trying fly it longer haul, coast to coast. It can do it, but not by much," Smith said. In addition, when it comes to flying across the Atlantic, "there's concern in the winter, when there are ferocious head winds, the 737 may need to stop for fuel." The reality is that Smith believes the Boeing 737 is a good plane, but is being asked to take on a mission the design wasn't meant to perform. "The Boeing 737 was essentially conceived as a small regional jet nearly five decades ago," Smith told us. "It's an extremely popular plane, but it's being asked to perform missions it wasn't designed for." As a result, Boeing is simply not in a position to bolt bigger engines onto the 737. Since its introduction in the 1960s, Boeing has been installing larger and larger engines on the 737 as the size of the plane grew. Unfortunately, the amount of room underneath the wing hasn't changed. Thus, Boeing has all but maxed out on the size of the engines it can mount on the 737 without completely redesigning the plane's under carriage. Instead of a stretched 737, Smith believes Boeing should have gone for an updated version of the 757 at some point during its production run. "Somewhere along the way, had Being just re-engined the 757 with a new cockpit and new internal systems, it could have been a big hit," Smith told us. In a statement to Business Insider, a Boeing spokesperson wrote: "The 737 MAX will extend the Next-Generation 737 range advantage with the capability to fly more than 3,500 nautical miles. That's an increase of 340-570 nmi over the 737NG which gives our customers the flexibility to open up new markets." With that said, the 757 isn't a perfect plane. "It's a 6-across (seating) narrow body that's long and thin," Smith said. "And for passengers, it can take a long time to board and disembark." In addition, the 757's cockpit is pretty old-fashioned when compared to modern airliners such as the 737 MAX. The controls of the 757 are also much heavier for pilots than its sibling — the Boeing 767. The 757 and 767 were developed at the same time and feature virtually identical cockpits. Finally, the Boeing 757 generates a massive amount of wake turbulence as it flies — forcing air traffic controllers to keep other planes far away from passing 757s.  "No one really knows why, but the 757 has really strong wake turbulence," Smith told us. "The early 757s had worse wake turbulence than the 747." Although Smith added that the addition of winglets on later 757s have greatly decreased the wake turbulence. The Boeing 757 is an aircraft that's come and gone. It served its tour of duty with honour and distinction. Now, it's time for Boeing to find a replacement worthy of stepping into its shoes.

Airlines around the world use Boeing for its dependability and first-class style. From the cheapest of flights to luxury liners, Boeing has proven itself to be a world class manufacturer for anything regarding air travel. They’re also famous for developing unique aircrafts that cater to the vibes of their customers. During the Star Wars hype of last year, for example, Boeing developed a set of limited edition jets modeled on droids from the famous intergalactic saga. The planes copied features of the droids BB-8 and R2-D2 on the exterior, and the on-board experience was even better with Star Wars paraphernalia and movies playing in each cabin. Once again, Boeing has listened to the requests of their customers and has responded with a potentially improved in-flight experience. According to a patent filing published last week, Boeing wants to offer projections of clouds and stars on cabin walls and ceilings for their customers’ viewing pleasure. If granted, the patent will allow the airline company to be the only jet that can project images onto a jet’s interior surfaces. They plan to feature images of a beautiful blue skies with fluffy clouds floating around during the day. At night, they’ll project stars and constellations. The projection will move lazily along as if the images were being viewed in real time. “Projection lighting is simply one of many technologies we are exploring to see if it can bring advances in both airline economics and passenger experience,” a Boeing spokesman said in the filing. “In theory, airlines could use lighting enhancements on the walls and bulkheads to display information about destinations or to project scenes that get passengers thinking about where they’re going.” This is all part of a movement in airlines all over the world to make the user experience better for everyone. Most notably, airlines have been working on improving their mood lighting. Through numerous tests and surveys it was discovered that the harsh fluorescents of a typical aircraft make the user experience far more unpleasant. It leads to disgruntled customers and poorer ratings. As a direct result of these findings, Boeing has been looking for ways to increase the mood lighting in their aircrafts without driving up the cost of production. When jets cost less to produce, it’s much cheaper for people to fly, helping to keep the airline service an accessible and affordable commodity. Boeing believes that their projection system will help to achieve the lower production costs. Though the initial startup installation will be higher than a traditional lighting system, it will be incredibly easy and affordable to run and maintain. Additionally, it will be much cheaper than installing a customized lighting feature within each seat. The ratings will go up for Boeing’s aircrafts without hiking their bottom line. If Boeing’s patent is successful and other aircraft manufacturers don’t find loopholes in the patent, the manufacturer could be one of the most coveted producers in the industry. As they cut costs while improving the customer experience, they’ll be able to maintain incredibly low fares and produce more competitive pricing in the industry.

Boeing says it will support a Moroccan plan to build up its aerospace manufacturing sector, encouraging suppliers to set up or expand here. With a high-quality but cheap workforce, Morocco's aerospace sector has developed rapidly over the past decade. King Mohammed VI oversaw the signing Tuesday in Tangiers. Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Raymond Conner says, "We and our suppliers must reduce costs and improve quality in order to win in the marketplace." Moroccan Industry Minister Hafid El Alamy says Morocco hopes to bring 120 Boeing suppliers here. Jobs and the economy will be a key issue in upcoming Moroccan legislative elections.

The upgrade from a single aisle Airbus A321 aircraft will cater to strong demand to and from the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, offering guests more seats on a wide-body aircraft. Together with the other daily Riyadh service operated by a Boeing 777, Etihad Airways will have more than 8,700 weekly seats on the route. Flight EY317 will be operated with a B787, departing Abu Dhabi at 10:15 hrs, arriving into Riyadh at 11:15 hrs. The return flight EY318 departs Riyadh at 16:25 hrs, arriving into Abu Dhabi at 19:10 hrs. The flights will provide optimal timings for guests in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, and convenient connections to and from destinations across key markets in Europe, Indian subcontinent, Asia and Australia. The 299-seat aircraft, configured in two classes, offers award-winning cabin interiors with 28 seats in Business and 271 in Economy. Guests will be able to experience the airline’s renowned Business Studio on board. The seat, which provides guests with direct aisle access, is also equipped with an in-seat massage and air cushion control system. Business Class guests using the service can choose from three main courses, with further dine-on-demand options available. There are also specialized services onboard, including a Food & Beverage Manager in the premium cabin, multi-national cabin crew and Flying Nannies, who are able to provide support to parents travelling with young children. For B787 Economy Class passengers, the airline’s commitment to providing the best guest experiences is showcased by its ‘Smart Seats’. They have been designed to provide additional comfort through simple design features such as a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard Wi-Fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available. Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways Chief Strategy and Planning Officer, said: “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million guests since 2004. Etihad Airways’ flights to Riyadh, Jeddah, Madinah and Dammam are complemented by Saudi codeshare partner flynas, whose dedicated services between Abu Dhabi and both Riyadh and Jeddah provide travellers with even more choice. Riyadh becomes Etihad Airways’ newest B787 destination this year following the induction of the aircraft on flights to Perth, Dusseldorf and Shanghai, with Abu Dhabi – Johannesburg set to become a Dreamliner route on 1 November. Etihad Airways’ current fleet of nine B787s also operates to Singapore, Washington DC, Brisbane and Zurich. — SG TAGS Etihad Airways B787 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleExcuse me Next articleAleppo hospitals overwhelmed by wounded Sadiq Hussain NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,486,011FansLike 41,110FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Deterrent for non-recurrence Nov 18, 2016 Sexual harassment Nov 18, 2016 Women in Riyadh feel more at ease without niqab Nov 18, 2016 American couple ruin stereotypes about Saudis Nov 18, 2016 Saudi Arabia set to reinforce its climate change commitments Nov 18, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

The Memorandum of Understanding outlining the project, signed by Morocco's Minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and the Digital Economy Moulay Hafid Elalamy and Boeing Vice Chairman Raymond L. Conner, comes just days before Boeing is set to host the third annual US-Morocco Trade & Investment Forum in Seattle on October 3. The conference brings US business leaders together with Moroccan officials to learn about investment opportunities in the Kingdom. "The Moroccan aeronautics industry has seen, thanks to [the vision of King Mohammed VI], huge growth these last few years. The sector has multiplied by six in 10 years and today boasts 121 companies," said Mr. Elalamy at the signing ceremony, which was chaired by King Mohammed VI in Tangier. "Through our business in Casablanca, we have already seen with our own eyes the unique opportunities offered by Morocco to aeronautics subcontractors in terms of cost effectiveness, all while producing quality products," said Mr. Conner at the event. Boeing has had a presence in Morocco since at least 2001, when the company became a co-founder of Morocco Aero-Technical Interconnect Systems (MATIS) Aerospace, which produces parts and engines for Boeing jets and employs 850 people in Casablanca. Boeing is also the preferred manufacturer for Moroccan national airline Royal Air Maroc, which earlier this month launched thrice-weekly non-stop flights between Washington Dulles International Airport and Casablanca on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The new aerospace ecosystem will further cement Boeing's presence in Morocco by bringing suppliers to the country, building factories, and streamlining the manufacturing platform. Boeing has also agreed to train the local workforce to meet demands for skilled labor. In a call on aerospace opportunities in Morocco organized on Monday by the State Department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, US Ambassador to Morocco Dwight L. Bush said, "With a strategic geographic location and historic ties at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, and its pursuit of integrated supply-chains and entrepreneurial opportunities, Morocco has developed into an important regional player in supplying the aircraft industry for Europe, the Americas, and around the world." Walter Siouffi, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Morocco, noted on the call, "I think what's impressing us the most about Morocco is the forward planning and thinking that the government has been embarking on as far back as the early part of 2000. And part of that thinking was that Morocco, given its proximity to Europe, after analyzing the competitive advantages it has in terms of logistics, distance, free trade agreements, labor, etc, figured out really early on that it could be an important part of the supply chain to companies in the aerospace [and other] sectors." In recent years, Morocco has successfully positioned itself as a gateway for US companies to African and European markets, and through aggressive economic reforms has become a top destination for foreign direct investment in Africa. Earlier this year, the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index named Morocco among the 50 most innovative economies in the world, and one of just two such in Africa. The results echoed the findings of many industry reports of recent years. KPMG International and Oxford Economics' 2015 Change Readiness Index (CRI) ranked Morocco as the most "change-ready" country in the Maghreb, with particularly positive results in the category of "enterprise capability." The World Bank's Doing Business 2016 ranked Morocco first out of 20 MENA countries for "ease of starting a business" and placed it sixth overall in the region for "ease of doing business." The Moroccan American Center for Policy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. This material is distributed by the Moroccan American Center for Policy on behalf of the Government of Morocco. Additional information is available at the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.

King Mohammed VI oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding in the northern port city of Tangiers to establish an industrial zone where up to 120 Boeing suppliers and sub-contractors could operate. "This is a very important strategic project as we move into a new aeronautical era in Morocco," Industry Minister Moulay Hafi Elalamy told AFP. Morocco's Industry Minister Moulay Hafi Elalamy said the Boeing industrial zone could create up to 8,700 jobs ©Paul J. Richards (AFP/File) Morocco has unveiled several large-scale industrial projects in recent years, with the Tangiers region among the fastest growing. French carmaker Renault in April signed deals to invest more than $1 billion (900 million euros) and create 50,000 jobs in the North African country. Morocco was badly affected by the financial crisis in Europe, its top trade partner, and has struggled to contain a ballooning public deficit. The authorities have strenuously promoted the country as a bridge between Africa and the West, in a bid to encourage foreign investment and trade. "The Moroccan aeronautical industry has seen important growth in recent years," said Elalamy. "The sector has grown six-fold in just 10 years and there are now 121 firms." Some of the largest manufacturers are already present in the country, contributing to a sector that employs about 10,000 people and has a turnover of $1 billion per year. Elalamy said the Boeing industrial zone could create up to 8,700 jobs. Morocco's gateway linking Europe, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Tangiers has experienced unprecedented development in recent years, including a new airport and deep-water port.

King Mohammed VI oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding in the northern port city of Tangiers to establish an industrial zone where up to 120 Boeing suppliers and sub-contractors could operate. "This is a very important strategic project as we move into a new aeronautical era in Morocco," Industry Minister Moulay Hafi Elalamy told AFP. Morocco has unveiled several large-scale industrial projects in recent years, with the Tangiers region among the fastest growing. French carmaker Renault in April signed deals to invest more than $1 billion (900 million euros) and create 50,000 jobs in the North African country. Morocco was badly affected by the financial crisis in Europe, its top trade partner, and has struggled to contain a ballooning public deficit. The authorities have strenuously promoted the country as a bridge between Africa and the West, in a bid to encourage foreign investment and trade. "The Moroccan aeronautical industry has seen important growth in recent years," said Elalamy. "The sector has grown six-fold in just 10 years and there are now 121 firms." Some of the largest manufacturers are already present in the country, contributing to a sector that employs about 10,000 people and has a turnover of $1 billion per year. Elalamy said the Boeing industrial zone could create up to 8,700 jobs. Morocco's gateway linking Europe, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Tangiers has experienced unprecedented development in recent years, including a new airport and deep-water port.

King Mohammed VI Chairs Signing Ceremony to Establish Boeing Industrial Ecosystem in Morocco By Morocco World News - September 27, 2016 , 2:18 pm Tangiers – The Setting up of a Boeing ecosystem, a new sign of confidence for Morocco at the international level. King Mohammed VI, chaired, on Tuesday at the Royal Palace in Tangiers, the signing ceremony of a draft agreement for the establishment of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco, a structuring project that will allow the Moroccan aviation industry to improve its position significantly at the international level. This major project, which is a partnership between Morocco and Boeing, the world leader in aerospace technology, will give structure to an ecosystem composed of suppliers and organize a sourcing platform based in Morocco. This ecosystem will generate an additional annual turnover from exports of one billion dollars, allow the setting up of 120 Boeing suppliers and create 8,700 new specialized jobs. To cover the training needs of its ecosystem, dedicated training programs specially designed by Boeing will be implemented. At the beginning of the ceremony, a documentary movie was screened highlighting development witnessed by the aviation sector, one of Morocco’s global businesses, in recent years, as part of the Industrial Acceleration Plan, launched on April 2, 2014. On this occasion, minister of Industry, Trade, Investment and Digital Economy, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, gave a speech before the Sovereign, in which he presented the main outlines of this project, which is a strong signal to the industrial world, confirming to operators the real capabilities of Morocco, especially in the most complex and high value-added sectors. “The Moroccan aviation industry has witnessed, under Your enlightened vision, significant growth in recent years. The sector was multiplied by 6 in 10 years and has now 121 actors,” said Elalamy, noting that the Kingdom, which is ranked 15th in terms of investments in the aviation sector, was able to be among the few countries operating in this area. Recalling the fact that a “locomotive” ecosystem reinforces the efficiency and attractiveness of the sector, while creating a virtuous circle of prosperity within the national economy, Elalamy said that Boeing industrial ecosystem will be a “real boost” to the aviation sector, like Renault and PSA ecosystems to the automotive industry. President of Boeing “Commercial Airplanes” has, for his part, lauded the strategic vision of HM the King which enabled Morocco to invest in the high-tech aerospace industry. “Boeing is proud of the trusting relationship we had with Morocco and its aviation industry for nearly 50 years”, he said, adding that the “Kingdom offers unique opportunities that will benefit Boeing and our extended supply chain.” “We are signing a significant agreement to enable more foreign investment and development of the aerospace industry here,” he noted, underlining that “we have collaborated with the government to develop an integrated industrial program of incentives to bring more Boeing suppliers to Morocco. Boeing will also be an advisor to the government’s plan for a new vocational and educational training institute. This will provide a pipeline of skilled workers for the aerospace jobs of tomorrow, he affirmed. Afterwards, the King chaired the signing ceremony of a draft agreement between the State of Morocco and aircraft manufacturer “Boeing” concerning the setting up of an ecosystem for aircraft parts manufacturing. The draft agreement was inked by Moulay Hafid Elalamy and Raymond L. Conner. The King, then, decorated Raymond L. Conner. with the Alawite Wissam of Exceptional Rank (Grand Sash).   Join the Conversation. What do you think?

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Sep 27, 2016 at 11:35AM While the stock market has surged to record highs in 2016, shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) have been held down by widespread worries about slowing aircraft demand. Indeed, with the end of September quickly approaching, Boeing is less than halfway to its full-year goal for aircraft orders. Boeing vs. S&P 500 2016 Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Order activity for the 777 widebody family has been particularly disappointing this year. Moreover, the backlog for this cash cow is disappearing quickly, which makes the task of finding new orders especially pressing. Fortunately, Boeing moved closer to finalizing two important 777 orders last week. 777 sales in focus Over the next several years, Boeing will transition from the 777 to the next-generation 777X. However, the 777X won't arrive until 2020, and production of that new model won't fully ramp up until a couple of years later. Boeing must sell enough 777s to bridge the gap until 777X production reaches full speed. However, the fact that the current-generation 777 is about to be supplanted by a new model makes that quite challenging. In January, Boeing announced plans to cut 777 production from 8.3 per month to seven per month at the beginning of 2017 to cope with the resulting order slowdown. Boeing is having trouble keeping its 777 factory busy. Image source: Boeing. To continue at that rate through the model transition, Boeing has said that it needs to garner 40-50 777 orders per year for the next few years. Increasingly, many analysts think that Boeing will have to slash 777 production even further. The reason? Boeing has logged just eight net orders for the 777 so far in 2016. Thus, Boeing desperately needs to finalize more orders in the next few months. New order from Saudi Arabia Last Friday, Saudi Arabian Airlines -- also known as Saudia -- announced plans to acquire 63 new aircraft: 28 widebodies from Boeing and 35 narrowbodies from Airbus. The Boeing order includes 15 777-300ERs, as well as 13 787 Dreamliners. Saudia already operates more than four dozen 777s, including 24 777-300ERs. The new planes for this important Boeing customer will most likely be used for a combination of growth plus replacement of aging 747 jumbo jets. Boeing hasn't officially announced the Saudia deal yet. However, it doesn't face any major obstacles to wrapping up this vital order. Some progress on Iran? Two days before the Saudia order announcement, Boeing got some good news about its pending order from Iran Air, as the U.S. Treasury Department approved export licenses for 80 Boeing planes. This gets Boeing one step closer to finalizing a tentative deal that includes 15 777-300ERs. However, the Iran aircraft sale is far from being a done deal. The U.S. rapprochement with Iran that would enable Boeing to do business with Iranian companies has been viciously opposed by nearly all of the Republican Party. If Hillary Clinton wins the upcoming presidential election, there is a good chance that Boeing will be able to finalize the Iran Air order later this year. (That said, lining up financing remains a significant obstacle.) On the other hand, if Donald Trump wins, his administration would likely slap tougher sanctions on Iran and force Boeing to drop the deal. Boeing needs these deals On paper, Boeing looks like it is miles away from meeting its 2016 order target for the 777. But if it can finalize the Saudia and Iran Air orders before year-end, it will have brought in 38 net orders for the current-generation 777: close to the goal of 40-50 net orders. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg has hinted that if the company can't close more 777 sales by the end of the year, it will have to make deeper production cuts (i.e., below the planned seven-per-month rate). That would represent a significant drag on earnings and cash flow. Boeing's chances of avoiding -- or at least delaying -- these potential production cuts look a lot better than they did a week ago. Moreover, Boeing still has three months left in the year to pursue additional 777 sales and (hopefully) solidify its production plans. Adam Levine-Weinberg owns shares of Boeing.

This workhorse of commercial aviation accounts for one of every three commercial flights, and there are around 2,000 of them in the air at any given time. Every one of those planes rolled out of Boeing’s Renton Production Facility, where workers build a 737 in just nine days. The factory, near Seattle, pump them out at the rate of 42 per month, and Boeing claims the 1.1-million-square-foot facility is most efficient airplane factory in the world. Boeing faces fierce competition from arch rival Airbus. The 737 is the best-selling jet ever, with more than 9,000 delivered since its introduction in 1967, but the Airbus A320 is no slouch. The company has delivered about 6,700 of them since the airliner entered service in 1984.

Information Agency Main Page Politics Economy War Kyiv Society World Pictures Videos Opinions Publications For subscribers Services Press Room Monitoring Image bank Products Advertising Archive Feedback Contact OpinionNew frontier of Russian lies Author: Roman Tsymbaliuk Politics 15:30, 27 September 2016 The tragedy the world witnessed July 17, 2014, has changed dramatically the nature of Russian aggression in Ukraine. On this day, a Malaysian Boeing was downed from the sky over Donbas. Nearly 300 people were killed in that horrific crash. Before that day, many European powers chose not to really notice what was going on in the east of Ukraine in favor of their economic ties with Moscow. But the death of EU citizens on board that plane forced many European governments to change their approach to the situation. Politicians were just forced to open his eyes. Sanctions were imposed against Russia (and they are still enforced to this day) and almost the entire civilized world started helping Ukraine. Many people, especially in Russia, are trying to erase from memory the events in Donbas back in those hot days. At the time, the Kremlin, after an almost bloodless occupation of Crimea, was obsessed with the destruction of the Ukrainian state, toying with the idea of a mythical "Novorossiya". To implement this idea, thousands of soldiers and officers "voluntarily" left for “vacations” but still drove their officially assigned armored vehicles to seize the Ukrainian land. That is how the Kremlin explained hundreds of freshly-dug  graves in different parts of their vast country. Ukraine was returning Russian "volunteers" home. In various shapes. However, officially abandoning the version of Ukrainian stealth aircraft, the Russian Ministry of Defense provided yet another piece of "irrefutable evidence" of the attack of the Ukrainian military against MH17 Back in the day, there were almost daily reports of Ukraine’s losses – downed warplanes and helicopters, which used to halt the advance of Russia’s “strayed” Russian convoys of military equipment. Two years ago, Putin explained that military equipment to be used in such a conflict is "always somewhere around", while anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as the Russian uniform, can obviously be purchased "in any military outlet". It is no surprise that on July 17, 2014, Russia's state news agencies, like TASS, referring to militants who occupied parts of Donbas, proudly reported the downing of yet another Ukrainian An-26. When it turned out that it’s a passenger jet that had been hit, Russian propaganda started producing at warp speed different versions of the incident and developing conspiracy theories. Brainwash masterminds came up with the Spanish ground control officer “Carlos”, who allegedly navigated MH17 from the tower and personally “saw” (in binoculars?) two fighter jets approaching with Ukrainian tridents on their wings. A similar vision - in the form of two vulture-jets allegedly attacking a civilian plane – stood in the eyes many militants and other "eye-witnesses" who elaborated to the Russian media on what they had personally seen (!) happening at some 10k altitude. There was also a "secret witness", whose testimony had to drop all charges against Russia, shifting the blame on the Ukrainian hero – an actual combat pilot Vladyslav Voloshin. But when it turned out that the Su-25, at which the Kremlin pointed fingers, was simply unable to hit targets at such altitudes due to its technical characteristics, the Russian "analysts" thought of nothing better reclassifying  the “killer jet” to a Su-27. On July 21, 2014, Head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff General Kartapalov was speaking confidently at a presentation held at the Daily operations control center of Russia’s Aerospace Forces Russia on the causes of the MH17 tragedy. The slides showed the alleged movement Ukrainian Buk-M1 air defense systems. Then it was also stated that the Russian air monitoring means spotted a Su-25 belonging to the Ukrainian Air Force just 5 km from the Boeing. "Why was the warplane flying on air path designed for civil aviation almost simultaneously and at the same altitude with a passenger aircraft? I would like to hear an answer to this question," the Russian general said, with apparent concern in his voice. More than two years after that event, the answer was voiced in the same briefing room. It turned out that there had been no Captain Voloshin, piloting his Su-25 in dangerous proximity to the Boeing. Just as there has been no Su-27. On the eve of the release of the results of an official Dutch investigation, scheduled for September 28, the "Empire" has decided to go for a pre-emptive strike, unexpectedly releasing details of their radars and reporting that there had been no airborne side objects near the Malaysian aircraft before its disintegration. More than two years after that event, the answer was voiced in the same briefing room. It turned out that there had been no Captain Voloshin, piloting his Su-25 in dangerous proximity to the Boeing. Just as there has been no Su-27 However, having officially abandoned the version of the Ukrainian stealth aircraft, the Russian Ministry of Defense provided yet another piece of "irrefutable evidence" of the attack of the Ukrainian military against MH17. Now the only version of a Buk missile launch is in the works, in order to be closer to the results of the Dutch investigation. It turns out that the Russian radars saw the entire air situation, to the last detail, but only in the occupied part of Donbas. And especially, in the area of the village of Snizhne, where, the Buk missile launch site was located, according to an international investigation. Head of the Russia’s radio technical troops of the Aerospace Forces of Russia General Koban said that had the missile been fired from the areas of Donetsk region beyond the Ukrainian government control, Russian radars would have recorded such fact. Apparently, that’s the very radar that “saw” the Ukrainian Su-25 two years ago... To be more convincing, the General even told how the "eyes" of the Russian army monitor a much smaller object loitering along the Russian-Ukrainian border – a Russian drone Orlan-10. He claimed that if such a small object was identified, the Russians would have never missed a missile launch from the bordering part of the seized Donbas. But there’s another thing regarding these Orlan UAVs. As soon as the Ukrainian military manage to shoot them down, this hi-tech miracle of the Russian aeronautic industry automatically "goes on vacation" (just like the Russian troops going into Ukraine since 2014), while Russian "partners" once again pretend that the UAV is not theirs, and they have nothing to do with it. Thus, the Russian Ministry of Defense, or rather, the Ministry of Misinformation has reached another frontier of lies. As soon as the evidence has been collected of the insolvency of their earlier tales of Ukrainian aircraft, they jump over to the version of a Ukrainian Buk. Thus, the Russian Ministry of Defense, or rather, the Ministry of Misinformation has reached another frontier of lies Later, when the investigators call by name the whole crew of the Russian Buk, strayed in Donbas, the Russian Defense Ministry will come up with some new excuse. And it looks like it will continue indefinitely. Or until what is happening in eastern Ukraine is also called by its proper name. Until the wandering of the Russian troops in the Ukrainian lands is officially recognized as invasion.

The upgrade from a single aisle Airbus A321 aircraft will cater to strong demand to and from the capital of Saudi Arabia, offering guests more seats on a wide-body aircraft. Together with the other daily Riyadh service operated by a Boeing 777, Etihad Airways will have more than 8,700 weekly seats on the route. Flight EY317 will be operated with a B787, departing Abu Dhabi at 10:15 hrs, arriving into Riyadh at 11:15 hrs. The return flight EY318 departs Riyadh at 16:25 hrs, arriving into Abu Dhabi at 19:10 hrs. The flights will provide optimal timings for guests in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, and convenient connections to and from destinations across key markets in Europe, Indian subcontinent, Asia and Australia. The 299-seat aircraft, configured in two classes, offers award-winning cabin interiors with 28 seats in Business and 271 in Economy. Guests will be able to experience the airline’s renowned Business Studio on board. The seat, which provides guests with direct aisle access, is also equipped with an in-seat massage and air cushion control system. Business Class guests using the service can choose from three main courses, with further dine-on-demand options available. There are also specialised services onboard, including a Food & Beverage Manager in the premium cabin, multi-national cabin crew and Flying Nannies, who are able to provide support to parents travelling with young children. For B787 Economy Class passengers, the airline’s commitment to providing the best guest experiences is showcased by its ‘Smart Seats’. They have been designed to provide additional comfort through simple design features such as a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard wi-fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available. Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways chief strategy and planning officer, said: “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million guests since 2004. Etihad Airways’ flights to Riyadh, Jeddah, Madinah and Dammam are complemented by Saudi codeshare partner flynas, whose dedicated services between Abu Dhabi and both Riyadh and Jeddah provide travellers with even more choice. Riyadh becomes Etihad Airways’ newest B787 destination this year following the induction of the aircraft on flights to Perth, Dusseldorf and Shanghai, with Abu Dhabi – Johannesburg set to become a Dreamliner route on 1 November. Etihad Airways’ current fleet of nine B787s also operates to Singapore, Washington DC, Brisbane and Zurich. - TradeArabia News Service   Tags: Etihad | Saudi | Dreamliner | Riyadh | Arabia | B787 | Abu | Dhabi | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Turkish Airlines to fly thrice to Cuba, Venezuela AirBaltic lowers checked-in baggage charges UAE National Day celebrations at Al Maryah Island Ramada Downtown Dubai launches new anniversary promotion Premier Inn ME deploys Ideas solutions for revenue growth SR Technics opens training centre in Abu Dhabi Dutch chef wins Etihad's 'Taste The World' title Dubai Miracle Garden all set to 'bloom' this winter ME airlines to spend $345bn to boost capacity Emirates offers LinkedIn Learning courses on ice Sharjah’s Al Bait Hotel $27m revamp on track WTM London 2016 most successful edition in event history Etihad, Hong Kong Airlines expand codeshare New executive chef for Alila Jabal Akhdar Rotana launches second hotel in Amman Etihad, Airbus to develop A380 MRO services Boeing to consolidate defence and space sites Hala Arjaan by Rotana wins top accolade Premier Inn Dubai Ibn Battuta Mall gains popularity among visitors Oman Air celebrates national day with free upgrades DoubleTree Hilton Riyadh moves ahead with Saudisation plan Dubai 'committed to global aviation growth' Omran keen on developing sultanate's hospitality sector Fairmont Nile City, Cairo receives two top awards Conrad Makkah to implement eco-friendly measures Dubai voted world’s 'Best Airport for Layovers' SPG offers members new points earning opportunity Booming’ business travel industry key to ibtm china success Casa Mia appoints new restaurant manager Gulf Air increases Hyderabad flights Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

Canada is in talks with jet makers including Boeing as it looks to upgrade its fleet of fighter jets. Dibyangshu Sarkar / AFP Boeing targets Super Hornet fighter jet sale to Canada Reuters September 27, 2016 Updated: September 27, 2016 11:31 AM Related Lockheed wins $6bn F-35 fighter jet deal – and it is not happy ‘All’s well that ends well’ as Canada and EU finally sign trade agreement Lockheed targets higher profits amid soaring helicopter sales Airbus fury as Poland scraps helicopters deal and gives Lockheed $3.5bn order instead GCC gains from French high-tech diving experience Topics: Canada Airbus Boeing Canada is assessing data from bidders to replace its ageing fleet of fighter jets, a Boeing executive says. The country’s Liberal government promised during last year’s election that it would launch an open competition to replace Canada’s CF-18 fighter aircraft. It pledged not to buy Lockheed Martin’s F-35 jets, as the previous Conservative government had planned to do, calling them expensive and unnecessary. While the government has yet to release details on such a competition, it requested data this summer from five companies that have fighter aircraft in production or planned production, including Lockheed and Boeing, which wants Canada to buy its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. The government sought up-to-date information on areas including capabilities and economic benefits. "The focus on data was very clear, very strong," said Marc Allen, the president of Boeing International, the unit which handles Boeing’s strategy and operations outside the United States. "It gave all of the suppliers a chance to set down in black and white what it is their platform does." Since then, Boeing has been engaged in a "ping-pong" set of questions and answers with the government, said Mr Allen. The defence minister Harjit Sajjan has said the government foresees a growing capability gap in the 2020s and that there is an urgent need to replace the CF-18s. "They know it’s imperative to solve that capability gap," said Mr Allen. "They are moving in a way that says they understand that." Mr Allen said ordinarily it can take multiple years from when an order is placed to when jets are delivered. The other potential fighter jet suppliers are Saab, Dassault Aviation, and the Eurofighter consortium , which includes Airbus. As Boeing campaigns to win the contract, it is citing the work opportunities that would be available to Canadian firms across the country if the federal government were to purchase the Super Hornet. Mr Allen did not rule out giving work to the struggling plane maker Bombardier, noting that Boeing always works with its competitors. "We’re not going to rule out anybody from the perspective of who would be a good partner," he said. Boeing earlier this month formally challenged a decision by the Danish government to pick the F-35 fighter jet over the Super Hornet, citing a flawed evaluation process. Mr Allen said that was a very particular circumstance and that Canada’s process was calibrated to ensure an accurate analysis. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Lockheed wins $6bn F-35 fighter jet deal – and it is not happy ‘All’s well that ends well’ as Canada and EU finally sign trade agreement Lockheed targets higher profits amid soaring helicopter sales Airbus fury as Poland scraps helicopters deal and gives Lockheed $3.5bn order instead More Aviation Supercars can now travel in style from Dubai with Emirates Skywheels US regional airline Republic set to fly out of bankruptcy soon Bombardier’s passenger jet woes spur high-cost refinancing Brazil approves Qatar Airways’ stake purchase in Chile-based Latam Airlines MOST VIEWED Business | All Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end Dubai expats group shows the way to managing a property portfolio What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

The plane not only brought a full load of 180 passengers from Ireland to the Connecticut River Valley, but it also heralded the return of long sought-after transatlantic service to Bradley and what economic development officials in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Ireland see as a growing market for business and recreational travel. Jack Foley, Aer Lingus executive vice president for North America, told the crowd Wednesday that he expects to be back here in a year or so to say Aer Lingus is now flying the route with a larger aircraft, not the midsize Boeing 757s it is using now. "As of now, ticket sales have exceeded our projections. We don't release numbers, but sales are exceeding our projections," Foley said afterward in a brief interview before boarding the plane. "And we are especially exceeding expectations when it comes to the all-important business travel market." Kevin Dillon, executive director of the Connecticut Airport Authority and head of Bradley, said the next few Aer Linigus flights are booked solid. "With service like this, it always takes about six months to really figure out where you are and how well it is received," he said. "But Aer Lingus is very happy and we are continuing to reach out and let people know the service is available." Flights leave Bradley at 6:10 p.m. daily, arriving in Dublin at 5:20 a.m. the following day. Return flights will leave Dublin at 2:20 p.m. and arrive back in Connecticut at 4:20 p.m. To get the Aer Lingus service, the state of Connecticut made revenue guarantees of $9 million over two years to the airline, Dillon said. That means if revenue on the line falls short of benchmarks in that time period, Connecticut makes up the difference. Aer Lingus — the name means "air fleet" in Irish — is advertising the flights, round trip, from $497. Airlines like Aer Lingus need a load factor of at least 85 percent in order to run a route economically. That means on the Boeing 757 airliners Aer Lingus will use here, executives expect that at least 153 seats will be filled. "In the last five years we have been the fastest-growing airline over the Atlantic," Foley said. "And we have done that being profitable." Aer Lingus is not just expanding into Connecticut. The Irish airline started flying to Los Angeles in May and will add service to Newark, New Jersey, this month concurrently with Bradley. And Aer Lingus is not just selling Ireland. The flights to Dublin connect with flights to 25 cities across Europe including London, Berlin and Warsaw. "It is really a connection with all of Europe," said Timothy Brennan, executive director of the Pioneer Valley Regional Planning Commission. "This is a major boost for the Capital Region of Connecticut and for Springfield." WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. -- The first Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks arrives Wednesday.(Jim Kinney / The Republican)   Bradley is selling Aer Lingus to the traveling public on the convenience factor of coming and going from Bradley instead of Kennedy airport in New York or Logan in Boston. "That was always the worst part of making the trip," said Tony Sheridan of Waterford, Connecticut, before he boarded the flight to Dublin. "I've been traveling to Ireland for 50 years, almost every year, and getting to Kennedy or Logan is always the worst part." Added to that ease of travel is that Aer Lingus passengers pre-clear customs in Dublin. They arrive at Bradley just as a domestic passenger would. No long waits at the airport. Sheridan, who grew up near Dublin, is president of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut. He led a group of 30 business people over to Dublin on the flight along with Connecticut's top tourism officials. His focus is on southern Connecticut. "We can promote all of Mystic Country," he said. "The aquarium, the casinos." Foley said he has a group of Irish tour group operators flying in later this week for a 10-day stay. They'll get a taste of Connecticut and Massachusetts, including the Berkshires in fall, he said. Sheridan said tourism will flow both ways. Forty million Americans claim some Irish heritage, he said. Marlene Ferreira of Enfield, Connecticut, flew to Dublin Wednesday night for a quick weekend. She knows some people taking the flight for business and taged along. "But we'll be using it again," she said. "We'll use the flight next year to connect with Portugual. We go every year." Brennan said business travelers will really appreciate the convenience of close-by international travel. "It opens a door," Brennnan said. "It opens a door to all of Europe."

Source: AFP 29 Sep 2016 - 12:40 AM  UPDATED 29 Sep 2016 - 10:22 AM Tweet "Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing catastrophe is not changing," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. "The conclusions of Dutch prosecutors confirm that the investigation is biased and politically motivated," she said. She accused the Joint Investigative Taskforce of "arbitrarily designating a guilty party and inventing the desired results." The taskforce presented its findings on Wednesday after a two-year investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine, which killed all 298 people on board in July 2014. RELATED READING Investigation finds MH17 downed from pro-Russia rebel held territory International prosecutors investigating the downing of a Malaysian airliner two years ago have concluded it was shot down by a Russian-made missile fired from rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, victims' family members said on Wednesday. The conclusion did not assign blame but said the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile system from an area in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and that the system was brought in from Russia and then taken back there. The ministry statement said the taskforce "excluded Moscow from fully participating in the investigation process" while embracing Ukraine as a "full member of the JIT" and giving Kiev an opportunity to "falsify evidence and twist the case in its favour". "Russia is practically the only (party) that sends true information and discloses more and more new data," the statement said. Yet the "whole 'body of evidence' of the Dutch prosecutors was provided by Ukraine," it said. The taskforce said Wednesday that Moscow had only provided part of the information that it had requested. Russia's defence ministry on Monday released what it claimed were new radar images showing that there was no missile fired from rebel-held territory on that day, which contradicted some of its earlier declarations. Russia's Almaz-Antey missile maker, which produces BUK surface-to-air systems, said in a briefing Wednesday that the inquiry did not include its findings. The state-controlled firm last October alleged the plane was downed from disputed territory by an outdated version of the BUK missile that is no longer in use by the Russian military. Dutch prosecutors said they only received Almaz-Antey's data this month and did not find that it outweighed the probe's conclusions.

Doug Hurley Eric both Sonny Williams and myself Bob Franken are all assigned to work with those basics and mowing the develop the next vehicles that we'll take astronauts of the International Space Station. What are we doing okay today we're rolling out a simulator that Boeing has provided its part task trainer that will allow us to simulate the CST 100. The start wondered their vehicle that's gonna rotate crewmembers to the International Space Station. All right let's get going okay what what I can do. From my seats which is kind of a new capability it that we haven't had until now for CST one utter. Are hardliners actually taking. Similar to run and actually runs through an ascent profile. So I can see and monitor the vehicle's performance to make sure that we're getting into orbit and make sure all systems are functioning and I'm not about to be faced with an emergency scenario like Villa rescue training team likes to put in there for us. And make her way to orbit safely as I monitoring the systems. In the simulator from the scene and I can take us to freeze and stop things I think you could probably hear the acoustics of the the engine firing him below us as we launched towards space station in the first stage. Why monitor the performance and bring it back into run if I needed check procedure make sure I understood what was going on I could actually do that and enough pick up where it left off. Historically if you ran a simulator like this might take an entire control room to kind of cloth and executed it's really important for us and I wanna deal was sealed on these cases and be ready when the time comes I just have the timing down perfectly and author myself quite a few times much like an app on your phone or otherwise I concerns stop at my convenience. Make sure that I understand things and and pick up where it left off. At the same time the flight control team needs to understand what's happening with the vehicle can do the same thing they can come and sit down and understand the vehicle and get themselves prepared before we go to a large group. Do a simulation and prepare for watching it space. By the time you actually fly the star liner in 2018. How many hours of training like this do you think you have done it's it's just to be hundreds isn't. That's a great question and I think it I knew the answer to right now I would. And I could probably set up my own old fashioned 1900 number and and be able to predict where the stars were gonna alignments. Think it will be hundreds of hours for space shuttle we had. Probably three quarters of our training time was focused on being prepared for ascent and entry and I would expect that for some of the crew members will have a significant training. Workload in terms of being right but I do know for sure is going to be quite a bit less than it was for the for the space shuttle. As you can see just by house on the cockpit is with a vehicle accident. Folks actually I'm not quite tall enough to make this shot work so let's go back instead of CE inside the space shuttle. He just a quick search on line you can probably find out that there were thousands and thousands of switches on board the space shuttle. We've just got handfuls witches and caught right in front of a single remember. It physically it was impossible to beat Lindsay on this issue and reach everything that I needed to be reached even on assets when it as a time critical face. Here here marks an uphill you may require. Three or crew members to be able to reach all the things that could possibly. Here telephone of one person much smaller vehicles entry via. And it blasts. Vehicles much more automated than his facial lines have been a lot of advances since the sixties and seventies and so underwent is designed. The new vehicles that we have coming forward from mowing and SpaceX sir I'm very very much automated. The crews and the positions. To take over if something isn't performing as it's expected. To make sure that the computer isn't completely control your destiny you have some capability continue to do something safe and over. But that's one huge advancements. Looking ships will not. Only fat the star liner sort of a blast of past because. It will look like an Apollo capsule but it's really not an Apollo capsule because the technology has changed and talk to me about what's going to be different invests them in the Apollo as the campus to the moon. One one of the things that is true is that physics and change. From the holidays where we are right now so the outer mold lines of the vehicles need to be about the same and make it Indus basin and make it safely back through the atmosphere so that physics is exactly the same. What is different. Is the technology from a computer perspective that can be on board the amount of things they say now can be accomplished by itself on. Network which has much more computational capability can handle for the computers that Rob Portman Apollo so he's to have to all be done in the mind of of the crew member. With some digital numbers being displayed tone in. A lot of mathematics and training that went into making them prepared to turn those things into the appropriate action packed him off the automated now computer can do a lot more of those things that's really the biggest difference is that the computer capabilities are much better. You can be landing on my hands this is fit to plan is for is to come down you'll transfer water back to come down and you talk actually talk to about. Economics is that why do you want lamb what does landing on lamb imports. Here I think it's in this case for the Boeing designed landing on and this in general is always better because the complexity of the operation post landing as it is simpler so. Some more than truck and drive up that pick up the capsule take the crew taken where they need to go. You need to shift in a lot of coordination could go find somebody in the in the open ocean so the complexities a lot simpler and the environment that the capsule goes through is a lot. Work clean lot more pristine if you actually land on my end. You don't have enough salt water to deal with you don't have to have a vehicle that used to be robust than that and it does allow the vehicle to potentially be reviews and I think that that's. That's part of DC. The cost effectiveness. Pointed doubling its trying to get to visit the of the people listen make it back to land it's a little bit harder to refurbish once it's been through that saltwater environment. You won't be you. I need cash not that you've flown shadowed U Penn Station and now we did this I mean this is almost three generations vehicles. Talking a little bit about you know one of the things that was really interesting to me when I arrived at NASA and that 2000 is how little. For thinking we can hand me and had a and and it rightly so we were focused on building the space station but we didn't have a lot of a longer term plans in terms of what the astronauts were going to do next. I'm past sixteen years later fast forward. Space shuttles retired we've got. CSC 100 this airliner we've got the dragon vehicle we've got a lioness Alaska got a lot of vehicles in the next that are are coming forward and so for me. I would say it's probably the most exciting time you know in my life time to be an astronaut we are elated on the moon when I was born and so this is. Might chance to be a part of a space program that's. Pretty exciting right now three new vehicles is more than any of us have had through the entire rest of our career. Going to different places a couple of the space station and a couple of for one further out and so that makes a big difference makes for exciting times tonight and it's really it's really awesome into the apartment. And the options are catching an asteroid. I mean Mars everyone's talking about Mars these days possibly going back to mom. If you could design dream mission what would your dream mission indeed you know among might trade mission is just to continue the explorations all those destinations you meant. Mentioned there are great one's going to the moon is a great place going to Mars is a great place. Going to retrieve an asteroid or visiting heads or or even. It's a Hubble space telescope those were great nation so. All those expiration destinations and kind of facilitating that exploration. And understanding that Europe piece of that. That that outward stepping the human race into the solar system is this something I'm just excited to be a part of itself to save it what's your dream mission and I can't do all hum. You just. Did you Huard talked to Scott Kelly who recently returned from a his one year mission even he would say he realizes that he can't do every mission that's out there and space he had a great one. But there are lots of great ones and we're all just lucky to beat here at a time when things like that are happening when artery nations and us. And we're looking at 2018 launch and this won't get US astronauts back on US don't spacecraft. How important is that to you you know thanks for thanks for admission that point that's probably the point that I should have mentioned when I said hey what's the I was my idea of a dream mission I would say that as a student that's responsible if you ask. Anybody who is there what they thought their dream that assessment would hurt a sign it would be it would be testing a new station and I get to be that. And then on top of that I get to be one of the folks it's gonna bring commercial. Space flight back to the Florida coast and will be launching Americans from American soil. As the chief of NASA's astronaut office has been quite a bit of time traveling back and forth in Kazakhstan I'd probably. Over four years did. More than a dozen trips. Somebody that I lost count and one of my goals was to make sure that is media astronauts and that made that pilgrimage to house Exxon has until we get. Crew members to space station right now that's how we get and is based. And I wanted to mall to be thankful. For the timely launch from again off the Florida coast and so. Those that time is coming up quick I think I'm going as a recording 120 team is that timeframe to be ready take as the space station and that. Dream mission to the apartment and that's right now right now. Thank you Herman's we appreciate your time and the time this year he opening of this are pestering her with us.

Close share panel Image copyright AFP Image caption Prosecutors said the missile was brought into Ukraine from Russia International prosecutors say Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by a Buk missile that had come from Russia. They also narrowed down the area it was fired from to a field in territory controlled by Russian-backed rebels. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Russia says it cannot accept the findings as the final truth, saying no Russian weapons were taken to Ukraine. "Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation," chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen told a news conference on Wednesday. MH17 Malaysia plane crash: What we know MH17 crash: The 298 who perished The missile had been taken from Russia to rebel-held Ukraine in the morning of 17 July, when the plane was shot down, and the launcher was taken back to Russia the next day, he said. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) has also narrowed the missile launch site down to a specific field near the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was then in rebel hands. Media captionProsecutors played recordings from intercepted phone calls during the news conference In an interview with the BBC, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was "nothing to accept or deny", as he understood these were preliminary findings. "We cannot accept as final truth of what they say. I bet you haven't seen any proof of what they say," he told the Hardtalk programme, adding: "We know the devil is in the detail, and we are still missing lot of the detail." But he appeared to rule out that the missile came from Russia: "We've been ruling out the fact that any Russian weapons were shipped to Ukraine, any Russian army members, any Russian troops were inside Ukraine. And we're still ruling out that possibility." Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko hailed the inquiry's initial findings, saying: "We have solid proof of who is to blame for this dreadful crime." Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the preliminary findings "an important step on the road to the ultimate goal: finding and prosecuting the perpetrators", whereas the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said his country sought "firm action" so that those responsible "will be brought to justice". Media captionThere are still lots of unclear things and lots of contradictions says Dmitry Peskov Who gave the order? Justice is exactly what the relatives of the victims want. "Apart from wanting to know exactly what weapon was used and where it was fired from, we also want an answer as to where we go from here," said Evert van Zijtveld, who lost his 18-year-old son Robert-Jan and daughter Frederique, 19, in the tragedy. "We want to see the perpetrators caught and put on trial," he told the AFP news agency. JIT prosecutors have established the identities of about 100 people "linked to the crash or the transport of the Buk" missile, but they are yet to determine who could be held criminally responsible. They will need to establish who gave the order to move the missile launcher into eastern Ukraine, and where the order for it to be fired came from. All of this will take time, they say. Media captionHow does a BUK missile system work? Many witnesses Prosecutors played recordings from intercepted phone calls during their news conference. They said witnesses reported seeing the missile launcher move from Russia into Ukraine and presented pictures and videos. The launch site was pinpointed by "many witnesses", prosecutors said. Image copyright Reuters A long, frustrating quest - Richard Galpin, BBC News Near the village of Hrabove, where a large section of the Boeing 777 had come down, we soon found bodies scattered in the fields and a pile of suitcases by the side of the road. A child's diary lay open on the ground. The intense heat from the crash had melted part of one of the wings and a section of human backbone lay in the ashes. For the families of the 298 people killed when MH17 was shot down, today's report is a step forward in their long, frustrating quest to see those responsible brought to justice. The confirmation that the missile launcher had been sent from Russia implies that Russian soldiers could have been involved at least in the transportation and possibly in the firing of the rocket. But prosecutors admit they do not know who gave the order to shoot the plane down. And while there is a determination to prosecute those responsible, it is very unclear that this will ever be possible, particularly if it would require Moscow to hand over suspects. Image copyright Reuters Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. "We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them," Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk People's Republic, told the Interfax news agency. "Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17]." An inquiry by the Dutch Safety Board last year found that a Russian-made Buk missile hit the plane but was not specific about where the launch site could have been. Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. The JIT does not yet have access to that data, prosecutors said. Russia's changing story In the two years since MH17 was shot down, Russian officials have presented several theories about what happened. Image copyright EPA Image caption This week, Russia presented radar images which it said showed the missile could not have been fired from rebel territory 21 July 2014: Four days after the tragedy, Russia's defence ministry presented satellite photos and other images suggesting it was downed by a Ukrainian surface-to-air Buk missile or a Ukrainian military jet June 2015: Russia's Investigations Committee named a "key witness" - a Ukrainian "aircraft ordnance technician" - who claimed that the Boeing was downed by a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter October 2015: Buk missile producer Almaz-Antey said that the plane was indeed downed by a Buk, but an old one - which Russia no longer had in its arsenal September 2016: Russia's defence ministry released what it said were radar data suggesting MH17 was shot down by a missile, but not one fired by Russian-backed rebels Russia's changing version of events Related Topics Russia Netherlands Ukraine crisis Share this story About sharing Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin More on this story MH17 Ukraine plane crash: What we know 28 September 2016 The 298 who perished on MH17 28 July 2014 A tale of two sisters 9 July 2015 History of downed passenger planes 20 July 2014 Top Stories Trump gives Sessions top law job US President-elect Donald Trump has given conservative ally Jeff Sessions the attorney general post. 18 November 2016 Scots and Welsh to get say on Brexit case 18 November 2016 'No, I didn't marry a snake' - fireman 18 November 2016 Features & Analysis An empty seat Remembering man whose death was filmed on Facebook Trump is coming Run away!

"Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing catastrophe is not changing," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. "The conclusions of Dutch prosecutors confirm that the investigation is biased and politically motivated," she said. She accused the Joint Investigative Taskforce of "arbitrarily designating a guilty party and inventing the desired results." The taskforce presented its findings on Wednesday after a two-year investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in conflict-torn eastern Ukraine, which killed all 298 people on board in July 2014. The conclusion did not assign blame but said the Boeing 777 was shot down by a BUK missile system from an area in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists, and that the system was brought in from Russia and then taken back there. The ministry statement said the taskforce "excluded Moscow from fully participating in the investigation process" while embracing Ukraine as a "full member of the JIT" and giving Kiev an opportunity to "falsify evidence and twist the case in its favour". "Russia is practically the only (party) that sends true information and discloses more and more new data," the statement said. Yet the "whole 'body of evidence' of the Dutch prosecutors was provided by Ukraine," it said. The taskforce said Wednesday that Moscow had only provided part of the information that it had requested. Russia's defence ministry on Monday released what it claimed were new radar images showing that there was no missile fired from rebel-held territory on that day, which contradicted some of its earlier declarations. Russia's Almaz-Antey missile maker, which produces BUK surface-to-air systems, said in a briefing Wednesday that the inquiry did not include its findings. The state-controlled firm last October alleged the plane was downed from disputed territory by an outdated version of the BUK missile that is no longer in use by the Russian military. Dutch prosecutors said they only received Almaz-Antey's data this month and did not find that it outweighed the probe's conclusions.

The industrial zone could create up to 8,700 jobs. Advertisement Morocco signed an agreement with Boeing on Sept. 27 to build a new hub for the US aerospace giant that officials hope will create thousands of skilled jobs. King Mohammed VI oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding in the northern port city of Tangiers to establish an industrial zone where up to 120 Boeing suppliers and sub-contractors could operate. "This is a very important strategic project as we move into a new aeronautical era in Morocco," said Industry Minister Moulay Hafi Elalamy. Morocco has unveiled several large-scale industrial projects in recent years, with the Tangiers region among the fastest growing. Renault in April signed deals to invest more than $1 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the North African country. Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things Morocco was badly affected by the financial crisis in Europe, its top trade partner, and has struggled to contain a ballooning public deficit. The authorities have strenuously promoted the country as a bridge between Africa and the West, in a bid to encourage foreign investment and trade. "The Moroccan aeronautical industry has seen important growth in recent years," said Elalamy. "The sector has grown six-fold in just 10 years and there are now 121 firms." Some of the largest manufacturers are already present in the country, contributing to a sector that employs about 10,000 people and has revenue of $1 billion per year. Elalamy said the Boeing industrial zone could create up to 8,700 jobs. Morocco's gateway linking Europe, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, Tangiers has experienced unprecedented development in recent years, including a new airport and deep-water port.

Fuller Korean Air's aerospace division and Boeing have renewed a project to convert some South Korean military helicopters into unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The companies signed a memorandum of agreement at Korean Air's Seoul headquarters last week, according to a company press release. The agreement calls for the development of unmanned aircraft by converting MH 500MD Defense helicopters. Per the agreement, Boeing will provide technical support for flight control and other data, as well as for test evaluations. Both companies are also set to implement an overseas joint marketing program. This agreement comes after Korean Air successfully completed a remodel of the ROK Air Force's retired 500MDs to unmanned rotorcraft from 2014 to May of this year. Now, Korean Air has launched a new project to remodel the 500MDs into unmanned, armed aircraft. The project will run until 2017. The combat aircraft will be able to perform day and night reconnaissance and surveillance missions, as well as conduct short-distance precision strikes.

They said the missile launcher was brought into Ukraine from Russia and returned back after hitting the plane. The prosecutors claim they would investigate about 100 people over the incident, but didn't give any names yes. As reported earlier, according to Dutch media, Joint Investigation Team (JIT) concluded that the "Buk" launcher, which downed Malaysian Boeing in Donbas, was brought into the territory of Ukraine from Russia. This is stated in a preliminary conclusion of the JIT, given by the prosecutor Fred Westerbeke to the relatives of the passengers, killed in the plane crash. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was hit by a surface-to-air missile while en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and all 298 people aboard were killed. At the time of the disaster, Ukrainian government forces were engaged in heavy fighting with Russia-controlled separatists. The Boeing 777 broke apart in midair, flinging wreckage over several kilometres of fields in the militant-held territory. The incident played a significant part in a decision by the European Union and the United States to impose sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine conflict, and East-West tensions escalated to levels not seen since the end of Cold War. As Ukraine Today reported, the team of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine planned a news conference at 11:00 GMT (14:00 Kyiv time) to deliver conclusions "with regard to the weapon that was used to bring down Flight MH17 and the precise location from which this weapon was launched", a group statement said. Read also UT special project From Russia With Love on the Kremlin involvement in Donbas War and particularly on circumstances of MH17 tragedy. Ukrainian and Western officials, citing intelligence intercepts, have blamed Russian-backed rebels for the incident. Russia has always denied direct involvement in the Ukraine conflict and rejects responsibility for the destruction of MH17, but blamed Ukraine for the disaster and also for obstructing the MH17 investigation. A civilian investigation into the cause of the July 17, 2014, incident conducted by the Dutch Safety Board concluded last year that the airliner had been downed by a Russian-made ‘Buk' missile, which was brought from Russia and launched from eastern Ukraine. But the board was not tasked with assigning blame, and prosecutors must conduct their own investigation if evidence assembled is ever to be used in court. Dutch prosecutors have sought legal assistance from Moscow since October 2014, and visited in person for a week in July, but "Russian authorities … have not answered all questions," and even blocked MH17 crash probes, so they had to be extended for another 9 months. State-backed Russian TV report on MH17 was also discredited for use of fake photos. A Kremlin-backed militant leader even claimed personally witnessing Ukrainian aircraft shooting down MH17, but current Russian official position proved the previous ones were a fake. Independent investigators like Bellingcat group presented their own conclusions and even photos of Russian Buk missile system, which had allegedly downed MH17. In 2015 Malaysian, Australian, Dutch, Belgian and Ukrainian delegations proposed a United Nations-backed tribunal to prosecute the case, but Russia cast a veto in the UN Security Council to block the motion. This decision was condemned by global leaders.  Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Crime12:19 Nov. 18, 2016 Offence against Shyrokyne, Hnutove and Troitske with 122mm artillery Crime11:28 Nov. 18, 2016 OSCE warns about a possible attack on Mariupol Crime19:25 Nov. 17, 2016 Bulgarian ex-minister charged over nuclear project Crime17:28 Nov. 16, 2016 Ukraine's cyber police shut down one of the biggest pirate movie websites Crime17:06 Nov. 16, 2016 Artillery fire towards Shyrokyne again See more news Tweets by @uatodaytv Ukraine Today WEEKLY DIGEST Subscribe to receive regular email updates about Ukraine and Eastern Europe Copyright © 2014News|Live|Politics|Business|Entertainment|Crime|Tech&Science|Society|Sport|Opinion|About Privacy policy Communicate Follow Follow @uatodaytv Subscribe vk154998

Samsung will issue a global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone as soon as this weekend after its investigation on explosion claims found batteries were at fault, according to South Korea's Yonhap News. (AP Photo/ahn Young-joon) Samsung's Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from iPhones to Tesla cars to Boeing jetliners. Blame chemistry and the fact that the batteries we rely on for everyday life are prone to leaking and even bursting into flame if damaged, defective or exposed to excessive heat. That's because lithium-ion batteries store a lot of energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls. If something happens to those separators, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. Samsung hasn't specified exactly what caused the fires that led to therecall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s Thursday beyond calling it a "battery cell issue ." Still, lithium batteries are so ubiquitous that ordinary users of phones and computers shouldn't worry. Research suggests that you're more likely to get hurt by a kitchen grease fire or a drunk driver than the battery powering your iPhone, Kindle or laptop. "It's not like we live in a world where people's smartphones spontaneously combust," said Ramon Llamas, research manager of research firm IDC's mobile phones team. He said owners of Galaxy Note 7s should err on the side of caution and contact Samsung for a replacement that doesn't run the same risk. Here's a look at other notable incidents when lithium batteries by themselves or in electronics have caused problems. ON AIRPLANES There have been dozens of aircraft fires caused by lithium batteries, so many that the batteries are no longer welcome as cargo on passenger flights. In one of the most recent incidents, a Fiji Airways Boeing 737 was preparing for takeoff from Melbourne, Australia, when smoke was discovered coming from the cargo bay. The plane was evacuated and the cargo unloaded. The source of the fire turned out to be lithium-ion batteries in a passenger's checked bags. Hoverboards and e-cigarettes are banned from flights for the same reason. TESLA In August, a Tesla electric car caught fire during a promotional tour in southwest France. Tesla said in a statement that it is "working with the authorities to establish the facts" about the fire. The driver was quoted in local newspaper Sud Ouest as saying he answered a Facebook ad offering test drives of the Model S sedan. The driver said he saw smoke, and the three people aboard got out before seeing it catch fire. Tesla hasn't officially found fault with the battery. But in 2013 , it faced questions when several Model S sedans caught fire after road debris damaged their batteries. Tesla wound up strengthening the battery shield on new and existing cars. HOVERBOARDS Hoverboards, or self-balancing scooters, have been linked with at least 99 electrical fires in the U.S., according to the the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Hoverboards might be more susceptible than other products to battery fires because they come under more duress than other electronic devices like computers. Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers dumped the products after videos of burning hoverboards went viral. But they reopened sales this year after passing new fire-safety tests. COMPUTER BATTERIES In June HP recalled nearly 50,000 HP, Compaq, HP ProBook, HP ENVY, Compaq Presario, and HP Pavilion computers after seven reports of battery packs overheating, melting or charring, including four reports of property damage totaling about $4,000.

With biofuel potential limited and emissions rising, the need for industry to act is urgent. Hopes rest on a global UN carbon offset scheme to be negotiated at the ICAO summit this week - but critics remain unconvinced There have been around 2,500 flights powered by biofuels, while aviation emissions are expected to quadruple by 2050. Photograph: Jeffrey Milstein/Gatwick Airport/PA John Vidal Tuesday 27 September 2016 06.24 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close When a South Africa Airways scheduled flight flew from Johannesburg to Cape Town last month, it carried nearly 300 passengers. Neither the passengers or the pilots would have noticed any difference between that flight and any other. But instead of the usual petroleum-based jet fuel, the plane was burning thousands of litres of a clear liquid derived from the oil of nicotine-free tobacco plants grown by farmers on acres of under-used land in the country’s Limpopo province. Boeing, KLM, South African Airways, the Dutch government and others who partnered in the trial were cock-a-hoop with the results, which came as part of something called Project Solaris. It appeared that the fuel was not only efficient, but it was also more or less “sustainable”, because it did not take up farmland needed to grow food or lead to deforestation or ecological problems. “It showed that a low-carbon aviation biofuel could be be grown that will not affect the environment and could reward farmers,” said Joost Van Lier, a director of South African Sunchem biofuel development, one of the project’s partners. The tobacco fuel used was much more expensive than regular jet fuel, but because many airlines have committed to reducing CO2 emissions and substituting biofuels for some of their jet fuel by 2020, Project Solaris hopes to ramp up the acreage of tobacco grown to eventually produce millions of litres of the fuel in other southern African countries such as Malawi. So far, there have been around 2,500 successful flights fuelled by biofuels. In March, United Airlines became the first US airline to use biofuel for regularly scheduled commercial flights from Los Angeles airport, and in June Alaska Airlines flew commercial flights using biofuel based on isobutanol produced from corn. “Oslo airport now supplies airlines with alternative fuels for regular daily flights. Los Angeles is following and we expect John F Kennedy and other New York airports to stream from 2019,” said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, a coalition of aviation industry companies. But despite successful tests and trials with different crops and waste streams, is there any hope in the forseeable future of aviation biofuels taking off on the scale needed to make even the slightest dent in the 300bn litres of jet fuel used worldwide every year? Worldwide, flights produced nearly 800m tonnes of CO2 in 2015, or up to 5% of all CO2 emissions. “No credible scenarios exist for large-scale production of biofuels at present,” said Carlos Calvo Ambel, an energy analyst with Brussels-based watchdog group Transport & Environment. “So far, only a handful of companies produce renewable jet fuel on a commercial scale, and a single airport , Oslo, is set up to provide it.” International aviation and shipping werenot mentioned in the Paris agreement, so it is unclear how their rapidly growing emissions are to be addressed. But the need for the industry to adopt a global scheme is seen as urgent if there is any hope of meeting the Paris agreement’s aspiration of holding temperature rises to 1.5C. As it is, the current industry projections expect aviation emissions to quadruple, potentially to account for 22% of global emissions by 2050. Instead of relying on biofuels, governments are pinning their hopes on a UN global carbon offset scheme. This is to be negotiated this week in Montreal when 191 governments meet for the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) summit. A draft scheme is backed by US, Canada, Mexico, EU countries including the UK, and Singapore. According to Transport & Environment, the US wants the new deal to cover as many countries as possible. “Its strategy has been to weaken the agreement’s environmental effectiveness so as to attract more states. China is pursuing a similar strategy, and it has yet to commit itself to signing up,” it said. But there are grave reservations among NGOs that an offset scheme, which could see other industrial sectors cutting emissions to allow aviation to continue growing, is not ambitious enough and may not even work. The proposal in the draft text released earlier this month defines a voluntary “pilot and implementation” period from 2021-27 after which countries would have to join in. “One of the discussions in Montreal will be whether to include Redd [Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation] offsets [offsets based on avoiding deforestation] in ICAO’s offsetting scheme. As a way of addressing climate change, offsetting flying against the carbon stored in forests would be insane,” says Chris Lang, editor of Redd Monitor which has analysed UN proposals to reduce forestry emissions with a similar offset scheme. “Not only would such a scheme allow the aviation sector to continue expanding and to continue burning fossil fuels, it would rely on carbon being stored in forests. Yet as climate change worsens, the risk of these forests burning and returning the carbon to the atmosphere is increasing,” he said. The offsetting scheme, which hopes to stabilise aviation emissions at 2020 levels, is strongly defended by Michael Gill, director of the Aviation Transport Action Group (ATAG), an industry coalition. “Offsetting is not a new concept,” he says. “Indeed, a large number of airlines already offer offsetting to passengers on a voluntary basis. What the industry does need is certainty, with a clear set of metrics defined before the scheme commences and consistently applied throughout its lifetime.” Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said: “I am optimistic that we are on the brink of a historic agreement—a first for an industry sector at the global level. The aviation industry would have preferred a more ambitious timeline than is currently outlined.” Critics are not convinced. The International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation (ICSA), the only civil society body accredited to observe the aviation proceedings, has strong reservations about the proposed market-based scheme because it would rely on a system of “voluntary, unguaranteed participation with weak environmental safeguards”. “The new proposed text would allow nations participating ... to opt out with only six months’ notice, raising serious concerns about the durability of the programme,” said the ICSA in a letter to EU commissioners. The coalition also fears that if the offsets used to achieve the goal of the UN scheme are also credited to other climate goals, emissions will increase while countries and airlines appear to meet their pledges. Instead they want to see ambitious states and regions allowed to go further in reducing their emissions and clear language introduced to avoid double counting. The environmental coalition prefers an expansion of the EU emissions trading system (ETS), which controversially included aviation for 10 months in 2012. The scheme involved the EU imposing a cap on carbon dioxide emissions for all planes arriving or departing from EU airports, while allowing airlines to buy and sell “pollution credits” , rewarding low carbon-emitting aviation. But the EU froze the scheme in November 2012 after the ICAO said it would take global action on emissions from planes. “The EU stopped the clock on its own ETS to give ICAO time to develop an environmentally meaningful measure, not a voluntary scheme which postpones serious action for a decade or more. Europe should be proud of setting the global benchmark, and never replace it with something inferior that is open to bogus offset programmes,” said Andrew Murphy, aviation policy officer at Transport & Environment.

Source: IHS/Gareth Jennings Boeing and Korean Air have signed a memorandum of agreement (MoA) to co-develop an armed unmanned variant of the MD 500 Little Bird light attack and observation helicopter for the Republic of Korea Army (RoKA) and the international market. The MoA, which was signed in South Korea on 21 September, will see Boeing provide Korean Air with technical support for flight control and other data, and for test evaluations. Korean Air Aerospace Division (KAL-ASD) first showcased a prototype of its unmanned Little Bird at the Seoul International Aerospace and Defence Exhibition (ADEX) 2015. Known as the Korean Air Unmanned System - Vertical Helicopter (KUS-VH), this platform was built as a demonstrator for the RoKA. At that event, IHS Jane's was told by a KAL-ASD official that the first flight would take place in 2016, although no news of such an event has yet been released. Boeing's involvement in the programme stems from it being the successor company to the Little Bird's original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Hughes Helicopters. Boeing has already developed its own H-6U Unmanned Little Bird (ULB), which it will no doubt use to help inform KAL-ASD's efforts. This MoA follows a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that Boeing and KAL-ASD signed in 2013 to convert an undisclosed number of the RoKA's MD 500 helicopters into unarmed unmanned platforms. The RoKA is thought to have 175 manned MD 500 helicopters still in service (130 MD 500s in the observation role and 45 BGM-71 TOW missile-equipped Defender platforms in the light attack role) that were licence-built for it in the 1970s by KAL-ASD. As the licence builder for the type, KAL-ASD has the proprietary knowledge and skill sets necessary to convert these ageing helicopters into unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). KAL-ASD has previously told IHS Jane's that a request for proposals for a MD 500 and Bell AH-1 Cobra helicopter replacement for the RoKA is expected in late 2016/early 2017, with the selected platform due to enter service in about 2022.

Sidelining the need for Wi-Fi, the system instead uses a chip that interfaces with mobile phones and enables passengers to interface with amenities, such as controlling overhead lights, beaming requests to flight attendants and shopping from their phones. According to Boeing: “If there’s a problem, the cabin device could automatically inform maintenance personnel on the ground so it can be repaired immediately after touchdown. It also could provide cabin crew with information about frequent fliers, including exact seat location and their preferences, which would help provide customized customer service. Additionally, the crew could monitor lavatory status and passenger orders or control cabin lighting.” The system would be separate from the plane’s cockpit and entertainment platforms, and the aviation’s cyber-security team has encouraged other airlines to embrace ‘smart cabin’ features and concepts to further differentiate them from competitors. Such innovations underscore the reality that we will be interacting with planes in new ways over the coming years. More frequently, airlines are introducing self-service screens and mobile-centric hardware, all of which suggest that we will see a greater amount of automation. These changes  will directly impact our expectations of airline personnel.

The cost-plus-fixed-free contracts are for risk reduction activities, concepts refinement, and trade space requirements development in preparation for the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the programme, according to the announcement. Both deals cover work through October 2017. USN officials have said the new aircraft will be optimised for two missions: tanking and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR). Single-mission high-endurance ISR aircraft and tankers typically have unique airframes, but officials have said that they are looking into the industry to demonstrate the design's "sweet spot" for conducting both missions. MQ-25 is the successor to the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) programme, which was focused on the ISR and strike missions. Want to read more?

Saidi is not just any hojat al-Islam, a Shiite clerical rank just below that of ayatollah, but the supreme leader’s representative to the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Summary⎙ Print Just back from New York, President Hassan Rouhani has been harshly reminded that engagement with the United States should not go beyond the nuclear deal. Meanwhile, Iran releases a detained Iranian-Canadian professor. Author Misha Zand Posted September 26, 2016 In an interview with the IRGC-linked Fars News Agency on Sept. 24, Saidi said, “Under the cover of the JCPOA, the country’s government was pursuing the straightening out of relations with the United States. The Americans’ intention with the negotiations was also beyond solving the nuclear issue, but the supreme leader prevented the Americans from gaining more points.” These comments come only days after Rouhani welcomed American companies at a Sept. 22 news conference in New York, where he said, “The nuclear deal has paved the ground for all foreign investors and companies to invest in Iran.” This is not the first time Rouhani has tried to build on the July 2015 nuclear deal. In February, he announced his government’s economic plans for a “second JCPOA” that would include international “reconciliation.” That statement did not please the supreme leader, either. In the Sept. 24 interview with Fars News, Saidi specifically underlined that talks with the United States should at all times stay within the framework of the nuclear deal, saying that broader diplomatic engagement “is one of the red lines that we cannot cross,” and adding, “This issue goes back to the cornerstones of the revolution.” Rouhani’s Sept. 20-22 visit to New York was also marked by extensive coverage in the Iranian media of the breaking news that the US Treasury finally issued licenses to Boeing and Airbus, permitting the sale of passenger airplanes to Iran. The Boeing deal is the largest business agreement between Iran and the United States since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. The positive reactions to the aircraft deals were inevitable in the pro-reform Iranian newspapers over the weekend. Speaking to the Reformist Shargh Daily on Sept. 24, Abbas Akhoundi, the minister of roads and urban development, praised the Boeing and Airbus deals and said, “This means that we finally after four decades can regain our share of the [aviation industry] in the global market.” In contrast, news outlets close to hard-liners downplayed the aviation deals, which are authorized under the nuclear deal. Adopting a skeptical position on Sept. 24, the hard-line Vatan-e Emrooz criticized the United States for not delivering its part of the nuclear agreement on time, as it has been months since preliminary understandings with Airbus and Boeing were announced. Other conservative outlets such as Kayhan Daily took it further and demanded Sept. 26 that the United States provide compensation for the delay. Saidi also remarked on the Boeing deal in his Sept. 24 interview with the IRGC-linked Fars News Agency, saying, “I am worried that they will send a few Boeing airplanes here and while a group of people take pictures with them, their minds will get sidetracked and they will start thinking that the JCPOA has been a success.” In other news, Homa Hoodfar, an Iranian-Canadian academic who was imprisoned earlier this year on security charges, has been released on humanitarian grounds. Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghassemi announced Sept. 26 that she has returned to Canada through Oman. The release comes after Canadian Foreign Minister Stephane Dion’s Sept. 21 meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit in New York. It was the first meeting held at the ministerial level since Ottawa severed relations with Tehran in 2012.

Investigators: Missile That Downed MH17 Was Brought in from Russia VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory September 29, 2016 08:08 International investigators say a Malaysian airliner that crashed over eastern Ukraine in July 2014 was shot down by a surface-to-air missile that was transported into the country from Russia. The findings released Wednesday confirm an earlier investigation by the Dutch Safety Board that concluded Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was brought down by a Russian-made Buk missile, a claim Russia has denied. "It may be concluded MH17 was shot down by a 9M38 missile launched by a Buk, brought in from the territory of the Russian Federation," said Wilbert Paulissen of the Dutch National Police. Paulissen said evidence shows that pro-Russian rebels requested the deployment of the surface-to-air missile to the village of Pervomaysk and reported its arrival in eastern Ukraine. But Russia has dismissed the Dutch-led investigation as subjective. "Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing crash is not changing," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. "The conclusions of the Dutch Prosecutor's office confirmed that the investigation is biased and politically motivated." Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov told the Interfax news agency, "All of the data presented today at the briefing by the investigation team has two main sources: the Internet and security services of Ukraine. Therefore, doubts are bound to be raised over the objectivity of this information, and, correspondingly, the conclusions based on it." Zakharova said Russia offered to assist in the investigation but the investigators "removed Moscow from full participation," relegating Russia to only a "minor role." In a move aimed at preempting the new findings, Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier Wednesday that Russian radar data proved that no rocket was fired from within territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. "The most important thing in today's report is that the circle is narrowing and perhaps next year the international commission of inquiry will name the perpetrators of the crime," Bogdan Petrenko, deputy director of the Ukrainian Institute of Extremism, told VOA. "Probably, after a final conclusion, it will be possible to take the Russian Federation to court. Of course, we are talking first and foremost about the relatives of the victims of the downed Boeing." "The investigation, a trial in this case, is very important for Ukraine. It makes it possible to sue Russia according to several international conventions," political analyst Olesya Yakhno-Belkovskaya told VOA. "One involves support and financing of terrorism. The results of the investigation of this tragedy are, in particular, proof of Russia's actions in the east of the country -- support and funding of military operations against Ukraine." The U.S. Department of State said the findings support Secretary of State John Kerry's statement days after the attack that the plane was downed by a BUK missile that was launched from an area controlled by Russian-backed rebels. "While nothing can take away the grief of those who lost loved ones on that tragic day, this announcement is another step toward bringing to justice those responsible for this outrageous attack," said State Department spokesman John Kirby. Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed rebels were engaged in intense fighting in eastern Ukraine at the time of the crash. Wilbert Paulissen of the Joint Investigation Team speaks on the preliminary results of the investigation into the shooting-down of Malaysia Airlines jetliner flight MH17 during a press conference in Nieuwegein, Netherlands on Sept. 28, 2016. /AP ◆ Ukraine Reacts to Findings Ukraine's Foreign Ministry hailed the report as "an important milestone" that exposes Russia's "direct involvement" in the missile attack. "This puts an end to all of Russia’s attempts to discredit activities of the Joint Investigation Team and conclusions by spreading distorted or fabricated information," the ministry said. Malaysia called Wednesday for the perpetrators of the missile attack to be brought to justice. "Malaysia wants firm action to be taken," said Prime Minister Najib Razak. "We have promised that those who were responsible for the downing of the aircraft will be brought to justice." In addition to Russia's consistent denial of any involvement in the crash, Moscow has claimed the airliner was downed either by a Ukrainian fighter jet or shot down from Ukrainian-held territory. But the evidence against that is overwhelming, military science analyst Justin Bronk of the London-based Royal United Services Institute said in an interview with VOA. "The rebels had been firing surface-to-air missiles regularly for months at all sorts of Ukrainian military aircraft. They did not have any official contact with air traffic control. So they basically have just taken delivery of a much more powerful missile system than they had had previously, and were shooting at whatever they could see. And they, unfortunately, happened to hit an airliner." Netherlands chief prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said investigators have identified about 100 who were involved in the attack "one way or another." He said, "A clear impression of the chain of command" must be established before it can be determined if they are culpable. The report, which stopped short of concluding Russian soldiers were involved, was prepared by prosecutors from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine. The report's findings were based on thousands of pieces of evidence, including wiretaps, photographs, witness statements and forensics tests that were gathered over a more than two year period. ◆ Possible Criminal Trial Investigators say the latest findings, in addition to those from an earlier investigation, may be solid enough to be used in a criminal trial. Prosecutors cannot file charges at this time because international investigators have not agreed in which court to hold a trial. The previous investigation identified a 320-square kilometer area where it said the rocket launch must have taken place. Authorities did not explicitly say who had fired it, although all the land was controlled by pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces. In a move aimed at preempting the new findings, Russia on Wednesday said its radar data proved that no rocket was fired from within territory held by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. On a conference call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian radar identified all flying objects over the rebel territory, and there was no rocket. "The data are clear-cut...there is no rocket," he said. "If there was a rocket, it could only have been fired from elsewhere." All 298 passengers on the Boeing 777 died after it broke apart in mid-air while traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The downing of the plane was a major factor in a decision by the European Union and the United States to impose sanctions on Russia, leading to a rise in East-West tensions to levels not seen since the end of the Cold War in 1991.

Kiev and independence supporters in Ukraine’s southeast have blamed each other for the downing of the MH17 plane. According to the JIT, the flight was downed by a 9М38 missile launched from Buk, which was brought from Russia and later returned there, near with the Pervomayskoe settlement, which was controlled by Donbas militias. At the same time the investigators failed to prove that the system had been brought from the Russian territory. Russia’s Almaz-Antey, which was Buk manufacturer, said that it's tests revealed that the missile had been launched from Zaroshchenskoe settlement. Director of the National Criminal Investigation Division of National Police of the Netherlands Wilbert Paulissen said that at the moment of the downing, militias had resisted Ukrainian Air Force's airstrikes. At the same time, JIT chief and Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke declined to formally link the crash to Russia or Russian nationals. According to Westerbeke, the investigators have identified 100 people "in one way or another" involved in the downing, but added that they should identify people, who were in the Buk's cabin and to find out whether they acted on their own or received orders. The investigators also reported that they would continue the probe into the flight crash until early 2018. THOUSANDS OF EVIDENCES Westerbeke told reporters that the results of the investigation were based on the investigation of some 1,450 debris of the plane that had been collected within the framework of the probe, as well as on the evidences collected in Internet. He added that up to 200 investigators worked on the issue during the investigation and some 100 investigators, prosecutors and experts were still involved in the inquiry. © AFP 2016/ EMMANUEL DUNAND EU Supports JIT's Investigation Into MH17 Crash, Welcomes Inquiry's ProgressHe added that the investigators had studied about half a million of video records and photographs and listened about 3,500 intercepted phone conversations, which had been provided by Ukraine's security services by court order. According to the investigators, the abovementioned materials contributed to clarification of the Buk's route. During the report's presentation, the JIT showed reporters video records and photographs showing the details of Buk's movement and a phone conversation of people, who discussed the details of the Buk's delivery. The presentation had also included photos of an alleged launch site and a condensation trail. INFORMATION FROM RUSSIA Despite the fact that Russia is not a member of the JIT, the information from Moscow had also been attached to the case. The Russian Defense Ministry said this week it would forward the new data uncovered by one of the Almaz-Antey's radar and control system production plants to Dutch investigators. Commenting on this fact, Westerbeke told reporters that the investigators had not received such information yet, but would thoroughly study it in future. At the same time the Dutch prosecutors were still expecting Russia's response to several requests on the issue. Earlier in the day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the MH17 crash probe was accompanied by speculation and other countries' refusal to provide radar data, adding that it was necessary to make conclusions against the backdrop of all the available information, including the most recent data. MOSCOW'S RESPONSE The report and its conclusions could not have slipped under the radar in Moscow. Almaz-Antey rejected the findings in the probe, saying that the investigators had not got enough technical evidence to support their claims. "The conclusions by the Joint Investigation Team announced today do not have sufficient technical evidence to support claims allegations that Russia was somehow involved in Malaysian Boeing catastrophe in summer of 2014," Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to Almaz-Antey general director, told RIA Novosti. According to Malyshevsky, Almaz-Antey has conducted three simulations that can serve as technical proof of the fact that a missile, which downed the Malaysian plane, was launched from the Zaroshchenskoe area, controlled by units of the Ukrainian army at the time of the incident. He added that the investigators made their conclusions in accordance with the characteristics of a US missile that was different from the ones used in Buk systems. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said that the impartiality of the data provided by the investigators of the crash and the conclusions made on the basis of this data cannot help but cause doubts. "We familiarized ourselves carefully with today’s statements of the representatives of the Dutch investigation team on proving the crash of the Malaysian Boeing MH17 in the Ukrainian airspace… I remind that all data presented today in the briefing of the investigation team had two main sources – the internet and the Ukrainian special services. Therefore, the impartiality of this data and consequently the conclusions made on its basis cannot help but cause doubts," Konashenkov said. The official added that no Russian missile systems, including Buk, have ever crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that Russia was disappointed with the situation around the investigation of the airliner's crash. "Russia is disappointed that the situation regarding the Boeing crash is not changing. The conclusion of the Dutch prosecutors confirm that the case is biased and politically motivated," Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement. According to the spokeswoman, Ukraine was made a member of the JIT despite the fact that it is an interested side. "It sounds like a cruel joke, but Ukraine was made a full-fledged member of the JIT, giving it an opportunity to falsify evidence and have the case develop to its advantage… Everything that the so-called ‘evidence base’ of the Dutch prosecution is based on was provided by the Ukrainian agencies, which are indubitably an interested side," Zakharova said. She also expressed hope that the situation would change after Russia provided "such indisputable evidence as primary radar data." WORLD'S REACTION © Sputnik/ Maksim Blinov UK Foreign Minister Calls on Russia to Engage Constructively in MH17 ProbeThe 2014 tragedy claimed lives of almost 300 people, who were the citizens of many countries, such as Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, Belgium and Indonesia among others. This has contributed to the fact that representatives of different countries have commented the Wednesday report. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak promised to convene a meeting with representatives of Ukraine, Netherlands and Australia to discuss the report adding that the responsible for the crash should be brought to justice. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders welcomed the publication of the results of the investigation. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the JIT's conclusions are a significant step towards the punishment of the culprits of the crash. "The publication of this information is an important milestone towards our ultimate common goal: bringing to justice all those responsible for downing the aircraft. It is our moral duty to the 298 victims and their relatives and friends," the ministerial statement said. The deputy defense minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic's (DPR), Eduard Basurin, said that the JIT was wrong in its conclusions about the alleged launch of the missile from militias-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. "I believe that it [investigation] is brought to a deadlock on purpose. For the second time the team makes its conclusions, for the second time the conclusions are wrong," Basurin told journalists adding that neither the United State nor Ukraine provided radar or satellite data used as a basis for accusations against Donbas militias. ...

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Flight MH17 was shot down by Russia-made missle say prosecutors September 28, 2016 22:13 IST By Reuters Close Embed <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.in/tv/embed/41428" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine have rejected claims they were behind the downing of Malaysia Airline flight MH17 in July 2014. On 28 September, the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) looking into the incident claimed the Buk missile, which hit the plane in eastern Ukraine, was from Russia. The plane crashed in the pro-Russia rebel-held city of Donetsk. All 298 people on board of the 777 Boeing flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur died. Local rebels rejected the probe findings, according to news agency AFP. Russia already denied its involvement in the incident, claiming the findings were extremely political. Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation, Dutch chief investigator Wilbert Paulissen said in a news conference on 28 September. He added the missile launcher was later taken back to Russia. The report came months after investigators found a part of the Buk missile at the Ukraine crash site. A 2015 preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) into the crash had already ruled out technical faults or actions by the crew. It said the plane broke up in the air due to a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated it from the outside. Families of victims have asked Russian President Vladimir Putin £1bn in compensation for his failure to support the investigation.

Facts 2016-09-28T17:52+02:00 17:52 28.09.2016 Report on MH17 crash points to Russia's guilt The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that the report by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), unveiling the results of an inquiry into the causes of the crash of a Malaysian Boeing in Donbas in July 2014, points at Russia's direct involvement in the downing of the plane. "A new and extremely important element in today's report is the information on the route by which the weapon traveled from Russia to Ukraine and was taken back via part of the Ukrainian-Russian border, which was controlled only by Russians and their militants. This once again points to the aggressor state having been directly involved in the shooting down of the plane," the ministry said in a statement on the results of the investigation of the Joint Investigation Team into the downing of the MH17 plane in the skies over Donbas. "In the course of the criminal investigation, all other possible theories and causes of this horrible tragedy were examined and dismissed. This put an end to all Russian attempts to discredit the efforts by the Joint Investigation Team and the results of the inquiry through the dissemination of distorted or fabricated information," the ministry said. According to the report released by the JIT earlier on Wednesday, the Boeing was downed by a Buk surface-to-air rocket that had been brought to eastern Ukraine from Russia, and the attack itself was launched from an area in Donetsk region controlled by militants.

Malaysian Airlines plane was conducting a regular flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Communication with the Boeing was lost at 4 PM. At that time it was above separatist-occupied part of Donetsk region.The Russian proxies were happy - they thought the Ukrainian army plane was downed. Then-so-called defence minister of self-proclaimed Donetsk republic wrote about the crash on Facebook. He quickly removed the post when he realized: the crashed plane was an international civilian flight. 283 passengers and 15 crew members died. Russian media were the first to come to the scene of the disaster - and the war for truth began. Read more Russia blames Ukraine for falsifying evidence in MH17 case The militants immediately started to prowl like rabid hyinas around the crash area. They gathered the black boxes, liner wreckage and even personal belongings of passengers. Neither OSCE monitoring mission nor international experts were allowed at the scene during the first days. The first Ukrainian argument on who actually downed the MH17 was the intercepted conversation between terrorists. After the initial analysis of their own data, General Staff of Ukraine stated - the Malaysian Airlines plane was shot down with a missile from Buk complex, delivered from Russia. A day before the catastrophe this convoy drove through several towns and was filmed by the citizens. Read more MH17 investigation report: full version (with video) From the day of the tragedy and until now, Russia, who possessed the main evidence, taken by militants, said - Ukraine is responsible for the catastrophe. The first scenario included a Ukrainian jet, last week - the jet disappeared and Moscow turned to a new version. Only this time it was a Ukrainian one. Downing of the plane became a turning point in relations between Russia and the civilized world. Citizens of 18 countries were aboard that fatal plane. Each and every one of their relatives and friends  - not only demanded truth but also started their own investigations. All that Kremlin could do - was to hold the evidence and produce spurious theories. For example, the Buk downing was a 'Putin's assassination' attempt, or 'a special op inside the liner', or even the craziest version: the passengers and crew were already dead and they were placed in the plane on purpose. Read more Russian Defence Ministry presents new data proving the previous ones were a fake Nevertheless, most experts who conducted independent investigations said that the MH17 was shot by a Buk missile. BellingCat investigators - proved that Russia provided false satellite images to blame Ukraine. But the US experts, using their satellites, restored that day - minute by minute. Today's first official report of the international commission says that a missile was launched from the separatist-controlled territory of Ukraine, from Russian Buk with a crew, trained - again - in Russia. Ukrainian Buk complexes were too far away from the plane. The next step in this sad story - is organizing an international court, which Russia also opposes.

The Partners in Flight outreach programme, sponsored by Boeing, has been brought to Bury St Edmunds by Bury in Bloom in partnership with Suffolk County Council and Bury St Edmunds Town Council to celebrate the new B-17 sculpture on Mount Road. During the interactive sessions, run by a team from the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, participants build a scale model B-29 Superfortress, explore the history and engineering behind the craft as well as participate in a series of mini-experiments which investigate the principles of flight. The B-29 was one of America’s most iconic and revolutionary aircrafts of the Second World War and was so technologically advanced, it remained in service for many years afterwards. Workshops have so far been held at Moreton Hall Community Centre for Abbots Green Primary School and Serbert Wood Primary School today (Friday, September 23), with two remaining sessions arranged at the same location for the general public on tomorrow (Saturday, September 24), between 10.15am to 11.45am, and 1.30pm to 3pm. There is no need to book.

International prosecutors investigating the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014 say the Buk missile that hit the plane was from Russia. They also narrowed down the area it was fired from to a field in territory controlled by Russian-backed rebels. All 298 people on board the Boeing 777 died when it broke apart in mid-air flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Russia says the conclusions are “extremely political” and its Buk missiles “never shot down” the plane. “Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation,” chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen said in a news conference on Thursday. The missile launcher was later taken back to Russia, he said. The Joint Investigation Team showed a number of videos and audio recordings that they say proves the missile came from Russia. An inquiry by the Dutch Safety Board last year found that a Russian-made Buk missile hit the plane but did not say where it was fired from. But Russia has rejected the conclusions, calling them “extremely political”. “This is of course a provocative statement… it has nothing to do with investigating the tragedy that took away the lives of so many people,” said Leonid Slutsky, the head of the parliamentary committee for the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent State). “These conclusions seek to achieve only one objective – to further marginalise the image of Russia in the global political and information space,” he added. Who gave the order? Prosecutors have narrowed the missile launch site down to a specific field near the village of Pervomaiskyi, which was then in rebel hands. They established the identities of about 100 people “linked to the crash or the transport of the Buk” missile, but they are yet to determine who could be held criminally responsible. There is a need to establish who gave the order to move the missile launcher into eastern Ukraine, and where the order for it to be fired came from, investigators said. The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) consists of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine. Many witnesses Prosecutors played recordings from intercepted phone calls during their news conference. They said witnesses reported seeing the missile launcher move from Russia into Ukraine and presented pictures and videos. The launch site was pinpointed by “many witnesses”, prosecutors said. Russia’s changing story In the two years since MH17 was shot down, Russian officials have presented several theories about what happened. Relatives were briefed before the JIT released their preliminary findings. “They told us how the Buk was transported [and] how they came to that evidence from phone taps, photo, film material, video,” Robby Oehler, whose niece was killed in the crash, told the BBC. Separatist rebels have denied they were involved. “We never had such air defence systems, nor the people who could operate them,” Eduard Basurin, military deputy operational commander at the rebel Donetsk People’s Republic, told the Interfax news agency. “Therefore we could not have shot down the Boeing [flight MH17].” Earlier this week, Russia said it had radar data showing that the missile was not fired from rebel-held territory. The JIT does not yet have access to that data, prosecutors said. – By: BBC Ebenezer Afanyi-Dadzie More on citifmonline.com Indians offer kidneys to ailing minister November 18, 2016 Mozambique fuel tanker blast kills dozens November 18, 2016 Japan PM has ‘great confidence’ in Trump November 18, 2016 Protesters storm Brazil Congress seeking military rule November 17, 2016 I wanted to curl up – Clinton November 17, 2016 Mystery over Dutch WW2 shipwrecks vanished from Java Sea bed November 16, 2016 General News PNC to petition EOCO over dubious payments to Zoomlion November 18, 2016 Gov’t’s ‘restored allowance’ confusing – Trainee nurses November 18, 2016 Chief of Staff leads gov’t delegation to console Otumfuo [Photos] November 18, 2016 Man douses girlfriend in acid November 18, 2016 Court strikes out Martin Amidu’s ‘false claim’ against Mahama November 18, 2016 Advertisement Recent Posts PNC to petition EOCO over dubious payments to Zoomlion Gov’t’s ‘restored allowance’ confusing – Trainee nurses Vote for positive change – Greenstreet urges Ghanaians Chief of Staff leads gov’t delegation to console Otumfuo [Photos] Child marriage increases by 42% in Northern Ghana Man douses girlfriend in acid Court strikes out Martin Amidu’s ‘false claim’ against Mahama Indians offer kidneys to ailing minister Veep assures of massive jobs in health sector Retain NDC to move Ghana forward – Mahama Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2016 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

ADVERTISING INQUIRIES HERITAGE TRAVEL DIRECTORY PRIVACY POLICY Close Why was the Inchon Landing a Success? facebook twitter linkedin pinterest print By Mr. History 9/27/2016 • Ask Mr. History What are the reasons behind the success of the Inchon Landing despite the dissatisfaction within the UN troops and surprise & deception measures adopted by both the warring parties? Maj Bishwonath Timilsina Army War College Nepal Army   ???   Dear Major Timilsina, The success of General Douglas MacArthur’s landing at Inchon was fundamentally due to the overwhelming advantage United Nations forces held at sea and in the air, but as far as intelligence goes there were added reasons for it going as successfully as it did. When it came to deception, the North Korean People’s Army, buoyed by its earlier success at maintaining the initiative, was largely guilty of self-deception, committing itself primarily to one last five-pronged offensive designed to break through the Pusan Perimeter. This started on September 1, but thanks to Lt. Gen. Walton Walker’s brilliance at parrying each enemy thrust, had been stalemated at all points by September 15. Meanwhile, on September 5, Boeing B-29s of the U.S. Air Force had begun mass bombing roads and railroads around Kunsan, 113 miles south of Inchon, as if to isolate it in preparation for a landing—and on the following day UN naval forces began staging close to Kunsan. Further activity climaxed on the night of September 12-13, when U.S. special operations troops and Royal Marines, landed from the British frigate Whitesand Bay, landed at the Kunsan docks. While this was going on, Central Intelligence Agency members were infiltrating Inchon, gathering intelligence and stationing themselves to transmit it to the landing force. As a result of all these factors the North Koreans were inadequately prepared when UN forces bombarded the real landing zone on September 10 (including their minelaying, which did not present much problem for the naval forces) and when they landed on September 15, on top of which the commander on Wolmido island assured his superiors that his garrison could deal with the UN landings there (it didn’t). The overall upshot was an overwhelming victory that secured the area by September 19. Moreover, besides leading to the liberation of Seoul the presence of so many UN troops behind it just as UN forces around Pusan were taking the offensive caused a general rout in the NKPA. Only Chinese intervention late in October prevented complete collapse in North Korea.

World 10:55, 26 September 2016 REUTERS The Buk was transferred from Russia to the militant-controlled territory of Donbas and operated by the crew from Russia's 53rd Air Defense Missile Brigade. The experts also revealed almost the exact launch site – a large field near the town of Snizhne of Donetsk region. However, according to Bellingcat's coordinator Aric Toler, official investigators from the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) will be able to present more accurate data, Radio Liberty reports. Toler says that there may be new information, in particular, on the exact spot of the missile launch. The investigators could probe the soil and establish, in which part of the field the Buk was located. Read alsoJIT to present interim results of MH17 downing probe late SeptemberThey cannot blame Russia for the tragedy, but after the exact launch location and is identified in the area under the Russian-backed militants' control, any speculations of Ukraine's involvement in the tragedy will be removed. Bellingcat continues its own research, but the report has not been prepared yet, Toler said. According to the expert from Bellingcat, Russia is now pushing new bits of data coming from Almaz-Antey in order to "disrupt" the report of the Joint Investigation Team. The Russian side has kept the radar data for more than two years, and now they must explain why it was submitted so late. Read alsoMore MH17 docs released, Dutch govt. assumed Russian separatist to be responsibleAccording to Toler, Russia is releasing this information now in order to declare later that the JIT has not taken it into account. Most likely, radar images will be true and full, but the Buk missile won't be seen on them because of technical limitations. This opinion is shared by Ukrainian volunteer researchers from InformNapalm. Anton Pavlushko, the co-author of studies on the downed Boeing, recalled that two years ago, the Russian side had stated that they had no data, but now these data suddenly appeared. He also reminded that Russia still did not explain the lack of data on military radar station in Millerovo, where, according to the investigation by InformNapalm, the Buk missile system was located for some time.

ABC News Australia reports that travelers should check their trip status if they plan to fly in or out of the travel hub. Most travelers know storms, tornados, and other inclement weather can cause problems for air travel, but many probably haven't considered the disruption an active volcano can have on flight schedules. In Iceland, the volcanic landscape has wreaked havoc on travel in the past: The eruption of Eyjafjallajkull in 2010 caused closures of airspace over Europe and delayed thousands of flights. Active volcanoes can throw ash miles into the air, and though volcanic ash may seem relatively harmless from the ground, when aircrafts collide with it at hundreds of miles per hour it's an entirely different story. Severely Decreased Visibility Ash is heavy enough to make it incredibly hard to see out of a cockpit window. This is an expected condition of flying near an active volcano, but pilots are trained to fly in situations with little to no visibility with help from radars. Even so, flying into a giant column of ash is not something pilots do on purpose. Engine Clogging Consider this the second-worst thing that can happen when you're flying through ash. According to Boeing, if caught at the right (that is, wrong) time, the ash can pile up in the engines and cause equipment failures. Boeing has documented a number of these situations. Ash Can Melt Into Glass Popular Science has broken down the nightmarish thing that occurs when you put volcanic ash in a hot situation: When ash is introduced to extremely high temperaturesmuch like the environment of an airplane engineit melts into glass. When this happens to an airplane engine, the inside of the pylon (the part that holds the engine on the wing) can become encased in glass. After this happens, the cabin can fill with a sulfuric-smelling smoke. Travel Pulse recently shared the story of a British Airways plane stuck flying through a column of volcanic ash over Indonesia. That specific flight has since gone down in history for the longest glide by a non-purpose-built aircraft. How did they even manage that?

The board of Ryanair has voted to sell its shares in Irish rival Aer Lingus to IAG, Friday July 10, 2015, putting the British Airways parent solidly on course to acquire the former Irish national airline. (AP Photo/Shawn Pogatchnik, FILE) WINDSOR LOCKS, Conn. (WWLP) – Starting Wednesday, you will be able to fly directly from Bradley International Airport to Dublin, Ireland. Irish carrier Aer Lingus has been planning the daily direct flights since they made the announcement last year. Aer Lingus Boeing 757s will carry 12 business class and 165 economy class passengers to Ireland, along with some cargo, in six to seven-hour flights. If you are traveling to Ireland, however, you must take into account the time difference; they are five hours ahead of us. Passengers whose ultimate destination isn’t the Emerald Isle may connect from Dublin to about 28 other European cities. Wednesday’s first flight will be a big milestone for Bradley, which hasn’t hosted transatlantic flights since 2009, when service to Amsterdam was discontinued. The pricing for tickets from Bradley to Dublin is similar to flights leaving from Boston or New York; with booking a last-second ticket costing about $1,400. There are some benefits to flying out of Bradley, however. You will only have to go through customs in Dublin. Once you get off your return flight at Bradley, you can go home without waiting in line. The service to Ireland will also have economic benefits for western Massachusetts; bringing international travelers closer to our area. “The opportunities that we have here for jobs are increasing, so those connections to other countries are going to be ever increasing and more important as we build those connections for business,” said Rick Sullivan, President of the Western Massachusetts Economic Development Council. Currently, the only international flights operating out of Bradley travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. News 8’s sister station reporter David McKay will be on Wednesday’s first flight to Ireland.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Derek B. Miller: Utah lost Facebook but can still save face By Derek B. MillerFor the Deseret News Published: Sept. 28, 2016 12:10 a.m. Updated: Sept. 27, 2016 7:23 p.m. 5 Comments In case you missed it amidst the status updates, news feed, likes, photos and pokes, Facebook has made its long-awaited decision. The company that created modern social networking and connected the world in ways heretofore unknown will build its massive data center in New Mexico, not Utah. The project had the potential to bring up to $1.5 billion in capital investment to Utah and would have joined a long list of notable companies that have moved to the Beehive State, including Proctor & Gamble, Adobe, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing and many more. In the corporate recruitment world where success begets success and reputation matters, this loss has consequences. In the long run, there are lessons to be learned that if ignored will produce an even greater loss. The first lesson is it’s better to risk losing a recruitment project than to become the casualty of a bidding war of incentives between competing locations. Some decry the use of any incentives from state and local governments. There is no doubt that in an economist’s utopia, incentives would be unnecessary, but we don't live in that perfect world. The reality is states compete for the jobs and investment that come with corporate recruitment projects. In a free market, companies have choices on where to do business, and the resulting competition means states that want to attract jobs must produce a skilled workforce, stable business environment and high quality of life. This healthy competition goes off track when locations get into an incentives bidding war. We saw this beginning to happen when New Mexico sweetened an already enticing offer of 100 percent tax rebate with an additional $10 million subsidy. A state with strong "natural" incentives of well-educated employees, low taxes and reasonable regulations should not have to play that kind of game when recruiting companies. If a state wins every recruitment project, it is an indication that the financial incentives may be too rich. Losing a project now and then helps a state to be reflective and refine the incentives process. The second lesson is incentive parameters must be determined before negotiations begin. It is risky to try to figure out how far is too far during the heat of the moment, when emotions are heightened and the party sitting across the table can get the better of you. The Facebook recruitment clearly suffered from internal disagreement on how much incentive was acceptable. The city made an offer. The county disagreed. And the school board approved something in the middle. Having your internal negotiations play out in the public forum is not an effective way to win deals. For any company looking to relocate, no amount of financial incentive is ever enough. By nature the company will always want more. This is why it is important to have parameters set on your side of the table before you start negotiating. The third lesson is all partners must get and stay on the same page. There's no shame in losing a recruitment project when it becomes a "dialing for dollars" exercise and the company is simply searching for the highest bidder. Losing a project because of internal misunderstandings is a different matter, especially when it spills onto the front page of the paper. Elected and community leaders in Utah rightly tout our economic development “secret sauce” as our willingness to cooperate and ability to collaborate. Utah’s secret sauce has produced a long string of great results under the leadership of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, supported by the Economic Development Corporation of Utah, in coordination with local counties and cities. The Facebook project was an unfortunate loss but gratefully a rare exception. Learning from the loss will help ensure this exception does not become a pattern. Derek B. Miller is the president and CEO of the World Trade Center Utah. Previously he was chief of staff to Gov. Gary Herbert and managing director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 5 Comments Like that? Read this.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:10 PM, September 28, 2016 LONDON - Rolls-Royce <RR.L> boss Warren East has rebuilt confidence in the British engine-maker, but there are doubts among investors and industry experts about whether his slimmed-down group has the muscle to meet ambitious production and development goals. The CEO has axed more than 600 management jobs and sought to reduce production times and costs since taking the helm last July, as part of a drive to increase efficiency at a company traditionally viewed as a symbol of British engineering might. While wrestling with the restructuring, however, Rolls must almost double its output of wide-body plane engines by 2019 to meet orders. It must also replace the blades across hundreds of engines used in Dreamliners after some cracked, while designing two new jet engines, the Advance and UltraFan. A source in the company familiar with its strategy told Reuters that East's turnaround program was being felt across the business. It has eliminated 33 internal legal entities out of about 300, allowing it to cut down on back office support and internal transactions, the source said. There has also been progress on the factory floor, according to the source. At one plant in Washington, northeast England, he said Rolls had cut the time it takes to manufacture the fan and turbine discs used in its engines by 50 percent, by combining production processes and introducing robotics and faster inspection processes. East has also been shaking up the senior executive team tasked with turning around the aerospace and defense company, naming Daily Mail and General Trust's <DMGOa.L> Stephen Daintith as its new finance chief last week. The company also told Reuters that it has appointed mergers and acquisitions banker Ben Story as director of strategy and marketing and Neil Crockett, a former veteran of Cisco Systems Inc, as chief digital officer. His overhaul has buoyed the company's stock, along with the impact of the fall in the pound against the dollar after the Brexit vote, which makes Rolls engines cheaper for overseas buyers. Rolls-Royce shares are up 25 percent this year. But even some of its most supportive investors concede that, while the restructuring - which included axing a fifth of senior management jobs - might stand Rolls in good stead in the long term, it could pose problems over the next five years. "There are plenty of uncertainties out there. And if you focus on those, it could be a pretty bumpy ride," said senior portfolio manager Kave Sigaroudinia at Baillie Gifford, Rolls's fourth-biggest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. "You will get operational challenges, ramping up production can create operational problems," Sigaroudinia told Reuters. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce, which issued a string of profit warnings last year, said the company was focused on making the business simpler and more efficient. "We can continue to be focused on our transformation, even while we increase engine production and invest in the new technologies that will create the next generation of Rolls-Royce civil aerospace engines," he added. EXECUTION Analysts expressed deeper concerns about the company, whose shares trade at a price to earnings ratio of 27 for 2016, compared with a sector average of in the mid-teens. That comes despite an expected halving of profits this year and no recovery to 2015's profit level in sight for the next three years. Of 24 analysts covering the stock, only two rate it a "strong buy" or a "buy", while its current 711 pence share price trades well above the consensus 627 pence target price, according to Reuters data. "Rolls looks to be priced almost for a flawless execution," said Barclays analyst Phil Buller, who has an underweight rating on the stock with a target price of 480 pence. East, 54, is one of the most celebrated technology executives in Britain, having built ARM into the country's most successful tech company in the 12 years he was CEO. But flawless execution is particularly hard to come by in the aviation industry, where the giant nature of projects mean they are regularly subject to cost-overruns and delays. At the same time as almost doubling its wide-body jet engine output, Rolls is looking at squeezing more out of its Trent XWB engine for the Airbus A350 engine by enhancing it for a potential, bigger 400-seat model of the plane, as Airbus and Boeing play leapfrog in the market for twinjets. Any problem with the availability of parts - and there are over 20,000 in each Trent XWB - or issues with quality could delay the ramp up program. It is also developing a derivative of the Trent 1000 for another Airbus jet, the A330neo. That is on top of the new Advance and UltraFan engines for wide-body jets - to be ready for service in 2020 and 2025 respectively. "The CEO acknowledged that existing engineering resources are 'stretched' against this set of programs," Bernstein analysts said after East participated in their conference this month. "But he feels confident that better process management will enable Rolls-Royce to complete these on time without reverting to adding significant headcount or facing material cost overruns." SETBACKS The aerospace industry is full of examples of projects suffering setbacks, including the delays experienced by Boeing on its 787 Dreamliner, which entered service three years late, and Airbus on its A380 project, less than two years late. Most recently, U.S. aero-engine maker Pratt & Whitney <UTX.N> in September downgraded its 2016 delivery forecast for the engines which power the Airbus A320neo, a miss which it said would put pressure on its cash flow. A problem on one of Rolls's flagship Trent 1000 engines, used to power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is testament to what can go wrong. ANA Holdings Inc <9202.T>, Japan's largest airline, said in August that all 100 Rolls-Royce engines on its Dreamliner fleet would need modifying following three engine failures caused by corrosion and cracking of turbine blades. Now, Rolls-Royce must set about replacing blades across all its Trent 1000s, of which there are hundreds. Boeing says that of the 445 Dreamliners in operation worldwide, about 40 percent use the Rolls-Royce engines. On top of all the other production and development challenges facing Rolls, this left the company looking like its hands were full, according to an industry source. "Boeing is likely to be asking Rolls-Royce some questions about how intensely they are going to be focused on supporting the 787 issue," the source said. Any slip-ups may make it harder to convince Boeing it has the capacity to take part in the U.S. planemaker's next likely project: a mid-market jet requiring a new engine that could cost $5 billion to $6 billion to develop. GE and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to compete for the mid-market project. For investors like Baillie Gifford, and U.S. activist investor ValueAct, which took a stake in Rolls last year based on what it sees from 2020 onwards, the company's long-term outlook holds potential. "We always take it back to the long-term view, what we have seen over the last six months is incrementally positive news," said Baillie Gifford's Sigaroudinia. "You can have a stab at what it is going to look like in 10-15 years time because these programs are so long term, and that is where our bold case comes from." Some other shareholders are more cautious. Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management – which holds a 0.3 percent position in Rolls in its passively managed funds - said the concrete results of East's work were a long way off. "East is very well respected, but it remains to be seen if his turnaround plans can improve the transparency and predictability of the company."

His overhaul has buoyed the company’s stock, along with the impact of the fall in the pound against the dollar after the Brexit vote, which makes Rolls engines cheaper for overseas buyers. Rolls-Royce shares are up 25 percent this year. But even some of its most supportive investors concede that, while the restructuring – which included axing a fifth of senior management jobs – might stand Rolls in good stead in the long term, it could pose problems over the next five years. “There are plenty of uncertainties out there. And if you focus on those, it could be a pretty bumpy ride,” said senior portfolio manager Kave Sigaroudinia at Baillie Gifford, Rolls’s fourth-biggest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. “You will get operational challenges, ramping up production can create operational problems,” Sigaroudinia told Reuters. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce, which issued a string of profit warnings last year, said the company was focused on making the business simpler and more efficient. “We can continue to be focused on our transformation, even while we increase engine production and invest in the new technologies that will create the next generation of Rolls-Royce civil aerospace engines,” he added. EXECUTION Analysts expressed deeper concerns about the company, whose shares trade at a price to earnings ratio of 27 for 2016, compared with a sector average of in the mid-teens. That comes despite an expected halving of profits this year and no recovery to 2015’s profit level in sight for the next three years. Of 24 analysts covering the stock, only two rate it a “strong buy” or a “buy”, while its current 711 pence share price trades well above the consensus 627 pence target price, according to Reuters data. “Rolls looks to be priced almost for a flawless execution,” said Barclays analyst Phil Buller, who has an underweight rating on the stock with a target price of 480 pence. East, 54, is one of the most celebrated technology executives in Britain, having built ARM into the country’s most successful tech company in the 12 years he was CEO. But flawless execution is particularly hard to come by in the aviation industry, where the giant nature of projects mean they are regularly subject to cost-overruns and delays. At the same time as almost doubling its wide-body jet engine output, Rolls is looking at squeezing more out of its Trent XWB engine for the Airbus A350 engine by enhancing it for a potential, bigger 400-seat model of the plane, as Airbus and Boeing play leapfrog in the market for twinjets. Any problem with the availability of parts – and there are over 20,000 in each Trent XWB – or issues with quality could delay the ramp up programme. It is also developing a derivative of the Trent 1000 for another Airbus jet, the A330neo. That is on top of the new Advance and UltraFan engines for wide-body jets – to be ready for service in 2020 and 2025 respectively. “The CEO acknowledged that existing engineering resources are ‘stretched’ against this set of programmes,” Bernstein analysts said after East participated in their conference this month. “But he feels confident that better process management will enable Rolls-Royce to complete these on time without reverting to adding significant headcount or facing material cost overruns.” SETBACKS The aerospace industry is full of examples of projects suffering setbacks, including the delays experienced by Boeing on its 787 Dreamliner, which entered service three years late, and Airbus on its A380 project, less than two years late. Most recently, U.S. aero-engine maker Pratt & Whitney in September downgraded its 2016 delivery forecast for the engines which power the Airbus A320neo, a miss which it said would put pressure on its cash flow. A problem on one of Rolls’s flagship Trent 1000 engines, used to power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is testament to what can go wrong. ANA Holdings Inc, Japan’s largest airline, said in August that all 100 Rolls-Royce engines on its Dreamliner fleet would need modifying following three engine failures caused by corrosion and cracking of turbine blades. Now, Rolls-Royce must set about replacing blades across all its Trent 1000s, of which there are hundreds. Boeing says that of the 445 Dreamliners in operation worldwide, about 40 percent use the Rolls-Royce engines. On top of all the other production and development challenges facing Rolls, this left the company looking like its hands were full, according to an industry source. “Boeing is likely to be asking Rolls-Royce some questions about how intensely they are going to be focused on supporting the 787 issue,” the source said. Any slip-ups may make it harder to convince Boeing it has the capacity to take part in the U.S. planemaker’s next likely project: a mid-market jet requiring a new engine that could cost $5 billion to $6 billion to develop. GE and Pratt & Whitney are also expected to compete for the mid-market project. For investors like Baillie Gifford, and U.S. activist investor ValueAct, which took a stake in Rolls last year based on what it sees from 2020 onwards, the company’s long-term outlook holds potential. “We always take it back to the long-term view, what we have seen over the last six months is incrementally positive news,” said Baillie Gifford’s Sigaroudinia. “You can have a stab at what it is going to look like in 10-15 years time because these programmes are so long term, and that is where our bold case comes from.” Some other shareholders are more cautious. Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management – which holds a 0.3 percent position in Rolls in its passively managed funds – said the concrete results of East’s work were a long way off. “East is very well respected, but it remains to be seen if his turnaround plans can improve the transparency and predictability of the company.” (Reuters) Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags British engine-maker investors market Ro Rolls-Royce Warren East Previous Football stadium land ‘lost to unpaid debts’ Next MTN denies illegal transfer of $14 billion from Nigeria Related Articles OPEC moves closer to oil output deal as Iran gets new offer November 18, 2016 Pacific rim leaders to debate future of trade post-Trump November 18, 2016 Russia’s battle for Eurobond went to the brink November 18, 2016 China SUV wars to heat up; VW unveils new models November 18, 2016 Volkswagen to cut 30,000 jobs at VW brand by 2021 November 18, 2016 UK Retail sales show strongest rise since 2002 November 17, 2016 Europe car sales drop November 17, 2016 Roche, Bristol-Myers cut cancer drug prices to win UK approval November 17, 2016 Asian markets mixed as US rally fades November 17, 2016 Check Also Siamese fighting fish sold in record auction A Siamese fighting fish with colors resembling the Thai national flag has been bought for a record breaking 53,500 baht ($1,530) at an online auction, making it the most expensive Betta fish to ever be sold.

The CEO has axed more than 600 management jobs and sought to reduce production times and costs since taking the helm last July, as part of a drive to increase efficiency at a company traditionally viewed as a symbol of British engineering might. While wrestling with the restructuring, however, Rolls must almost double its output of wide-body plane engines by 2019 to meet orders. It must also replace the blades across hundreds of engines used in Dreamliners after some cracked, while designing two new jet engines, the Advance and UltraFan. A source in the company familiar with its strategy told Reuters that East's turnaround programme was being felt across the business. It has eliminated 33 internal legal entities out of about 300, allowing it to cut down on back office support and internal transactions, the source said. There has also been progress on the factory floor, according to the source. At one plant in Washington, northeast England, he said Rolls had cut the time it takes to manufacture the fan and turbine discs used in its engines by 50 percent, by combining production processes and introducing robotics and faster inspection processes. East has also been shaking up the senior executive team tasked with turning around the aerospace and defence company, naming Daily Mail and General Trust's Stephen Daintith as its new finance chief last week. The company also told Reuters that it has appointed mergers and acquisitions banker Ben Story as director of strategy and marketing and Neil Crockett, a former veteran of Cisco Systems Inc, as chief digital officer.

Trade groups representing United Continental, Boeing and other industry leaders are pushing nations to join the agreement, which would require companies to offset their emissions growth by funding environmental initiatives. The accord, being brokered in Montreal during 11 days of talks beginning Tuesday, would be the first global climate pact targeting a single industry. Exhaust from international flights accounts for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gases, yet was largely omitted from the Paris accord on climate change last year because delegates feared divvying up responsibility for global routes could derail the broader deal. With aviation emissions forecast to triple by 2050, airlines believe that regional or global regulation is inevitable. If their pollution must be controlled, airlines would prefer a single international standard, saying it would be far cheaper and easier than following a patchwork of local programs. "We recognize that as an industry, we have an impact on climate change," said Michael Gill, executive director of the Air Transport Action Group, which represents airlines, engine makers, airports and pilots. "The industry is willing to pay its share. We just want to pay our share in the most economic way possible." Deal wouldn't force airlines to cut pollution To be clear, the 15-year agreement would not force airlines to cut their pollution. Instead, companies would compensate for any emissions growth after the accord begins in 2020 by buying credits that back renewable energy development, forest preservation or other environmental endeavors. Airlines estimate the annual industrywide cost may be as much as $23.9 billion by 2035, or 1.8 percent of projected revenue. If the U.N.-sponsored deal fails, companies run the risk of facing even costlier regulation if Europe or others push ahead with regional plans. Environmentalists also are pushing for the deal in Montreal, saying it's an important first step that can be improved over time. Yet they criticize the current proposal for relying on voluntary participation during the first six years. And they say the low cost of environmental offsets could let companies off easy. "It's peanuts," said Bill Hemmings, of the Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment. "It gets them off the hook. Without enforced safeguards, it's a massive green-washing exercise."

Well, now I’ve heard everything! Joe Bob Briggs over at Takimag claims as much, in his most recent (and most startling) column. North Carolina governor Pat McCroy, Briggs says, is deliberately bleeding his state dry by backing a controversial law that forces residents to use public restrooms in accordance with the sex assigned on their birth certificate. Gov. McCroy’s intransigence has teed off many companies who now refuse to do business in the Tar Heel State. Paypal, Bruce Springsteen, Deutsche Bank, and many others are slashing their commercial ties, either by boycott or reduced investment. The real kicker is the NCAA pulling its All-Star Game out of Charlotte. The move is expected to cost the state millions. “Basketball is the religion of North Carolina,” Briggs writes, and this will have long-lasting effects on one of the state’s prime industries.  So what’s his fix? Briggs wants a “Southern Female intervention” for McCroy, preferably led by his grandmother. If only an Aunt Bea-like figure would give the governor a good talking to, he would come to his senses and stanch the economic fallout. Then Michael Jordan can finally show that his state isn’t full of bigots -- a goal all respectable people aspire to. For Briggs, the whole bathroom-use issue is trite and unnecessary. It’s causing the state to hemorrhage billions, all in the name of an outdated view of biology. Better to cut the losses and genuflect before Mammon, he maintains. I dissent, courteously. The reason why should be obvious to anyone sick of liberals routing conservatives on the cultural battlefield. Admittedly, I don’t have much of a dog in this fight. I’m not from the South. I’m a Yankee, living in Raytheon and Boeing county, Virginia. The economic loss North Carolina is seeing doesn’t affect me. So if Mr. Briggs wants to dismiss my criticism because my skin isn’t quite in the game, that’s fair. He would be wrong, however, to not heed my words. The sex-obsessed Left already collected one scalp in a similar fight. Last year, the Indiana legislature passed a law -- the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- protecting the right of religious business owners to deny serving same-sex couples if doing so violated their conscience. The bill was signed into law by Governor (now vice-president nominee) Mike Pence, commencing a national outcry. What followed is a pattern of behavior similar to what’s being witnessed in North Carolina. Big business and the media teamed up to discredit the law. Gay rights activists successfully made themselves out to be on the side of righteousness, while other side was condemned as backwards, bigoted cave folk. Gov. Pence eventually relented, signing a bill that gutted the original law, rendering it meaningless. In backing down, he showed that business could be profitable by taking up the cause of sexual rights. “What this means is that today’s cultural power elite is entirely aligned with the economic power elite,” Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen wrote at the time, “and they’re ready to steamroll anyone in their way.” Unlike other Republican pols in his position, Pat McCroy has refused to be steamrolled. He has demonstrated that he has, as Thoreau wrote, “a bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through!” His refusal to give in to popular clamor, it seems, is no longer about upholding the law. It has become a fight to end the Left’s hubristic campaign of shutting down traditionalists via economic sanctions. And on that principle alone, Gov. McCroy should be supported. Briggs’s concern isn’t just on his wallet, though. He treats transgenderism like it’s old hat, pointing out that sex-change operations have been going on for decades. Moreover, he dismisses the fear that allowing men believing they are women to share the restroom with actual women is dangerous. Well, let’s take a look at the headlines to see if such a fear is unwarranted. A quick Google search pulled up the following: men undressing in women’s locker rooms in Seattle; a Toronto man jailed for sexually assaulting women in a shelter after claiming to be transgendered; a Virginia man arrested for filming and peeing on a 5-year-old in a girl’s bathroom; the University of Toronto ending its gender-neutral bathroom policy after two voyeurs were caught filming girls in the shower; two men in Texas busted for recording women in a Target restroom. Do these sound like instances of unsubstantiated worry? Is it really unreasonable for fathers to worry about their daughters going into restrooms that any penis-possessing male can waltz into carefree? As for transgenderism being a benign thing, as Briggs implies, that couldn’t be more wrong. A recent study co-written by Paul R. McHugh of the John Hopkins University School of Medicine and published in The New Atlantis refutes the narrative that perceived gender mismatch is harmless. Not only do transgendered individuals have a high suicide rate, they experience high levels of “social stress” and are often times the victim of sexual trauma. Andy Taylor wouldn’t personally escort Mayberry’s trans population into the bathroom of their choice. He’d protect the community by forcing them to get treated for gender dysphoria. He would understand that embracing disturbed delusions helps nobody. Still, Briggs is right on one point: McCroy’s crusade is likely to fail. Cultural conservatives have been beaten back on every stand they’ve taken in the past three decades. Their record is worse than Charlie Brown kicking the football -- liberal elites won’t even deign to set the ball for us anymore. Instead, their strategy is to peg us in the groin until total surrender. The Right has lost the Culture War. But that doesn’t mean traditionalists should just give up. As Aunt Emily said in Walker Percy’s The Moviegoer, “In this world goodness is destined to be defeated. But a man must go down fighting. That is the victory. To do anything less is to be less than a man.” Now that’s some real southern womanly advice. Allowing the Left to easily chalk up another victory without resistance only emboldens them. So keep fighting the good fight, Governor McCroy. We -- meaning any right-thinking, God-fearing Americans who don’t believe in loony leftist private-parts philosophy -- have your back.

Arcan Cetin, 20, is charged with five counts of first-degree premeditated murder after a shooting at the Cascade Mall in Burlington. He has a criminal record dating back at least two years and was charged in 2015 with assaulting his stepfather. Police said Cetin opened fire late Friday in a Macy's department store, instantly killing three women and a teenage girl and critically wounding a man who died hours later. The victims ranged in age from a 16-year-old girl to a woman in her 90s and included a probation officer and a Boeing maintenance worker. Records obtained by NBC station KING5 showed a Washington state mental health facility last year tried to have Cetin involuntarily committed. In documents filed with probation officers, a doctor checked a box indicating he was worried Cetin would harm himself, the station reported.

"We're torn up. we're hurt," David Marshall told reporters Monday as he comforted his wife. "Arcan has had mental health issues that we have been trying to work on him with. That's all I can say." Cetin was held in lieu of $2 million bail at a court appearance Monday, his first since the massacre Friday. Many in the crowded courtroom were wearing purple and blue in memory of 16-year-old murder victim Sarai Lara, NBC station KING of Seattle reported.

"God got another angel." Much of the shooting was caught on surveillance video. Cetin, who lives in Oak Harbor, entered the mall through "the Chuck E. Cheese entrance" and scoped out the Macy's in the mall, the warrant states. Then he went back to his car and drove it closer to the west entrance of the Macy's, where women's clothing is sold. "He was inside the store for approximately one minute," according to the warrant. "During that time, the suspect initially shot the juvenile victim near some clothing racks, and then walked through the store toward the cosmetics counter. He encountered and shot the adult male victim, then shot three adult female victims." When he was done, the warrant states, Cetin "placed the rifle that he used on top of the cosmetics counter, exited Macy's women's store through the west entrance, got into vehicle and then left the store."

Cetin is a permanent legal U.S. resident who came from Turkey, a country on the border of war-torn Syria that has been fighting Kurdish rebels for years. When asked Sunday whether they could rule out terrorism as a motive, Mount Vernon police Lt. Chris Cammock said no. But the warrant doesn't mention any possible terrorist links.

Cetin said his father bought him a laptop and his mother visited him regularly at his new apartment. Social media accounts apparently belonging to Cetin included a mixture of selfies — including a picture in which he is holding a gun in his bedroom — and posts about serial killers and ISIS. A former high school contemporary described the suspected shooter as "that kid who wasn't afraid to say something offensive or vulgar." Austin Hendrix, 19, told the Seattle Times: "In high school he started harassing kids and not being a nice person, so I disassociated with him. He would grope women in high school and middle school."

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio September 27, 2016 Lawmakers balk at replacing aging EC-130Hs with smaller Gulfstream G550s without open competition. Last year, the U.S. Air Force tried to retire most of its EC-130 Compass Call spy planes, worn from years of flying over Iraq and Afghanistan. Now service officials say replacements are needed urgently — so urgently that they must write a no-bid contract for 10 aircraft whose price tag could top $1.6 billion. Not so fast, says Congress. “[T]he Air Force’s proposal to recapitalize the EC-130H Compass Call aircraft using a sole source purchase of ten business class aircraft would not give us any confidence that the Air Force is achieving the maximum value for the American taxpayer,” reads a Senate Armed Services Committee report on the 2017 defense authorization bill. Built in the 1980s, the 14 Compass Call aircraft are Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes packed with special computer equipment and a spiderweb-like antenna that allows the crew to eavesdrop on and attack enemy communications. The planes have been heavily used in the post-9/11 counterinsurgency campaigns. Subscribe Receive daily email updates: Subscribe to the Defense One daily. Be the first to receive updates. But instead of replacing the Compass Calls with new C-130s, the Air Force wants to take a different approach: installing the special electronics on a Gulfstream G550 business jet, according to Pentagon sources and congressional documents. The service would call this new spy plane the EC-37B. It’s unclear whether the EC-130’s 13-member crew and electronic suite would fit inside the smaller Gulfstream. But more immediately disturbing to lawmakers is the Air Force’s plan to offer a no-bid, sole-source contract to an EC-37B team that includes Gulfstream, which makes the jets, and BAE Systems, which handles the electronic gear. Air Force officials told lawmakers that the Gulfstream is the “only option that does not require development and/or certification work,” according to a House report on the 2017 defense authorization bill. Officials also said the shift from C-130 to G550 is driven by unspecified foreign threats, and the increased cost of maintaining old aircraft. “The threat has evolved and we need to get started to be able to provide that capability, which is critical to the combatant commanders,” Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, the Air Force’s military deputy for acquisition, said at an Air Force Association conference outside Washington last week. “We actually have letters of support from two of the combatant commanders showing how critical this capability is, and we need to do it expeditiously.” The Air Force has asked Congress for $165.7 million to buy and convert a Gulfstream G550 into a Compass Call starting in 2017. (The service already has a small fleet of G550 business jets to fly senior Pentagon officials around the globe.) The request was not included in the Air Force’s 2017 budget request to Congress in February, but was submitted to lawmakers separately in a “technical adjustment” letter, according to a House report. A new, unmodified Gulfstream G550 costs just over $61 million, according to Aviation Week, which means the 10-aircraft purchase would send more than $600 million to Gulfstream, the business jet arm of General Dynamics. Gulfstream has built special intelligence versions of the G550 for foreign governments, including Israel. Even more money, about $100 million per plane, would go to BAE Systems, which would install specialized electronics equipment designed for the C-130 into the smaller Gulfstream. General Dynamics is “aggressively lobbying” for about 14 new EC-37B aircraft to extend G550 production, defense consultant Jim McAleese wrote in an Aug. 24 note to investors. Some lawmakers, as well as officials with competing defense companies, say that buying Gulfstream G550 aircraft through a no-bid contract will prejudice future competitions. The Air Force is looking to modernize other fleets of intelligence planes, based on Boeing 707 jetliners built in the 1960s and 1970s. “[A]llowing this sole source award to proceed could potentially prejudice source selections for other Air Force recapitalization programs, such as the program to replace the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft,” the Senate report reads. Northrop Grumman, which made the current E-8C JSTARS planes, is working with Gulfstream to offer a new JSTARS aircraft based on a G550. Boeing has offered a larger 737 and Lockheed Martin has teamed up with business jet-maker Bombardier. At the Air Force Association conference last week, Boeing showed off a model of its Compass Call version of the 737 commercial jetliner. Company executives point out that a G550 cannot refuel in flight, as do the EC-130H and the P-8, a submarine-hunting 737 flown by the Navy. Some experts argue the Air Force needs a comprehensive plan to buy new intelligence planes — like the RC-135 Rivet Joint and E-3 AWACS — before rushing to start the Compass Call shift to a Gulfstream. Despite its purported urgency, the Air Force plan would implement the Compass Call replacement much more slowly than projects of similar importance. The Air Force wants to buy one new G550 from Gulfstream annually for a decade, using money currently slated for EC-130H maintenance and upgrades, Bunch said. When the Air Force has an urgent operational need, it typically works to buy equipment through a secretive acquisition office known as Big Safari. When the service raced to get a fleet of small intelligence planes into battle in 2008, Big Safari purchased a handful of used and new King Air 350 turboprops. The planes reached the battlefield in less than a year, a remarkable feat for a Pentagon acquisition system that sometimes takes decades. “Almost any time that you can do a competition, we really think that the military ends up getting better weapon systems,” Mandy Smithberger, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project On Government Oversight, said of the Compass Call plan. “We always think that you have to be very cautious when you’re going to waive those kinds of requirements, particularly it’s not very expeditious to fulfill the requirement over 10 years.” This isn’t the first time the Air Force has taken fire for looking to no-bid contracts in an attempt to circumvent the slow Pentagon acquisition process. In 2010, it wanted to buy 93 Black Hawk helicopters, valued at about $1 billion from Sikorsky to replace old UH-1 Huey helicopters that patrol far-flung ICBM bases. The move was eventually quashed in favor of competition, but the Air Force has yet to buy new helicopters. For now, the Compass Call project is in a holding pattern, as the Air Force waits for lawmakers in the House and Senate to iron out a unified version of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. Bunch said the Air Force is waiting for lawmakers to provide direction before proceeding. “What I really want as the military acquisition individual is give me the max flexibility that I can to use the acquisition authorities that we have whether that is full-and-open competition or that is less-than full-and-open competition so that we can do this in an expeditious manner,” Bunch said. The Senate version of the authorization bill restricts funding for the effort while the House version encourage the Air Force speed up plans to shift to the Gulfstream aircraft. The White House has backed the Air Force plan, arguing that the “Air Force requires the flexibility to employ appropriate contracting authorities as allowed by law, including the exemptions to full and open competition in order to efficiently and effectively execute” the shift to move from the EC-130H to the EC-37B.

(WWLP) – Starting Wednesday, you will be able to fly directly from Bradley International Airport to Dublin, Ireland. Irish carrier Aer Lingus has been planning the daily direct flights since they made the announcement last year. Aer Lingus Boeing 757s will carry 12 business class and 165 economy class passengers to Ireland, along with some cargo, in six to seven-hour flights. If you are traveling to Ireland, however, you must take into account the time difference; they are five hours ahead of us. Passengers whose ultimate destination isn’t the Emerald Isle may connect from Dublin to about 28 other European cities. Wednesday’s first flight will be a big milestone for Bradley, which hasn’t hosted transatlantic flights since 2009, when service to Amsterdam was discontinued. Aer Lingus to begin direct flights from Bradley to Dublin The pricing for tickets from Bradley to Dublin is similar to flights leaving from Boston or New York; with booking a last-second ticket costing about $1,400. There are some benefits to flying out of Bradley, however. You will only have to go through customs in Dublin. Once you get off your return flight at Bradley, you can go home without waiting in line. The service to Ireland will also have economic benefits for western Massachusetts; bringing international travelers closer to our area. “The opportunities that we have here for jobs are increasing, so those connections to other countries are going to be ever increasing and more important as we build those connections for business,” said Rick Sullivan, President of the Western Massachusetts Economic Development Council. Currently, the only international flights operating out of Bradley travel to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. 22News reporter David McKay will be on Wednesday’s first flight to Ireland. Over the next several days, he will have a look at who is going to be using these flights, and where they will be going once they are in Ireland.

This research report titled 'Global Aeroderivative Gas Turbine Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This report also covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global aeroderivative gas turbine market. Increasing demand for aeroderivative gas turbines from the aerospace and marine sectors as well as the replacement of coal-fired power plants by natural gas-based gas turbine power plants are contributing to the growth of the market. Heavy investments to continuously improve the efficiency and durability of gas turbines are also contributing to the market growth. Manufacturers are focusing on developing high-efficiency gas turbines by decreasing fuel costs. These costs account for a major portion of the overall operation cost, as well as the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of gas turbines, to make the most on the growing trend of natural gas-based power generation. Anju Ajaykumar, a lead analyst at Technavio, specializing in tools and components research, says, "Increase in demand for commercial aircraft, particularly from APAC, due to rising air passenger traffic will contribute to the upsurge in demand for aeroderivative gas turbines. The US and Europe-based commercial aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing and Airbus, are expected to benefit from the increasing demand from APAC."

Based on end user, the report categorizes the global aeroderivative gas turbine market into the following segments: Mobility Power generation Oil and gas Others Global aeroderivative gas turbine market by end-user 2015 (% share) Mobility 39.09% Power generation 29.21% Oil and gas 27.18% Others 4.52% Source: Technavio The top three end-user segments for the global aeroderivative gas turbine market are as follows: Mobility sector The mobility segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.10% during the forecast period. The mobility segment primarily consists of aeronautic and marine applications of gas turbines, and is considered to be the major end-user segment in the market. This development is attributed to the significant rise in demand for air travel, resulting in the addition of aviation fleets worldwide, corresponding to growth levels of about 5%. The naval applications of aeroderivative gas turbines are expected to be dominated by GE's LM2500 gas turbine, an aero derivative of the CF6 prominent for commercial transport aircraft, in terms of production value. During 2016-2029, it is projected that GE will build 267 LM2500s for naval ships. GE is expected to be followed by Rolls-Royce with a market share of approximately 46% during the forecast period. Rolls-Royce's high efficiency MT30 gas turbine competes neck to neck against the LM2500 in power class. The turbine has been also evaluated by the U.S. Navy to power the DDG 51 Arleigh Burke class Destroyers. Power generation The power generation segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.2% during the forecast period. "With rising demand for global power and cleaner solutions, aeroderivative gas turbines are increasingly being used for power generation. APAC countries such as China and India should significantly contribute to the growth of the segment with a large number of ongoing power generation projects in these regions," adds Anju One of the most important factors impacting the growth of this market is the cost of power generation across different regions. Fuel cost plays a vital role in determining generation cost. Natural gas is the primary fuel used in aeroderivative gas turbines. Another important factor impacting the segment is the CO2 emission allowance price. The shift of power generation from coal-based power plants to natural gas-fired gas turbine power plants is highly viable with the CO2 emission allowance priced at 28 pounds/ton CO2. Oil and gas sector The oil and gas segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.40% during the forecast period. The oil and gas industry, including all segments of the value chain, such as the upstream, midstream, and downstream, uses gas turbines for power generation. The midstream and downstream segments are likely to drive the global gas turbine market in the coming years. In the upstream segment, gas turbines have been historically used in areas of high-volume gas production. Production facilities in the Middle East and North America, which usually have a basic gas processing plant, rely on gas turbine-driven captive power plants to power equipment. The midstream segment has seen the most significant growth in the use of gas turbines in the oil and gas sector. The emergence of natural gas pipelines for the provision of energy security has ushered an era of cross-country and multi-country pipelines. The downstream segment has used gas turbines for decades and the association is projected to grow. Power requirements of refineries of any magnitude are extensive. The most critical aspect of this power demand is the necessity for reliable power, as refineries have critical hot oil and steam systems that require uninterruptible power.

S7 Group, the owner of Russia’s S7 Airlines, agreed to buy the floating rocket platform Sea Launch from a group of investors and aims to restore its operations after a more than two-year hiatus, the family-owned company said. S7 Group co-founder Vladislav Filev described the deal as an “admission ticket” into the aerospace industry. Vladislav Filev in Moscow. Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg “Why are we doing it? Just because it’s beautiful,” Filev said in an interview in Moscow before heading to Guadalajara, Mexico, to sign the deal. S7 faces significant challenges in trying to revive Sea Launch, which was created by Russian, Ukrainian, Norwegian companies and Boeing Co. of the U.S. in 1995. Its operations were suspended in 2014 amid Russia’s conflict with Ukraine, which supplied Zenith rockets to the project. The business remains prone to accidents like a recent SpaceX explosion. Chapter 11 Sea Launch Co., which operated the project, filed for Chapter 11 U.S. bankruptcy protection in 2009, two years after one of its rockets blew up. When it emerged in 2010 its assets were transferred to new entities under the control of RSC Energia, an aerospace company whose biggest shareholder is the Russian government. Boeing no longer has a stake and has sued Energia and its Ukrainian former partner, seeking $356 million that the U.S. aerospace company says it is owed, according to a regulatory filing. Filev didn’t provide a value for the transaction to acquire the Sea Launch brand and assets from investors linked to RSC Energia. Two people familiar with situation, who declined to be identified as the information is not public, said the price is about $100 million. The project may also require additional investment, including building a new rocket if Ukraine won’t restore the supply, Filev said. S7 Group has no debt and will pay cash, Filev said. The company is controlled by Filev’s family and generated revenue of more than $1.3 billion last year. The airline operates 66 Boeing and Airbus Group SE jets and serves 145 routes in 27 countries. When talk of a possible deal for Sea Launch surfaced over the summer, news reports in Russia compared Filev, 53, to SpaceX and Tesla Motors Inc. founder Musk. Filev, who has been in the aviation business for more than two decades, aims to join a group of entrepreneurs, including Musk and Blue Origin and Amazon.com Inc. founder Bezos, who are driving investment in the space business. Russia Sanctions Filev said economic sanctions against Russia, which have contributed to a weak ruble, could help Sea Launch in its quest for profitability. “I think we will be highly competitive, as 80 percent of the costs are in rubles,” he said. S7 signed the contract with Energia on Tuesday, ensuring that it will help to re-start the project, Russian airline said in the statement. The agreement also cover development of the transport infrastructure in space, it said. Energia’s CEO Vladimir Solntsev said that S7 may invest $150 million into the project and that he is sure that it will be successful, Tass newswires reported from the press conference in Guadalajara. The deal on Sea Launch is subject to approval from the U.S. State Department because the launches have been operated from a command point in Los Angeles. A review could take six to nine months, Filev said. After that S7 Group will need about 18 months to restart launches, he said, though that could take longer if S7 needs to build its own rocket. Sea Launch sent nearly three-dozen rockets into space from 1999 through 2014, using a Pacific Ocean platform near the equator. It will be able to handle 50 to 70 launches in the next 15 years without modernization, Filev said. “There is a multi-year waiting list for launches, so we believe that our service will be in demand,” Filev said, adding that he would devote most of his time to Sea Launch.

But he doesn’t have the money to get to Mars alone. So today he must either announce a substantial financial partner or woo one, in the face of a very recent SpaceX rocket explosion. There's one agency Musk needs to win over, and it already has its own Mars plans Ambitious space projects are glamorous, but this event isn’t really for you and me. (We are useful only insofar as we provide politicians with evidence of public enthusiasm.) This isn’t a phone, or a new app, or new headphones — it’s not a consumer product at all. Rockets are far too expensive; space colonies are more expensive still. If Musk doesn’t announce financial backing, it means the presentation is meant to convince someone — probably NASA — to fund him. But this is an extraordinarily awkward time to try to win over money, since one of his rockets blew up earlier this month. Musk’s SpaceX has relied on being a low-cost, reliable alternative to other aerospace companies, like the United Launch Alliance. SpaceX’s biggest customer is NASA, and the company is set to shuttle astronauts to the ISS in late 2017 or early 2018. But here’s the rub: Musk is announcing his Mars plans well before he’s successfully launched a single human being to space, and immediately in the wake of a launch-pad accident. He has an unnervingly ambitious schedule for the first human mission to Mars, he’s said nothing about how much it will cost or who’s paying, and there’s been no mention of any partnerships with space agencies or suppliers for material. The goal of Musk’s speech today, then, is to show current and future customers — especially NASA — that he’s for real. It may also be to woo potential partners for a Mars mission. Neither ESA nor Roscosmos have hinted at any Mars interest, though it’s theoretically possible one or both agencies might decide on a collaborative mission. But their budgets are a fraction the size of NASA’s. So absent any funding announcement today, there’s one agency that Musk needs to win over, and it already has its own Mars plans. Musk has already announced an ambitious schedule that he almost certainly won’t stick to, in order to create the political pressure needed to force NASA’s funding. Without NASA or some other deep-pocketed benefactor, he’s sunk. There are three things he must show in his presentation: that he can meet deadlines; that his rockets are reliable; and that Mars, not the Moon, should be our goal. NASA/JPL-Caltech Deadline dysfunction Musk has relied heavily on NASA’s goodwill in building his business. So he needs to prove, today, that he can follow through on his big promises. The problem is his mouth writes checks his company can’t cash — like promising in 2011 he’ll get people into space in just three years. NASA has almost certainly been influenced by what SpaceX has promised to do. When US President Barack Obama canceled the proposed replacement to the Space Shuttle — NASA’s project to return to the Moon — Musk praised the development. Maybe SpaceX wasn’t the deciding factor in killing the program, but Musk’s feelings were unequivocal. Musk is not very good at deadlinesThe US has been hitching rides from Russia, and despite the Commercial Crew program, which contracted with SpaceX (as well as Boeing) in 2014, no Americans have gone to space on an American vehicle since the Space Shuttle was retired. NASA bet on the SpaceX at least in part because of Musk’s extravagant promises. As part of the program, SpaceX was meant to begin ferrying astronauts to the ISS by 2017; now that will likely slip to late 2018. NASA gambled heavily on SpaceX and is, presumably, now feeling the effects of that wager: the delays. So when Musk shoots off his mouth, it has real consequences for the space industry. The government frequently cites Musk’s big talk when it talks about what NASA should do. But even Musk can’t live up to his own promises — and there are significant effects on our space programs because of it. In fact, longtime SpaceX watchers know that Musk is not very good with deadlines. We’ll start with his 2011 promise: he told Marketplace that he’d put humans in space in three years. It is now five years later, and — it bears repeating — not a single person has flown aboard a SpaceX rocket. That same year, Musk told The Wall Street Journal that his best-case scenario was to put people on Mars by 2021 (his worst case scenario was between 2026 and 2031). Earlier this year, he said he was planning to put people on Mars by 2025. Not one person has flown aboard a SpaceX rocketIt’s not just SpaceX, either. Musk has this whole other company, Tesla, which sells cars. Tesla’s Model S was announced in June 2008, and production was planned for 2010. Model S production actually began two years later, in 2012. Then there’s the Model X — introduced in February 2012, it was initially scheduled for production in early 2014; deliveries started in September 2015. These blown deadlines matter because Musk and SpaceX — in all likelihood — aren’t rich enough to finance these Mars trips alone. SpaceX convinced NASA to throw millions of dollars in contracts at it, and has used that money to develop some of the technology we expect to see Musk present today. So Musk must win over someone, probably the US government, in order to pay for his colonization fantasies. And NASA’s the best candidate for getting Mars money: there’s zero business reason to go to Mars, and no known profit incentive. But NASA has already experienced what working with SpaceX is like — it knows Musk can’t hit his target dates. It’s not like NASA doesn’t blow deadlines too, but it’s something else for a very vocal contractor to be unreliable. Reliable rockets There have been two major explosions of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rockets with their payloads attached. On September 1st, a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Florida, while it was being fueled. The fireball was caused by a "breached helium system," the company said. It’s not the first Falcon 9 mishap, and not the first problem with the helium system. In June 2015, another Falcon 9 experienced an unplanned disintegration while it was ferrying cargo to the International Space Station, due to the failure of a strut holding down the helium tanks. By way of comparison, the United Launch Alliance’s Altas V has a much better launch record — only one flight out of more than four dozen has malfunctioned. ULA is more expensive than SpaceX, though, so Musk has been able to win bids. Now ULA is essentially arguing that buying rockets on the cheap is more expensive in the long run. Since two of SpaceX’s rockets have disintegrated with their payloads attached, that should "serve as a reminder of the complexity and hazards intrinsic to space launch services," ULA’s CEO Tony Bruno argued in a letter to Pentagon officials that was leaked to The Washington Post. ULA has complained before that the Pentagon is thinking too much about doing business on the cheap. "This strategy defies both law and logic and puts hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and Warfighter mission needs unnecessarily at risk," he wrote in the letter leaked to the Post. Mars, not the Moon Musk’s Mars dream is not likely to be cheap, which is why he needs NASA. The realest of the real talk is that no one knows how much a humans-on-Mars mission costs. NASA’s robotic programs, which are decidedly cheaper, began around 2000, and have cost about $700 million a year for the last 15 years. Old estimates — from 1989  — suggested humans on Mars might cost $450 billion. Last year, The Houston Chronicle said the cost would be between $200 billion and $400 billion; Space News pegged that price much higher, at $1.5 trillion. Musk isn’t short on money, but his money isn’t long enough to get him to Mars. NASA's Mars program has been called a "time-wasting distraction"Right now, NASA will be acting as a consultant on initial SpaceX missions, but it plans to scale down its role as the program continues, Spaceflight Now reports. That’s because NASA has its own Mars ambitions, and on a far more reasonable timeframe. The space agency plans to send people to the vicinity of Mars sometime in the 2030s. It’s even building its own rocket, the Space Launch System. It’s not impossible the SLS will be canceled, as other NASA projects have been — at a hearing in February, the space agency was chastised by a Congressional committee for not having defined-enough goals. The Mars program was also called a "time-wasting distraction." A few witnesses suggested that NASA rethink its approach or focus on the Moon. If NASA’s Mars plans are canceled, that’s another opportunity for Musk — unless the agency is instructed by a new sitting president to focus on the Moon. So if Musk doesn’t announce funding today, he’s betting big on NASA’s future moves, and hoping that going back to the Moon won’t get much traction. And while SpaceX has dropped a cool $1.5 million (as of 2014) on lobbying Washington, his recent Falcon 9 woes, along with his deadline dysfunction, may dampen enthusiasm for his plans.

(Brandy Shreve/Skagit Valley Herald via AP) By MARTHA BELLISLE and GILLIAN FLACCUS Associated Press MOUNT VERNON, Wash. (AP) — A man charged with five counts of first-degree premeditated murder in the shooting deaths of five people at a Washington state mall shared an early dinner with his stepfather then told him he was headed to his job at a gym. Instead, police say, Arcan Cetin headed to the Cascade Mall in Burlington, pulled a Ruger rifle from his trunk and opened fire in a Macy’s department store, instantly killing three women and a teenage girl and critically wounding a man who died hours later. As the small city an hour north of Seattle struggled to make sense of the carnage, an unsettling portrait emerged of the man authorities say was the shooter. Cetin, 20, of Oak Harbor has a criminal record dating back at least two years and was charged last year with assaulting his stepfather, who said his stepson suffered from mental illness. One of Cetin’s neighbors at an apartment complex said he unnerved her so much that she kept a stun gun near her front door. On Monday, Cetin expressed no emotion when asked by a judge if he understood his rights. Bail was set at $2 million and his lawyer said nothing about his client in court and did not speak with reporters. “It’s a terrible tragedy for the community but having lived here my whole life, I believe the community is strong enough. It will recover,” said Rich Weyrich, Skagit County prosecutor. “It’s going to take a long time, but we will recover.” After his arrest, Cetin admitted to detectives that he was the man captured on security video carrying a Ruger rifle inside the mall, “and he did bring the rifle into Macy’s and shot all five victims,” court documents released ahead of Monday’s hearing said. Cetin left the rifle with a 25-round magazine on a cosmetics counter before fleeing, the documents said. The victims ranged in age from a 16-year-old girl to a woman in her 90s and included a probation officer and a Boeing maintenance worker. Authorities have not revealed any details about a motive, but Cetin’s stepfather David Marshall told reporters after the hearing that his stepson “has mental health issues.” He did not elaborate. The court documents painted a picture of Cetin’s stepfather and mother trying to help their son as he seemed to unravel. Cetin came to the U.S. from Turkey and is a permanent legal resident, authorities have said. Cetin faced charges last year in an assault on his stepfather after he caught Cetin smoking marijuana inside the house, according to court records. Cetin was told by a judge last December not to possess a gun, but his stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was “going through a hard time,” the records said. Cetin had been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and has taken unspecified medications in the past, the records show. He eventually moved out of his parents’ home and the stepfather told detectives after the shooting that he and his wife had helped Cetin with his rent. Cetin said his father bought him a laptop and his mother visited him regularly at his new apartment. She last saw him Wednesday, and his stepfather shared a meal with him in the late afternoon Friday, the documents said. Less than three hours later, surveillance video shows Cetin entering the mall from a fast-food restaurant, walking through the shopping center and leaving through the Macy’s women’s department exit, police said. He then moved his car closer to the Macy’s entrance and took a rifle out of the car’s trunk, the documents said. Cameras in Macy’s show him entering through the same women’s department — this time with the rifle. In the span of a minute, Cetin killed a teenage girl near some clothing racks and then walked to the cosmetics counter where he shot a man and three women, the documents said. He was arrested nearly 24 hours later in Oak Harbor, about 30 miles from the mall. Cetin’s stepfather told detectives that his Ruger rifle and .22-caliber ammunition were missing, documents said. Police interviewed the suspect’s former girlfriend and said Sunday she has an employment history at Macy’s, but not at the Burlington Mall location. They did not identify her. ——— Flaccus reported from Portland.

Port of Seattle Commissioner Fred Felleman and Xiamen Chairman Che Shanglun took part in the ribbon cutting and toast to Xiamen by the Boeing Company. Port of Seattle CEO Ted Fick Economic and Commercial Counsellor from Consulate General of China in San Francisco Yang Yihang and other guests attended. This is not only the first long haul route originating in Xiamen with an end point in the United States, but also the first direct international service between Shenzhen and the U.S.. The service will be handled by a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner, with three flights per week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Xiamen Airlines chairman and general manager Che Shanglun said, "The launch of the Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is an important reflection of the results of the meeting between Chinese and American leaders in 2015. On the heels of these events, a Fuzhou-New York and a Xiamen-LA service will also be initiated, making air travel, and, by consequence, exchanges between the two countries much easier." The Xiamen-Shenzhen-Seattle service is the sixth long-haul and first American route that Xiamen Airlines has launched. Existing services include Xiamen-Amsterdam, Fuzhou-Sydney, Xiamen-Sydney, Xiamen-Melbourne and Xiamen-Vancouver routes. The newly opened Seattle service is Xiamen Airlines' first long-haul route with a stop at a city outside of Fujian province. To complete the build out of a network that extends beyond Seattle, Xiamen Airlines has signed a partnership agreement with Alaska Airlines that enables passengers traveling to Seattle via Xiamen Airlines to fly onward to 61 major and secondary destinations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The launch of the route marks the first time the Xiamen Airlines fleet has had a chance to visit the home of their "birth", as Seattle, where Boeing is located, is where each member of the 165-strong fleet of aircraft was manufactured and first saw the light of day. As a loyal client of Boeing, Xiamen Airlines operates the largest all-Boeing aircraft fleet in China. Over the past three decades, Xiamen Airlines has taken delivery of hundreds of brand new Boeing airliners and, due to the cost advantage of an all-Boeing fleet, Xiamen Airlines has continuously shown a profit for 29 years, the longest period of reporting uninterrupted profits in Chinese civil aviation history.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents DARPA Awards $171M to LM for HABWC | NG’s Triton Cleared for LRIP | Oshkosh to Provide $378M FMS in Tactical Vehicles to Somalia, Cameroon & Iraq Sep 27, 2016 00:58 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has awarded a $171 million contract to Lockheed Martin as part of its Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept (HABWC) program. A joint effort between DARPA and the USAF, the program looks to develop and demonstrate critical technologies to enable an effective and affordable air-launched hypersonic cruise missile. Lockheed will undergo a research project for the program and follows a recent $147 million award for DARPA’s Boost Glide program. Northrop Grumman’s MQ-4C Triton has been cleared for low-rate initial production, the first piece of the production and deployment phase of the UAV. 68 Tritons are expected to be fielded, with the first to be deployed in 2017. The Triton will operate as a forward-deployed, land-based, autonomously operated system that provides persistent ISR within a range of 2,000 nautical miles using a multi-sensor mission payload including maritime radar, Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), Electronic Support Measures (ESM), Automatic Identification System (AIS), and basic communications relay. Contracts worth $43 million each have been doled out to Lockheed Martin and Boeing in order “to conduct risk reduction activities in support of the MQ-25 unmanned carrier aviation air system.” Both companies are expected to complete their work on the UAV by October 2017. Now known as the Stingray program, the UAV integrates the first operational, carrier-based, catapult-launched drone and will provide long-endurance ISR and organic refueling capabilities for the carrier air wing. Middle East &North Africa The UK government has blocked EU attempts to establish an independent international inquiry into the ongoing war in Yemen, sparking accusations that London is putting its multi-billion arms deals with Saudi Arabia first. A proposal by the Netherlands was submitted to the UN last Friday which, if successful, would have seen the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva investigate alleged war crimes committed by the Saudi-led coalition and opposing Houthi militants. Brexiter and UK Foreign secretary Boris Johnson last week rejected the need for such an inquiry, arguing that the UK was “using a very, very wide variety of information sources about what is happening to acquaint ourselves with the details” about Yemen. Oskosh will provide 1,543 medium tactical vehicles in a foreign military sales contract awarded by the US Army. Valued at $378 million, the vehicles will be delivered to the governments of Somalia, Cameroon, and Iraq. The deal also covers the provision of three 78-gallon armor B-Kit corrosion prevention compound for vehicles to ship outside of the continental United States. Europe Heckler & Koch’s 5.56mm 416 F assault rifle has won a Europe-wide competition run by France as part of its Future Individual Weapon program. The rifle will replace the domestically-produced FAMAS rifle, with deliveries to commence next year and continue over a ten-year period. Chambered for the NATO caliber 5.56mm cartridge, the rifle has the ability to fire rifle grenades and can be fitted with a 40mm grenade launcher to increase its firepower. Asia Pacific Nine types of missiles have been tested by the South Korean military this year, however, only five of the missiles actually hit their targets, indicating a drop in accuracy over previous years. As a result, opposition lawmakers have used the accuracy drop to hammer the government over concerns with the proficiency of the country’s aged computerized command and control system as well as guided missile systems. Some of the missiles that failed to make the grade include the indigenous SSM-700K anti-ship missile and Raytheon’s RIM-66 anti-air missile. An upgraded Mirage 2000 fighter operated by the Indian Air Force has successfully test-fired the Mica air-to-air missile. The MBDA made missile system was recently acquired from France and follows a $2.4 billion deal to upgrade the IAF’s fleet of 51 Mirage fighters. Once completed all of the fighters will be of the Mirage 2000-5 Mark 2 variant, which boasts new radar systems, a new weapon suite, missiles, electronic warfare system and modern electronic warfare.

Using Skype, a family still in shock spoke with us through tears and unfinished sentences. “Our sense of feeling for the last six hours has just been total numbness, we haven’t -- I don’t know,” Ray DeLorenzo, Jennifer’s ex-husband, explained, trailing off. Jennifer, Ray, and their kids -- Chuck’s three granddaughters -- talked to us from Vancouver, Washington, about life with Chuck and now life without him. >>PHOTOS: 5 killed in Cascade Mall shooting  “I really used to love sitting around while he played guitar. That was always really fun.  I loved his music skills,” Chuck’s oldest granddaughter, 20-year-old Alex Eagan, said. “I have been talking a lot about wanting to go see him recently and it’s kind of hard that I can’t see him now, and honestly, it’s just really hard to process,” the middle granddaughter, 16-year-old Faith DeLorenzo, explained. The family didn’t find out until Sunday morning that Chuck was a victim of the shooting that seemed so far away on the news.  Ray spoke with Chuck’s wife, who was shopping in the Macy’s with Chuck Friday night. >> RELATED: Arcan Cetin: What to know about Burlington mall shooting suspect “All of a sudden they heard a click, click, click, click, and Chuck knew immediately what it was, so he grabbed her hand and took off running,” Ray told us of what happened inside the Macy’s.

It doesn’t seem fair,” Alex said.  On Monday, the man police say shot him will appear in Skagit County Court. >> RELATED: Cascade Mall shooting victims: Remembering the 5 people killed   “I hope it haunts him,” Ray told us.  “I hope God can forgive him because I don’t know if I can right now,” Jennifer said, sobbing. © 2016 Cox Media Group.

Stop Video Replay 2:29 Russian missile blamed for MH17 tragedy UP NEXT VIDEO Russian missile blamed for MH17 tragedy Families of the victims of the air disaster heard evidence from the international team of investigators, including Australians, at Nieuwegein in the Netherlands on Wednesday. Families of MH17 victims have heard evidence from a team of investigators. Photo: AAP Among those who died after the Russian-made BUK surface-to-air missile exploded next to Malaysian Airlines flight 17 on July 17, 2014, were 38 Australian residents. Dutch chief prosecutor Fred Westerbeke told reporters on Wednesday that around 100 people had been linked to the transport and firing of the missile and determining which of them was culpable would be part of further investigations. He said the Joint Investigation Team was fully confident that "good investigation will lead to prosecution". Mr Westerbeke and the Dutch head of criminal investigation, Wilbert Paulissen outlined in detail how tapped phone calls of Russian-speaking participants in the fighting in eastern Ukraine helped investigators determine the track of the BUK missile launcher by truck from Russia into the war zone. MH17 investigation: The facts • 298 people were killed including 38 Australian residents • The missile has been identified as a Russian-made BUK 9M-38 series • Joint Investigation Team members: Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Malaysia, Ukraine. • More than 450 Australian Federal Police officers worked on the case over the last two years • More than 100 investigators from the participating countries continue to work on the case • 1448 pieces of wreckage are recorded in an investigation database • Around 150,000 intercepted phone calls were checked and over 3500 deemed to be of interest • Many millions of emails along with half a million photos and videos have been examined • More than 200 witnesses have been examined Social media images posted by locals also produced photos and videos of the camouflaged launcher being transported on a white Volvo truck before it was unloaded and drove to a field near the village of Snizhne. Witnesses also gave evidence about the launcher's journey and the firing of the BUK 9M-38 series missile, including reports of a loud bang and images of a long smoke trail in the sky. Witnesses claimed there was a loud bang and long smoke trail in the sky. Photo: Reuters. On tapped phone calls provided by Ukrainain authorities, Russian-speaking rebel leaders or Russian military operatives can be heard talking of the missile launcher's deployment, amidst a lot of swearing. Satellite images from the European Space Agency and information from US authorities also helped investigators piece together the chain of events. One satellite image showed a charred section of field where investigators believe the missile was fired from before the launcher with three missiles still aboard was rushed back across the Russian border under cover of darkness. The crash site of MH17. Photo: Reuters "We have no doubt whatsoever that the evidence we are presenting today is accurate," Mr Paulissen said. Russia has consistently rejected allegations that a Russian unit or rebels fired the missile and on Monday the Russian military said radio-location data showed it was not fired from rebel-held positions. It said the new data would be handed over to investigators. Moscow has suggested the plane was brought down by the Ukrainian military, which is also equipped with BUK missiles. Australian Federal Police and defence force investigators took part in the MH17 investigation. AFP Assistant Commissioner Ian McCartney told Wednesday's press briefing that Australia remained committed to seeing justice done for the 298 victims and their families. In a statement Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the findings showed that significant progress had been made in this ongoing investigation. She said the countries involved - Australia, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Ukraine and Belgium - were united in their resolve to ensure those responsible were held to account. Ms Bishop said Australia was carefully considering the prosecution options available and she called on other states to fully cooperate with the investigation and prosecution in line with a UN Security Council resolution. "While we cannot take away the grief of those who lost their loved ones that day, we can do everything possible to ensure justice is done independently, fairly and transparently." Moscow: Inquiry 'biased' and 'politically motivated' Investigators inspect the MH17 crash site. Photo: Reuters. Moscow on Wednesday described the inquiry as "biased" and "politically motivated". "Russia is disappointed that the situation around the investigation of the Boeing catastrophe is not changing," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. "The conclusions of Dutch prosecutors confirm that the investigation is biased and politically motivated," she said. She accused the Joint Investigative Taskforce of "arbitrarily designating a guilty party and inventing the desired results." Russia's defence ministry on Monday released what it claimed were new radar images showing that there was no missile fired from rebel-held territory on that day, which contradicted some of its earlier declarations. Russia's Almaz-Antey missile maker, which produces BUK surface-to-air systems, said in a briefing Wednesday that the inquiry did not include its findings. The state-controlled firm last October alleged the plane was downed from disputed territory by an outdated version of the BUK missile that is no longer in use by the Russian military. Dutch prosecutors said they only received Almaz-Antey's data this month and did not find that it outweighed the probe's conclusions.

The news was announced yesterday at the International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico. "The possibilities are endless." The goal of the mission is to give developing nations that don’t have their own space programs the chance to fly payloads in microgravity. The United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) is accepting proposals "on anything from developing materials that resist corrosion in space to studying climate change and food security," Motherboard reports. Developing countries get first dibs, but the mission is open to all UN member states. The payloads will be selected by UNOOSA in 2018 and will be launched into low Earth orbit — up to about 1,200 miles above Earth — in 2021. "One of UNOOSA's core responsibilities is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space," Simonetta Di Pippo, director of UNOOSA, said in a statement. "I am proud to say that one of the ways UNOOSA will achieve this, in cooperation with our partner Sierra Nevada Corporation, is by dedicating an entire microgravity mission to United Nations Member States, many of which do not have the infrastructure or financial backing to have a standalone space programme." The chance to fly payloads in microgravity The Dream Chaser is a 30-foot-long reusable spacecraft with small wings designed to land gently on runway. The company that makes the Dream Chaser, Sierra Nevada Corporation, was recently awarded a NASA contract along with Orbital ATK and SpaceX to resupply the International Space Station between 2019 and 2024. The contract revitalized the company. A previous version of the Dream Chaser designed to ferry astronauts to the ISS was rejected by NASA, which instead chose Boeing and SpaceX for the job. After that, Sierra Nevada had to lay off "dozens of employees," according to The Washington Post. The UNOOSA is currently looking for sponsors to fund the mission. The countries that send the payloads to space will also be asked to cover some of the costs, based on how much they can afford, according to a UNOOSA press release. The ultimate goal of the UN mission is to make space — a valuable environment for science experiments — more affordable to nations that might not otherwise have access to it. "The possibilities are endless," said Di Pippo.

Posted 29 Sep 2016 00:41 Total new orders for US manufactured goods totalled US$226.9 billion in August 2016. (AFP/Bill Pugliano) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: Orders for US manufactured durable goods were unchanged in August, hitting a plateau after rising in July, according to data released on Wednesday (Sep 28) by the Commerce Department. Total new orders for manufactured goods totalled US$226.9 billion, barely changed after having risen 3.6 per cent in July. Analysts had forecast a decrease of 1.9 per cent for August. However, excluding transportation, an important but volatile component, orders fell 0.4 per cent. Defence orders for capital goods rose US$2.3 billion, or 23.6 per cent, to US$11.9 billion. According to Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, the August results were significantly boosted by the US Air Force's recent order of 19 new tanker aircraft from Boeing, which helped offset a decline in civilian aircraft orders. However, he said the figures showed a third consecutive gain in core capital equipment expenditures, excluding defence items and aircraft.

Speaking at a press conference in the Dutch city of Nieuwegein, Wilbert Paulissen, the head of the Dutch National Detective Force, said there was conclusive evidence that a missile from the Russian-made Buk 9M38 missile system downed the passenger flight on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board. The Buk was returned to Russian territory the next day, said Paulissen, presenting the findings of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), a Dutch-led group of prosecutors gathering evidence for a potential criminal trial into the downing of MH17. “We have no doubt whatsoever that conclusions we are presenting today are accurate,” he said. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the findings pointed to the “direct involvement” of Russia, and said an investigation was ongoing into specific suspects and their “place in the chain of command” in order to pursue a criminal case. Russia, which has repeatedly denied any involvement in the downing of the plane, rejected the report. “None of the missile complexes, including BUK, have ever crossed Russian-Ukrainian border,” said Russia’s spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, Igor Konashenkov, in a statement. “All data presented today is based upon two sources — the Internet and Ukrainian security services. That’s why the objectivity of this data, and so of all the conclusions made based on it, leaves us with doubt.” Prosecutor: 100 people linked Evidence presented by the JIT Wednesday included intercepted phone calls, witness accounts and material on social media that investigators said established the missile system’s route in a convoy into Ukraine, which was displayed in a computer-generated animation. Paulissen said the missile was fired from farmland near the village of Pervomaysk which was under the control of pro-Russian rebels at the time — a conclusion supported by satellite data from the United States and the European Space Agency. Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said there were about 100 people linked “in one way or another” to the transportation and firing of the Buk, but they were yet to formally identify individual suspects. He said prosecutors were still seeking a clearer picture around the chain of command: “Who ordered to transport the Buk, who ordered the MH17 to be shot down, if the crew took their own decisions, or were they operating on instructions from above?” But they believed there was a realistic chance that the perpetrators would be brought to justice, he said. Investigators said they were not about to make any statement about the involvement of Russia, or Russians, in the downing of the plane. Family members grateful The findings are the first released by the group, comprised of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, in its criminal investigation into the downing of Flight MH17. Nearly 200 of those on board were Dutch citizens. Family members of the victims were briefed ahead of the public release of the report. Dennis Schouten, whose brother-in-law and brother-in-law’s girlfriend were killed, said he was grateful to the JIT for having put “some of the conspiracies” around the flight to rest. “We can be sure it was a Buk installation that has brought down MH17,” he said. Schouten said that the findings meant that Russia had “to do some explaining.” “We can surely say they have a part in this story,” he said. He said the key step to get justice for the victims was to identify those responsible for ordering the shootdown. “They want to get to know their names. That is the most important thing. We know everything else but who.” Piet Ploeg, a relative of another MH17 victim, said “there was evidence before that Russia was involved, but now [we] are sure.” Last year, a civilian investigation conducted by the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the Boeing aircraft was shot down by a Russian-made Buk missile. But the investigation was not required to assign blame for the missile strike, and did not say who was responsible. Russia: Ukraine involvement ‘bad joke’ Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement Wednesday that the JIT had suspended Moscow from full participation in the investigation, relegating its efforts to only a minor role. “It sounds like a bad joke, but at the same time they made Ukraine a full member of the investigative commission, giving it an opportunity to forge evidence and wrap the case in their favor,” she said. The statement pointed to radar data unveiled by Russia’s defense ministry earlier this week, which it claimed that if the plane was shot down, it was by Ukrainian forces. Justin Bronk, a research fellow specializing in combat airpower and technology at the Royal United Services Institute, said Russia’s suggestion of Ukrainian responsibility was “absolutely ludicrous, for fairly simple reasons.” “The Ukrainian military hasn’t fired a single surface-to-air missile in the entire multi-year conflict because the rebels don’t have an air force,” he said. “So the only kind of potentially hostile aircraft they might encounter would be Russian air force jets and the last thing Ukraine wants is to give Russia a pretext for even more overt military confrontation on its soil.” He said the notion that the Ukrainian forces would fire at an airliner that had been in contact with their country’s air traffic control and was leaving the country’s air space was “just insulting.” In July, Malaysia Airlines settled damages with the families of most of the passengers killed on Flight MH17, an attorney representing some of the families confirmed. The airline said Wednesday it was monitoring the progress of the JIT’s criminal investigation closely. “We are ensuring that all those affected by this tragic incident are kept fully informed.

Speaking at a press conference in the Netherlands, Paulissen said there was conclusive evidence that the Buk, a Russian-made missile, shot down the passenger flight, and was subsequently returned to Russian territory. He made the comments at the release of a report by the Joint Investigation Team, a Dutch-led group of prosecutors gathering evidence for a potential criminal trial. The findings are the first released by the group, comprised of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, in its criminal investigation into the downing of Flight MH17. The Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board, including 196 Dutch citizens. Last year, a civilian investigation conducted by the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the Boeing aircraft was shot down by a Russian-made Buk missile. But the investigation was not required to assign blame for the missile strike, and did not say who was responsible. The widely accepted theory is that the aircraft was shot down from within territory held by Russian-backed separatists, who were engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces at the time. On Monday, Russia’s defense ministry released radar data which it claimed refuted that theory, saying it showed that if the plane was shot down, it was done so by Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian officials have not responded to the allegation. In July, Malaysia Airlines settled damages with the families of most of the passengers killed on Flight MH17, an attorney representing some of the families confirmed.

If the rumors are correct, we’ll see DJI reveal Mavic; a 4K drone with a two-axis gimbal that reportedly folds up for easy transport. At a rumored 1.43 pounds it would be DJI’s lightest drone. That puts it on track to be a direct competitor with GoPro’s new Karma drone. Tuesday will also see the SpaceX CEO speak at the International Astronautical Conference in Mexico, where he’s expected to reveal his plan for colonizing Mars. With a lot of time, money, and effort, Elon Musk thinks our planetary neighbor could be a second home for humans, a hedge bet in case things on Earth really go south. It’s hard to say exactly what he’ll share — when Musk is on stage, any topic is fair game — but we published our best guesses last week. Look no further if you want to be prepared. Musk isn’t the only one with big ambitions for Mars, however. Musk isn’t the only one with big Mars ambitions NASA has spent the better part of the last decade pumping up its own "Journey to Mars," with a loose goal of getting humans to the surface sometime in the 2030s. The agency built a crew spaceship called "Orion," which has flown (empty) once during a test in late 2014. NASA is also building (and testing parts of) a giant rocket, known as the Space Launch System, to one day carry that spaceship to Mars. But the space agency’s goals are too loose for some, especially Congress. The technology, timeline, and budget have faced intense scrutiny, and the program was called a "time-wasting distraction" during a hearing in February. NASA’s Mars program also faces a hurdle the agency is deeply familiar with: election cycles. Incoming presidents and congressional regime changes can disrupt NASA’s budget and affect the overall attitude about the agency’s purpose. And even if funding stays steady, NASA officials have admitted that there is no concrete plan for the SLS rocket. There is no plan B for Earth That’s why the rise of private spaceflight companies is exciting. For the first time ever, there are multiple American entities outside of NASA that are pursuing space travel. Blue Origin, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, has successfully flown (and landed) its suborbital rocket four times in the last year. And Bezos recently unveiled the company’s much larger rocket, New Glenn, which could someday take humans beyond the reaches of Earth. But Bezos has scoffed at the idea of using Mars as a "plan B for Earth" in the past. The United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has rockets capable of getting to Mars. But for now the ULA seems content with only using those rockets to send robots — not humans — to the planet. (Boeing is even separately working on a crew spaceship for NASA, but it will only be used to bring astronauts to the International Space Station.) That leaves us with Mars One, which isn’t a private spaceflight company, but has driven the conversation almost as much as SpaceX. The Dutch non-profit spent the last few years pushing the idea of sending a select group of willing but untrained humans to Mars and filming it for a reality show. By all accounts, Mars One and the people who run it have a weak grip on the problems they’d face — an MIT study found that the life support systems proposed by Mars One would kill its astronauts within months of landing, for example. Mars One’s plans have also suffered delays, and the group was caught ginning up the number of applicants who were willing to sign up for the trip in the first place. Who will Elon Musk be able to convince to go to Mars? How will he get them there? Most importantly, how will he keep them alive? We start getting answers to those questions tomorrow when Musk takes the stage. The Verge will be both on the ground in Mexico and covering the event from New York.

Airlines reported 10,854 air rage incidents worldwide last year, up from 9,316 in 2014, according to the International Air Transport Association. That equates to one incident for every 1,205 flights, an increase from one incident per 1,282 flights the previous year. A majority of incidents involved verbal abuse, failure to follow crew instructions and other anti-social behavior. Eleven percent included physical aggression toward passengers or crew or damage to the plane. Alcohol or drugs were a factor in 23 percent of the cases, although in the majority of incidents the drugs or alcohol was consumed prior to boarding, the association said. Related: • Now you can sign up for TSA PreCheck at O'Hare • Your next trans-Atlantic trip may be on Boeing's humble 737 Training staff in airport bars and duty-free shops to sell alcohol responsibly, including avoiding offers that encourage binge drinking, can cut incidents by half, the association said, citing an initiative by Monarch Airlines at London's Gatwick Airport. Airlines also want more countries to ratify a 2014 treaty that closes gaps in laws for dealing with unruly passengers. So far, only six countries have ratified the pact. "More are needed in order to have a consistent global approach to this issue," said Alexandre de Juniac, the association's director general.

Speaking at a press conference in the Dutch city of Nieuwegein, Wilbert Paulissen, the head of the Dutch National Detective Force, said there was conclusive evidence that a missile from the Russian-made Buk 9M38 missile system downed the passenger flight on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board.

MUST WATCH Time-lapse shows reconstruction of MH17 01:04 The Buk was returned to Russian territory the next day, said Paulissen, presenting the findings of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), a Dutch-led group of prosecutors gathering evidence for a potential criminal trial into the downing of MH17. "We have no doubt whatsoever that conclusions we are presenting today are accurate," he said. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the findings pointed to the "direct involvement" of Russia, and said an investigation was ongoing into specific suspects and their "place in the chain of command" in order to pursue a criminal case.

"None of the missile complexes, including BUK, have ever crossed Russian-Ukrainian border," said Russia's spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, Igor Konashenkov, in a statement. "All data presented today is based upon two sources -- the Internet and Ukrainian security services. That's why the objectivity of this data, and so of all the conclusions made based on it, leaves us with doubt." Ahead of MH17 report, Russia says if plane shot down, Ukraine pulled trigger Prosecutor: 100 people linked Evidence presented by the JIT Wednesday included intercepted phone calls, witness accounts and material on social media that investigators said established the missile system's route in a convoy into Ukraine, which was displayed in a computer-generated animation.

The Boeing 777 was shot down July 17, 2014, over Ukrainian territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists. All 298 people on board were killed. In an October 2015 report, Dutch investigators found the flight was shot down by a warhead that fit a Buk rocket, referring to Russian technology, Dutch Safety Board Chairman Tjibbe Joustra said.

Hide Caption 58 of 58 Paulissen said the missile was fired from farmland near the village of Pervomaysk which was under the control of pro-Russian rebels at the time -- a conclusion supported by satellite data from the United States and the European Space Agency. Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said there were about 100 people linked "in one way or another" to the transportation and firing of the Buk, but they were yet to formally identify individual suspects. He said prosecutors were still seeking a clearer picture around the chain of command: "Who ordered to transport the Buk, who ordered the MH17 to be shot down, if the crew took their own decisions, or were they operating on instructions from above?" But they believed there was a realistic chance that the perpetrators would be brought to justice, he said. Investigators said they were not about to make any statement about the involvement of Russia, or Russians, in the downing of the plane. First responder: What I saw at Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash site Family members grateful The findings are the first released by the group, comprised of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, in its criminal investigation into the downing of Flight MH17.

Hide Caption 23 of 23 Dennis Schouten, whose brother-in-law and brother-in-law's girlfriend were killed, said he was grateful to the JIT for having put "some of the conspiracies" around the flight to rest. "We can be sure it was a Buk installation that has brought down MH17," he said. Schouten said that the findings meant that Russia had "to do some explaining." "We can surely say they have a part in this story," he said. He said the key step to get justice for the victims was to identify those responsible for ordering the shootdown. "They want to get to know their names. That is the most important thing. We know everything else but who." Piet Ploeg, a relative of another MH17 victim, said "there was evidence before that Russia was involved, but now [we] are sure." Last year, a civilian investigation conducted by the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the Boeing aircraft was shot down by a Russian-made Buk missile. But the investigation was not required to assign blame for the missile strike, and did not say who was responsible. Russia: Ukraine involvement 'bad joke' Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement Wednesday that the JIT had suspended Moscow from full participation in the investigation, relegating its efforts to only a minor role. "It sounds like a bad joke, but at the same time they made Ukraine a full member of the investigative commission, giving it an opportunity to forge evidence and wrap the case in their favor," she said. The statement pointed to radar data unveiled by Russia's defense ministry earlier this week, which it claimed that if the plane was shot down, it was by Ukrainian forces. Justin Bronk, a research fellow specializing in combat airpower and technology at the Royal United Services Institute, said Russia's suggestion of Ukrainian responsibility was "absolutely ludicrous, for fairly simple reasons." "The Ukrainian military hasn't fired a single surface-to-air missile in the entire multi-year conflict because the rebels don't have an air force," he said. "So the only kind of potentially hostile aircraft they might encounter would be Russian air force jets and the last thing Ukraine wants is to give Russia a pretext for even more overt military confrontation on its soil." He said the notion that the Ukrainian forces would fire at an airliner that had been in contact with their country's air traffic control and was leaving the country's air space was "just insulting."

Photographer: Ty Wright/Bloomberg Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Orders for U.S. durable goods were little changed in August and shipments of capital equipment declined for a fourth straight month, indicating lingering weakness in manufacturing. The latest reading for bookings of goods meant to last at least three years followed a 3.6 percent advance the prior month that was less than initially reported, Commerce Department data showed Wednesday in Washington. Sales of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, used in calculating gross domestic product, unexpectedly dropped 0.4 percent last month. The series of declines in shipments of those goods indicates equipment investment may weigh on economic growth for a fourth straight quarter. While household demand is providing some relief for manufacturing, factory customers are still contending with high inventories relative to sales and overseas markets remain tepid. “Business investment is just incredibly sluggish,” said Omair Sharif, senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale in New York. “We’re on track for it to be a drag on third-quarter growth. There’s very little impetus for businesses to go out and make capital investments.” On a positive note, bookings for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft increased 0.6 percent in August, stronger than forecast and the third straight advance. At the same time, orders for July were revised down to a 0.8 percent advance compared with an initially reported 1.5 percent gain. Orders for machinery, computers, fabricated metals and electrical equipment declined in August, while motor vehicle bookings climbed along with military hardware and communications gear. The drop in shipments of non-defense goods excluding aircraft, which were projected to rise 0.1 percent, followed a 0.7 percent July decline that was worse than previously reported. They were down an annualized 5.1 percent over the latest three-month period. The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey called for a 1.5 percent decrease in total durable goods, with estimates ranging from a 3 percent decline to a 2 percent advance. The report also showed bookings for commercial aircraft fell 21.9 percent following a 73.7 percent surge in July. Boeing Co., the Chicago-based aerospace company, said it received 22 orders for aircraft in August, fewer than the 73 in the prior month. Excluding transportation equipment, which is often volatile, orders fell 0.4 percent. Orders for military capital equipment increased 23.6 percent, while demand for non-defense durable goods fell 1 percent. Durable goods inventories rose 0.1 percent after a 0.4 percent gain, the first back-to-back increase since March-April of last year. Unfilled orders of big-ticket goods dropped for a third month.

 Durable goods orders were unchanged in August Akin Oyedele Sep. 28, 2016, 8:30 AM 895 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stephen Brashear/Getty Durable goods orders were flat in August, according to the Commerce Department.  Economists had forecast that orders for things designed to last for a long time fell 1.5% during the month, according to Bloomberg. A rise in defense orders boosted the headline print, after the US Air Force ordered 19 Boeing 767-based tanker aircraft. Commercial-aircraft orders fell.  But transportation orders are usually volatile, and capital-goods orders for non-defense items excluding aircraft, or so-called core durable goods, increased by 0.6% (estimated to drop 0.1%). Shipments in this category fell 0.4% (0.1% forecast). That was the fourth straight month of a rise in core orders.  "The key factor driving the turnaround is the rebound in activity in the oil sector, but note that the NFIB survey also points strongly to an upturn in orders for non-oil, non-residential capex too," said Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson in a note. "In the light of the plunge in the ISM manufacturing index, these numbers are very comforting."   SEE ALSO: The most active part of the US economy is sending 'mixed signals' NOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen Loading video...

Speaking at a news conference in the Dutch city of Nieuwegein, Wilbert Paulissen, the head of the Dutch National Detective Force, said there was conclusive evidence that a Russian-made Buk 9M38 missile downed the passenger flight on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board. After the missile launch, the Buk was returned to Russian territory the next day, he said. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the findings pointed to the “direct involvement” of Russia, and said an investigation was ongoing into specific suspects and their “place in the chain of command” in order to pursue a criminal case. Russia, which has repeatedly denied any involvement in the downing of the plane, rejected the report. “The findings of the Dutch prosecutor’s office confirmed that the investigation was biased and politically motivated,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. On Monday, Russia’s defense ministry released radar data which it claimed showed that if the plane was shot down, it was done so by Ukrainian forces. Prosecutor: 100 people linked Paulissen made the comments at the release of a report by the Joint Investigation Team, a Dutch-led group of prosecutors gathering evidence for a potential criminal trial into the matter. That evidence included intercepted phone calls, witness accounts and material on social media that helped establish the missile system’s route in a convoy into Ukraine, investigators said. Prosecutors presented a computer-generated animation showing the Buk’s alleged path into the country. Paulissen said the missile was fired from farmland near the village of Pervomaysk which was under the control of pro-Russian rebels at the time — a conclusion supported by satellite data from the United States and the European Space Agency. Dutch prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said there were about 100 people linked “in one way or another” to the transportation and firing of the Buk, but they were yet to formally identify individual suspects. He said prosecutors were still seeking a clearer picture around the chain of command: “Who ordered to transport the Buk, who ordered the MH17 to be shot down, if the crew took their own decisions, or were they operating on instructions from above?” They were seeking more information on the chain of command that led to the firing of the missile, but believed there was a realistic chance that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. Prosecutors said they were not about to make any statement about the involvement of Russia, or Russians, in the shootdown. Family members grateful The findings are the first released by the group, comprised of prosecutors from the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, in its criminal investigation into the downing of Flight MH17. Nearly 200 of those on board were Dutch citizens. Family members of the victims were briefed ahead of the public release of the report. Dennis Schouten, whose brother-in-law and brother-in-law’s girlfriend were killed, said he was grateful to the JIT for having put “some of the conspiracies” around the flight to rest. “We can be sure it was a Buk installation that has brought down MH17,” he said. Schouten said that the findings meant that Russia had “to do some explaining.” “We can surely say they have a part in this story,” he said. Piet Ploeg, a relative of another MH17 victim, said: “there was evidence before that Russia was involved, but now [we] are sure.” Last year, a civilian investigation conducted by the Dutch Safety Board concluded that the Boeing aircraft was shot down by a Russian-made Buk missile. But the investigation was not required to assign blame for the missile strike, and did not say who was responsible. In July, Malaysia Airlines settled damages with the families of most of the passengers killed on Flight MH17, an attorney representing some of the families confirmed. The airline said Wednesday it was monitoring the progress of the JIT’s criminal investigation closely. “We are ensuring that all those affected by this tragic incident are kept fully informed. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are to the families and friends of the passengers and crew onboard Flight MH17.” Filed in: National/World News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email Have a news tip?

The book on leadership development helps companies grow their middle management teams to strengthen and grow their businesses. Annapolis, United States - September 28, 2016 /PressCable/ -- Martin O'Neill has announced the release of his new book Next Generation Leaders: Getting Tomorrow's Leaders Ready Today. The book focuses on helping companies grow staff, better serve clients and build their businesses. More information on Next Generation Leaders can be found at: http://martinoneill.net. Training Magazine reports that while leadership development earns a top spot year after year on organizations' talent priority lists, 36 percent do not have a formal leadership development strategy, according to 2015 Brandon Hall Group's State of Leadership Development Study. The Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University showed that as many as 70 percent of Americans blame leadership crisis as a factor in the national economic decline, even though in the last decade companies allocated more funds than ever to train their executives. Next Generation Leaders is designed to help individuals understand today's business climate by developing the skills needed to form and lead teams effectively, become a trusted advisor to their stakeholders and help them shape and grow their business. CEOs say the development of their companies' middle managers is a critical success factor, but research indicates that only 28 percent of companies have a program in place that addresses their needs. Next Generation Leaders was designed to help organizations develop middle managers. O'Neill is the author of The Power of an Internal Franchise, Building Business Value, and Act Like an Owner. He has more than 30 years of experience in the business realm and has acquired perspective and depth of experience to guide leaders in industry and the public sector. After facilitating more than 100 meetings and planning sessions with companies including Boeing, Constellation Energy and Northrop Grumman, O'Neill created a 12-course online leadership development program with the same title and goals of his book, "Next Generation Leaders." Martin O'Neill developed Next Generation Leaders to benefit team leaders, project and program managers, practice leads, field supervisors, future leaders and those with an interest in growing their leadership skills. "As the owner of a consulting firm, the author of four books and an established businessman with more than 30 years of experience, I've encountered the highs and lows of the business world. Through these valleys and peaks, I've built a leadership process for building value," O'Neill said.

Schiebel, Diehl Defense strengthen cooperation by Richard Tomkins Vienna (UPI) Sep 26, 2016 Lockheed, Boeing get $43 million MQ-25 carrier drone contracts Washington (UPI) Sep 26, 2016 - Lockheed Martin and Boeing have each received $43 million U.S. Navy contracts for work on the MQ-25 Stingray aircraft carrier drone program. Both cost-plus-fixed-free contracts will conduct risk reduction activities in support of the system, including refinement of concepts and development of trade space for requirements generation in advance of the engineering and manufacturing development phase of the program. Work on Lockheed's contract will be performed in California and Texas. Work on Boeing's contract will be performed in Missouri and Washington. Each contract's estimated completion date is October 2017. The Stingray program integrates the first operational, carrier-based, catapult-launched drone. It will provide long-endurance intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and organic refueling capabilities for the carrier air wing. Austria's Schiebel, maker of the Camcopter S-100 unmanned helicopter, has strengthened cooperation with Diehl Defense for marketing opportunities in Germany. Diehl Defense possesses broad know-how in the integration of different defense systems and surveillance equipment into German Navy vessels, Schiebel said. "Today we are the world's leading producer of unmanned helicopters and we plan on further strengthening our position" said Hans Georg Schiebel, owner of the Vienna-based company. Added Helmut Rauch, member of the Division Board of Diehl Defense: "We consider Schiebel a highly competent partner and believe the CAMCOPTER S-100 is the best possible product for all remotely piloted aircraft operations of the German Navy." The Camcopter S-100 is a vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with a maximum speed of 138 miles per hour and a six-hour endurance. Units sold to date number 300 worldwide and include a number of naval clients who use the aircraft in conventional littoral reconnaissance roles. In 2008, Schiebel completed extensive flight trials from German Navy corvettes. The tests included more than 130 takeoffs and landings but no procurement contracts were issued. The S-100 system has since been upgraded and is now is available with a heavy fuel engine.

By Will Moredock Tools Share on Facebook Email a Friend Print Friendly Add to favorites Saving… Add to Custom List Loading… Comments (6) click to enlarge Latest in Will Moredock The fear industry fires up the right So why do so many people fall for it? Dimitri Cherny takes on Mark Sanford—again Pedaling and Paddling to Congress More » On the one hand, it says a lot about the Democratic Party in South Carolina that Pastor Thomas Dixon is its U.S. Senate candidate. No one else threw their proverbial hat into the proverbial ring, so Dixon took the nomination by default. On the other hand, Dixon could be the ideal candidate for that multitude of voters who say they are tired of professional politicians. He certainly stands in contrast to his opponent, Tim Scott, the GOP incumbent, who has been climbing the political ladder for two decades. Dixon has never held public office, nor has he ever even run for office. And unlike so many politicians who end their careers with a prison sentence, Dixon served his time years before his first run for office. But I get ahead of myself. At first glance, Thomas Dixon and Tim Scott would seem similar enough. Both are middle-aged, African-American men. But the similarities end there. As we know, Scott grew up in North Charleston, the son of a single mother. He was headed for trouble in his early teens, when he famously found a mentor, who gave him a job, kept him out of trouble, inspired him to finish high school, go to college, then open his own insurance business. Along the way, he learned the Republican platitudes of hard work, perseverance, religious faith, etc. Today he is in the U.S. Senate, providing the perfect cover for the party that has made itself the mouthpiece of white resentment and fear. And to maintain his own cover, Scott has refused to even join the Congressional Black Caucus. Thomas Dixon was not so lucky. He grew up in the Southside projects of Chicago. By age 14, he was drinking and using drugs and there was no mentor, no one there to turn him around. And so began the long descent into decades of drug and alcohol abuse. In an effort to escape the death grip these substances had on him, he joined the Navy and trained as a medical corpsman. Yet, to his dismay, he found that the demons he fled in Chicago were everywhere around him. After six years and several run-ins with authorities, Dixon counted himself lucky to take an honorable discharge. He was in Charleston then, 37 years old, with a wife and two children, and an addiction that had to be fed every day. Perhaps inevitably, he turned to crime to pay the bills and his dealer. Just as inevitably, he got caught, spending eight months in Dorchester County Jail and then two years in state prison. It was there that he had a religious experience. He came out of prison, put his family back together (both of his children have college degrees), and has been spending his life trying to repair the damage he did to society during his 30 years of addiction. Dixon's had plenty of time to work on that project, because he says he is unemployable as an ex-convict. Changing the law to help ex-cons find jobs is one of his causes and he has been active with S.C. Crime Reduction Coalition. Dixon has been working with Fight for 15, the campaign to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; with the International Association of Machinists, trying to organize workers at Boeing; and with Parents Against Gun Violence, trying to bring sensible gun laws to South Carolina. To combat violence in North Charleston, he co-founded People United to Take Back Our Community and he is a leader at Summerville Christian Fellowship. If that sounds like a modest resume, remember that Barack Obama started as a community organizer. As admirable as Tim Scott's climb out of poverty and social dysfunction may be, he does not seem to have learned much from the experience. Compare his cynicism to the compassion and empathy of Thomas Dixon, a man whose life experience much more closely reflects the lives of many South Carolinians. Dixon is a man who has lived a hard life, learned some hard lessons, and yet has not been broken or made bitter. He is not only a role model, but an agent for change. He knows that government can work for ordinary people, not just corporations and the wealthy. So it happens that we do have a worthy Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in South Carolina — not a man who has spent decades grooming himself for the position, not a man who spends his days hobnobbing in country clubs and boardrooms, fueling his campaign with corporate and special interest money. He told me, "I want to make this a better nation, a safer nation, a nation where we are all free to grow up and fulfill the American Dream." Thomas Dixon deserves our support on Nov. 8. Will Moredock is the author of Living in Fear: Race, Politics & The Republican Party in South Carolina.

Only massive intervention by governments across the globe saved the banking system from meltdown then, but the crisis is still far from over and there is plenty of unfinished business – as we have seen over the past week. On Tuesday, the shares of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest lender and a former pillar of the entire European banking system, hit their lowest level since 1983 amid a fresh crisis triggered by a claim for US$14 billion from the US department of justice (DoJ) for mis-selling mortgage securities during the heady days of the sub-prime boom. Deutsche, under siege from hedge fund investors, among them George Soros, who have taken short positions in its shares, denied well-sourced stories that it was seeking assistance from Berlin to fight the Americans. As the shares dived again, the bank was forced to issue a statement saying that its chief executive, John Cryan, had "at no point" asked Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to intervene in the stand-off with the DoJ. But a report by the German magazine Focus said Ms Merkel had ruled out a Deutsche rescue ahead of 2017’s German elections. "This question [of a government rescue] is not on our agenda: Deutsche Bank is determined to meet the challenges on its own," said the bank’s chief spokesman. There have been persistent questions about the bank’s financial health for some time, and even before conformation of the fine, investors were nervy about its capital position. Deutsche made a €6.8bn (Dh27.9bn) loss last year, driven by €12bn of writedowns, litigation, restructuring costs and the prospect of further charges, and that has continued through this year. Its shares have fallen by nearly 60 per cent over the past year and more than 90 per cent from its pre-crisis peak, leaving it with a market capitalisation of €14bn, which is just about what the DoJ reckons Deutsche owes it. There have been reports that the sale of the bank’s 10.8 per cent stake in the Chinese bank Hua Xia has gone wrong, prompting further doubts about its ability to get through its new crisis without raising more capital – an expensive operation at the current share price, even if it could do it. "The question of a capital increase is currently not on the agenda," said a bank spokesman last week. No one believed him – of course it’s on the agenda, it’s just a question of when and how much it can raise. Earlier this year, when Deutsche’s shares began their collapse, Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, said in an interview with Bloomberg that he had "no concerns about Deutsche Bank", and Mr Cryan followed up with a statement insisting the bank was "absolutely rock solid". When banks use language like that, everyone knows they’re in trouble. Eight years ago, the British prime minister Gordon Brown used exactly those words in a vain attempt to head off the crisis, and HBOS and RBS, even as they were going down, were still protesting that they didn’t need new capital either. Deutsche shares have fallen by another 50 per cent since those days; on a market cap basis, it now ranks 78th among global banks, just below the likes of Malaysia’s Public Bank and Brazil’s Itaúsa Investimentos Itau. The US action raises all sorts of trade issues that a new US president is going to have to become involved in sooner or later. The $14bn claim on Deutsche almost equals the tax claim which European Union authorities have sought to impose on Apple, raising suggestions that we are now into a new game of tit-for-tat. "The DoJ is asking for 10 times more from Deutsche than they asked for from any of its US peers, with no disclosure – it’s extortion," said one Deutsche shareholder, Davide Serra, the founder of Algebris. "Ultimately I wouldn’t pay it – and I would consider exiting the US." And a bitter battle rages between Boeing and Airbus over what constitutes state aid after the World Trade Organization ruled that Airbus’s popular A350, which competes head-to-head with Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner, would never have flown without the "direct and indirect effects" of past EU subsidies – which it declared illegal. Washington hailed the findings as a "sweeping victory" that would redress years of damage to the US aerospace industry from "wrongful" European subsidies. After this week’s Clinton-Trump debate, no one should be in any doubt that trade wars are going to step up if Donald Trump wins. And the banks may find themselves right in the middle of them. Can Ms Merkel really stand back and let Deutsche go? I think not.
