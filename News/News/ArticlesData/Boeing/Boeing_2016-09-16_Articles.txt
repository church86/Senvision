(Starbucks) Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner disputes Donald Trump’s assertions that the company’s jobs will go to China. Also: Starbucks’ new video series, called “Upstanders,” likely won’t be its last foray into original content; and Amazon’s Alexa talks about Safeco insurance. Share story By Seattle Times staff Seattle Times business staff Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has declared while campaigning that Boeing will move American jobs to China, emptying U.S. plants. “China is making them build a massive airline facility, right? Massive, like bigger than anything you’ve seen. You feel good about Boeing right now? Tell me in five years … All of a sudden you’re gonna be reading a big front-page story, all over the place, that Boeing is going to leave South Carolina, they’re going to make all their planes in China. Because that’s what they do,” he told a Walterboro, S.C., crowd earlier this year. Boeing hasn’t challenged him on this publicly before, but this past week Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner initiated a phone interview specifically to declare emphatically this is not true. Conner said, “Trump has made an issue about our involvement with the Chinese assembly center, saying we’ll move all these jobs to China.” Most Read Stories Trump supporter in state Senate says some protests are ‘economic terrorism,’ should be felonies Flesh-eating bacteria traced to tilapia bought from Bellevue market Earl Thomas, Rob Gronkowski have cool Twitter exchange about hard hit in Sunday's game Should California, Oregon and Washington join Canada? #Calexit talk envelops West Coast Cheap Eats: Some of Seattle’s greatest food isn’t found at the priciest places | PNW Magazine  WATCHUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. That’s not the case, Conner insisted. The Chinese center, announced a year ago when Chinese President Xi was in town, is “our largest opportunity for sales, creating an expanded relationship, but it will also create more jobs here. It’s lopsided on what we get and give — we get more. It’s being portrayed as the opposite.” The 737s sold to Chinese airlines will continue to be assembled in the Puget Sound region, then flown to China, where they will be painted and have the interior installed. The deal, Conner said, actually protects Boeing by limiting intellectual-property transfer. More than 70 percent of Boeing’s commercial-jet deliveries are outside the United States. China needs an estimated 6,000 airliners over the next 20 years. In addition to competition from Airbus, Boeing faces the certainty that China will field an indigenous commercial airliner, too. The finishing center keeps Boeing solidly in the game. Aerospace altogether generates 1.5 million American jobs and is the bedrock of many small companies. Conner is also concerned about the general anti-trade rhetoric of the election. For example, both Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. “Some people do get impacted by trade agreements, no question. In general, these create more opportunity. The right controls need to be in place to protect American workers. But these agreements aren’t as bad as being portrayed,” Conner said in the interview. “We … need to be cognizant how important trade is to this region,” he said. “Boeing for sure, but this region. People need to take time to educate themselves. It sounds good to take it back to a time when life seemed better. But the world will not sit still. “We need to make the best agreements possible. But to shut our doors to the rest of the world would be a real problem.” — Jon Talton: jtalton@seattletimes.com Starbucks’ series a bid to inspire Starbucks’ first foray into creating original content — a series of videos, podcasts and stories it calls “Upstanders”, highlighting ordinary Americans doing inspirational things — likely won’t be its last. Certainly, the series is meant to be uplifting, providing examples of things people could do to better their communities. And it falls in line with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz’s ruminations about the role of corporations in public life. “For the last couple of years, we’ve been asking: What is the role and responsibility of a public company?” Schultz said during a screening of “Upstanders” Monday night at the SIFF Cinema Egyptian. That role, he believes, is not just to make money but also to “elevate discourse, provide a significant understanding that we, as a corporation, as private citizens, need to do more to advance the cause of social impact in our communities.” But that’s not to say there isn’t also a bottom-line reason the company is getting into creating original content. “For any consumer brand, especially a brick-and-mortar retailer like Starbucks, the rules of engagement, because of Amazon and mobile commerce, are really changing,” Schultz said. Companies such as Starbucks now have to create “something really experiential” in the stores, he said — like the Roasteries that Starbucks has opened as a multisensory showcase for its higher-end beans and drinks. But companies also have to enhance the emotional connection with consumers even outside the stores, and extend the relevancy of their brands, Schultz said. “We’re never going to become a media company,” he said. “But we can extend the brand and the experience through media and original content.” He envisions people viewing such content via the Starbucks app on their smartphones, an important business tool for the company. Currently, a quarter of all transactions are conducted through the company’s mobile app. Others have recognized the reach of Starbucks’ mobile app, with the company being approached to put movie trailers on it, for instance. But Schultz said it was important to him to “leverage our scale for good and do something around original content — and not to do that in a commercial way.” For instance, the Upstanders series of 10 minidocumentary films, each five to six minutes long, does not promote Starbucks products. The series is written and produced by Schultz and Rajiv Chandrasekaran, Starbucks executive producer and a former senior editor of The Washington Post. The series debuted last week and can be viewed online, through the Starbucks mobile app, and via the company’s in-store digital network. The series showcases people such as a church pastor who reached out to local Muslims building an Islamic center nearby; a former NFL player who started a workout group for wounded veterans; and townspeople who banded together to raise money for college scholarships for every student in town. Also featured in the series are two people who attended the showing at the Egyptian: Sue Rahr, director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission and former King County sheriff, who’s working on changing the way police officers are trained; and Susan Burton, who spent years in prison and is now helping keep other female ex-convicts from returning to prison by providing them with a place to live. At Monday’s screening, Burton’s daughter, who also attended, said it would soon be her birthday and that the film about her mother was “the best birthday present.” It had been a long road, she said, getting to where she could believe in her mother again. Burton, in reply, said that she couldn’t get back years of going in and out of prison but that, through her work, she could help others get their sons and daughters back — and that through that work, “I got my daughter back.” — Janet I. Tu: jtu@seattletimes.com Alexa, can we talk about insurance? Nobody wants to talk about insurance. But Safeco Insurance is betting that doing so through Alexa, Amazon’s voice-powered artificial-intelligence concierge, will make the conversation smoother. Seattle-based Safeco has released a new Alexa app dubbed the “Insurance Advisor.” It won’t talk you through a roof replacement or any other crisis, but it can explain insurance’s often jargony terms, or find a local independent agent for those interested in specific kinds of policies. “We know insurance is a complicated, confusing space,” said Samuel Affolter, who heads Safeco’s research and innovation efforts. “This provides an easy way for consumers to get that type of information about insurance.” Safeco’s arrival on the Echo, the voice-powered Amazon speaker that uses Alexa, illustrates how Amazon’s decision to make Alexa an open platform for third-party developers is paying off in the rapid proliferation of apps. This past week Amazon.com reported that the number of Alexa apps, or “skills,” has tripled to about 3,000 since June. New apps being launched include a Twitter reader, and a GE appliances “skill” to control kitchen appliances. “Today there are tens of thousands of developers building Alexa skills,” the company said in a news release. “The fact that they open-sourced their (software development kit) is the reason we were able to do what we’ve done with Alexa,” Affolter said in an interview. “It they hadn’t done that, it’d be the same as Google Now or Siri,” platforms that also interact with the human voice but until recently were tightly controlled. (Apple in June said it would allow third-party developers to tap into Siri’s voice abilities, something Google did in March, according to news reports.) Safeco’s app, which took about three months to develop, also showcases both the promise and the limitations of the Alexa platform, which animates the Echo speaker and other devices, including a recently launched tablet. The interface — the human voice — is naturally inviting; Liberty Mutual, Safeco’s parent company, makes much of a Gartner study that predicts that 30 percent of interactions between users and computers will be through the voice by 2018. But actions initiated by voice commands remain in the realm of the relatively straightforward: hail an Uber, order a pizza, play some music, query information. In the case of Safeco’s app, the voice interaction replaces the act of pulling a phone out of a pocket and typing an insurance question into a web browser. The high-stakes matters of opening a claim or selling an insurance product seem at this point to be well beyond Alexa’s skills. “Those independent agents can do a lot for them, probably better than anything we can do within the virtual assistant,” Affolter said. Liberty Mutual, based in Boston, is also working on its Alexa app, which it promises to release in the fall. It is expected to give what Liberty calls “actionable advice” on typical home and auto concerns, and take the complexity up a notch by providing a car insurance estimate. Affolter said Safeco is already working on finding new Alexa-borne solutions not only for general insurance inquiries, but for more specific questions from its customers. “I think there’s a ton of opportunity there,” he said. — Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com Seattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Boeing preps legal challenge after Denmark rejects Super Hornet for F-35 David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen | September 16, 2016 2:30 PM ET More from David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo? More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Aerospace giant Boeing is setting the stage to mount a legal challenge against Denmark’s selection of the F-35, a move that shows the potential minefield the Liberal government could be moving into as it prepares to replace Canada’s fighter jets. Denmark rejected the Boeing Super Hornet, touted by Liberal insiders as the best jet for Canada. Instead, it decided to buy the same F-35 stealth fighter the Harper government originally wanted. But Boeing calls Denmark’s procurement process flawed. The company has submitted a “request for insight,” which would require the country’s defence ministry to provide the data used to pick the F-35 over the Super Hornet. Boeing said this is the first stage for a formal legal challenge of the proposed F-35 purchase. Related Liberals pay $33 million to stay in F-35 development program, despite promise not to buy the fighter jet F-35, the aircraft Trudeau said is ‘far from working,’ now declared ready for combat by U.S. Air Force F-35 exit strategy: Canada could pay about $313M to pull out of jet program, defence documents show The U.S. airplane maker is questioning how the Danes decided the Super Hornet would cost significantly more than the F-35, pointing out U.S. Defence Department budget information indicates otherwise. Denmark would be paying about US$83 million for each F-35, according to reports, compared with US$122 million for a Super Hornet. Alan Williams, former procurement chief for the Department of National Defence (DND), said Boeing seems to have a case. It would also be able to mount a legal challenge under the Canadian system. “The current data have the U.S. government putting the fly-away cost of the F-35 as about $99 million, so if I’m Boeing and see that someone is claiming $83 million, then I would know that’s not accurate,” said Williams, who oversaw Canada’s entry into the F-35 program. “If the same thing happened in Canada, they would also know such a price is fictitious.” Denmark will buy 27 F-35s. The Danes say the aircraft offers more value than the Super Hornet in terms of military, strategic, economic and industrial criteria. But Boeing insists Denmark inaccurately assessed the plane’s cost and capability. “We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet,” said Debbie Rub, a Boeing vice-president. Peter Christensen, the Danish defence minister, has said Boeing would be given the information it requested. The Danish procurement was “a very thorough and transparent process,” he added. Airbus, the European aerospace giant, is also concerned about Denmark’s evaluation process. The firm, which led a consortium offering the Eurofighter, is in discussions with Denmark to better understand how it picked the F-35. During last year’s election campaign, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised Canada would not buy the F-35, an aircraft he said was unnecessary for the country’s needs and too expensive. If the same thing happened in Canada, they would also know such a price is fictitious In the summer Ottawa looked at a sole source purchase of Super Hornets. But that was shelved after Lockheed Martin threatened to freeze out Canadian aerospace firms from working on the F-35. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has said he is interested in an open competition to pick a replacement for the CF-18 fighter jets. How the government will now proceed is unknown. Five companies recently responded to its call for information about fighter jets:  Boeing (Super Hornet), Lockheed Martin (F-35A), Dassault (Rafale), Eurofighter (Typhoon) and the Saab Group (Gripen). The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded commitment and later agreed to buy 65 of the planes. But the F-35 program has been dogged by controversy and the aircraft has faced numerous technical problems. The DND originally claimed the project would cost about $14.7 billion, but then-parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page said it would be about $29 billion. An independent audit ordered by the Conservative government put the cost at $44 billion over the 42-year life of the plane. That figure included everything from maintenance to fuel. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Flight MH370 Flap Part Confirmation Could Help Unravel the Mystery of the Ill-Fated Plane, Experts Claim Posted By: Faramarz HedayatiPosted date: September 18, 2016In: Social Page 1 of 212» The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has confirmed on September 15 that the flap section found on the island of Pemba off the coast of the east African country of Tanzania in June belongs to the ill-fated Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370. The latest ATSB announcement comes as the official search for the wreckage of the plane in the vast Indian Ocean is set to be concluded in December, notes the International Business Times. The large flap section is just one of the many debris found over the last couple of months mostly on the eastern shores of Africa. In its official report, the ATSB said that upon the flap section’s arrival, several part numbers were immediately located on the debris that confirmed the preliminary identification. The initial findings were consistent with the physical appearance, dimensions, and construction of the part. The bureau added that all of the identification stamps had a second OL number, in addition to the Boeing part number that was the unique identifier related to part construction. Boeing subsequently recovered build records for the numbers located on the part and confirmed that all of the numbers related to the same serial numbered outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404 are the same. Based on the company’s records, aircraft line number 404 was delivered to Malaysian Airlines and registered as 9M-MRO. Just like what they did to the flaperon found last year near the coast of Reunion Island off Madagascar, ATSB would use their confirmation on the flap section to determine how the debris drifted to its final resting place as affected by winds and currents. One of the biggest aviation mysteries of all time Investigators are confident that the confirmation of the flap section and the flaperon could help them solve one of the biggest aviation mysteries of all time, reports the Express of UK. They are still examining other pieces of debris that were found in Mozambique, South Africa, and the Rodrigues Island off the coast of Mauritius. There have been a number of conspiracy theories about the plane’s disappearance on March 8, 2014. There are those who are saying that Malaysian pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately crashed the plane into the ocean in a horrific suicide mission, which was denied by his family. Another theory suggested that the plane went down after a sudden loss of electricity or experiencing a flash fire in its cabin. Some investigators also pointed out the possibility in July that the plane may have glided and not plunged in its final moments. Fugro project director Paul Kennedy said that if the plane was manned, it could have glided a long way, which is why Flight MH370 veered way off course. Search will be officially ending soon Sometime last month, there were reports saying that the search operation for the wreckage of the Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 shall be suspended indefinitely if nothing turns up by December. However, because of the inclement weather conditions in the southern Hemisphere area where the search for the wreckage of the ill-fated Flight MH370, the team decided to halt everything for the time being until the weather becomes conducive, which would likely begin in October. The families of the victims of Flight MH370 took the news as a welcome development more than the announcement previously that the search will be suspended indefinitely. Flight MH370 was laden with 239 passengers onboard during its flight from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia to Beijing in China on March 8, 2014, and most of them were Chinese. The families of the victims believe that they would not have a complete closure if the wreckage and perhaps the remains of their relatives are still not found.

China is the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing's forecast. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4% annually in China over the next 20 years." Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes, such as the new 737 MAX 8 and current 737-800, through 2035, accounting for 75% of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X. This year's forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China's single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18% of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China's widebody fleet only represents approximately 5% of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. Worldwide, Boeing projects investments of $5.9 trillion for 39,620 new commercial airplanes to be delivered during the next 20 years. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model – the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies.

Staff Sgt. Shawn Nickel / CP Share Adjust Comment Print Aerospace giant Boeing is setting the stage to mount a legal challenge against Denmark’s selection of the F-35, a move that shows the potential minefield the Liberal government could be moving into as it prepares to replace Canada’s fighter jets. Denmark rejected the Boeing Super Hornet, touted this summer by Liberal insiders as the best jet for Canada, and instead decided to purchase the same F-35 stealth fighter the Harper government originally wanted to buy. But Boeing says Denmark’s procurement process is flawed and has now submitted a “request for insight” which would require the country’s defence ministry to provide the data it used to select the F-35 over the Super Hornet. Boeing said this is the first stage for a formal legal challenge of the proposed F-35 purchase. Boeing has questioned how the Danes concluded the Super Hornet would cost significantly more than the F-35, pointing out that U.S. Defence Department budget information indicates otherwise. Reports indicate that Denmark would be paying about $83 million U.S. for each F-35; the Danes claimed the purchase of the Super Hornet would cost about $122 million U.S. per plane. Alan Williams, the former procurement chief for Canada’s Defence department, said it appears Boeing has a case with the Danes and under the Canadian system it would also be able to mount a legal challenge. “The current data has the U.S. government putting the fly away cost of the F-35 as about $99 million so if I’m Boeing and see that someone is claiming $83 million then I would know that’s not accurate,” said Williams, who oversaw Canada’s initial entry into the F-35 program. “If the same thing happened in Canada they would also know such a price is fictitious.” Denmark will purchase 27 F-35s. The aircraft was evaluated by the Danes as offering more value than the Super Hornet when it came to military, strategic, economic and industrial criteria. But one of Boeing’s vice presidents said Denmark inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the Super Hornet. “We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet,” said Boeing’s Debbie Rub. Rub said the company believes the Danish evaluation fell short in the four selection criteria and that must be reviewed under the full extent allowed under Danish law. “Denmark deserves to know beyond a shadow of doubt that a fair and transparent process was used to select the country’s future fighter fleet,” Rub added in her statement. Denmark’s Defence Minister Peter Christensen has said Boeing would be given the information it requested. He noted the Danish procurement was “a very thorough and transparent process.” Lockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment. Airbus, the European aerospace giant, has also raised concerns about the Danish evaluation process. The firm led a consortium offering the Denmark the Eurofighter. Airbus noted it is in discussions with Denmark to better understand how the selection of the F-35 was made. During last year’s election campaign, Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised Canada would not purchase the F-35, an aircraft he said was unnecessary for the country’s needs and too expensive. In the summer the Liberal government examined a sole source purchase of Super Hornets. But that was shelved after Lockheed Martin threatened to freeze out Canadian aerospace firms from working on the F-35. Defence minister Harjit Sajjan has said he is interested in an open competition for the replacement of the country’s CF-18 fighter jets. How the Liberals will now proceed on the replacement is unknown at this point. Five companies recently responded to the Liberal government’s call for information about fighter jets. Boeing submitted information on its Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin provided information on the F-35A, Dassault responded with the data on the Rafale, Eurofighter with the Typhoon, and the Saab Group offered details on the Gripen aircraft. The F-35 became a major political headache several years ago for the Conservative government. Although a Liberal government originally signed on to a research and development program for the plane, the Conservatives significantly expanded commitment and later agreed to the purchase 65 of the planes. But the F-35 program has been dogged by controversy and the aircraft has faced numerous technical problems. The Department of National Defence originally claimed the project would cost around $14.7 billion, but then-parliamentary budget officer Kevin Page put the price tag for 65 aircraft at around $29 billion. Auditor general Michael Ferguson also issued a report that concluded DND officials withheld key information from Parliament about the fighter-jet purchase, underestimated costs and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. An independent audit ordered by the Conservative government found the purchase of the aircraft would cost $44 billion over the 42-year life of the plane. That figure included everything from maintenance to fuel.   Swedish military publishes gender manual so officers pay attention to sexual... 15 F-35A fighter jets grounded because of peeling insulation Video Connect With Us Email Alerts Get the latest news in your mailbox as it happens Weather Weather Currently Feels Like We want you to have the most accurate weather report you can.

The development may lead to a lawsuit against the Danish MoD’s evaluation regarding the procurement of the country’s next fighter jet. Denmark selected Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II over the Boeing F/A-18 and Airbus' Eurofighter Typhoon. Boeing Global Strike vice-president and general manager Debbie Rub said: “As we said when the decision was announced, we believe the ministry’s evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet. “We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet.” Boeing presented its concerns regarding the evaluation process to the Danish Parliament Defence Committee prior to the award decision earlier this year. "We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet." The company’s primary issue was about the ministry’s estimate that the Super Hornet would cost up to twice as much as detailed in US Department of Defense budget documents. Rub added: “Denmark deserves to know beyond a shadow of doubt that a fair and transparent process was used to select the country’s future fighter fleet. “Our action today underscores our belief that the Ministry’s evaluation of each of the four selection criteria fell short of these objectives and must be reviewed to the fullest extent allowed under Danish law.” Image: Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornet.

Boeing challenges Denmark's choice of fighter jets by Staff Writers Copenhagen (AFP) Sept 15, 2016 Gentex receives $82.4 million contract for F-35 pilot masks Washington (UPI) Sep 15, 2016 - Gentex Corp. has been awarded an $82.4 million U.S. Army contact for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter masks and life support systems. The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract will cover joint service aircrew masks for the fighter, as well as life support system and pilot flight equipment that will provide combined chemical and biological protection to pilots during flight. Work locations and funding will be determined with each order. The estimated completion date is September 2026. The Army Contracting Command is the contracting activity. The F-35 Lightning II is intended to replace a range of aircraft across the U.S. military services. Boeing accused the Danish government Thursday of overseeing a "fundamentally flawed" process to replace its fleet of fighter jets which saw the US defence giant lose out to competitor Lockheed Martin. In June, Denmark decided to replace its ageing fleet of F-16s with 27 US-built Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighters in a deal valued at 20 billion kroner (2.69 billion euros, $3.02 billion). Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Eurofighter's Typhoon model were also in the running for the order, which had been debated for over 10 years. "We believe the ministry's evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet," Debbie Rub, a Boeing vice president, said in a statement. The company had submitted a request for the defence ministry to provide "all materials related to the fighter procurement evaluation and decision announced in June," it said. "We're taking this step because there's too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet," Rub said. She described it as "the first step toward bringing a formal legal challenge." Boeing said it had voiced concern earlier this year over the Danish evaluation process, in particular with a government estimate that "the Super Hornet would cost up to twice as much as detailed in US Department of Defense budget documents." Danish Defence Minister Peter Christensen said it was "natural" that only the company behind the winning bid would be happy with the outcome of the process. "I note that we have had a very thorough and transparent process," he told Danish news agency Ritzau. Denmark is one of nine partner countries, that also include Britain, Canada and Turkey, who are helping pay for the futuristic F-35A fighter jet's development. The country expects to take delivery of the F-35s between 2021 and 2026. Boeing, Saab display new trainer aircraft St. Louis (UPI) Sep 14, 2016 - Boeing and its partner Saab have displayed a new production trainer aircraft to be offered to the U.S. Air Force. The aircraft put on display Tuesday is the T-X, designed specifically for the U.S. Air Force training mission. Boeing said the aircraft takes advantage of the latest technologies, tools and manufacturing techniques. "Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come," said Leanne Caret, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and chief executive officer. The Boeing T-X aircraft is a twin-tailed, single-engine jet with an advanced cockpit with embedded training. "It's an honor to build the future of Air Force training," said Saab President and CEO Hakan Buskhe. "We have created the best solution thanks to great cooperation and a clear strategy since day one." The U.S. Air Force plans to replace its fleet of aging T-38 aircraft. The Boeing-Saab partnership is one of several competitors for the contract.

By Ananya Roy September 16, 2016 05:54 BST Close Embed Feed Australia examines possible MH370 plane debris found in Tanzania IBTimes US <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19434" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has confirmed on Thursday (15 September) that the large wing part found off a Tanzania coast in June is from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The bureau also said it is conducting further examination of the piece of debris to see if it can provide any clues to the final hours of the flight. On the request of the Malaysian government, the ATSB secured the flaperon found on the island of Pemba and began its examination at its facilities in Canberra. It said that preliminary identification from photographs indicated that the piece was likely to be a section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap. The bureau said in its recent update that examination of the several part numbers found on the flaperon confirmed it belonged to a Boeing 777 outboard flap and that it was "consistent with the physical appearance, dimensions and construction of the part". The ATSB added that a date stamp associated with one of the part numbers showed the manufacture date as 23 January, 2002, which was found consistent with the 31 May, 2002, delivery date for 9M-MRO. The identification stamps also had an "OL" number, which was in addition to the Boeing part number. These numbers were unique identifiers relating to part construction. The Italian part manufacturer matched its records with these numbers and confirmed that all those numbers related to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404, which was delivered to Malaysian Airlines and registered as 9M-MRO. Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) confirmed after examination of identification numbers (in picture) on the flaperon found off the Tanzania coast that it belongs to missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370Australian Transport Safety Bureau ATSB "Based on the above information, the part was confirmed as originating from the aircraft registered 9M-MRO and operating as MH370," ATSB said. The authorities are now studying the flap section for signs that may indicate the state of flap operation at the time of separation from the wing. "This information may contribute to an increased understanding of end of flight scenarios," the bureau added. Meanwhile, Blaine Gibson, a US lawyer-turned-independent investigator trying to resolve the mystery of the missing MH370, handed over five pieces of debris to ATSB earlier this week for examination. The pieces found off Madagascar bear signs of damage from intense heat or fire. Gibson believes that if confirmed to be from the missing Malaysian flight, these pieces could give the ongoing investigation a new dimension. Australian authorities are running a search for the wreckage in the southern Indian Ocean for the past two years following the plane's disappearance on 8 March, 2014, but have recovered nothing so far. A second sweep of the 120,000sq km ocean floor is set to begin soon to see if the wreckage was missed in the initial sweep.

Business Home LBoard ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Boeing challenges Denmark’s choice of fighter jets AFP | September 16, 2016 Danish Defence Minister Peter Christensen said it was "natural" that only the company behind the winning bid would be happy with the outcome of the process. COPENHAGEN: Boeing accused the Danish government Thursday of overseeing a “fundamentally flawed” process to replace its fleet of fighter jets which saw the US defence giant lose out to competitor Lockheed Martin. In June, Denmark decided to replace its ageing fleet of F-16s with 27 US-built Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fighters in a deal valued at 20 billion kroner (2.69 billion euros, $3.02 billion). Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Eurofighter’s Typhoon model were also in the running for the order, which had been debated for over 10 years. “We believe the ministry’s evaluation of the competitors was fundamentally flawed and inaccurately assessed the cost and capability of the F/A-18 Super Hornet,” Debbie Rub, a Boeing vice president, said in a statement. The company had submitted a request for the defence ministry to provide “all materials related to the fighter procurement evaluation and decision announced in June,” it said. “We’re taking this step because there’s too much at stake for Denmark and, potentially, other countries considering the Super Hornet,” Rub said. She described it as “the first step toward bringing a formal legal challenge.” Boeing said it had voiced concern earlier this year over the Danish evaluation process, in particular with a government estimate that “the Super Hornet would cost up to twice as much as detailed in US Department of Defense budget documents.” Danish Defence Minister Peter Christensen said it was “natural” that only the company behind the winning bid would be happy with the outcome of the process. “I note that we have had a very thorough and transparent process,” he told Danish news agency Ritzau. Denmark is one of nine partner countries, that also include Britain, Canada and Turkey, who are helping pay for the futuristic F-35A fighter jet’s development. The country expects to take delivery of the F-35s between 2021 and 2026. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

The lab, which will house 50 data analysts and other staff, will study how Boeing clients can save money through smart planning — such as planning flight routes so that planes needing certain replacement parts will be landing at or near airports where those parts are in-stock, dramatically reducing repair costs.  The following are five items to take away from the announcement. 1) Boeing Vancouver becomes the largest data science group in two key categories. “I believe we are certainly the largest data science group in Vancouver, but also in the global Boeing organization,” said Bob Cantwell, president of Boeing Vancouver. “And really, that’s all because of the talent — the talent that exists here in Vancouver.” Cantwell said the concept for the lab came five years ago, when Boeing realized data analysis could yield potential gains in “disruption management” and maintenance and fuel optimization: “For many of us who came from the airline industry — and lived and breathed these problems everyday — we understood that the power that was going to be unleashed by this new talent and this technology that we’re seeing amongst us here.” 2) The lab provides Boeing with a significant advantage when selling its aircraft. Kevin Crowley, vice-president of Boeing Digital Aviation, said the plane maker is facing increasing competition from European giant Airbus, and the company needs something more than aircraft engineering to attract clients. “We’re still very competitive, but we have to have a competitive edge that’s based on something more than the aerodynamics of our airplanes, our knowledge of materials … those type of things,” Crowley said. “We have to have more of an edge when you come right down to it … mining the data and being a better partner for our customers.” 3) The data analysis applies mostly to civil aerospace, but can be applied to military uses. “Some of the tools that our commercial airline customers have enjoyed for quite awhile are actually being applied on Royal Canadian Air Force programs,” said Roberto Valla, vice-president of global sales for Canada. He noted the RCAF’s Chinook helicopters and some transport planes already use software tools developed in Richmond by AeroInfo. “I think hopefully the one thing all of you will take away from this … is that fact that the Boeing company has been, is, and will remain committed to Canada.” 4) Seemingly minuscule fuel savings in percentage terms are huge in reality. Dawen Nozdryn-Plotnicki, Boeing Vancouver’s director of advanced analytics, said even a one-per-cent cut in fuel use by all Boeing aircraft worldwide would mean savings worth $1 billion and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 6.6 million tonnes. “That’s the equivalent, per year, to 1.4 million cars we can take off the road. … That’s why this team right here (in Vancouver) has worked on solutions that will allow us to be able to realize that kind of savings.” 5) B.C. may get more aerospace operations like Boeing Vancouver in the coming years. Amrik Virk, the B.C. technology minister said B.C. will announce in the coming weeks that a technology fund that will provide $100 million in venture capital for small companies to expand. Virk said he hopes that will spur an increase in startup activity in the tech industry that, along with the Boeing decision, could create an aerospace technology hub here. chchiang@postmedia.com Hanjin Shipping vessels now 'under arrest' off B.C. coast over $3.6...  Adorlee tackles beauty, beasts dealing with China's free-trade zones Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Friday, Sep 16, 2016 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>> Debris found off Tanzania part of Missing MH370 plane (Xinhua)    09:12, September 16, 2016 KUALA LUMPUR, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- The piece of debris discovered on an island off Tanzania in June this year has been confirmed to belong to the Boeing 777 plane of Malaysia Airlines MH370, Malaysia's transport minister Liow Tiong Lai said in a statement on Thursday. Several part numbers, along with physical appearance, dimensions, and construction have been confirmed to be an inboard section of a Boeing 777 outboard flap, while a date stamp of Jan. 23, 2002 on one of the part numbers was consistent with the delivery date for MH370, said Liow. In addition, the Italian part manufacturer has confirmed that all numbers on the discovered object relates to the same serial number outboard flap that was shipped to Boeing as line number 404, which was consistent with the part used on the plane delivered to Malaysia Airlines, registered as 9M-MRO for the MH370 plane. The conclusion was based on the examination of experts from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the MH370 Safety Investigation Team, according to Liow. Liow said further examination of the debris will continue so as to uncover further evidence which may provide insight into the circumstances of Flight MH370. Previously, a piece of debris found on the French island of Reunion in July 2015 has been confirmed to be part of MH370. Government of Malaysia, Australia and China announced in July that search for Flight MH370 would be suspended upon completion of the current search area, but promised to resume search should new evidence emerge.

At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. REGIS DUVIGNAU/REUTERS Employees work during the delivery of the first series-production LEAP-1A propulsion systems by Aircelle for the A320neo aircraft Airbus family at the Aircelle plant in France. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said. Ad Feedback "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 6400km, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1900km. While ranges have increased, the 5400km reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 3200km miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The UK and Irish routes planned for Norwegian's 189-seat Max 8s will span about 4800km. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus's A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 6400km using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The US carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 5600km from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city.Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 - dubbed the Max 10 - that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. "But they're coming."  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next News story: Zika virus: Where is it found, what are the dangers and symptoms, how do you prevent it spreading?

Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, though they'll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus's A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 6400km using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The US carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with "trans-Atlantic range." TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 5600km from both New York and Recife, the South American country's sixth-largest city.Ireland's Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a "fantastic opportunity." It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favored successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9 - dubbed the Max 10 - that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade's end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It's also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Whatever the outcome, passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years. "For the moment we haven't really got the planes out there," said Yan Derocles, an analyst at Oddo Securites in Paris. "But they're coming."  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next News story: Zika virus: Where is it found, what are the dangers and symptoms, how do you prevent it spreading?

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out travel Search Destinations Themes News Travel Troubles Cruising Snow Kiwi Traveller Humble Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 set for long-haul journeys RICHARD WEISS, ANDREA ROTHMAN AND BENJAMIN KATZ Last updated 13:52, September 16 2016 123RF Eight hours on the smallest aircraft might not appeal but cheaper fares and new routes might. The smallest aircraft made by Boeing and Airbus Group are about to find a new role operating trans-Atlantic routes that were previously the preserve of some of the world's biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15 per cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 800 kilometres to their range - just enough to allow the narrow-bodies to span the 4828km between the eastern US and Western Europe. MATT MILLS MCKNIGHT A Boeing 737 MAX plane at the Boeing plant in Renton, Washington. While eight hours on a 40-metre plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travellers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn't otherwise be viable.

That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. REGIS DUVIGNAU/REUTERS Flight test engineers taxi the Airbus A320neo (New Engine Option) after its first flight in Colomiers near Toulouse, in 2014 file photo. At the same time people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle, JetBlue Airways and Portugal's TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes, with NAS set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing's Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. REGIS DUVIGNAU/REUTERS Employees work during the delivery of the first series-production LEAP-1A propulsion systems by Aircelle for the A320neo aircraft Airbus family at the Aircelle plant in France. "The Max is very competitive," Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said. Ad Feedback "It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. But you can't go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. You must target airports with a totally different cost structure." Boeing's 757, the world's longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 6400km, has been plying the Atlantic for years, with companies including United Continental Holdings Inc. still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives and with fuel consumption way in excess of modern jets. The 737 and A320, by contrast, were designed for much shorter flights, with the original 737-100 seating just 85 people and limited to trips of about 1900km. While ranges have increased, the 5400km reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 500 miles in an emergency. A handful of carriers operate services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range, with SAS serving Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connecting London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada's WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John's, Newfoundland, with Dublin -- distance 3200km miles -- and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents Boeing/Saab T-X Trainer Unveiled | B-52s to Get New Ejector Seats – Contract to AMI Industries | US Extends Landmark $38B Mil Aid Package to Israel Sep 16, 2016 00:58 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas Cost reductions at Boeing have resulted in the curbing of paid overtime by 80,000 salaried workers based in the US from October 14. The move is part of company-wide attempts to slash costs amid intense market competition. A company memo stated “By curbing exempt overtime pay, Boeing is challenging leaders and employees to come up with work solutions that curb the need to work overtime.” Boeing and Saab have officially unveiled their new production trainer aircraft for the USAF T-X trainer competition. The Boeing/Saab T-X aircraft is a twin-tailed, single-engine jet with an advanced cockpit with embedded training, taking advantage of the latest technologies, tools and manufacturing techniques. While the offering faces off with several other designs from rival manufacturers and consortiums, the company stated that their “T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come.” B-52s are set to be fitted with new ejector seats following a USAF contract award to AMI Industries. The $14 million deal will see the company install the Advanced Conception Ejection Seat (ACES) II ejection seat. Due for completion in December 2018, the ejection seat will be composed of a detachable seatback and bucket structure that does not require removal of the B-2 escape hatches for any maintenance task. Elbit subsidiary EFW has won a $102 million US Army contract to provide the service with mortar weapon systems. Under the deal, EFW will deliver 60mm, 81mm and 120mm mortar systems to the Army with completion expected for September 2021. Middle East & North Africa Israel is to receive $38 billion in military aid from the US over the next ten years in what is a landmark military assistance package. The deal, which has been in the works for more than ten months, includes the promise by Israel not to seek additional funds from Congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually. Having the new pact signed prior to the upcoming US Presidential elections allows Tel Aviv to avoid uncertainties surrounding the next president, whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump, and to give Israel’s defense establishment the ability to plan ahead. Europe A legal challenge has been launched by Boeing against the Danish Ministry of Defense for selecting the Lockheed Martin F-35A over the F/A-18E/F as the air force’s next generation fighter. Citing a “flawed” evaluation process, Boeing submitted a request for insight to the Ministry of Defence to obtain all materials related to the selection. Denmark’s parliament approved a recommendation by the MoD to buy 27 F-35As in June after the fighter beat out the F/A-18 in the military, strategic, economic and industrial judging categories. Asia Pacific It’s been revealed that China will be taking delivery of four Su-35 fighters by the end of 2016. The disclosure was made by the Governor of Khabarovsk Territory Vyacheslav Shport during the opening of a production plant. Some experts mark the Su-35 as a potential rival for the F-15, Eurofighter, and Rafale fighters. India’s government has launched its investigation into corruption allegations against Brazil’s Embraer regarding the purchase of three EMB-145 aircraft from the company in 2008. The $210 million procurement was destined for the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as part of its indigenous airborne early warning and control systems (AEW&C) program. Embraer has been under investigation by the US Justice Department since 2010 after a defense contract with the Dominican Republic raised suspicions of kickbacks. The US investigation has extended to examine Embraer’s business dealings with eight more countries, including Saudi Arabia and India.

Boeing Co and SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, are building spaceships to fly NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is looking to turn over crew transport to SpaceX and Boeing before the end of 2018, breaking a Russian monopoly. SpaceX is aiming for its first test flight to the station in 2017. “We’re full-steam head for certification. We’re still trying to remain on schedule,” Abhishek Tripathi, director of certification for SpaceX, said during a webcast panel discussion at an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Long Beach, California. “I know what I need to do in the next day and in the next month,” Tripathi said, adding that his work is not being affected by the accident investigation. SpaceX, with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration, is working to figure out why one of its Falcon 9 rockets burst into flames on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre launch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The blaze destroyed the communications satellite, owned by Israel’s Space Communication Ltd, which was scheduled to be carried into orbit two days later. SpaceX has not yet disclosed how much damage was done at its primary launch site. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said on Wednesday the company was hoping to resume flights in November at a second, nearly complete launch pad at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, adjacent to the Air Force base. The company, which has a backlog of 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than $10 billion, also flies from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 17, 2016 at 10:13AM SpaceX's winning streak went up in a ball of fire and a puff of smoke in September. Image source: U.S. 45th Space Wing. Americans love to cheer for an underdog. So let me preface today's column with a hearty three cheers for SpaceX -- the first company to land an orbital rocket back on Earth on its own tailpipe, the first to land a rocket intact at sea, and -- potentially, one day -- the company that will put mankind on Mars. The fact that one small private company, backed by one visionary (and his money), has managed to accomplish so much in such a short period of time (SpaceX is less than 15 years old), and against such entrenched competition from the world's aerospace giants, seems nothing less than extraordinary. But now, let's get real -- and take a really hard look at SpaceX's safety record. Spaceflights for cheap... SpaceX has shaken up the space industry, and not just here in America, where its $62 million rocket rides are cutting off Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) at the knees (their United Launch Alliance joint venture charges twice that). Over in Europe, Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) subsidiary Arianespace says that SpaceX is really the only space company they're worried about. In Russia, Roscosmos is flabbergasted at the Walmart-like everyday low prices that SpaceX advertises. What's even more amazing is that for a while there, SpaceX was doing a pretty good job of beating its competitors at their own game. Up until June 2015, SpaceX had strung together 20 straight successful space launch missions in a row before one of its rockets blew up. And even after stumbling when its CRS-7 mission exploded midflight, SpaceX quickly regained its footing, returning to flight in December last year and sticking its first landing on Earth in the process. Nine successful launches later, though, SpaceX suffered yet another failure. On Sept. 1, a Falcon 9 rocket preparing to send an Israeli telecommunications satellite into orbit exploded on its pad during pre-flight testing. Ever since, SpaceX has been sending out plaintive tweets asking space fans to send "audio, photos or videos of our anomaly" in hopes they will prove "useful for investigation" of the as-yet unsolved mystery. And SpaceX's winning streak has reverted to zero. "Cheap" at a price Now compare that to the records at ULA and Ariane, SpaceX's two chief rivals in space launch. Last week, ULA successfully launched the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission aboard one of its Lockheed-built Atlas V rockets. Its mission: to extract mineral samples from an asteroid and return them to Earth for study. OSIRIS-REx was ULA's 111th straight successful launch, counting missions sent up by both Atlas V and Boeing-built Delta IV launch vehicles. Since ULA was formed in December 2006, it has yet to suffer a single mishap on any of its big rockets -- a near-10-year streak of unbroken success. Airbus' record at Ariane is nearly as stellar, and in some respects even better than ULA's. The company's previous launch vehicle, the Ariane 4, racked up 74 straight successes before its retirement in February 2003. Its current vehicle, the Ariane 5, has flown without a single incident since its inauguration in 2003. Ariane 5's record of 73 straight successes stands within a whisker of beating Ariane 4's record -- and Ariane 5's history of 13 straight years of flight without incident has already outpaced that of ULA (admittedly, mostly because ULA hasn't yet existed for 13 years). Cheapest... and least reliable? If SpaceX keeps blowing up its rockets at the rate of one per year, it's going to be awfully hard for the company to catch up to the rocket launch leaders. But that's more of a marketing problem for SpaceX. Here's where it morphs into a business problem: Currently, SpaceX is the cheapest launch provider in the West. At a base launch cost of $62 million for a Falcon 9, SpaceX launches rockets at a price per ton roughly half that of its nearest competition. And that big price disparity has given SpaceX an enormous advantage in bidding for launch contracts. In just three years, however, Boeing and Lockheed plan to field a new and improved launch vehicle called the Vulcan, which could shrink SpaceX's price advantage considerably from 2019 on out. One year later, Airbus and Ariane will introduce their new and improved rocket called the Ariane 6, which could drop their launch cost to within just 11% of SpaceX's for very large payloads by 2020. At that point, space launch customers will face an interesting dilemma: Do they pinch pennies and save 11% by launching with SpaceX, despite its checkered history of rocket reliability? Do they opt for Ariane's long record of reliable launches, and pay a bit more? Or do they pay even more for ULA's even longer record of safe launches? (And what happens when we move away from robotic spaceflights, and start stuffing humans into the capsules again)? Time will tell. Meanwhile, if SpaceX wants to keep winning customers and stealing market share from its rivals, it's time to start building a record of reliability of its own. With any luck, by the time 2019 and 2020 roll around, its customers won't think to ask this question -- and SpaceX can get back to doing what it does best: Competing on price.

Zhang, who calls himself Craig while in the United States, said many people in China want to become pilots, but it takes much more time in China to get the training. Zhang, 21, said he has wanted to be a pilot since he was a boy. "We come here. We get the knowledge and that's good," he said. "I love to fly. In China, the airspace belongs to military. We can't just go out and do the different maneuvers we do here without getting permission from the military. That takes time." Liu, who chose the name Norman, said he is enjoying his time in the United States. He already is contracted to work for Hainan Airlines, the largest privately owned air transport company and the fourth-largest airline in terms of fleet size in the People's Republic of China. Li, known as Sam, arrived in mid-July and is just beginning his classes. (It has been a tradition since the training school opened that students adopt American first names because their own are difficult to pronounce, according to Craig Anderson, director of Griffith Aviation Inc., which has operated the airport since 1984. They choose names from movies or someone they like and admire.) Zhang, Liu and Li are among 45 Chinese men currently learning to become pilots at the Griffth-Merrillville Airport through an agreement between the airport and the Civil Aviation Flight University of China, at which all are students. Growing need The Civil Aviation Flight University of China is the largest civil aviation university in Asia and the world's largest flight training institution. It is under the direct leadership of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, a government agency. The airport made the arrangement with the flight university in 2007, and the first group of Chinese students began classes in the spring of 2008. Since that time, they have trained nearly 300 Chinese men to be pilots, Anderson said. To date, no women have enrolled in the flight school. As global economies expand and airlines take delivery of tens of thousands of new commercial jetliners over the next 20 years, there is extraordinary demand for people to pilot and maintain these airplanes, according to Boeing's website. To meet this growth, the 2016 Boeing Pilot and Technician Outlook forecasts between now and 2035, the industry will need more than 2 million new aviation personnel - 617,000 commercial airline pilots, 679,000 maintenance technicians and 814,000 cabin crew. The largest growth is expected to be in the Asia-Pacific region where the demand for pilots is estimated at 248,000, according to the website. North America will require 112,000, Europe 104,000, the Middle East 58,000, Latin America 51,000, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)/ Russia 22,000 and Africa 22,000. Anderson said the need for pilots in China and the lack of airspace for training there creates the need for commercial training in the U.S. "When students come over here they haven't flown in China," he said. "They get physicals here. They earn their pilot certificates here. They attend ground school here and earn a private pilot's license, too. They attend classes for 10 to 12 months from 7:30 a.m. to about 6 p.m. each day." Time for flight, time for fun The students live in an apartment complex in Crown Point. While here, they fly to Midway in Chicago, Michigan, Indianapolis and other areas. When the Chinese students graduate from the program at Griffith, they will have commercial pilot certificates with instrument and multi engine ratings. All of them already are contracted to work with an airline in their home country. The airlines pay the cost of the education for the Chinese students in the U.S. Anderson couldn't release the cost because it is confidential. However, he added, that money keeps small airports like the Griffith-Merrillville Airport solvent. Ying said his employer, China Eastern Airlines, which operates international, domestic and regional routes, will require him to do additional ground training when he returns home and will convert his certificates to Chinese. It hasn't been all hard work and study for the Chinese students. They've also visited nearby communities. Ying said they go to Chicago monthly and stop in Chinatown to buy food and meet other Chinese locals. "It's beautiful here and the skies are blue," Ying said. "In China, it's rare to see the blue skies because of the pollution. We see the Gary Air Show and the Chicago Air Show. It was cool." Li said he didn't expect to see such a big city like Chicago. "It's all very interesting," he said.

TrendsMalaysia MH17 plane crash The video, published by the Segodnia.ru website, recalled that as the sole developer and manufacturer of all components of the BUK missile systems, Almaz-Antey held two consecutive experiments to shed the light on what happened to MH17. A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine’s Donetsk Region on July 17, 2014. The lives of 298 people were lost in the tragedy, which took place in an area where Kiev’s troops were battling rebels who are rejecting the coup-imposed central power and battling for the establishment of a self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. Two years after the crash, the official Dutch investigation ruled that the plane was brought down by a Russian-made BUK air defense system, but didn’t name the responsible side. Read more Russian bloggers slam Bellingcat MH17 investigation for ‘falsified evidence’ During the test firings, the Russian arms maker attempted to verify or refute the conclusions of the Dutch-led investigation into the tragedy, and revealed that the experts were wrong about the type of rocket that hit the plane, the place from where it was launched and the spot on the jet’s cockpit where the explosion took place. The international inquiry, however, ignored Almaz-Antey’s findings in an attempt to “make the events fit the already prepared scenario,” the company believes. The video alleges that the Dutch investigators pointed to the wrong type of warhead, having found just a couple of butterfly-shaped holes on the cockpit of the Malaysian Boeing downed over Ukraine. Meanwhile, one of the experiments by Almaz-Antey with same payload has produced dozens of such holes, which suggests that the international experts made a mistake in establishing the exact type of rocket that hit the plane. The angle at which Flight MH17 was hit, and therefore the place from where a missile was launched, were also calculated wrongly by the Dutch investigators, Almaz-Antey said. The plane’s cockpit was perforated by destructive agents during the Russian test. But on the debris of the downed Malaysian jet there were plenty of non-penetrating scratches, which indicate that the destructive agents traveled on a tangential trajectory. Russian arms producer challenges media criticism of its #MH17 crash inquiry – report https://t.co/5J9SH6SCi3— RT (@RT_com) September 15, 2016 The video also draws attention to alleged violations and investigation procedure failures during the MH17 inquiry. Not all of the rubble was collected at the crash site by the Dutch experts, it said. While the collected fragments that contradicted the results that the investigation wanted to achieve were showcased separately from the other parts. “But these are the debris that can drastically change the perception of what happened” to the Malaysian airliner, the authors of the video stressed.

The first flight of the Boeing Max 737 jet: The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15-per-cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. The revamp added about 800 km. or so to their range — just enough to enable the narrow-bodies to span the 4,830 km. between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe.   (Mike Kane / Bloomberg file photo)   By Richard Weiss Andrea Rothman Benjamin KatzBloomberg Fri., Sept. 16, 2016 The smallest aircraft made by Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE are about to find a new role operating trans-Atlantic routes previously the preserve of some of the world’s biggest planes. The re-engined 737 Max and A320neo jets offer a 15-per-cent fuel saving meant to cut costs on the shortest inter-city services. At the same time the revamp has added about 800 km. or so to their range — just enough to enable the narrow-bodies to span the 4,830 km. between the eastern U.S. and Western Europe. While eight hours on a 130-ft. plane with three toilets and one gangway might not immediately appeal to travellers used to the spacious cabins of an Airbus A380, airlines say the smaller jets will open up direct routes that wouldn’t otherwise be viable. That would do away with the need to switch between flights at a busy hub. Article Continued Below At the same time, people can look forward to competitive fares as carriers seek out smaller airports where access charges are lower. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Portugal’s TAP are among airlines buying the jets for trans-Atlantic routes. NAS is set to lead the way when it becomes one of the first carriers to get Boeing’s Max 8 next year. Its initial flights may link Edinburgh, Birmingham in England and Cork and Shannon in Ireland to smaller airports in New England and the New York area. “The Max is very competitive,” Norwegian Air Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kjos said in an interview in London. “It has huge potential from the smaller cities along the Atlantic coast. “But you can’t go into New York as you do with wide-bodies. “You must target airports with a totally different cost structure.” Boeing’s 757, currently the world’s longest single-aisle airliner with around 200 seats and a range in excess of 6,435-km., has been plying the Atlantic for years. Some companies, including United Continental Holdings Inc., are still deploying the model on routes such as Newark, New Jersey, to Birmingham, England. Production ceased in 2004, however, leaving those 757s still flying in the twilight of their lives, their fuel consumption way in excess of that of modern jets. The 737 is itself a fifty-year-old design, still in production but much-tweaked. It and the A320 were designed for much shorter flights. The original 737-100 seated just 85 people and was limited to trips of about 1,930 km. While ranges have increased, the 5,310-km. reach of the 737-800 and -900 is insufficient for fully laden operations on trans-Atlantic routes, where jets must carry enough reserve fuel to fly about 800 km. in an emergency. There is also talk, on such industry websites as AirInsight, of Bombardier’s CSeries twin-engined airliner being used over the Atlantic in a dedicated business-class service, or carrying heavier loads if it turns out, as some have been saying, that the new Canadian jet has greater range than expected. A handful of carriers operate the older narrow-body planes on services at reduced capacity, which cuts the weight of a plane and increases its range. SAS AB serves Boston from Copenhagen using an 86-seat 737-700 and British Airways connects London City airport and New York with an Airbus A318 carrying just 32 passengers. The only current trans-Atlantic 737 or A320 services with a near-normal load are flown by Canada’s WestJet Airlines Ltd. and link St. John’s, Newfoundland, with Dublin, at a distance of about 3,220 km., and Halifax, Nova Scotia, with Glasgow in Scotland. The 737-700s used have 136 seats. The U.K. and Irish routes planned for Norwegian’s 189-seat Max 8s will span about 4,830 km. Subsequent flights could serve Stavanger, Trondheim and Bergen in Norway and Aalborg in Denmark, although they’ll likely involve a long-range version of Airbus’s A321neo known as the LR and able to fly more than 6,435 km. using extra fuel tanks, spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen said. Norwegian ordered 30 of the planes with 220 seats in a single class in July. JetBlue and TAP also plan to deploy the model, which is due to be available from 2019. The U.S. carrier has agreed to buy 30 A321neos with an option to take some as LR variants, saying it wants an aircraft with “trans-Atlantic range.” TAP has orders for 10 A321neoLRs, saying it could use them to serve Brazil and possibly the U.S. Its Lisbon base is about 5,630 km. from both New York and Recife, the South American country’s sixth-largest city. Ireland’s Aer Lingus is also a likely operator of the A321neoLR across the Atlantic, Willie Walsh, CEO of parent company IAG SA, said in July, adding that the jet represents a “fantastic opportunity.” It already flies 757s to locations including Hartford, Connecticut, typical of the cities smaller planes could serve. With the LR emerging as a favoured successor to the 757, Boeing is studying designs for a stretch of its biggest Max 9, dubbed the Max 10, that would offer much of the range and payload of the A321 and could be ready by the decade’s end, or a more elaborate revamp using the larger engines developed for the Airbus jet. It’s also working on a new family of mid-range aircraft that would debut about five years later, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Wednesday. Passengers seem certain to be making longer trips on the smallest class of jetliners in coming years.

Liow Tiong Lai told Anadolu Agency on Friday that both the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the MH370 Safety Investigation Team will look into details of debris confirmed to belong to the aircraft to determine the falling mode of MH370 in March 2014. "The teams will examine into other details now and study how the accident happened -- whether it was a controlled or uncontrolled ditch into the sea," he said in a telephone conversation. The minister had earlier dismissed a report claiming that evidence had shown that MH370 was deliberately crashed into the Indian Ocean by its pilot, and underlined that the ATSB had reported the incident was an "uncontrolled ditch". His comments Friday come a day after he confirmed that a piece of debris -- an inboard flap of a Boeing 777 -- found in Tanzania last June originated from MH370. In a statement late Thursday, Liow said the debris was determined to be from the missing aircraft after several numbers as well as its physical appearance and dimensions were found to match those of the ill-fated flight. "A date stamp indicated that it was manufactured on Jan 23, 2002, and consistent with the May 31, 2002, delivery date for MH370,” Liow said. "Besides the Boeing part number, all identification stamps have a second OL number which are unique identifiers relating to the part," the minister highlighted. He added that an Italian parts manufacturer had confirmed that all numbers located on the recovered debris relate to the same outboard flap shipped to Boeing and delivered to Malaysia Airlines. Flight MH370, carrying 239 passengers and crew, disappeared from radar shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur enroute to Beijing on March 8, 2014. The jetliner has yet to be found despite massive search operations in the southern Indian Ocean where the aircraft was believed to have ended its flight after diverting from its original route. The search and rescue mission -- which began immediately after -- involved some 160 assets as well as experts from 25 countries. To-date, at least six pieces of aircraft debris found along Africa’s east coast have been confirmed as “almost certainly” coming from MH370 . After 10 months of intensive undersea search for the vanished flight, on Jan. 29 2015 Malaysia declared that MH370 was lost in an accident, killing all passengers. On July 29 last year, a piece of aircraft debris was found washed ashore on the French island, east of Madagascar. The debris -- believed to be from a Boeing 777 -- was sent to Toulouse, France, for analysis the following day. Days after, Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that the flaperon was from MH370, and that the flight indeed ended in the Indian Ocean. On July 22, ministers from Malaysia, Australia and China decided during a tripartite meeting to suspend the search operations for MH370, after competing the current earmarked 120,000-square kilometer search area.

X Travel Warrior: Aircraft sales set to gain altitude in China, says Boeing Growth in air travel predicted to rise 6.4 per cent annually over next 20 years Fri, Sep 16, 2016, 05:00 Joan Scales China is predicted to spend more than $1,025 trillion on aircraft over the next two decades.         Boeing has revised upwards the 2015 estimate of the number of aircraft China airlines will order from 6,330 to 6,810 over the next two decades. China will spend more than $1,025 trillion (€915 billion) on aircraft. The order is part of China’s 13th five-year plan, which began this year. Air travel is booming in China with a new middle class taking overseas trips. Growth is expected to rise 6.4 per cent annually over the next 20 years. China is also expected to overtake the United States in business travel in the next year. Concur, the expense management company owned by SAP, is to acquire the online travel company Hipmunk. Established in 2010 with funding of $20 million, Hipmunk offers flight searches and accommodation including hotels and Airbnb rentals. Concur allows employees to book travel in compliance with company policy. Hipmunk chief executive Adam Goldstein said: “This combination with Concur means we can do a even better job for frequent travellers.” Instead of channel-hopping when you stay in a Marriott hotel, how about browsing the inspirational offerings from TED? A partnership between the two companies will mean offerings of talks, blogs and quotes with a different theme each quarter. TED will curate content for Marriott guests delivered over in-room entertainment systems and wifi. Marriott regulars will have a chance to attend a series of five TED Talks Fellows salons at properties in Washington state, London, Dubai, Bangkok and Santiago. Between now and December 2nd, British Airways is giving free upgrades to first class to some of its business-class passengers. In an effort to increase the profile of Club World and first class, some lucky travellers will get an upgrade in one direction. Your upgrade can be free when you book an eligible R. D, or C class, or a full flexible J-class fare for travel up to December 23rd. You cannot book it online it has to be booked direct with BA or through a licensed travel agent.

Carry on: Boeing stretches 737, China’s trillion-dollar fleet and more Nevil Gibson WEEKEND REVIEW Friday September 16, 2016 Share Boeing 737-8 Max In Carry On, Nevil Gibson reveals Boeing's plans for a bigger 737 Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Boeing to stretch 737 Max Boeing is studying two designs for its so-called Max 10, a potential stretch of its largest 737 aimed at making up ground on Airbus’ longest single-aisle jet. One option is a simple lengthening of the 737 Max 9 that would offer much of the range and payload of Airbus’s A321neo. The alternative is a more elaborate revamp that would feature a larger new generation engine option (neo). The upgraded Max 9 version could enter the market by early 2020, while the more complex one wouldn’t begin service until almost two years later. Airbus, meanwhile, has already received almost 1300 orders for the A321neo, with a long-range version scheduled to begin commercial operation in 2019. Boeing tips trillion-dollar fleet for China Boeing says in a new forecast that China will be the first country with a trillion-dollar airline fleet. The manufacturer says Chinese airlines are likely to purchase 6810 planes worth $US1.025 trillion in the next 20 years. This estimate is 7.6% higher than the 6330 aircraft predicted last year. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes... gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," says Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing. China’s passenger traffic is forecast to increase 6.4% annually over the next 20 years. Singapore turns back on A380 Singapore Airlines (SIA) won't be renewing the lease on the first ever Airbus A380 to enter service. The 10-year lease expires next month and four others are on a similar arrangement. SIA has a total of 19 A380s in its fleet and is not ordering any more. In July, Airbus said it would slash production of the A380 to 12 planes a year in 2018 from 27 last year due to lack of orders. National Travel Industry Awards Air New Zealand collected two awards – best international airline online and best agency support. Etihad Airways was named best international airline offline.

Meanwhile, the A350 will continue to operate Bangkok-Chiang Mai and Bangkok-Phuket routes during this period. Qantas to replace Jetstar on Melbourne-Tokyo Qantas will fly direct flight from Melbourne to Tokyo (Narita) from December 16. The route will add 297 seats with the operation of a two-class A330-300. Jetstar will continue to operate on the route until February 25, 2017, when its flights will cease.

The number of Australians travelling to Japan increased 24% in 2015. American codeshares with Jetstar American Airlines has expanded its codeshare partnership with Jetstar in New Zealand to the  Auckland-Napier/Hastings,  Auckland-Nelson  and Auckland-Palmerston North routes. Other route news of the week Hong Kong Airlines, which starts operating to Auckland in November, is to expand its only service to Australia from three to five times a week. The expanded Hong Kong-Gold Coast-Cairns-Hong Kong service will operate from November 9. Air Niugini is launching a service to Micronesia. From, December 3 it will operate Fokker 70 aircraft with on a   Port Moresby-Chuuk-Pohnpei-Port Moresby and a   Port Moresby-Pohnpei-Chuuk-Port Moresby.

Politik Wirtschaft Wissenschaft Energie & Klima Kultur Medien Magazin Telepolis Politik Our 9/11 Our 9/11 18. September 2016 Mathias Bröckers Gedenken 2004: Tribute in Light. Bild: Derek Jensen, Public Domain Affirmation replaces criticism: the "Church of Free Fall" In August this year I received a note requesting advice on a new project. As the project in question was rather unique in scope - dealing as it did with founding a new religious order or church - the signatories of the note requested that I preserve their anonymity should I decide to report on their activities. Doing so would be quite welcome, though, "to gain first insights into the potential reach of such a project." The note continued: "Now that almost 15 years have passed and the crimes of September 11, 2001, have yet to be prosecuted or the true perpetrators and instigators of the crime identified and named, investigations that deserve that name cannot be expected to happen for decades yet. As understandable and as legitimate as it may be to continue demanding the truth about 9/11 and for a decent crime investigation into the gruesome mass murder that happened on that day, it is unfortunately just as illusory and unrealistic to expect the demands to be met in real life. Given that the official legends promulgated by governments and media alike are thus going to continue to stand as truths, realpolitik tells us that rational arguments are no longer any use against them. Wherever legends have become official "true history" and have been declared state creeds on which governments base their power politics, rational critique has become obsolete. It is for these reasons that we propose to found a new creed that states clearly its unshakable belief in the official stories of 9/11 and which celebrates the miraculous promotion of these myths to the ranks of solidly governmentally verified truths. As this involves in part violations of the laws of nature and statistics as well as those of logic or common sense, we have decided on a working title of "Church of Free Fall" for our project. We are working to achieve official recognition as a religious order for the "C. o. F. F.". The C.o.F.F. - despite originating as a secular "knowledge community" -has its very own founding myths and miracles that are in no way inferior to those of established churches, as its Credo as attached below amply demonstrates. The Credo has been adopted officially by the International Section of the preliminary C.o.F.F. Episcopate, to serve as a firm foundation of the religious community. Further extensions of the Credo, including additional fundamental beliefs, dogmas, and rituals, are currently under development. The C.o.F.F. Credo bows to a realpolitik of war, observation, and "security" that has arisen from the dust and ashes of the WTC towers. The C.o.F.F. replaces strength-by-refusal with the joy of affirmation, celebrates the insanity of reality as well as the truly just Great War on Terror. Instead of fighting its enemies, the C.o.F.F. embraces its enemy in a stranglehold. You are welcome to publish our manifest." Which I will do forthwith: We trust in the one suitcase of 200 Which got left at the gate And which revealed all the proof We might ever have needed: Teaching videos on how to fly a Boeing plane, Instructions for airplane hijackers, A Hamburg, Germany, registration form, A diploma granted by the Technical University of Hamburg, And the Final Will and Testament of Mohammed Atta, The "Leader" of the hijackers. We believe That that man wished to carry his testament With him onto his suicide mission, Just in case his deadly flight Failed to end in an enormous ball of fire. Or because he figured His testament naturally indestructible, Just like the passport of his fellow hijacker Al Sugami That was discovered unscathed next to the WTC. We believe That two airplanes are able to Bring down three skyscrapers The first time ever in the history of construction That steel framed skyscrapers became Pulverized by burgeoning fires alone, While a plastic-and-paper passport Is able to survive the inferno unscathed. We believe In the Free Fall In which burning office furniture Brought down WTC7 so fast That the BBC was able to report it 20 minutes beforehand. We believe That Hani Hanjour might have been bad at flying small aircraft, Bad enough for the rental agency to refuse to rent him a Cessna, But that he did succeed in hitting the Pentagon From behind at ten feet above the ground Descending with a jumbo jet at 500 mph In an ingenious curve around the building. We believe That he did not just keep on flying straight Into the offices of the Pentagon Chiefs Because he wished to make air navigation history Through an ingenious maneuver taking him "Once around the most highly secured building of the world" Along with aces of the air like the Red Baron before him. We believe That the total absence of an air defense Not just above the Pentagon But above the entire U.S. air space Had nothing whatsoever to do With the "war games" that Were taking place that morning. We believe That "nobody could ever have imagined That terrorists would ever fly a hijacked plane into a building" (CONDOLEZZA RICE) Despite the fact that these war games Were using as a war scenario precisely what was happening that day, Namely the hijacking of passenger airplanes. We believe That Osama Bin Laden masterminded this "Surprise attack" from a cave in Afghanistan Even when the FBI announces it has no proof of his complicity in the attack, And even when he himself refused to take any credit whatsoever for Taking part in that particular act of terror In his first interview after, on Sept. 18, 2001. Bild: Robert J. Fisch/CC BY-SA 2.0 We believe That he and his 19 "hijackers", armed with nothing but box cutters, Were solely responsible for succeeding in this attack, Despite the fact that due to totally bogus visas 15 of them would never even have reached U.S. soil Had not the U.S. Consulate in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, Simply waved through the lot of them. We believe That the CIA never had any idea of this Even if a visa official of that consulate, Michael Springman, became a whistleblower Because his office was constantly being used To funnel suspicious Arab "freedom fighters" Into the U.S.A. We believe That the Saudi security service had no idea either And that it was purely as an act of charity That the "terror logistics expert" Al Midhar And his colleague Al Hazmi received Monthly stipends from the wife of Royal Ambassador to the U.S., Prince Bandar, during their stay in San Diego. We believe That the Pakistani secret service had nothing to do with 9/11 either, Whose chief, General Ahmad, was having breakfast in Washington on 9/11 With the heads of the secret service oversight committees of House and Senate, Bob Graham and Porter Goss, And who shortly after resigned without a word When word got out that his secret agent Omar Saeed Sheikh Transferred 100,000 U.S. Dollars of funds to Mohammed Atta. We believe That neither was Israel's Mossad involved Even if five of its agents were arrested in New York City Filming themselves triumphing and showing victory signs With the WTC towers burning in the background Only to claim on a TV talk show in their home country, Where they had quietly been deported to, They had been in New York City "to document the events". We believe That it was simply a hugely unlucky chain of events That all these ever vigilant secret services "failed" their duties And a truly unlucky chain of unlucky events that enabled Osama and his 19 box cutter wielding hijackers To pulverize three skyscrapers all by themselves And to murder 3000 people. We believe In George W. Bush's warning to the United Nations General Assembly: "We must speak the truth about terror. Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th; malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists, themselves, away from the guilty." We believe That only malicious liars, outrageous conspiracy theorists, Intolerable anti-Semites and notorious anti-Americans, Enemies of freedom and friends of terrorism Can deny the truths of the 9/11 Commission's Final Report After all, it includes the undeniable confessions of an accomplice By the name of Khalid Sheikh Mohamed. We believe In the truth of these confessions Even if they were extracted in 182 torture sessions During which the prisoner was subjected to waterboarding Because only malicious heretics and crazy conspiracy theorists Who also believe in aliens from outer space or who have been infested by the devil Would question the investigations into 9/11 Or much less request a completely new re-investigation. We believe In our democratic media of repute Who recognize the divisive poison in these doubts And pillory those who heinously try to spread it To strengthen the belief of our Brothers and Sisters In the Holy Script of the 9/11 Report And in our governing bodies that proclaim it In defense of our freedom and security. Let us therefore pray: Our 9/11 Thou camest from out of the blue sky Hallowed be thy name Thy GWOT* has come Whose will be done With drones in the heavens As it is with wars on Earth. Give us this day our daily budgets (the fall of the Soviet Union had put those very much in question, after all) And never forgive a terrorist As thy GWOT* just keeps on Creating new ones daily And lead us not into temptation To deliver ourselves from the evils of a war Without end and without an end. For thine is the imperial kingdom And the military power And "Full Spectrum Dominance" For ever Amen. *Great War On Terror © C.o.F.F.

Trends Malaysia MH17 plane crash The video, published by the Serodnia.ru website, recalled that as the sole developer and manufacturer of all components of the BUK missile systems, Almaz-Antey held two consecutive experiments to shed the light on what happened to MH17. A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down over Ukraine’s Donetsk Region on July 17, 2014. The lives of 298 people were lost in the tragedy, which took place in an area where Kiev’s troops were battling rebels who are rejecting the coup-imposed central power and battling for the establishment of a self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. Two years after the crash, the official Dutch investigation ruled that the plane was brought down by a Russian-made BUK air defense system, but didn’t name the responsible side. A crane moves wreckage at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 © Maxim Zmeyev Russian bloggers slam Bellingcat MH17 investigation for ‘falsified evidence’ During the test firings, the Russian arms maker attempted to verify or refute the conclusions of the Dutch-led investigation into the tragedy, and revealed that the experts were wrong about the type of rocket that hit the plane, the place from where it was launched and the spot on the jet’s cockpit where the explosion took place. The international inquiry, however, ignored Almaz-Antey’s findings in an attempt to “make the events fit the already prepared scenario,” the company believes. The video alleges that the Dutch investigators pointed to the wrong type of warhead, having found just a couple of butterfly-shaped holes on the cockpit of the Malaysian Boeing downed over Ukraine. Meanwhile, one of the experiments by Almaz-Antey with same payload has produced dozens of such holes, which suggests that the international experts made a mistake in establishing the exact type of rocket that hit the plane. The angle at which Flight MH17 was hit, and therefore the place from where a missile was launched, were also calculated wrongly by the Dutch investigators, Almaz-Antey said. The plane’s cockpit was perforated by destructive agents during the Russian test. But on the debris of the downed Malaysian jet there were plenty of non-penetrating scratches, which indicate that the destructive agents traveled on a tangential trajectory. The video also draws attention to alleged violations and investigation procedure failures during the MH17 inquiry. Not all of the rubble was collected at the crash site by the Dutch experts, it said. While the collected fragments that contradicted the results that the investigation wanted to achieve were showcased separately from the other parts. “But these are the debris that can drastically change the perception of what happened” to the Malaysian airliner, the authors of the video stressed. rt.com Tags Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 Previous article Alabama pipeline ruptures, leaking 250,000 gallons & causing ‘fuel emergency’ → Next article Putin: We don’t approve of WADA hackers, but information they leaked raises questions → Comments Deja un comentario Cancelar respuesta Tu dirección de correo electrónico no será publicada.

The anti-drones market is estimated to be at $209.77 million in 2016. Anti-drone systems are used to detect, identify and neutralize rogue drones. These systems uses different technologies such as jamming, high energy lasers, directed energy weapons, command and control (C2), electro-optical surveillance, electronic surveillance and RF threat management to detect and neutralize unmanned aerial vehicles. The high growth of anti-drones market in aerospace and defense industry is majorly attributed to increasing security breach by unidentified drones. Various instances, for example, incidents when a drone crashed at the White House lawn, a flying machine overflew the nuclear facilities at France and the near misses to an aircraft at the airports across the world have triggered the need for anti-drone systems. For instance, in April 2016, an incident at San Francisco where a British Airways flight was hit by a drone causing slight damage to the aircraft which raised serious safety concerns. Thus, the growing number of incidents by unknown drones is a primary driver for development of the market. Moreover, there are a number of opportunities for counter-UAV systems in defense and non-defense applications. Anti-drone systems use different modes of engaging the threats such as kinetic system, laser system, and electronic system. The laser systems accommodate for the highest share in terms of value. The technology is being used to shoot small UAVs using a high energy laser beam. Some of the defense prime contractors such as Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Rheinmetall Defense Electronics are using laser technology for their anti-drone systems. Due to technological innovation, electronics system has been observed to be a powerful tool to be used in anti-drones systems. Hence, it is expected to grow at a faster CAGR in the forecast period. The anti-drone systems vary according to its usage in military and commercial applications. The increase in the terrorism, drone attacks, and borders infraction are some of the factors driving the defense market. The increase in the R&D activities by the defense prime contractors and illicit activities has resulted in the highest revenue of the defense segment. Globally, the usage of commercial drones has considerably increased which has posed a serious threat to the public safety and the violation of privacy. Moreover, there is an impending need for anti-drone systems at airports, prisons, events, and critical infrastructure that has driven the non-defense segment to grow at a faster rate. North America is currently dominating the anti-drones market; however, the geographical analysis of this market unveils a great potential for growth in the Asian countries. According to the analysis, the U.S. will grow at a faster rate; accommodating majority of the revenue. Recently, Federal Aviation Administration initiated a Pathfinder Programme and selected Anti-UAV Defense System (AUDS) to start a trail phase to protect the major U.S. airports from drones. Similarly, in 2015, France has started a program named Project Angel as that focuses on 18-months study on counter-UAV systems. Russia, China and Canada are also expected to have a decent rate of growth from 2016-2021. Key Topics Covered: Executive Summary 1. Research Scope and Methodology 2.

U.S. finalizes rule to limit gas ‘flaring’ at drilling sites In Pittsburgh's neighborhoods, a natural gas leak every 2 miles Army Corps wants more study on Dakota Access oil pipeline Even without the cracker, Shell’s industrial site is impressive Home About Companies Consumers Policy Energy Jobs Energy Forum Login Register Logout Login Register Logout Home About Companies Consumers Policy Energy Jobs Energy Forum Login Register Logout Advertisement Good Jobs First exec sheds more light on corporate subsidies September 17, 2016 12:00 AM Lake Fong/Post-Gazette Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, gives a thumbs-up before talking to an audience at Carnegie Mellon University. An artist's rendering of the cracker plant courtesy of Shell. By Len Boselovic / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Tweet Email Pennsylvania taxpayers are providing $1.65 billion in incentives for Shell’s Beaver County ethane cracker plant, but they will have to share benefits generated by the project with other states, according to an expert on government subsidies who spoke Friday at Carnegie Mellon University. “The Royal Dutch Shell deal is going to leak into Ohio and West Virginia,” Good Jobs First executive director Greg LeRoy said at a Heinz College forum attended by about 70 students and economic development officials. “I have to assume a lot of the benefits will go to your neighbors,” Mr. LeRoy said. Good Jobs First, based in Washignton, D.C., has compiled a database of about $250 billion in tax breaks, grants, low-cost loans and other subsidies that federal, state and local governments have provided to businesses. According to Mr. LeRoy, those subsidies are conservatively worth about $70 billion annually. His organization believes much of that is money poorly spent. Outsized incentive packages like the $8.7 billion the state of Washington provided to Boeing leaves states paying an average of $658,000 for every job created, Mr. LeRoy said. Sixteen states allow companies to keep state income taxes they deduct from their workers’ paychecks, he said. Because taxes are such a small part of business expenses, “Incentives almost never matter,” he told the audience. PG graphic: “Free” enterprise? (Click image for larger version) Shell was vigorously courted by Pennsylvania officials, who believe the incentives are an excellent investment in the region’s economy. Shell has said building the complex will create 6,000 jobs and that the plant will employ 600 when it opens. The debate over whether the subsidies are a good investment or corporate welfare may become a little more informed when a new accounting rule requires many governments to disclose how much tax revenue they are losing by providing the subsidies. The rule was approved last year by the Government Accounting Standards Board, a Norwalk, Conn., body that oversees government accounting rules. Pennsylvania’s 66 counties, 516 school districts, and state colleges and universities are required by law to comply with the government accounting standards. But the state’s more than 2,400 municipalities are not. Governments that are required to comply must start reporting the foregone tax revenue for fiscal years that began after Dec. 15, 2016. The new rule only requires each subsidy program to provide an overall cost figure. No company-specific data will be disclosed unless a government does it voluntarily. Even though Mr. LeRoy would have preferred a stronger standard, he told the audience the new standard “will change the debate forever.” One of the biggest impacts will be on school districts, which have little to say when governments exempt businesses from paying property taxes, the biggest source of education funding. “Property tax breaks are going to come out of the shadows,” Mr. LeRoy said in an interview. He expects a cottage industry of companies will spring up over the next few years to analyze the data in the disclosures. He is hopeful the additional information will lead to a more informed debate about the impact of the foregone tax revenue on education and other government services.

Mark Crawford, Contributing Editor Q3 2016 By most reports, Mexico’s economy is doing well. Although there were some rough spots, Mexico’s overall economic performance in 2015 was solid, with promising projections for 2016 and 2017. Related Research Do Free-Trade Agreements Represent Fair Trade? The Case for Supplier Parks in the Automotive Supply Chain Auto/Aero Firms Redrawing the Map Criteria for Selecting a High-Tech Cluster The Mexican economy experienced an annual rate of growth of 2.5 percent during 2015, which helped keep the unemployment rate low (about 4.2 percent in January 2016). Over the first three months of 2016 the Mexican economy grew at a rate of 2.6 percent. Further, according to A.T. Kearney, GDP growth is expected to average 2.6 percent over the next three years, thanks to an expanding middle class, a robust manufacturing sector, and proximity to the U.S. market. Even with low oil prices, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects Mexico’s GDP growth to reach 3 percent in 2017, reflecting the positive impact of new government reforms. The current administration of Enrique Nieto Peña hopes to attract US$150 billion in new FDI over its six-year term with $30 billion of that targeted for 2016 Much of this economic growth is anchored by manufacturing. Exports account for more than 30 percent of the country’s economic output, and overall trade as a percentage of GDP now exceeds 60 percent, outpacing even China. Exports from Mexico totaled US$380.8 billion in 2015, with about 84 percent of these products shipped to North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, the United States and Canada. In addition to its economic performance, good business climate, and increased trade, Mexico’s new political reforms and improved government stability are making it more attractive to foreign investors, especially manufacturing companies. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Mexico ranks 10th in the world for FDI investment. FDI inflows in 2015 totaled about US$21.5 billion. The 2016 A.T. Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence Index ranks Mexico 18th in the world, with most of its investors being industrial firms headquartered in the Americas. The Mexican government is committed to increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in key sectors by breaking up cartels, reducing corruption, and improving competition. The current administration of Enrique Nieto Peña hopes to attract US$150 billion in new FDI over its six-year term, with $30 billion of that targeted for 2016, especially in the automotive, medical device, aerospace, and electronics industries. Manufacturing-Driven Manufacturing accounts for about one third of Mexico’s total economic output. Seven of the top-10 exporting groups are manufactured products. Expand Close Manufacturing accounts for about one third of Mexico’s total economic output. Seven of the top-10 exporting groups are manufactured products. Factors that make Mexico ideal for manufacturing are its strategic location between North and South America, political stability, shipping infrastructure, and lower labor costs with higher productivity/quality compared to other low-cost countries, especially China. Mexico’s many free-trade agreements (FTAs) with more than 40 countries, and incentive programs with others, make it an attractive location for foreign investors to set up manufacturing operations. “The benefits that Mexico offers to manufacturers include competitive wages, growth prospects thanks to an open-trade philosophy, reliable infrastructure, proximity to the U.S., an educated workforce, and a growing supplier base,” notes Doug Donahue, vice president of Business Development for Entrada Group, which helps manufacturers locate in Mexico. “These factors combine to make Mexico a location any manufacturer seeking growth has to consider.” Key Industry Clusters Automotive: The top manufacturing industry in Mexico is automotive. Mexico became the world’s seventh-largest auto producer in 2015. It now produces more vehicles than Brazil and is projected to be the world’s fifth-largest vehicle producer by 2020. More than three-quarters of the vehicles are exported to the U.S. and Canada. Mexico is also a top supplier of automotive parts to the U.S. As a result, Mexico’s automotive sector has attracted steady foreign investment. For example, FDI from European and Asian car manufacturers includes recent investments from Nissan and Volkswagen — whose global delivery center in Mexico is the company’s largest production site outside its German headquarters. Lear, a leader in automotive seating and electrical systems, in Ramos Arizpe Industrial Park, Coahuila “In all, some US$15 billion of additional investment in automotive capacity is anticipated before the end of the decade,” reports Deloitte in its May 2015 report entitled “Competitiveness: Catching the Next Wave, Mexico.” Electronics: Electronics is another major manufacturing industry in Mexico, which began with the foreign-owned maquiladoras that developed along the U.S. border decades ago. Electronics manufacturing operations have advanced considerably since then in terms of size, technology, and supply chain sophistication. Electronics clusters are located close to the manufacturing industries they serve — for example, a northwest cluster supplies parts for nearby automotive and aerospace facilities; to the northeast, electronics manufacturers serve computer and appliance companies. The largest and most sophisticated cluster is in Guadalajara, home to more than 400 manufacturers that employ about 50,000 workers — sometimes called the Silicon Valley of Mexico. Eight of the top 10 contract electronic manufacturers have operations in Guadalajara. In fact, Guadalajara’s high-tech industry — led by electronics — provides 60 percent of the state of Jalisco’s total exports. Aerospace: Although it is still a relatively small industry, aerospace is emerging as a growth area for high-value production. Mexico’s aerospace industry has grown from 100 manufacturers in 2004 to over 300 in 2016; major U.S. players with operations in Mexico include Gulfstream Aerospace/General Dynamics, General Electric, Textron, and Honeywell. Other nations with an aerospace presence in Mexico include France (Safran Group), Canada (Bombardier Aerospace), the Netherlands (Fokker), and Spain (Aernnova). A significant engine-component cluster is located around Guaymas, in the state of Sonora. NKPM, a logistics provider for Honda and other suppliers, in Bajio Industrial Park, Guanajuato Research and development is also happening in Mexico. For example, Boeing, Aeromexico, and the Mexican government are working together to develop sustainable biofuels to protect the environment and reduce costs. “Boeing and Aeromexico and other key stakeholders are collaborating to move Mexico’s sustainable aviation biofuel industry forward,” says Marc Allen, president of Boeing International. “Sustainable jet fuel will play a critical role in reducing aviation’s carbon emissions and will bring a new and innovative industry to Mexico.” Oil and gas: Perhaps the greatest political triumph for the Enrique Nieto Peña administration is the reform program that will allow foreign companies to explore for oil in Mexico — the first time this has happened since 1938. This creates open competition with government-owned Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), which should stimulate considerable foreign investment. However, the current low oil prices have made oil and gas companies reluctant to invest capital until the industry improves. In 2015, foreign investors did win several bids on exploration lands, including Italian national oil company Eni and several consortia led by oil companies from Argentina, the Netherlands, Canada, and the United States. Oil and gas companies are also highly interested in the potential for shale gas across Mexico. Also, when oil prices turn around and exploration ramps up, significant FDI will likely be spent on pipeline improvements, oil storage, and other refining infrastructure. Telecommunications: Growth in this sector has been hampered in the past by poor coverage, not enough modern infrastructure, and only a few key players, creating a cartel structure for telecommunications and television broadcasting as well. For example, one company, América Móvil, controlled 70 percent of the mobile phone market and 80 percent of the nation’s fixed lines. Reforms passed in 2014, however, have reduced the influence of these controlling companies, which is attracting foreign companies into this emergent marketplace. For example, U.S. firm AT&T recently acquired two Mexican telecom companies — lusacell for $2.5 billion in November 2014 and Nextel Mexico for $1.9 billion in 2015. A Promising Future Reforms to major markets, improved labor laws, and concerted efforts to reduce corruption and crime have accelerated foreign interest in investing in Mexico. In fact, according to Deloitte, “Mexico’s medium-term growth could average 4.5 percent per year, up from a projected 3.1 percent real annual growth rate for 2015-2034, if the government can deliver its broad reform initiatives.” Further, if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is enacted, it could foster even greater foreign investment, “raising Mexico’s longer-term growth rate by close to 1 percentage point.” Momentum will quickly stall, however, if the Mexican government falters on enforcing reforms and other economic initiatives, including anti-corruption measures. And, with manufacturing creating one third of the country’s GDP, it is important for the government to invest in critical infrastructure, such as transportation and border crossings, to support its growing manufacturing sectors and to attract more FDI. Also, the lack of key infrastructure and adequate water in prime oil-and-gas exploration areas could discourage energy-investing in these territories. “As Mexico begins to break up longstanding monopolies and push forward with a number of significant reforms, “it will continue to open its economy more fully to global trade and competition,” states Deloitte in conclusion. “There are a number of opportunities that suggest the country’s competitive future should be bright.” Mark Crawford, Contributing Editor Mark Crawford is a full-time freelance writer in Madison, Wisconsin, who specializes in business writing.

They were guys he met online. “Looking at them in a bar, you would have no idea,” Hillman said. ”They’re just normal guys.” The men worked for some of the region’s most prominent employers: Microsoft, Boeing, Amazon. One was a radiologist. Another was a dentist.   During their meetups in local bars, the men would discuss their “hobby” — hiring Korean prostitutes. “I remember sitting there the first time, and I was just like ... looking around, praying that nobody would see me sitting with these guys and would hear what they were saying,” Hillman said. The men didn’t know that Hillman, the man they had invited into their elite circle, was actually an undercover detective. Law enforcement is beginning to take notice of so-called “John boards” — review sites where customers rate prostitutes. The men busted in this Seattle group earlier this year exposed a secretive world where online sex buyers are treading on a whole new level of criminal behavior. The men had met on TheReviewBoard.net (that now leads to a notice saying it was seized by the King County Sheriff's Office). It’s one of many sites across the country where men rate prostitutes. Investigators estimate the Review Board had between 15,000 and 20,000 members. The men would describe a woman's weight, race, breast size, which sex acts she was willing to perform and her hourly rate. Hillman wrote fake reviews and was invited to join a subgroup that called itself “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.” Police documents show they were spending $300 per session, multiple times a week. Screen capture from the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen’s password-protected website showing activity and handles of active members. - Photo courtesy of King County Sheriff’s Office The League attracted the attention of law enforcement not because its members bought a lot of sex, but because of how they worked together. The men wrote glowing reviews to draw customers to their favorite women. That kept the women in town longer and encouraged the seven agencies supplying the women to send new prospects their way. “So they were really operating as pimps,” said Valiant Richey, a senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County and one of the lead attorneys on the case.  “They’re charged with promoting prostitution because they expanded the market, they facilitated visits to these women, they connected new buyers to the women and helped with the screening process." After six months of undercover surveillance, law enforcement closed in. They busted eight brothels. A dozen Korean women were offered human trafficking victim services and released. Surveillance video recorded by undercover detective Luke Hillman of the King County Sheriff’s Office during one of The League’s meet-ups in a Seattle bar November 10, 2015. In this clip, League leader Charles Peters describes the growing number of “K-girls” (Korean prostitutes) in the area and concerns that the market has gotten too large. The league’s website and the larger website, the Review Board, were seized. “We’ve just taken down one small tentacle of what’s going on,” said King County Sheriff John Urquhart at a news conference announcing the arrests in January. “There are still umpteen websites out there that we haven’t gotten to — yet.” Instead of charging the 16 league members with buying sex, a misdemeanor, they were charged with promoting prostitution — a felony. More than half have pleaded guilty. At his sentencing, one of the men, Paul Rhinehart, expressed remorse and said he’d been drawn into friendships and lost perspective. “I took on a misguided feeling that this was a community like other legitimate communities,” he told the court. About 15 percent of American men buy sex at some point. Only a small fraction of them are “hobbyists” like the men in Seattle. This review board is gone, but it has left a digital trail that could help law enforcement come to a better understanding of how frequent buyers operate. Alex Trouteaud of youthSpark in Atlanta studied the data on North American sex buyers. He found 5 percent of them account for nearly half of illegal sex transactions. In order to feed their habit, these buyers need to find new sources of sex and avoid the cops. That means they have to share intel. “'John boards are far and away the fastest and easiest place to find these individuals,” Trouteaud said.  Prosecutors said the Seattle case opened up a new window into the sex trade, where internet crowdsourcing allows buyers to work together to blur the lines between supply and demand.   This story was produced with Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Wearable computing vendors such as Honeywell International Inc. and Zebra Technologies Corp. could see a steep jump in sales by 2021, as retailers and logistics providers are on track to triple their spending on wearable scanners for fulfillment work, a report says. Led by demand from the warehousing, manufacturing, and transportation industries, global shipments of wearable scanners are forecast to reach nearly 22 million units by 2021, up from seven million units in 2016, according to the London-based analyst firm ABI Research. Companies such as Amazon.com Inc., Boeing Co., Deutsche Post DHL Group, FedEx Corp., IBM Corp., and UPS Inc. need a more efficient way for their workers to scan barcodes on packages during picking and packing operations, the firm says. In response, wearable computing devices are quickly migrating from consumer applications like the Fitbit and Apple Watch to business tasks such as warehousing and fulfillment, according to the ABI report "Enterprise Wearable Scanner and Reader Technologies: Devices, use cases, and supplier ecosystem analysis." That trend is driving demand for products such as wearable ring scanners from Honeywell and Zebra, glove scanners from manufacturers like ProGlove, and smart glasses from providers such as Vuzix Corp., ABI says. "Wearable scanners boost business productivity, offering workers a faster, hands-free alternative to the need for traditional hand-held scanners and paper picklists," Stephanie Lawrence, an ABI research analyst, said in a statement. "Ring barcode scanners, glove scanners, and smart glasses are the most popular forms, which, depending on the device type, allow their wearers to scan barcodes, record processes, and access information without interruption." #Logistics #Automatic Data Capture Resources Mentioned In This Article ABI Research Amazon.com Boeing Inc.

This research report titled 'Global CFD Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. The report presents the vendor landscape and the corresponding detailed analysis of the major vendors in the market based on revenue. The report, also, considers the revenue obtained from the sales of software licenses. The aerospace and defense industry manufacturers are facing high pressure to reduce the product development cycle. CFD is mainly used in the second stage of the product development cycle. In the designing stage, the simulation and optimization processes are carried out using software such as computer-aided engineering (CAE) software. The designing stage is a vital stage in the product development life cycle as it can reduce the time and cost of production of aerospace and defense products. Hence, industries are highly dependent on the software to reduce product development cycle time. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52389 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio's ICT analysts categorize the global CFD market into four major end-user segments. They are: Aerospace and defense industry Automotive industry Electrical and electronics industry Others Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=52389 Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question about this market and they will have your answer within 24 hours. Aerospace and defense industry The aerospace and defense industry accounted for a market share of almost 41% in the global CFD market in 2015. Most of the major players in the market are owned or controlled by the governments of their countries and consider the revenue generation as confidential. In 2015, the high adoption of CFD by companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, General Dynamics, and Bombardier Aerospace for R&D activities contributed to the growth of the global CFD market. The aerospace and defense industry also had high R&D investments in 2014 and 2015. Before the evolution of CFD, aircraft manufacturing companies used wind tunnel testing and flight testing to check the performance of designed products. With the development of fast and highly efficient computers, the traditional tools and methods of testing were replaced by numerical simulation methods based on the Navier-Stokes equation. The Navier-Stokes equation is used to describe the motion of fluid substances using Newton's second law of motion. According to Ishmeet Kaur, a lead enterprise application research analyst from Technavio, "CFD is widely used in various design stages of aircraft manufacturing and R&D. It is also used to design external aerodynamics, fuel systems, engine core compartments, missiles, cockpit and cabin ventilation, and submarines Automotive industry The automotive industry accounted for a market share of over 30% in the global CFD market in 2015. The increase in sales of automobiles and commercial vehicles in General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler made 2015 a profitable year for automakers in the US. The demand for more sophisticated technologies from customers has increased resulting in a greater demand for CFD. CFD is mainly used in the design and development of interior and exterior features such as enhanced night vision with pedestrian detection and automatic high beam control. "Advances in computing and complex code solving programs has helped the CFD market in the automotive industry with more accurate prediction and analysis. CFD is used for all components that interact with fluids such as lubricants, fuel, water, coolants, and exhaust gases," says Ishmeet. Electrical and electronics industry The electrical and electronics industry was one of the fastest growing segments in the market in 2015 with a market share of approximately 13%. This industry is growing at a fast pace in APAC because of the growing demand for semiconductor components, consumer durables, electronics goods, and high-technology products, especially in China, South Korea, India, and Japan. The countries in APAC that played a significant role in the cloud CFD market include China, Japan, and Taiwan. Smartphones were the major areas of R&D in the electrical and electronics industry. The adoption of CFD in the electronics industry is higher compared to the electrical industry. This is because electronics components are more sensitive to heat and pressure variations and their designing process requires proper CFD analysis. Miniaturization is a trend in the electronics industry, which will drive the need for proper design.

But many of them pack a total-return punch, too. Thinkstock By Dan Burrows September 16, 2016 With the market not far off all-time highs, you might think it’s not the best time to go looking for the best dividend stocks to buy. You’d be wrong. Just because dividend yields market-wide are off versus a year ago doesn’t mean dividend stocks any less attractive for long-term investors. Indeed, dividend stocks never go out of style for patient investors. See Also from Kiplinger: 8 Risky Stocks That Are Worth a Gamble Be that as it may, yields on the best dividend stocks in the S&P 500 aren’t what they once were. Sure, companies are increasing their dividend payments, but share-price gains are offsetting any bump to dividend yield. Just look at the dividend yield on the S&P 500. It’s down to 2.12% today vs. 2.2% a year ago — not large on the aggregate, but it’s not the right direction, either. In a way, the thirst for yield only makes the search for the best dividend stocks even more important. The key is to get the largest yield possible with the least amount of risk. Advertisement Large caps — preferably blue chips — with ample yields and a long history of rising payouts will serve your equity income portfolio well if given enough time. Although current yields may be underwhelming, they won’t stay that way on your own personal costs basis if you hang on through hike after hike. The trick is to find the best S&P 500 dividend stocks and hang on. Here are the top names in the index. Procter & Gamble Dividend Yield: 3.1% Advertisement It doesn’t get more blue chip than Procter & Gamble Co. (PG). This component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average has paid rising dividends since the 19th century. That gives investors confidence that the payouts will keep coming no matter what. Admittedly, Procter & Gamble isn’t running completely unimpeded. Its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report saw earnings and revenues decline thanks to hiccups in the beauty, home care and other divisions. Still, PG is getting its house in order. It’s in the midst of a $10 billion cost-cutting program, which is something that is always music to the market’s ears. It’s also returning billions of dollars to shareholders via stock buybacks. Happily, defensive names like Procter & Gamble are in vogue these days. PG stock is up 10% for the year-to-date vs. a gain of less than 5% for the broader market. Advertisement Wells Fargo Dividend Yield: 3.2% OK, Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) might not be the most popular name after its jaw-dropping accounts scandal, but so what? It’s still a quality business with a quality stock. Wells Fargo’s reputation took a hit, and now Congress is doing its typical bluster — this time over senior management. Advertisement But, as bank crises do, this will blow over. Shares in WFC went to $46 from $51 on the news. That has the dividend up to a very attractive level. True, banks are constrained when it comes to formulating their capital plans. But — again — the scandal doesn’t have anything to do with capital requirements. See Also from Kiplinger: 6 Good Dividend Stocks Yielding 5% or More When you can get one of the nation’s top banks on sale, you go for it. Cisco Systems Dividend Yield: 3.4% Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) is one of the first names when it comes to tech dividends. But Cisco offers a heck of a lot more than just dividends. CSCO is following the same playbook as every other legacy tech name. It’s making the long, painful and slow transition to cloud-based services and away from hardware. The arrow hasn’t always been pointed up, but Cisco has been regularly topping Wall Street’s earnings and revenue targets. Cost cuts also increase investor confidence in this company Cisco has been a total-return machine so far this year, with price appreciation of nearly 15% on top of the healthy dividend. With cloud-based services still ramping up, you can expect more of the same. Boeing Dividend Yield: 3.4% It’s in fashion to worry about Boeing Co. (BA), but the company isn’t that troubled. Boeing beat analysts’ profit estimate over the summer and the cash-flow picture continued to strengthen. In a tip to the benefits of diversification, margin growth in the company’s defense business is making up for some of the drag coming out of the commercial segment. Right now, Boeing is duking it out with Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) over a combat jet deal in Denmark — a rare challenge in the international defense world. See Also from InvestorPlace: 7 Stock Splits Investors Are Dying to See BA stock is still off for the year-to-date with an 11% decline. That underperforms the broader market by a wide margin, but it also has the dividend yield flying high. Gushers of cash flow ensure that the payouts will keep coming. Pfizer Dividend Yield: 3.5% Mega-Pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is on a mergers and acquisitions bender that promises long-term price appreciation to go along with a steady dividend stream. PFE’s $14 billion acquisition of Medivation bolsters the long-term bull case on Pfizer stock. The pharmaceutical giant is building up its oncology portfolio in a big way. It already has a hit with Ibrance, a breast cancer drug on the cusp of becoming a blockbuster, and MDVN complements that nicely. Then there’s the $5.2 billion acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals, which landed Pfizer crisaborole — a non-steroid eczema treatment that’s being studied for efficacy against psoriasis. Like a lot of defensive names, PFE is having a good year. Shares are up 6% for the year-to-date. The S&P 500 is ahead by only 4.5% so far in 2016. IBM Dividend Yield: 3.6% International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) is another classic tech name trying to get with the times. Happily for shareholders, last quarter’s report showed good progress with its turnaround plan. IBM beat Street forecasts on the top and bottom line thanks partly to its focus on new business areas. The legacy business continued to shrink, but that was partially offset by growth in the segment that includes things like Watson, security and cloud computing. Analytics, social and mobile are also some of the keys to IBM’s future. Watson alone is a reason to love this company, with Deloitte estimating that the cognitive computing market could reach $50 billion in the next five years — in just the U.S.! IBM stock is another total-return winner these days. It’s up 13% YTD on price alone. And the dividend has nearly doubled over the past half-decade. AbbVie Dividend Yield: 3.6% AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) stock is having a market-beating year with its gain of more than 7%, and the dividend only pads that lead. Slow-but-steady growth is a basic part of the equation. AbbVie successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx in June, which bolsters its portfolio of oncology treatments. In other fundamentally good news, the FDA recently approved Humira in non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult patients. That makes it the only non-steroidal drug available for the disease. With a long-term growth rate of more than 15%, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 11 gives ABBV a compelling valuation. And dividend growth is fantastic. AbbVie has only been around since 2013, and its payout has grown by more than 40% in that short time. Verizon Dividend Yield: 4.49% You can’t talk about dividend stocks without talking about the telecommunications sector. That’s why you have to look at Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ). Sure, Verizon is boring, but it’s supposed to be. As much as traditional telecommunications is a poky business, VZ is making some interesting moves. Most famously it recently acquired the core properties of Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) to drive new revenue streams and position itself for the future. And a little further back, Verizon acquired AOL. You might scoff at Verizon picking up has-been Internet properties, but they actually provide VZ with potential growth in digital content and advertising technology. See Also from Kiplinger: 4 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Worth the Risk And lest you think defense is not cool, VZ stock is up 12% so far in 2016. If it can keep up its mojo, it will continue to be a total-return monster. AT&T Dividend Yield: 4.8% Speaking of total-return monsters, you have to give a shout out to AT&T Inc. (T). Verizon’s main competitor routinely offers one of the heftier dividend yields in the S&P 500. Even if this were just a list of the largest dividends in the index, T would warrant a spot. But AT&T isn’t just a high dividend — it’s a high-quality dividend. An earnings beat helped by its acquisition of DirecTV and advances in the wireless business was applauded by the market and analysts alike. After some upgrades, fully 15 of the 31 analysts covering the stock rate it a buy. See Also from InvestorPlace: The 5 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks With the Highest Yields More impressively is that shares are having a huge year. T stock is up 17% YTD. That has weighed on the dividend yield, to be sure … but then, where else are you going to get that sort of return for this kind of risk? General Motors Dividend Yield: 4.9% The market is rightly worried about General Motors Co. (GM) hitting the peak of the latest car-buying cycle, but it’s overdoing its concerns. It feels like GM stock has been discounted for a worst-case scenario, if not more. GM once again printed strong quarterly numbers back in July. It set a record for earnings and lifted its full-year guidance. Higher-margin pickup trucks and large SUVs helped pick up the slack, and Europe has even become a positive once more. If we’re at the cyclical peak, don’t tell General Motors. This article is from Dan Burrows of InvestorPlace. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Delta Airlines flight 1086 landed on LaGuardia Airport’s runway 13, veered to the left and departed the side of the runway, contacted the airport perimeter fence and came to rest with the airplane’s nose on an embankment next to Flushing Bay. The NTSB investigation found that the probable cause of the accident – in which 29 of 127 passengers suffered minor injuries – was the captain’s inability to maintain directional control of the Boeing MD -88 due to his application of excessive reverse thrust, which degraded the effectiveness of the rudder in controlling the airplane heading. The aircraft was substantially damaged. “The passengers and crew of Delta flight 1086 were fortunate to have survived this crash with no loss of life or serious injuries,” said NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart. “Proper use, in real time, of precise, accurate, and timely information about the condition of the runway can help make winter operations safer, as well as the study and use of large quantities of data to inform best practices. If today’s recommendations are acted upon, future landings on contaminated runways will be safer because of actions to enable the timely communication and use of information to eliminate potentially life-threatening unknowns.” The NTSB investigation also revealed that, during the accident sequence, damage to the aircraft resulted in the loss of the interphone and public address system as methods of communication after the accident. As a result, the announcement to evacuate the aircraft was delayed and more than 17 minutes passed before all passengers were off the aircraft. The NTSB made 10 recommendations to the Federal Aviation Administration, two to Boeing, one to the U.S. operators of MD-80 series airplanes, and one to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Race, 73, resident of Blue Mountain and retired military career person, passed away peacefully from complications of Parkinson's, Sept. 13, 2016 at the North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo. Services, with Military Honors, will be at 2 PM Friday, Sept. 16 in The Heritage Chapel of Ripley Funeral Home with Bro. Jerry Bonds, pastor of the Blue Mountain United Methodist Church officiating. He will be laid to rest at the Blue Mountain Cemetery. Fred was born September 20, 1942 in Toledo, OH and he leaves behind his devoted wife Linda of 50 years, his two children, Amanda Race (Daniel Darnell) of Fairbanks, Alaska and Jeff Race (Mandy) of Colorado Springs, Colorado,his grand daughter, Allison, 2 brothers, Tim Goheen (Kim) of Phoenix, Arizona and Ken Goheen (Debbie) of Virginia, his nieces and nephew, Erin, Megan and Hunter, several cousins including Dale Race ( Annette) and Jim Race (Chris) and his aunt, Beverly Race of New Jersey. He was preceded in death by his beautiful mother, E. Marie Goheen, father, Donald, beloved uncles, Gale, Merlin and Dale Race, Sr., special aunt, Virginia Davenport and his "best friend" Woody, the dog. Fred, call sign W8FR, was a Ham for over 58 years. He first listened to Hams at age 7 on his grandfather's old Philco radio of 1937's vintage, and at age 13 while working in a radio-tv shop as an assistant, he heard local Hams on 160 using a car radio that covered up to about 1900 KHz. He met one of the 160 groups, Pete, W8WRO; by listening to him describe his neighborhood, which was only 2 blocks away! This led to a novice license in 1957, a general in 1958, and almost exclusive 160 operations until 1970. His first call wsa K8IUA, then KL7HEE, followed by W8KWN, W8FR, AL7JO and finally, W8FR (reclaimed). He has had several overseas calls including GM5BFQ while in Scotland, TA2F and TF1TB (both "bootleg" calls), DL4IU and many MM1, 2 and 3 operations at sea. While working at United Telephone in Ohio in 1970, he met Al Weber on the Ham Radio from Fairbanks, Alaska who told Fred there was a job at the University of Alaska with his brother Ken, where he worked at UAF from July 1970-72, while living at Rainbow Valley Trailer Park with his wife, infant son and daughter. While serving 29 years of military service in the Army Reserves, Regular Army, then Navy, he earned 2 degrees: BSET and BA (History & Government). After retiring from the Navy in 1990, he earned a Post-Baccalaureate K-8 Teaching Certificate from the University of Alaska in 1991. This led to teaching in Fairbanks, Alaska School District (1993), and then 5th and 6th grades in Mohave Valley Elementary School, Arizona (1994-96). In 1999, a Masters dissertation, subject to military and proprietary "Classification" was submitted to the University of WA and confirmed. It was subsequently awarded by his aerospace employer, after much delay; lost in a government program secure documents shuffle (14 Years)! In the workplace (1991-1993), Fred taught members of Air Force Space Command in Spacecraft Communications and Tracking Systems, while working for LORAL Space & Range Systems in Sunnyvale, CA. Then, he moved to the Seattle area to teach for the Boeing Company in September 1996. Fred worked for Boeing in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, Instructional Systems Design (ISD) until July 1999. Prior to this last assignment, he was Lead Training Specialist for the "DarkStar" Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) program. The Military UAV programs ultimately became his foremost interest area. Before that promotion, he was initially assigned to AWACS Training Services in Kent, WA as Lead Communications Maintenance Course Developer and Instructor for USAF E3, and Japanese E767 AWACS platforms. He retired (again) to Laughlin, NV in July 1999, and in the Spring of 2000, he agreed to independently-contract to design and teach the DEMC maintenance course for the General Atomics "Predator" UAV program at Indian Springs, NV USAF-AF. Then, he contracted as a Senior Technical Writer(Robotics) for Asyst Technologies, Inc. of Fremont, CA. This became a "Telecommute" job (March 2001), and on completion Fred again returned to retirement (September 2001). He moved to Blue Mountain, MS (March, 2002) and he declared this the "best retirement and Ham radio location ever!" After turning 62 in September 2004, he started Social Security Retirement on October 1 initiating a "full retirement enviroment" and that led to odd assignments in Antenna Design/prototyping for Martin Jue at MFJ (MFJ 61, 62 & 64xx series and 14 others) Tech Writing, Educational Counseling and Ham Radio operation. Recently, Fred was honored with an official occupational Title "Concept Expert-Emeritus" for his training course and Senior Writing skills in UAV Systems for the USAF and various Defense contractors. He described his wife Linda, as his personal "ANGEL" who cared for his needs 24/7 for the last 3 years and that love affair celebrated 50 years longevity on July 2, 2016 with family and friends near & far. Fred enjoyed the adventure of life; opportunities, used and those missed; traveling the world for the Flag; living in Germany, Scotland, Iceland, Hawaii, Alaska and several states which rendered the education of a lifetime. He told his family all the time how much he loved us; we never wanted for anything growing up - we really did have a wonderful life with him.

The primary electric thruster is designed to lift the satellite through its geostationary transfer orbit, slowly but steadily. These electric thrusters take a satellite into orbit without using ‘conventional’ chemical rocket thrusters. Intelsat said the Boeing-built High Throughput satellite, destined to operate from 60 deg East, would not now arrive at its orbital position as expected in Q4, and following testing come into service before year-end. It is designed to replace Intelsat 904 when it arrives on station. However, the Thruster problem means that it will take a few more weeks to reach orbit. Intelsat’s president Steven Spengler told the Euroconsult Satellite Business Week in Paris that I-33e would not now enter service until Q1/next year. He implied that this was the limit of the impact. It has now emerged on the sidelines of the conference that the problem might trim up to 1.5 years from the satellite’s operational life. The problem means that this glitch could lead to an insurance claim of up to a reported $40 million payout.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) SEOUL, South Korea - Samsung's recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after several dozen caught fire and exploded may stem from a subtle manufacturing error, but it highlights the challenge electronics makers face in packing ever more battery power into ever thinner phones, while rushing for faster release dates. Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 percent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Monday. U.S. safety regulators stepped in Thursday with an official recall, saying Samsung's voluntary efforts were inadequate. Though Samsung promised replacement devices, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said U.S. customers would be eligible for refunds if they choose. Replacements are expected in stores by next Wednesday. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and - not least - the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: Users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a "tiny error" in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. "If Koh's argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company," Park said. "But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem." Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple's September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 percent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 percent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That's what happened with the Note 7, Samsung's Koh explained. "The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together," he told reporters in Seoul. It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7's design that it compromised safety. "There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity," said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute's battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. "Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode," Doh said. "It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety." The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone's battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is "one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we've seen in a phone," said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. "We don't think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries - more likely just a manufacturing defect," IFixit's Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. "You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else," he said, adding that the two rivals are "constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping." While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung's smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. "The security of the battery isn't directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not," Cho Joon-ho, head of LG's mobile business, told reporters. "But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand."

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 17, 2016 at 8:13AM Before and after pictures of the damage incurred by the Sentinel-1A satellite. Image source: European Space Agency. Seven years ago, a defunct Russian military satellite made headlines by running headlong into a satellite operated by Iridium Communications (NASDAQ: IRDM) and smashing it to smithereens. Since that date, there have been multiple close calls, near misses, and actual satellite fatalities recorded in orbit. Here's the latest: On Aug. 31, the European Space Agency (ESA) noticed an anomaly on data coming from its Sentinel-1A radar imaging satellite. Now, Sentinel-1A has only been in orbit for a couple of years -- hardly enough time for things to start breaking down on their own. So when ESA was alerted to a "sudden power reduction," combined with a change to "the orientation and the orbit" of the satellite, this naturally piqued their interest. Flipping on the sat's onboard cameras, they were startled to discover a 40-centimeterwide dent in its solar array (pictured above). Anybody catch the license plate on that meteor? ESA has only had a few days to examine the evidence so far, but initial indications are that the satellite's solar array was pierced from the rear by a flying piece of orbital debris -- space junk -- or perhaps a "micrometeoroid" of nonterrestrial origin. Either way, ESA's best guess is that the perpetrator of this crime was traveling at a high rate of speed but was no more than "a few millimetres" in diameter itself. When you think about it, that's kind of worrisome. One particle of random space junk, moving at high speed, put a dent in Sentinel-1A roughly 100 times the particle's own size. And it gets worse. On Sept. 7, roughly a week after the impact was first reported, U.S. Strategic Command's Joint Space Operations Center reported that it has detected five "small" pieces of debris in the vicinity of Sentinel-1A, which are all thought to have been created "due to Sentinel 1A['s] small particle impact." These latter pieces of debris were not detectable prior to the impact because, as ESA points out, "only objects greater than about 5 cm can usually be tracked and, thus, avoided by manoeuvring the satellites." The fact that debris is detectable now, therefore, suggests that the original impact with Sentinel-1A created five new pieces of space junk, each five centimeters or more in size. The Kessler effect Put another way, not only did the original piece of space debris cause damage 100 times its own size, but it also created five new bits of cosmic flotsam, each more than 10 times the original perpetrator's own size -- and each with the potential to cause damage 100 times their own size to other spacecraft! In astrophysics, this phenomenon is termed the "Kessler effect." One collision between space objects not only damages the objects involved (and in greater proportion than the size of the objects involved) -- it also creates an exponential number of new pieces of space junk, each with the capability of causing additional disproportionate harm to other objects. Lather, rinse, and repeat until Earth's orbit has been transformed into a floating junkyard. So what's the solution? And why should investors care? In fact, we're already well on our way to that scenario. The U.S. Air Force is currently aware of 20,000 (rather large) items of "space junk" in orbit. But NASA estimates that the total population of orbiting pieces of space junk marble-sized or larger is closer to 500,000. Now, time will fix some of this. As Jim Cantrell, CEO of microsatellite launch service Vector Space Systems, told me recently, space junk in low Earth orbit will, over time, be slowed down by contact with Earth's atmosphere, lose velocity, fall back to Earth, and burn up in the atmosphere. The higher up the debris is, though, and the faster it's moving (and the more destructive potential it has from those higher speeds), the longer it takes for "the Earth herself [to clean up] with atmospheric drag." That's why the Air Force has hired Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) to construct a "space fence," consisting of Earth-based S-band radars tasked with detecting, cataloging -- and warning space companies to avoid -- orbital debris. Once complete in 2018, this $2.5 billion project will be able to detect, track, and characterize 200,000 items -- 10 times what the Air Force is currently capable of detecting. (That will still be only 40% of the threat, but it's a start, and Lockheed has plans to tighten its fence even further in 2021.) At the same time, over at ULA, both Lockheed Martin and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are working to build a "space truck" service of utility spaceships in orbit. In conjunction with detection data from the space fence, one potential use of these ships would be cleaning up some of the space junk currently circling the globe. It's a big job, but consider the cost of not doing it: Sentinel-1A cost Europe $384 million to put in orbit, but one misaimed piece of space junk threatened to trash that entire investment. As ESA's close call with a mere millimeterswide piece of space junk showed us last month, this is a job that's worth doing. And with billions of dollars' worth of Air Force contracts on the line, it's a job that America's space tech firms will be happy to perform.

Sputnik earlier wrote about a leaked report about the MH17 tragedy, allegedly prepared by Russia’s Almaz-Antei company, and which appeared in a recent issue of Novaya Gazeta. © AFP 2016/ VASILY MAXIMOV Russian Newspaper Reveals Draft Text of Response to Bellingcat MH17 ProbeA team of Russian volunteers and bloggers earlier published their first findings about the July 17, 2014 crash, aptly titled “Anti-Bellingcat Report.” The analysis of the Bellingcat investigation shows that from the very beginning the so-called “independent experts” chose followed a pro-Ukrainian version of militiamen’s guilt for the crash. In the introduction of their report the Bellingcat authors unambiguously state that “within hours, the world became aware of the general circumstances that led to the tragedy: a group of pro-Russian separatists shot down the passenger plane with a Buk anti-aircraft missile”. According to the authors of the “anti-Bellingcat report,” however, this statement actually rules out any need for any further investigation into the crash. First off, most of the photo and video evidence, used by self-styled researchers, were downloaded to the Internet on the day of the crash, but the authors of these photos still remain anonymous. Maksim Blinov MH17 Crash Probe Initial Results to Be Unveiled September 28Based on so-called “fair evidence” presented by Ukrainian politicians, the so-called independent investigation by Bellingcat advocated the version of US military intelligence officials about the missile launch site of the Buk launcher. It is worth mentioning, however, that neither before nor afterwards, was there any information about the use of Buk missile launchers by independence supporters. One of Bellingcat's charges concerns a satellite image showing a white transport truck carrying the Buk missile allegedly used to shoot down flight MH17. However, this image was proven to be a fake because three of the vehicles Bellingcat claims were part of the Buk convoy are actually pictured going in the opposite direction of the site the missile was allegedly launched from. In an interview with Komsomolstaya Pravda, Yuri Kotenok, a leading author of the “Anti-Bellingcat Report,” said that there were lots of discrepancies in the Bellingcat’s version. “In their July 17 video we see a Buk convoy passing by a gas station in Makeyevka. A good clean road, but in a Hot News  video posted on June 15 we see a road severely dented  by caterpillar trucks we don’t see in the July 17 video. Meaning that in a wartime situation they had taken just one day to fix it! This is a fake, no doubt about that,” Kotenok added. © Sputnik/ Igor Maslov Kremlin Questions Bellingcat's Report on MH17 Crash in East UkraineThus all Bellingcat claims that the Boeing was downed by a Buk missile transported on a white trailer simply hold no water. Next, the "Anti-Bellingcat Report" effectively proved that the photo showing the smoke trail from a Buk missile allegedly launched by independence supporters had either been digitally altered or taken on a different day since other photo and video evidence from July 17 have confirmed that the weather in the area was cloudy, not clear, as claimed by Bellingcat. Yuri Kotenok also said that on July 17, 2014 the sky in the area of the MH17th crash was overclouded and not clear as in the Bellingcat photo. “This means that you simply couldn’t see any traces of a  missile launch. The Bellingcat photographs provide no particular time frame of when they were made and their volunteers tend to disappear in a very mysterious way,” Kotenik said. This means that there was no missile launch from Snizhne (an area controlled by independence supporters) and that  the photos of a white smoke trail against a clear blue sky used in the Bellingcat report were forged. In additional proof of this, Mikhail Malyshevsky, an adviser to Almaz-Antei Concern’s chief designer, flatly denied allegations that the missile that shot down the Malaysian airliner had been fired from Snizhne because in this case the right side of the plane would not have remained intact. “All they want everyone to believe is that the missile had come from Snizhne, but this is not true because if fired from there it could not have reached the aircraft under that angle. If they agree [that the missile been launched from the territory controlled by Ukrainian armed forces] then their entire version will fall through,” Malyshevsky said. As to the crucial Bellingcat claim – that MH17 was hit by a single Buk SAM in the hands of the Donbass militia, the report reiterated that this is a practical impossibility, since the detection range of a single Buk is limited to 120 degrees in azimuth and 7 degrees in elevation, and its effectiveness of fire is limited. A single Buk system can guard only a pre-assigned airspace sector with knowledge of its potential targets' parameters, up to and including enemy flight time (that is, to wait in 'ambush' mode). Without this information, normally provided by support systems elsewhere in the military command, a single Buk is not capable of precisely locating and then hitting its target. The authors of the "Anti-Belligcat Report" will continue their work to debunk the myths and falsifications being spread by the Bellingcat “experts.” ...

(KOIN) — On their first date, Bert Harrison kissed Lucy as they rode through the Tunnel of Love in Seattle’s Playland Amusement Park. Now, 70 years later, they’re still in love. Bert and Lucy Harrison got married on September 13, 1946 — a Friday the 13th — and now 2 children, 5 grandchildren, 7 great-grandchildren and 4 great-great-grandchildren later, they’re happy, smiling and sharing the secrets to a long marriage. He said they haven’t thought too much about the anniversary until just now. “I just think it’s mind boggling,” Lucy said. “It happened one day at a time, and yet all of a sudden it’s here.” It began with a blind date in May 1946. Bert was in the Merchant Marines and in port in Seattle when a friend of his urged him to come out on the blind date. Bert also had a car and his friend didn’t. “I wasn’t too sure about her at first,” Bert said. “Both girls got in the backseat and I was the driver, so I had to tell them one of them belonged up here.” “And I happened to be the one that got up there,” Lucy said. At the end of the date — and after the kiss in the Tunnel of Love — Bert told his friend he was going to marry Lucy. “Actually, he didn’t ever ask me to marry him,” she said. “He simply put the ring on my finger and he says, ‘If you don’t want it, give it back.’ How romantic can that be?” Lucy said, laughing. 70 years of wedded bliss View as list View as gallery Open Gallery Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Lucy Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) A Shoot-the-Chutes-style ride at Playland, circa 1934 (Courtesy: MOHAI collection) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison on the 70th anniversary of their wedding, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day in 1946 and a recent photo, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison have been married 70 years on September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison married 70 years ago, September 13, 2016 (Courtesy photos) 70 years of wedded bliss x Thumbnails Gallery                   Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Lucy Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) A Shoot-the-Chutes-style ride at Playland, circa 1934 (Courtesy: MOHAI collection) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison on the 70th anniversary of their wedding, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day in 1946 and a recent photo, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison have been married 70 years on September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison married 70 years ago, September 13, 2016 (Courtesy photos) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Lucy Harrison in an undated photo provided September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) A Shoot-the-Chutes-style ride at Playland, circa 1934 (Courtesy: MOHAI collection) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day, September 13, 1946 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison on the 70th anniversary of their wedding, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison on their wedding day in 1946 and a recent photo, September 13, 2016 (KOIN) Bert and Lucy Harrison have been married 70 years on September 13, 2016 (Courtesy) Bert and Lucy Harrison married 70 years ago, September 13, 2016 (Courtesy photos) On that first date, they also got stuck on one of the rides called The Hammer. When he kissed her in the Tunnel of Love, Bert wasn’t sure if he was going to be slapped. “I thought he was being a little bit on the fresh side,” she told KOIN 6 News. “In those days it just wasn’t done.” That was in May, and they were married just 4 months later. Over the years Bert drove trucks across the country and started an automotive center. Lucy worked for Boeing, was a quality control inspector for one of the moon buggys and also worked on the first Air Force One. They moved to Salem in 1970 and they’ve been there since. Through it all, they’ve figured a few things out. There is give-and-take in a marriage, and they balance each other out. She said his gentleness is a good counterpoint to her being bull-headed. “That’s how the 70 years has lasted is we work with each other all the time,” he said. “It’s not something you can just stand aside and let it happen. It takes work every day. But it’s loving work.” “Never go to bed on a fight. I don’t care how long it takes you to work it out, never go to bed on a fight,” she said. “Kiss him in the morning for a good day, kiss him at night for a good night’s sleep. That’s it. What else do you need?” Bert said they each have their own hobbies. “I help her with hers, she helps me with mine.” This weekend they’re having a 70th anniversary party with family and friends to celebrate what Bert said has been “just a wonderful life.” How do they feel about each other now? “I still love him. He’s my best friend. Most of all, he’s my best friend,” Lucy said. “Yep,” Bert said. “Same here.” Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) More Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Related Posts Report It Wrap: Did you know Terre Haute had a Civil War camp? ‘I never thought it was possible‘: 100-year-old women mark momentous Election Day Wabash Valley man spends years restoring 500 bikes for area kids in need Grandparents stepping up in the addiction crisis Advertisement « Previous Story — Next Story » Comments are closed.

Electric planes? Not so much. There are several small, experimental aircraft out there – NASA is building an electricity-powered plane set for a test flight next year and a two-seat Airbus electric aircraft soared over the English Channel in 2015. But don’t expect an electric jet to fly hundreds of passengers anytime soon. Battery limitations all but rule that out. “A lot of the technical advances that happen start in smaller airplanes,” said Richard Anderson, director of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s flight research center and a professor of aerospace engineering. “There will be a market that stands for smaller, fully-electric airplanes.” The concept of using electric motors to power airplane systems dates back at least to World War II, when the B-29 Superfortress bomber used electric motors to power its gun turrets. Since then, other airplanes have replaced the ducts and hoses of hydraulic and pneumatic systems with electrical power to control such things as stabilizers and brakes. That can save significant weight and reduce fuel burn. Using electrical power to actually propel planes, however, is a more complicated challenge. In a conventional jet airplane, the engine sucks air in through its front, a compressor squeezes it, and fuel is sprayed in and lit, creating burning gases and forward thrust. Electric plane power is much simpler – batteries power an electric motor that spins a propeller. It’s more efficient, but involves far less thrust, which is why electric planes tend to be slow. Airbus’ two-seat electric plane could only go a maximum speed of about 136 miles per hour. A solar-powered plane that completed an around-the-world journey this summer had an average airspeed of 47 miles per hour. The plane, called Solar Impulse 2, had more than 17,000 solar cells that powered four electric motors. The payoff, however, could be a quieter, greener way to fly. According to a recent report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, aircraft were responsible for about 8 percent of the greenhouse gas emitted by the U.S. transportation sector in 2014. That compares to 23 percent for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and 61 percent for light-duty vehicles. “As technology progresses, I think we’ll see big strides in improvements in noise, direct operating costs, reduction in fossil fuel burning and reduction in emissions,” Anderson said of electric aircraft research. An electric plane gets its energy from batteries, generally lithium-ion. An example of that is NASA’s X-57, an experimental plane that will test how electric propulsion technology can improve performance. A team of NASA researchers and private industry professionals is converting an Italian-designed Tecnam twin-engine plane fuselage into an all-electric plane by swapping out the original piston engines for electric motors and switching to battery power. A later iteration of the plane, if it receives funding, would have a modified wing with 14 electric motors that would turn propellers to simulate a high-lift component, which would reduce the speed that’s normally needed to take off. The conversion is taking place at Scaled Composites’ headquarters in Mojave, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles. The prime contractor is Empirical Systems Aerospace; Electric Power Systems is developing the battery system; Electric aviation startup Joby Aviation is working on the cruise motors; and Xperimental is making the wing. The efficiency of electric power enables other design advances, said Sean Clarke, principal investigator for the X-57 project at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base. For example, the electric motors’ smaller size and weight allowed engineers to experiment with a smaller wing and multiple engines for increased lift, said Matt Redifer, chief engineer for the X-57. “I think that electric propulsion technologies are going to greatly improve aircraft design over the next few decades,” Clarke said. The biggest hurdle for these projects is battery technology, particularly a battery’s specific energy, or the amount of energy it can store for a given amount of weight. Despite improvements, planes need a lot of lithium-ion batteries to achieve significant range. In electric cars, the main problem was the cost of the batteries, which is starting to come down. In planes, the biggest challenge is weight. The jet fuel capacity of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner is about 223,000 pounds, according to an airport planning document released in December. The estimated weight of a battery pack with equivalent energy would be 4.5 million pounds, Anderson said. “Unless there’s a cosmic change in the battery, it’s just not going to work for bigger, faster airplanes,” he said. “It’s going to be a really long time before batteries weigh less than liquid fuel.” The X-57’s battery system alone weighs about 800 pounds – close to the weight of the plane’s fuselage. The weight of the entire aircraft is 3,000 pounds. To mitigate this, Empirical Systems Aerospace decided to put the batteries in the fuselage rather than in the wings, said Philip Osterkamp, lead integration engineer for instrumentation systems on the X-57 at Empirical Systems Aerospace. Packing lithium-ion batteries on a plane has other drawbacks. In 2014, a federal probe found that an internal short circuit in a battery cell was the “probable cause” of a 2013 fire aboard a parked Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has since redesigned the batteries. Battery limitations grounded the Firefly, an all-electric helicopter developed several years ago by Sikorsky Innovations as a technology demonstrator. Firefly never flew and the program is no longer active. “It just wasn’t worth it for where the battery technology was at the time,” said Chris Van Buiten, vice president of innovation at Sikorsky. The company continues “internal explorations and studies” on the technology’s progress, he said. A more viable solution is a hybrid system with at least two motors: an electric motor that turns the propeller and a gas engine that drives another generator for power. Since its English Channel crossing, Airbus has modified its all-electric E-Fan into a hybrid to improve range and learn more about that technology. The aerospace giant is also developing an E-Fan 2.0 that runs only on electric power. NASA considered making its X-57 a hybrid, but because the plane is not intended as a commercial product, the team decided to focus simply on electric propulsion technologies, said Clarke of NASA. The ideas may not end up working out quite as expected, but he said the plane’s development is “trying to push the limit.” “NASA’s prepared for that kind of risk,” Clarke said. “We want to take bigger risks and learn where the technology could go.” Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Tumblr Telegram Related One thought on “Electric planes a steeper challenge than electric cars” freepress September 18, 2016 at 5:16 am You won’t find me in an electric plane anytime now or in the future!

Michael’s father was a gifted mechanic who served in the U.S. Army Air Corp in World War II. After the war, he became a career military man serving throughout Europe before coming back to Indiana in the late 1950s where Michael was born. When Michael was a year old, his father’s next assigned location was March AFB and the family moved to Edgemont, a small town near Moreno Valley in Riverside County. The youngest of three, Michael, and his father were close and he spent hours learning the skills his father had to teach him on working with his hands and mind: bikes, electronics, and his beloved go-cart that they built. Living so close to the Riverside Raceway, he would go to the races (he loved drag races most) late in the day when they opened the gates for free so that he could watch and learn. It was no surprise that Michael’s favorite subjects in school were Science and Math. At age 11, he began a love affair with astronomy that would stay with him to this day when a neighbor gave him his first chance to see the moon through his telescope and he was hooked. His father bought him his first telescope from Fedco (remember them?). His mother happened to see a posting in the local paper for an astronomy club which he began attending and by age 12 was already building his first telescope. While going to college Michael worked full time in electronics shops and then an automobile crash test lab, learning the engineering skills that would define his future. He would graduate in 1985 with his degree in Engineering Technology in Electronics with a promising future ahead. He went to work as an engineer for Nissan for almost seven years, but during these years he was already hard at work laying the ground work for his own company. One of his partners had worked with him at the test lab and the other was a classmate All three shared a vision and passion for crash testing so it seemed a natural evolution to start their own business, Diversified Technical Systems (DTS) which began as a Partnership in 1990, becoming an S-Corp in 1996. In the early stages of building DTS, they all worked out of a garage-office space. In 1994 Michael stumbled upon Seal Beach when he was invited to a party, fell in love and stayed. Shortly after this in 1995, they got their first contract opportunity that would set DTS in motion and they knew they needed to find a real business space. As it happened, a “For Rent” sign was up at 909 Electric and within days, they opened their two room company at this location. Michael and partners Steve Pruitt and Tim Kippen quickly gained other business and ultimately have become the world leader in providing data acquisition needs for demanding, high impact testing applications for the automotive, aerospace, military and other substantial industries. As DTS has grown, so did their staff and several years ago, they left their start up location to move to bigger quarters in the Boeing Business Center. They now have offices and employ people in Michigan, Asia-Pacific, France, Japan and the U.K. Most recently their equipment has been on board the Orion spacecraft as it gets tested for its ultimate trip one day to Mars, quite an accomplishment for a boy who dreamed of watching the stars. Michael never stops learning; in fact, he met his wife Bridget while taking a cross country skiing class at Long Beach City College in 1990. They lived on Fifth Street before moving to their home in Bridgeport in 2003 where they live today. Perhaps it was serendipity or maybe a sign, but the night they moved in they were able to view a meteor shower from their roof deck. Michael’s free time is sparse these days but when he has some, his first love is still astronomy and now he shares that love and passion with the community, holding community astronomy nights at the pier, Girl Scout House and other places when there are events to see in the night sky.  His telescope collection now stands at seven. He reads constantly and travels the world to have opportunities to view celestial events such as meteor showers and lunar eclipses. He has traveled to the William Herschel Observatory in Slough, England, the real birthplace of modern astronomy. And if all that wasn’t enough, Michael also sits on the Board of Directors for the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. As the current Chairman, he will have a unique opportunity to travel to Chile this October to tour their observatories in the Southern Hemisphere that are doing groundbreaking work in astronomy. I asked Michael if he would go into space if it was available to him today, and surprisingly he told me “no.” He enjoys his feet on the ground and his eye to the stars. When asked how he would like to be remembered he did not hesitate to tell me this: “I would like to be remembered as a person who inspired people to seek a deeper understanding of their world.”  Do you have a Neighbor you think we should know?

The closure was listed as permanent in the records. USL launched its first transpacific service in 2003, offering a weekly schedule to Long Beach from Shekou and Hong Kong. In 2015, operations were expanded to include services from Vietnam to Hong Kong and Ho Chi Minh City. In 2006, the company announced ships would sail daily from Los Angeles to Australia/New Zealand, in addition to services from New Zealand and Australia to Hong Kong/South China and North America. In 2007 USL was bought by ANL Singapore, a subsidiary of the CMA CGM Group. Other layoffs in the county include: • National Oilwell Varco will cut 72 jobs, also effective in October, at its Orange office. The Texas-based company provides equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production operations. • Morning Sun Shirt Company in Garden Grove will cut 76 jobs, effective in November. The company was formed in Costa Mesa in 1981 as a management and ownership change in a T-shirt shop. • ITT Technical Services let go almost 800 people this month. The layoffs included 76 people from the company’s Orange office. Its campuses were to shutter Friday. ITT offered technology-oriented degree programs. The for-profit college was cut off from the Department of Education’s student loan program. Around 8,000 employees were laid off and roughly 35,000 students were affected. • Good Hope International in Anaheim laid of 60 people this month. Good Hope International is an affiliate of Wincome Group, which was awarded $300 million in future tax subsidies for the building of two four-diamond hotels by the Anaheim City Council earlier this year. The hotels would replace Wincome’s Anaheim Plaza and Suites and the Anabella Hotel. • Airplane giant Boeing has also announced substantial layoffs. In September, the company listed 73 in Huntington Beach and 38 in El Segundo as “layoff unknown at this time.” In October the company also will terminate 37 jobs in Huntington Beach and 20 in El Segundo, also listed as “layoff unknown at this time.

The Elon Musk-owned company said Thursday it’s still pointed toward its first test flight to the International Space Station in 2017 while officials investigate an explosion that destroyed a test rocket and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite on Sept. 1, according to Reuters. “We’re full-steam head for certification. We’re still trying to remain on schedule,” director of certification for SpaceX, Abhishek Tripathi, said during a webcast panel at an American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics conference in Long Beach, California. Tripathi said the private space exploration company’s plans aren’t being affected by the Federal Aviation Administration’s investigation into why one of its Falcon 9 rockets exploded during fueling just as it was about to launch from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Related Stories SpaceX Aims To Resume Launches In November How Big Is Blue Origin's New Rocket, The New Glenn? According to Reuters, Tripathi’s comments came one day after Space X president Gwynne Shotwell said the company was planning to continue flights in November NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, which is also located in Cape Canaveral. Along with Musk’s Boeing, SpaceX is attempting to help NASA fly astronauts to the ISS rather than relying on Russia to transport them, but come November it could face an even more crowded marketplace. While SpaceX already has 70 missions worth more than $10 billion planned, at least 10 other rocket companies are competing to launch satellites into space, according to the Los Angeles Times. Besides the ventures of Musk’s billionaire brethren like Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic, companies like United Launch Alliance are planning to turn around orders for satellite launches in just three months. “Because it’s going to be so many companies trying to launch so many satellites, I think most of these companies will take what they can get,” senior space analyst at the Teal Group Marco Caceres told the LA Times. “The bigger issue is going to be who can launch sooner.” Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

He was commenting on a New Zealand Helicopter Survey completed for the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) in August 2016. The survey gathered information from industry participants about their views on issues underlying safety performance. New Zealand has a good reputation internationally for providing a safe aviation environment. ‘This is a tribute to the regulator, the companies that make up the aviation industry, and the relationship that exists between the regulator and industry’, said Nicholson. Safety is critically important in the aviation industry. Anything that compromises safety affects the country’s reputation. Industry association Aviation New Zealand for example, was created in 1950 by industry to encourage the safe development of aviation in the country. Aviation New Zealand (including the New Zealand Helicopter Association - NZHA) has been involved for many years in programmes to encourage and promote aviation safety. Sometimes this has been in association with the regulator and at other times, this has seen industry take the lead. AIRCARE™ was developed and introduced by industry. It brings flight safety and environmental safety together in one safety assurance programme. Forty-one helicopter companies are AIRCARE™ accredited. These companies generally achieve a higher level of flight safety and environmental safety than non accredited companies. CAA and the NZHA regularly produce Activity and Safety Updates and NZHA produces Safety Bulletins. These comment in particular on accidents reported to CAA and generalise the learning from them so that all industry members benefit. As we understand it, the regulator/industry cooperation that results in these reports is leading edge with other industry associations keen to learn from the New Zealand experiences. The NZHA and Aviation NZ run annual conferences that focus on the issues of the day and tomorrow. This year’s conferences in June, among other things, addressed operator fatigue, learning from accident and incident reports, risk management and the importance of role training. It is important that as an industry, we address the perceptions coming from the August CAA Safety Survey. We (industry and CAA) are responsible for safety. We have to ensure that some of the behaviours apparent in the survey are discouraged and eradicated. ‘The programmes that we provide for our members are one way of ensuring this happens’, said Nicholson. ‘We would welcome other helicopter companies joining us to participate in those programmes’. Key facts about Aviation New Zealand Aviation New Zealand exists to lead, inspire and grow the New Zealand aviation industry. It was established in 1950 to encourage the safe growth of the aviation industry in New Zealand. In more recent years, it has also become involved in helping the international development of its members. - Aviation New Zealand has over 300 members and over 1300 on its database - Members include agricultural companies, air operators (fixed wing and rotary), aircraft designers and manufacturers, the UAV industry, airports, aviation trainers, emergency and medical services companies, helicopter companies, and parts manufacturers. Key facts about aviation in New Zealand An ‘early adopter’ in aviation terms – first international customer for Boeing; first pilot training school 1916; first airmail 1919; and quick appreciation of the suitability of aviation for agriculture, tourism and forestry. 4639 aircraft in New Zealand, one per thousand people, give New Zealand one of the highest aircraft per capita ratios in the world. Decades of policy innovation to support competition, safety and growth; 30m km² of safely managed airspace; and exports to over 100 countries on all continents. Aircraft fit-outs, new aircraft (including UAVs), GPS track and tracing systems, high precision processes (for example bait and fire fighting), composites, titanium powders, and aviation industry business and operational systems are just some of the exciting technologies and practices developing in New Zealand which set the scene for growth in the next 100 years. © Scoop Media   Tweet         Business Headlines | Sci-Tech Headlines BUSINESS, SCIENCE & TECH > >   Geographical Indications Bill Passes: Wine Industry Welcomes New Legislation “Our ‘Geographical Indications’ - the names and places where our wines come from - are at the very heart of the New Zealand wine story and this new law provides an additional level of protection for them.” More>> ALSO: NZ Govt - Good news for wine and spirit industries NZ First - Geographical Indicators Bill Patronises Maori Spirits NZ - Spirits NZ Welcomes Passage of Geographic Indicators Bill The Price Of Cheese: Appeal Court Turns Down Fonterra Bid To Keep Inferior Terms Fonterra Cooperative Group has lost its bid to overturn a High Court ruling against inferior terms offered to the suppliers of the failed New Zealand Dairies Ltd business in South Canterbury.

The event was in support of the CancerCare Manitoba Foundation and the Children’s Hospital Foundation of Manitoba. According to organizers, the festival has raised more than $1.25 million over the past four years for pediatric clinical trials, and care and support for children fighting cancer. The long brightly coloured canoe-like dragon boats are powered by teams of 20 paddlers, a steerer and a drummer, and feature a dragon head on the prow. Regina Ramos Urbano paddled for ChemoSavvy Thunder, a team consisting entirely of breast cancer survivors. “A cancer diagnosis can be devastating, so I was happy to join a group of supportive, amazing, and hopeful women who not only understood what I was going through, but provided me with encouragement and inspiration to stay healthy and become fit,” said Regina. ChemoSavvy Thunder and ChemoSavvy Lightening captured first and second place honours respectively in a competitive field of 17 teams in the All Female category. Over 60 teams competed in three categories. The Boeing Water Dragons won the Mixed Competitive category and Dragon Boxers won in the Mixed Recreational category. Trophies were awarded to company teams in four Manitoba industries: engineering (Stantec Slayers); heath care (Gunnars Galley); manufacting (Boeing Water Dragons) and; legal, financial and insurance (TD Titans). Non-racing awards included: Best Decorated Paddlers Village (Gate Keepers); Best Team Cheer (Broad Strokes) George Jarvis Sportsmanship (HMC); Volunteer of the Year (Roger Paquette); Peggy Delaney Best Steersperson (Dave Phillips).

US govt issues Note 7 recall amid new reports of burns, property damage Chris Keall Friday September 16, 2016 Share The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Play NBR radio on More bad news for Samsung (and bad timing too, on iPhone 7 launch day): a US government agency has issued a formal recall notice for the Galaxy Note 7. The Consumer Product Safety Commission notice follows fears that some Note 7 buyers are ignoring Samsung and phone company requests to return the handset — despite the risk that the battery could overheat and cause a fire. Samsung reported 31 "incidents" as of September 1. The CPSC notice updates that: Samsung has received 92 reports of the batteries overheating in the US, including 26 reports of burns and 55 reports of property damage, including fires in cars and a garage. The CPSC says a Note 7 customer should stop using the phone, power it down, then return it (reflecting Samsung's own advice in the US and New Zealand). Here, Samsung has advised customers to return their Note 7 to the store where they bought it to organise a replacement or refund, or visit Samsung's website if they purchased online. The Korean company shipped 2.5 million Note 7 units between its August 19 launch and its September 3 voluntary recall, including more than 50,000 in Australasia. On September 10, Air New Zealand followed other airlines in banning the use or charging of a Note 7 during flight. Not just a Samsung problem Manufacturers from gadget makers to electric car makers have been under pressure to utilise ever-denser lithium-ion batteries as customers demand longer life from hardware but don't want extra weight. The volatile nature of the lithium ion batteries used by all smartphone manufacturers has led to a number of incidents. On August 2, a Sydney man was admitted to hospital after his iPhone exploded as he hit the ground after falling off his bike, causing his pants to catch fire. In 2010, a Christchurch man had his HTC phone go up in flames after running "insanely hot". And in 2012, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found an iPhone caught fire on a plane after a screw punctured its battery. In 2013, the FAA grounded the entire Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet in 2013. Boeing addressed the issue by adding a steel containment box around the batteries. Lithium-ion battery fires have also struck everything from hoverboards to Sony laptops. Beyond safety issues, the energy density of today's lithium-ion batteries makes them prone to damage during recharging, or when they overheat. That's why your smartphone's battery can degrade after 12 to 24 months, and it's typical for a laptop's battery life to halve over the same period.

(Source: WISTV) CLEMSON, SC (WIS) - On Saturday, the SC State Bulldogs are headed to Death Valley to take on the Tigers, and SC State's president is taking Bulldog pride to a new level, literally! President Clark will lead what is believed to be the first-ever formation flight led by a university president. He'll be flying a red and white RV-6, which was custom built by Clark and his friend. The flight will represent the endless possibilities and new beginnings for SC State after the university overcame a lengthy battle with their accreditation. Right before kick-off, Clark alongside 8 other pilots will fly in a unique formation over Death Valley. He says this flight will represent the future possibilities he wants the university to explore in the aviation industry. WIN A TABLET FROM WIS! "We're looking at how we can merge what we're doing as an academic institution with what the industry needs. Before, I was very involved in various aspects of the industry as it were. Now that I'm on the educational and academic side, I'm at a unique juxtaposition of the two. So, hopefully I can find some opportunity where SC State can be something unique with entities like Boeing,” SC State University President, James Clark said. While being a university president is a new venture for Clark, he's been a pilot for more than 25 years. The pre-game flight is at 11:55 Saturday morning at Clemson. Copyright 2016 WIS.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File)More SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung's recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after several dozen caught fire and exploded may stem from a subtle manufacturing error, but it highlights the challenge electronics makers face in packing ever more battery power into ever thinner phones, while rushing for faster release dates. Announcing the recall on Sept. 2, Samsung confirmed dozens of cases where Note 7 batteries caught fire or exploded, mostly while charging. It plans a software update that will cap battery recharging at 60 percent capacity to help minimize risks of overheating. But it is urging owners to keep the phones turned off until they can get them replaced, beginning Monday. U.S. safety regulators stepped in Thursday with an official recall, saying Samsung's voluntary efforts were inadequate. Though Samsung promised replacement devices, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said U.S. customers would be eligible for refunds if they choose. Replacements are expected in stores by next Wednesday. The Note 7 debuted to rave reviews in August thanks to its speed, new software features and — not least — the estimated nine hours it would run between charges. But all that power comes at a price: Users began reporting the phones were catching fire or exploding, in one case incinerating the SUV it had been left in. Aviation authorities in the U.S., Australia and Europe have urged passengers not to use or charge Note 7s while flying and not to put them in checked baggage. On Monday, Canada issued an official recall. Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, said in announcing the recall on Sept. 2 that an investigation turned up a "tiny error" in the manufacturing process for the faulty batteries in the Note 7s that was very difficult to identify. The end of the pouch-shaped battery cell had some flaws that increased the chance of stress or overheating, he explained. That kind of manufacturing error is unimaginable for top-notch battery makers with adequate quality controls, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Samsung and other experts should search for factors outside the battery cells that could have led to overheating, he said. "If Koh's argument is right, that makes Samsung SDI a third-rate company," Park said. "But it does not appear to be a simple battery problem." Time also is a factor in marketing and making the phones. In 2015, Samsung moved up its unveiling of its new Galaxy Note model to August from September, seeking a leg up on Apple's September iPhone upgrades. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping pace with demand for the Note 7. Samsung has not recalled Note 7s sold in China, but the company has refused to say which of its two battery suppliers made the faulty batteries or clarify whose batteries are used in which Note 7 smartphones. The company also refused comment on South Korean media reports that it has stopped using batteries from Samsung SDI, one of its two suppliers, in the Note 7. C.W. Chung, an analyst at Nomura Securities in Seoul, cited SDI officials in estimating that about 70 percent of the batteries for the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones came from SDI. The other 30 percent are thought to have been supplied by Amperex Technology Ltd., a Chinese-based manufacturer that reportedly also is a main supplier of batteries for the iPhone. Problems with lithium batteries have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner, though having so many lithium-ion battery fires in a short time is unheard of, Park said. The batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices, favored by manufacturers because they are lightweight and pack much more energy into a small space than other power cells. But storing so much energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls, makes them susceptible to overheating if exposed to high temperatures, damage or flaws in manufacturing. If the separators fail, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control. That's what happened with the Note 7, Samsung's Koh explained. "The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together," he told reporters in Seoul. Read More It is unclear how Samsung failed to discover the battery problem before launching the Note 7. It confirmed delays in shipments for extra quality tests weeks later, in late August, after photos of charred phones began popping up on social media. South Korean experts suggested Samsung may have been so ambitious with the Note 7's design that it compromised safety. "There was no choice but to make the separator (between positive and negative anodes) thin because of the battery capacity," said Lee Sang-yong, a professor at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology who worked more than a decade at LG Chem, a leading lithium battery maker. Thicker separators can improve safety but will not necessarily prevent all overheating issues, he said. Doh Chil-Hoon, head of the state-run Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute's battery research division, said that based on the limited information provided by Samsung, he believes the push to increase battery power was part of the problem. "Even with a small manufacturing mistake, if there had been enough elements to ensure safety, it would not explode," Doh said. "It is a roundabout way of admitting weak safety." The Note 7 phones have a powerful 3,500 milliampere hour battery, whereas the Galaxy S7 smartphone, which has a slightly smaller body than the Note 7, features a 3,000 mAh battery. So does the Note 5, launched in 2015. Apple does not provide information on the iPhone's battery capacity in milliampere hours. But two research firms that specialize in analyzing tech gadgets and their components said the battery in the iPhone 6S Plus is 2,750mAh. The size of the battery in the newly released iPhone 7 is not yet known. The 3,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Note 7 is "one of the highest, if not the highest, capacity battery we've seen in a phone," said Wayne Lam, an industry analyst at IHS Markit Technology. Lam said he thinks the Note 7 battery problem resulted from weak controls in manufacturing, not a poor or unsafe design. A spokeswoman at iFixit, which publishes repair guides for electronic gadgets, offered a similar view. "We don't think any internal design changes in the Note 7 are responsible for the exploding batteries — more likely just a manufacturing defect," IFixit's Kay-Kay Clapp said in an email. Apple has tweaked hardware and software it developed itself to make iPhones use power more efficiently, while Samsung has increased the capacity of the batteries in its phones. That can be done without increasing size by adjusting components or changing the production process, Lam said. "You have two different trajectories, with Samsung packing in more energy density, versus Apple trying to trim it down by optimizing everything else," he said, adding that the two rivals are "constantly locked in this arms race of improving and one-upping." While Apple and Samsung are using built-in batteries for their premium phones, LG Electronics, Samsung's smaller South Korean rival, has opted for a replaceable, 3,200 mAh capacity battery for its new premium, jumbo screen smartphone, the V20. LG chose to make the phone thinner and allow customers to extend battery life by swapping out batteries. "The security of the battery isn't directly related to whether the battery is replaceable or not," Cho Joon-ho, head of LG's mobile business, told reporters. "But we make efforts to secure safety with quality controlling tests beforehand." __ AP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco. __ Lee can be reached on Twitter: www.twitter.com/YKLeeAP Her previous works can be found on: http://bigstory.ap.org/content/youkyung-lee Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to read next Uber Challenges Taiwan's Steps, Says Let People Decide News18 Google will face tough regulatory policies under President-elect Donald Trump – Tech2 Tech2 Friday Flashback: "Wouldn't marry Anil Kapoor, he is hypersensitive": Madhuri's 1989 Interview is entertaining!

It is disappointing to learn that some helicopter operators believe that corners are being cut and safety compromised in the helicopter industry’ said John Nicholson, Chief Executive of Aviation New Zealand. He was commenting on a New Zealand Helicopter Survey completed for the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (CAA) in August 2016. The survey gathered information from industry participants about their views on issues underlying safety performance. New Zealand has a good reputation internationally for providing a safe aviation environment. ‘This is a tribute to the regulator, the companies that make up the aviation industry, and the relationship that exists between the regulator and industry’, said Nicholson. Safety is critically important in the aviation industry. Anything that compromises safety affects the country’s reputation. Industry association Aviation New Zealand for example, was created in 1950 by industry to encourage the safe development of aviation in the country. Aviation New Zealand (including the New Zealand Helicopter Association – NZHA) has been involved for many years in programmes to encourage and promote aviation safety. Sometimes this has been in association with the regulator and at other times, this has seen industry take the lead. AIRCARE™ was developed and introduced by industry. It brings flight safety and environmental safety together in one safety assurance programme. Forty-one helicopter companies are AIRCARE™ accredited. These companies generally achieve a higher level of flight safety and environmental safety than non accredited companies. CAA and the NZHA regularly produce Activity and Safety Updates and NZHA produces Safety Bulletins. These comment in particular on accidents reported to CAA and generalise the learning from them so that all industry members benefit. As we understand it, the regulator/industry cooperation that results in these reports is leading edge with other industry associations keen to learn from the New Zealand experiences. The NZHA and Aviation NZ run annual conferences that focus on the issues of the day and tomorrow. This year’s conferences in June, among other things, addressed operator fatigue, learning from accident and incident reports, risk management and the importance of role training. It is important that as an industry, we address the perceptions coming from the August CAA Safety Survey. We (industry and CAA) are responsible for safety. We have to ensure that some of the behaviours apparent in the survey are discouraged and eradicated. ‘The programmes that we provide for our members are one way of ensuring this happens’, said Nicholson. ‘We would welcome other helicopter companies joining us to participate in those programmes’. Key facts about Aviation New Zealand Aviation New Zealand exists to lead, inspire and grow the New Zealand aviation industry. It was established in 1950 to encourage the safe growth of the aviation industry in New Zealand. In more recent years, it has also become involved in helping the international development of its members. – Aviation New Zealand has over 300 members and over 1300 on its database – Members include agricultural companies, air operators (fixed wing and rotary), aircraft designers and manufacturers, the UAV industry, airports, aviation trainers, emergency and medical services companies, helicopter companies, and parts manufacturers. Key facts about aviation in New Zealand An ‘early adopter’ in aviation terms – first international customer for Boeing; first pilot training school 1916; first airmail 1919; and quick appreciation of the suitability of aviation for agriculture, tourism and forestry. 4639 aircraft in New Zealand, one per thousand people, give New Zealand one of the highest aircraft per capita ratios in the world. Decades of policy innovation to support competition, safety and growth; 30m km² of safely managed airspace; and exports to over 100 countries on all continents. Aircraft fit-outs, new aircraft (including UAVs), GPS track and tracing systems, high precision processes (for example bait and fire fighting), composites, titanium powders, and aviation industry business and operational systems are just some of the exciting technologies and practices developing in New Zealand which set the scene for growth in the next 100 years.
