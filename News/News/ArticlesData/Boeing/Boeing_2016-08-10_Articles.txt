Djibouti - Air Djibouti took delivery of the first Boeing 737-400 aircraft in Djibouti in preparation for the launch of Air Djibouti’s new commercial operations. His Excellency Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, President of the Republic of Djibouti, Mr. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, Chairman of Air Djibouti, along with other dignitaries, met the plane and crew at Djibouti’s International Airport in a ceremony welcoming this important step in Djibouti’s development as a global transport hub. Bruce Dickinson, Chairman of Cardiff Aviation, which provides Air Djibouti with operational management, delivered the Boeing 737-400 personally. The plane travelled from Cardiff, stopping in Malta for re-fuelling. The plane will officially go into service on August 16, flying to regional destinations initially. Air Djibouti plans to introduce two BA146-300 aircraft by mid-September and mid-October, and a Boeing 767-200 in December this year, initially operating between Djibouti and London. Other international destinations are expected to follow soon after, as well as regional freight services. UK-based aircraft services and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) company, Cardiff Aviation, is providing technical assistance and management, and secured the European-level Air Operator’s Certificate for Air Djibouti. The launch of Air Djibouti’s commercial operations is a crucial element of the Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority (DPFZA)’s strategy for establishing Djibouti as a major logistics centre for the region. With two new airports under construction that are expected to be operational by 2019, the country is building its air transport links to complement its already well established road, rail and maritime transport network. Bruce Dickinson said: “The arrival of the first aircraft comes at a particularly exciting time for the region as Djibouti leads in spearheading the growth of aviation in East Africa.” Djibouti is strategically located on the second busiest shipping lane in the world. It is a natural meeting point for the East and West’s global business development. The DPFZA is working to replicate its success in port logistics in the aviation sector. Air Djibouti’s commercial operations will further develop the country’s international connections and accessibility. Djibouti’s current transport and logistics infrastructure programme exceeds $15 billion. Discussion Be the first to comment on this article!

Originally published August 11, 2016 at 10:19 am Updated August 11, 2016 at 2:46 pm Boeing 777s in various stages of completion at the final assembly factory in Everett. (MIke Siegel/The Seattle Times) Another warning by Boeing executives should be a warning to the region. Share story Between 1967 and April 1971, Boeing employment fell from 100,800 to 36,690. It took years to recover. The causes included cancelation of the supersonic transport (SST), slow sales of the new 747 and, by early 1973, the OPEC boycott and “energy crisis.” The company was still headquartered in Seattle and was the region’s largest employer. The result was the worst downturn here since the Great Depression — this was when the “Will the last person leaving Seattle — turn out the lights” billboard was put up by two real-estate agents near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. This history echoes a bit with the story from my colleague Dominic Gates about Boeing admitting “softness” in the widebody market that not only affects the 777 and 787, but casts a pall over the upcoming 777x, heavily subsidized by state taxpayers. (If you haven’t read it, please do so. I don’t mind waiting). Softness? The story reads, “Boeing has said it needs to sell 40 to 60 jets per year to fill all the open 777 delivery slots between now and the end of the decade. So far this year, it has booked just eight net new orders.” Related story Boeing admits ‘softness’ in widebody orders, weighs Everett slowdown Despite being a much more economically diverse region with technopolis and major world headquarters, this is still Jet City. Boeing is the largest private-sector employer in the state. It remains — despite the ministrations of former CEO Jim “Lil Jack Welch” McNerney — a bastion of family-wage union jobs. And don’t think big reductions in employment would only affect Everett — workers at the massive assembly plant there and nearby aerospace companies live throughout the region.

None of this means that we’re headed for anything like the early 1970s. Boeing and other aerospace employment here has wide swings — in 1990, it was more than 114,000; in the fall of 1995 down to 57,000; by 1998 back up to 113,000; down below 61,000 in 2004; 97,000 in March 2013, and 91,700 in May. This business has plenty of dips and slowdowns. Still, it is significant that the certainty of strong orders by Boeing brass in recent years has recently given way to repeated backtracking and cautioning (and, yes, the 737 is doing well, for now). Also, as in the past, larger forces are at work. The China economic pullback continues to reverberate. The world economy is growing slowly, if at all — every BRICS nation is suffering. All this affects commercial airplane orders. So this is a time for watchful waiting. That’s especially true considering the national expansion is aging. Changes in the metro Seattle economy make a repeat of the early 1970s “Boeing recession” impossible. But slow down Boeing and add in trouble at, say, Amazon and Microsoft and we’re talking something serious. And for all of us carping about high prices, housing, traffic, “where’s my Seattle from 1985?” … no boom lasts forever. But busts have a way of sweeping away plenty of good things as well as bad bets, and lately they’ve only made inequality worse.

By Mary-Ann Russon August 11, 2016 18:23 BST Boeing has made major progress with the Starline CST-100, which will be the first new space capsule to take astronauts into space from US soilBoeing As part of continued efforts to revitalise the US space industry and once again have astronauts launched into space from American soil, Boeing and Nasa are striving ahead to build space capsule called Starliner that will feature 21st century technology to get humans and cargo into low-earth orbit destinations. The Starliner CST-100 crew taxi vehicle is a space capsule designed to fit the United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V rocket. The capsule's parachute and airbag system enables it to be reused up to 10 times, it flies autonomously (with backup manual controls just in case) and it can hold five passengers comfortably as well as cargo. Test flights on a prototype of the Starliner CST-100 are meant to take place in 2016, with the intention that the Starliner will be able to fly Nasa astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) and back in 2018, and eventually to the Bigelow Aerospace orbital space complex that is currently being developed for launch in 2020. A glimpse at the future of US space ambitions The pressure hull for Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner structural test article sits inside a repurposed space shuttle hangar at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in FloridaNASA/Kim Shiflett Boeing recently gave the media a first look at the Starliner factory – the 50,000sq ft high Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility (C3PF) high bay at the Kennedy Space Center in a hangar that previously housed the orbiter Discovery and cost $20m (£15.4m) to refurbish. Currently, there is currently no direct American access to the ISS and Nasa has to pay $70m (£48.3m) per seat for US astronauts to ride on Russia's Soyuz space capsules. To counter this, Nasa has awarded both SpaceX and Boeing over $8.2bn to help private firms revitalise the space industry as soon as possible, and Boeing is calling in small businesses to help it with the many components needed to make the spacecraft a reality. The aerospace manufacturer told Universe Today that it was currently simultaneously building two full scale Starliner crew vehicles at full speed, while work is almost complete on the Structural Test Article (STA) crew module, which will be sent to a test site in California so that qualification tests can begin to make sure the that all the components in the space vehicle are structurally sound. The Starliner CST-100 is meant to be much lighter than previous space capsules, using a weldless spin-forming process to produce a honeycomb effect that makes the capsule both lighter and more resilient to the stress placed on the spacecraft during flight. While the space capsules continue to be built, this weekend (13 August), Nasa, Boeing and ULA plan to showcase the CST-100 Starliner Crew Access Arm and White Room to the Crew Access Tower on Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The arm will serve as the connection that astronauts will walk through prior to boarding Boeing's Starliner spacecraft when stacked atop ULA's Atlas V rocket. On track to deliver space capsule to Nasa in 2018 The Crew Access Arm will be used as a bridge by astronauts to board Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft as it stands on the launch pad atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocketNASA/Ben Smegelsky At the moment, everything is on track for the pad abort test that will make sure the spacecraft is able to life astronauts away from danger if there is an emergency during launch. That test will take place in October 2017, while a full unmanned orbital test flight is slated to take place by the end of 2017, and the plan is for three crew taxi vehicles to be ready for Nasa deployment by 2018. If all goes well, there will be a two-person crew test flight in February 2018, launched atop the Atlas V rocket, and in August 2018, SpaceX plans to hold a similar crew test flight on a Dragon space rocket to the ISS. "It's important for our team to understand the legacy of the shuttle program, all the lessons we learned on the shuttle program, and transition to the next phase of human spaceflight," said John Mulholland, head of Boeing's commercial space program, according to Florida Today. "I'm extremely confident that if our team continues to perform to our plan, that we're going to be just fine. We're really proud of our team at what we've accomplished, and feel very comfortable that we will capture the flag and be the first partner of Nasa to return humans to the International Space Station on a domestic system."

NASA has been discussing potential partnership opportunities with Bigelow for its inflatable habitat technologies as part of NASA's goal to develop innovative technologies to ensure that the U.S. remains competitive in future space endeavors. (Photo : Photo by Bill Ingalls/NASA via Getty Images) In hopes of surviving in space, NASA is partnering with private companies to build space habitats. The Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program has partnered with approximately six companies to build the prototypes which would meet the criteria of basic life support to radiation mitigation. Advertisement For NASAs NextSTEP program, six private companies have been selected. These include a few renowned names in the US aerospace industry namely Orbital ATK, Bigelow Aerospace, Nanoracks, Boeing, Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems, and Lockheed Martin. However, not all of the companies will be building space habitat modules. A few are said to focus on propulsion systems, communication infrastructure, and other equipment needed for survival in space. The space habitats created by the companies will become part of the mission to Mars set for 2030. The three private companies focused on creating space habitats are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, and NanoRacks. Bigelow Aerospace is developing an Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), which is an expandable habitat. This 330 cubic meter space habitat would be attached to the visiting module of an existing space station. Boeing's space habitat is a capsule designed to be assembled while in orbit. Low cost and quite simple, the Boeing space habitat can be modified for long term deep space missions. The third space habitat is from NanoRacks, which is in partnership with two companies namely United Launch Alliance and Space Systems Loral. The habitat called "Ixion" will make use of repurposed propellant tanks of launch vehicles. These will be converted into a space habitat. If the design works, this can be a cost saving measure. As for Lockheed Martin, the private company is set on developing a logistic module. This will be used for the Orion spacecraft. The main component of Lockheed Martin's logistic module is its Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). Advertisement Orbital ATK will be creating cargo supply ships in the form of the Cygnus Spacecraft for the International Space Station (ISS). The Cygnus Spacecraft is reportedly a new prototype which will be used in tandem with other deep space modules and the Orion Spacecraft. Last but not the least is Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems. The private company is in charge of creating an unmanned reusable space vehicle, the Dream Chaser spaceplane.

Here's how these two peas in a pod are using Azure data technologies to make commercial flights more efficient and even (gasp!) more pleasant. By Andrew Brust for Big on Data | August 11, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics Boeing 787 Dreamliner Last month, in a keynote at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference (WPC), Microsoft demonstrated on stage how Japan Airlines is using HoloLens to improve the technician training experience, bringing jet engines to life in 3D, hologram-based augmented reality. Neat stuff. read this Delta outage highlights how airline industry needs new IT approaches The airline industry is plagued by legacy systems and single points of IT failure. How'd we get here? Mergers, bankruptcy restructurings, and falling behind the cloud curve. Read More But a week after WPC, Microsoft announced that it and Boeing are partnering around Azure and data. I wanted to know more about that. Given that commercial airplanes are described by some as "flying data centers" and considering the number of inefficiencies that exist in commercial air travel today (just ask anyone who flies more than once a year), the potential for analytics in commercial aviation seems immense, and so do the potential benefits. Talking to both companies I asked Microsoft if I could learn more and the company was kind enough to set me up to speak with Andrew Gendreau, the director of advanced information solutions in Boeing's Digital Aviation division, and Greg Jones, Microsoft's global industry director for travel & hospitality. Although we only had a short time to speak, I found out a lot. For one thing, Microsoft and Boeing already had a partnership in place and have already worked together using Microsoft's application development stack, especially its tools for mobile applications. One output of that collaboration: tablet-based Electronic Flight Bag software that replaces paper-based flight bags, containing books and documents, often weighing as much as 40 lbs! Predictive Examples Under the existing partnership, things like Maintenance Optimization, Crew Planning, and Crew Training were already being addressed. Fuel optimization was in motion as well, and it's fascinating. By observing fuel usage over all of its flights, an airline can build predictive models which predict fuel usage needs over time. These models can account for the idiosyncrasies of certain routes (and their typical air traffic delays), seasonal anomalies, equipment, passenger load, and so forth. These models can then be used to drive policy, performance targets, financial aspects of fuel procurement (potentially including hedging strategies), and the necessary change management to make all of these procedures and systems work better. All in But now the two companies are moving beyond these specific initiatives, with an eye towards a thorough re-platforming that would build and host all efficiency applications on Azure. The scope of this is huge, and it benefits not just the airlines, but passengers too. Have you been on a flight that seemed to be running on-time only to encounter a maintenance issue at the last minute? Ever waited for the part and the technician to arrive and fix the problem or, worse yet, have to deplane and switch aircraft? When such things happen, it infuriates passengers. It's also expensive and disruptive to the airline -- the delays are costly and the impact on flight crews' morale and performance is non-trivial. Multiple contingencies, in model form The good news is that predictive models can help here, in many ways. Predictive maintenance can avoid operational maintenance incidents overall. And where they can't do that for specific aircraft, they can still assist greatly in making sure the right parts and personnel are on-call, in the locations where such issues are most likely. Special Feature Cloud: How to Do SaaS Right Software as a Service offers irresistible benefits for organizations of all sizes — from cost savings to scalability to mobile accessibility. We offer guidance on avoiding the pitfalls of the cloud and choosing your SaaS partners well. Read More This overall discipline is called (I kid you not) "disruption management" and encompasses things such as schedule execution, equipment utilization optimization, and performance of crew. Another important component of this work is determining the optimal set of actions required to mitigate outages and equipment failures. These outages include not just the aircraft and its navigational components but hardware and services in support of the customer journey, including things like climate control, overhead lights, and the in-flight video system. All together Of course, all of these services are delivered by the airlines (or "operators") and not Boeing, per se. But in addition to manufacturing aircraft, Boeing offers management systems for these operational needs to its airline customers. As Microsoft builds out its data cloud with services like Azure Machine Learning, HDInsight (with Spark and R), Azure IoT Suite, and Power BI, Boeing thinks it's got a full-on platform on which it can standardize. Microsoft is a database company, an enterprise software company, and a cloud computing company. It seems that combination is exactly what a company like Boeing needs as it establishes such a wide-ranging partnership.

The cadets from 17 units are part of the Northern Ireland Wing of the Air Training Corps who are currently working together to build a Sting S4 plane at Ulster Aviation Society’s Lisburn hangar. The project - Centennial Wings, which has been supported by funding from Boeing and the Air League, is in the early stages and cadets are working on the aircraft to ensure it will be ready to fly at Farnborough Air Show in 2018 to mark the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Air Force. Sir Michael Arthur, president, Boeing Europe and managing director, Boeing UK commented: “These young men and women are the future of our industry and I could not be more proud that we can support this engaging, hands-on STEM initiative.” The Sting S4 ultralight aircraft is being built from kit, under the guidance of Sqn Ldr Ian Campbell, Wg Cdr Mike Miskimmin, volunteers from the Ulster Aviation Society as well as Boeing engineers who will also mentor the programme. The two-seater plane will have a state-of-the-art system of controls and instruments installed and when completed the aircraft will be capable of a maximum speed of 177 miles per hour. Project Officer Aaron Coulter commented on the project which is expected to take a year to complete: “This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for the cadets who are taking part and a first for cadets from Northern Ireland. “They have all been greatly enthused by the project, it’s not everyday kids get the opportunity to build an aircraft.” Farnborough Airshow is described as ‘the world’s greatest airshow’ and the cadets will be in Hampshire to see their aircraft presented. “The project team will all be over at Farnborough,” added Aaron. “Our cadets travel to the Royal International Air Tattoo every year but cadets in Northern Ireland don’t get the opportunity to go to Farnborough so it will be a great experience to see the aircraft will fly at the airshow and also be on display for people to look at.” The biennial Farnborough Airshow alternates with the Paris Airshow. With about 1,500 exhibitors and some 100,000 trade visitors, Farnborough’s pulling power remains huge. It has played a key role as a marketplace for Britain’s aerospace and defence firms. The 17 squadrons involved in the project are: 72 (Omagh), 806 (Larne), 814 (Portadown College), 817 (Lisburn), 825 (Bangor), 833 (Antrim), 1134 (West Belfast), 1136 (South Belfast), 1137 (East Belfast), 1919 (Newtownabbey), 2004 (Ballynahinch), 2062 (Carrickfergus), 2178 (Hollywood), 2241 (Regent House School), 2349 (Ballymena), 2350 (Coleraine), 2390 (Belfast Royal Academy).

A state-of-the-art Etihad Airways Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner today touched down in Shanghai from Abu Dhabi on its first flight into China. The new Dreamliner features the airline's next-generation Business and Economy Class cabins, with 299 seats – 28 in Business Class and 271 in Economy – representing a 14 per cent capacity increase on the route. Flight EY862 from Abu Dhabi departed at 10.25pm yesterday arriving in Shanghai at 11.10am today. The inaugural flight from Shanghai (EY867) will depart again on 3 August at 00.30am, arriving in Abu Dhabi at 6.15am the same day. To mark the event, guests were presented with commemorative certificates in Chinese and English, featuring Shanghai's iconic landmark, the Oriental Pearl Tower. Peter Baumgartner, Chief Executive Officer of Etihad Airways, said: "Since launching flights between Shanghai and Abu Dhabi four years ago, we have experienced first-hand the huge growth of China's outbound tourism market and enjoyed strong demand from both business and leisure travellers. "The decision to upgrade to the Boeing 787 reflects the importance of Shanghai and China to the airline. Shanghai is a modern metropolis and a global economic, financial, trading and shipping centre, which underlines its importance within Etihad Airways' global network and supports the introduction of the new aircraft." Mr Baumgartner continued: "The new Boeing 787 services will help to support the increasing demand for outbound tourism from Shanghai and its surrounding cities in Eastern China. The additional capacity will enable more Chinese business and leisure travellers to enjoy seamless one-stop connections over the Abu Dhabi hub to over 40 destinations across the Gulf region, Europe, Africa and South America." China has recently surpassed the USA as the biggest business travel market in the world, according to the Global Business Travel Association, representing US$291.2 billion spending on business travel in 2015. The Dreamliner will assist Etihad Airways' growing reputation amongst the business community in China, with the aircraft specifically catering to the long-haul business market.

Homes Heritage Perth and District Christmas House Tour 5 / 5 The latest update on defence contracts awarded David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen More from David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen Published on: August 11, 2016 | Last Updated: August 11, 2016 12:26 AM EST Training systems are being developed for the RCAF's Chinook helicopters (one of those helicopters is shown here in this USN photo). Bluedrop Performance Learning Inc. and Boeing recently announced they completed a major milestone in the development of the next-generation CH-47 Chinook helicopter Rear Crew Trainer with the integration of its Canadian-built fuselage with Boeing’s cockpit training simulator system. Share Adjust Comment Print The latest issue of Esprit de Corps magazine is out and it has my article outlining recently awarded contracts for the defence industry. Here is the article, based on info provided by the companies: IMP Aerospace has delivered the final re-winged P-3 Orion aircraft to the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF), marking the successful completion of the multi-year program, company officials announced. The aircraft are very similar to the Canadian CP140 Auroras, which are also receiving new wings, as well as mission system upgrades as part of a mid-life upgrade being undertaken at IMP Aerospace under a separate contract. The wing replacement is part of the Aircraft Service Life Extension Program (ASLEP), which also includes the replacement of the center wing lower surface and horizontal stabilizer, IMP noted. Under this program, all life-limiting components are replaced with new materials incorporating advanced alloys, yielding a five-fold increase in corrosion resistance and resulting in a significant reduction in future maintenance and operating costs, the firm pointed out. The ASLEP(N) contract was awarded to IMP in February 2008, to refit the entire RNoAF fleet of six P-3 Orion aircraft. L-3 MAS announced that it has been awarded a contract to provide avionics upgrade kits for the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18 early Lot C aircraft. The F/A-18 C+ upgrade kit will provide the USN with parts required to modernize a portion of its legacy fleet to ensure it maintains its operational viability to meet ongoing strike fighter commitments. The contract calls for 28 kits, L-3 MAS officials said. L-3 MAS provides F/A-18 A-D depot maintenance, system upgrade and life extension solutions and has provided such support to Canada, Australia, Finland, Spain, Switzerland and the U.S. Navy. Discovery Air Defence Services Inc., (DA Defence) has had its Standing Offers to provide interim Contracted Airborne Training Services (“ICATS”) to the Canadian government extended until December 2017, with two additional six-month option periods.  DA Defence has been the exclusive supplier of “fast jet” (Type 1) and “business jet” (Type 2) airborne training services to the Canadian Armed Forces through these Standing Offers since 2005, the company pointed out. The ICATS program supports live-fly Adversary, Joint Terminal Attack Controller training, Electronic Warfare and Electronic Attack training as well as live fire target practice. Bluedrop Performance Learning Inc. and Boeing announced they completed a major milestone in the development of the next-generation CH-47 Chinook helicopter Rear Crew Trainer with the integration of its Canadian-built fuselage with Boeing’s cockpit training simulator system. The fuselage is part of a forty-two foot-long mock-up of the Chinook helicopter that was manufactured by Bluedrop and installed in its Bluedrop Training and Simulation Centre facility in Halifax. The team has also tested, and is on track to achieve a 100 percent untethered, or wireless, virtual reality training experience to maximize the flexibility and safety of the trainer. The initial development phase of the trainer began one year ago following a more than US$2 million cash commitment from Boeing as well as, an intellectual property license associated with the specific technical characteristics of the Chinook platform, engineering support from the Boeing training and simulation group during the development phase, and a five-year commitment to support the on-going sales and marketing of the new product within Boeing’s global supply chain. The integration and testing process will continue through the fall, with a full demonstration of the stand-alone trainer ready by year end. Final delivery of the trainer to Boeing is anticipated in early 2017. The Chinook is used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Army Reserve, National Guard and more than 19 counties including Canada, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Japan, Italy, Greece, Spain, South Korea, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Bluedrop Training & Simulation Inc., a subsidiary of Bluedrop Performance Learning Inc. received a US$13 million contract from Sikorsky to provide instructors and training courseware for pilots and maintainers learning to operate Canada’s new fleet of 28 CH-148 Cyclone maritime helicopters. The agreement extends by three years the training that Bluedrop has provided to the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project since 2010. Bluedrop will provide over 30 technician and aircrew instructors, simulator operators and training program support personnel for the 406 Operational and Training Squadron located at 12 Wing Shearwater in Nova Scotia. The Cyclone training suite includes two flight simulators, two operational mission simulators, six mission procedures trainers and two aircraft maintenance trainers; supplemented by several maintenance part task trainers. C4i Training & Technology of Calgary supported a series of emergency response exercises, running along the West Coast of the United States and Canada, in an effort to prepare local leaders for a large-scale earthquake and resulting tsunami. Exercises included: CASCADIA RISING (USA – WA, OR, FEMA Region 10), Coastal Response (Canada – EMBC) and Staunch Maple (Canada DND). C4i’s Emergency and Disaster Management Simulation was selected as the simulation driver for the Washington State National Guard and Oregon National Guard events on CASCADIA RISING. Also, in partnership with Calian, C4i provided EDMSIM to EMBC, providing the scenario, visualization and social media stimulus to the Provincial Emergency Management organization’s preparation exercise. GE’s Marine Solutions business in Peterborough, Ont., is completing one of the  first milestones of the company’s 7-year contract with Irving Shipbuilding Inc., to provide electrical power, propulsion systems, installation and commissioning services for six ice-capable Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships (AOPS) for the Royal Canadian Navy.  GE’s power and propulsion systems will position the new vessels amongst the highest performance in their class worldwide.  Four diesel generators and engines have been shipped to ISI’s Halifax Shipyard, and GE has begun acceptance testing on the first AOPS propulsion motor. General Dynamics Mission Systems–Canada successfully completed at-sea testing for its MATADOR Torpedo Detection System under the Build in Canada Innovation Program (BCIP). The testing, conducted on board a Royal Canadian Navy ship, confirmed the detection and tracking capabilities of the MATADOR system against heavyweight anti-ship torpedoes. MATADOR is an acoustic processing system optimized for torpedo detection and designed to be used with a wide range of passive underwater sensors. The system’s open architecture and flexible interface allow it to be configured to work seamlessly with almost any sensor. Sensor systems fitted with the specialized MATADOR acoustic analysis capability can provide additional levels of warning that reduce mission risk, allowing ships to operate more safely and effectively in the far oceans of the world. Under the BCIP, innovative Canadian products are matched with a government department for testing in a relevant operational environment. The MATADOR system was installed onboard HMCS Calgary using the existing towed sonar array as the underwater sensor. The Royal Canadian Navy recently tested an integrated submarine combat system developed by Lockheed Martin. The test marked Canada’s first use of the combat system with the MK 48 heavyweight torpedo, variant 7AT. The exercise took place at the Canadian Forces Maritime Experimental and Test Ranges (CFMETR) on the U.S. Navy Yard Torpedo Tender Battle Point, a surface ship that can launch torpedoes from submarine tubes, Lockheed Martin said. The next step is to install the submarine combat system on the Victoria class submarine for further test firings, according to Lockheed. The plan is to upgrade all Victoria Class submarines to the CCS 876 Combat System over the next few years. Along with the CCS 876 Combat System, the RCN is also deploying the AN/BQQ-10(v)7 sonar system developed by Lockheed Martin, the company pointed out.   What is happening with HMCS Charlottetown and the outbreak of Hand,...

MUMBAI: Preliminary inquiry into the Emirates Dubai crash landing suggest that the commander retracted the landing gear during a wind shear go-around after which the Boeing 777 aircraft lost speed rapidly and crash-landed onto the runway. A wind shear is a rapid change in wind speed and/or direction over a short area and by itself this weather phenomena rarely brings down a passenger jet such as a Boeing 777. "But when a go-around is carried out in wind shear, the standard operating procedure is to leave the aircraft configuration unchanged, that is, it's landing gear and flap settings should be left untouched," said a senior commander. So, if the landing gear is down, as would be the case when an aircraft approaches a runway to land, then it shouldn't be retracted till the aircraft has climbed clear off wind shear. That rule was probably not honoured. It is also suspected that the aircraft did not have full go-around power, which is needed to climb out of a wind shear situation. On August 3, the Boeing 777300 aircraft operating the Emirates ThiruvananthapuramDubai flight EK 521 crash landed on the 13,123-feet long Dubai runway 12 L at 12.50pm. The aircraft was engulfed in smoke and burst into flames a few minutes later. A commendably executed emergency evacuation ensured the survival of all the 282 passengers and 18 crew. While only the final investigation report will reveal a comprehensive picture of the sequence of events that led to the crash, preliminary inquiries put a question mark over the actions taken by the commander during the course of the wind shear go-around. "When it came down to land, the Boeing 777 continued to float over the runway and missed the touchdown zone," said the commander. This occurs when there is a strong tailwind (wind blowing from the tail to the nose of aircraft). The commander initiated a go-around, that is, instead of continuing with the landing, the aircraft would now climb, level out, descent and approach the runway for a second attempt at landing. A go-around is a standard, safe practice opted for by pilots when not sure of a safe landing. The commander would have pushed the TOGA (take off-go around) switch on the throttle which would rev up the engines to full throttle to give full power so as allow the aircraft to climb out of wind shear. "Now, during a wind shear go around, no changes should be made to the flap setting or landing gears till the aircraft has left the wind shear zone," he added. However, it seems, the Emirates commander didn't wait for it. It is also not clear whether the aircraft had attained full TOGA power too."After the aircraft climbed a bit, he seems to have raised the landing gear lever to retract the gear. The aircraft had its nose high up and all these actions together increases the drag on the aircraft, which in turn reduces its speed. The aircraft speed dipped and it stalled and crashed onto the runway. The pilots gave a Mayday call and ordered an evacuation," the source said.Capt M Ranganathan, an air safety expert said: "If they had followed the wind shear go around procedure correctly and left the landing gear down, the aircraft would have been safe." An Emirates spokesperson said: "The incident is currently being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Emirates is extending our full cooperation in this regard. We are unable to comment further. Both the Captain and the First Officer have over seven thousand hours of flying experience each." Only the final investigation report will reveal whether the actions taken by the commander led to the crash. What should be remembered though is that investigations should not carried out to apportion blame, but to find out the causes and to prevent a recurrence.

Thanks to This Man, Airplanes Don’t Crash Into Mountains Anymore Bloomberg 11/08/2016 The wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, a Boeing 727, smolders as recovery workers search for the bodies of 111 victims on Sept. 7, 1971, in Juneau, Alaska. Giant flocks of black birds circled the wreckage of an airliner that had struck an Alaska mountain two weeks earlier, killing all 111 aboard. In a small plane overhead, a young engineer directed his pilot to follow the same path the jet had taken toward the craggy terrain. With seconds to spare, an alarm went off. Don Bateman’s plane climbed to safety, but he was frustrated. The electronic device he invented to warn pilots that they were about to hit the ground didn’t leave enough time to have prevented the large airliner from crashing. “I was disappointed,” Bateman, now 84, recalled of the day in 1971 when he flew over the remains of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, which had slammed into a fog-shrouded ridge. “We needed to do better.” That’s exactly what Bateman and his small team of engineers at what is now Honeywell International Inc. did. The device presaged today’s mobile mapping applications, dramatically reduced what had been by far the worst class of air crashes and made Honeywell billions of dollars. © Mike Kane/Bloomberg Don Bateman with a Honeywell plane the company used to test his safety devices at Paine Field in Everett, Wash. “I would give Don individual credit for having saved more lives than any other individual in the history of commercial aviation,” said Earl Weener, a member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and former chief engineer for safety at Boeing Co. Before retiring in June, Bateman and his band of colleagues dabbled in the world of Cold War espionage, hid the true cost of their endeavor from their corporate masters and endured skepticism from the very airlines whose planes were being lost. In spite of repeated changes in corporate ownership and the blunt-spoken Bateman’s occasional threats to quit, he worked on his mission to save lives with the same group for almost six decades, colleagues said. Eventually Bateman’s Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System became required in most commercial planes around the world, dramatically reducing accidents in which perfectly good aircraft with trained crews plowed into the ground or bodies of water, almost always in poor visibility. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an average of one such fatal accident per month, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. It was by far the largest cause of death in jetliner accidents. Since the U.S. government began requiring an upgraded version of the device on all but the smallest aircraft starting in 2001, there hasn’t been a single such fatal crash on a U.S. commercial passenger plane equipped with it or competing devices. There have been a few overseas, often when pilots ignored or shut off the devices.

Bateman was always fascinated with airplane crashes. As an 8-year-old school boy in 1940 in Saskatoon, Canada, he and a friend sneaked out of class after two military planes collided and crashed nearby. As punishment, his teacher made him write a report on what happened. “That was my introduction to aircraft accidents,” he said recently. The carnage he saw that day helped motivate him years later. After taking a job with Boeing in Seattle, he joined a small aviation firm called United Control in 1958. Airplane accidents continued to fascinate him and he began “making little books” of notes on them. One type stood out. In the arcane world of aviation terminology, these crashes were called Controlled Flight into Terrain, or CFIT. It was a vexing problem: Basic navigation should have kept pilots from crashing. But the cockpit navigation technology of that era wasn’t intuitive and it was too easy to get disoriented, especially at night or in bad weather. “In my mind it became a big issue, even though there wasn’t much being done about it,” Bateman recalled. In the 1960s, Bateman worked with Scandinavian Airlines System, now SAS AB, which had suffered a CFIT crash in Turkey in 1960, to invent a mechanism to warn pilots when they flew too low. It involved a new instrument on planes that used radio waves to determine a plane’s distance from the ground. It helped stem the accident rate and, after a series of crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required it starting in 1974. But it was prone to false alarms and had a glaring weakness: It couldn’t look forward, so was of little use if a plane was flying toward steeply increasing ground, such as a mountain. For years, Bateman tinkered with the device to improve it. He also consulted with NTSB investigators, poring over accident reports. “He would come to me and say what do we know about this accident?” said Jim Ritter, director of the NTSB’s Office of Research and Engineering, who was a technician at the time. “The whole time, the gears were spinning and he was trying to make things safer.” Bateman had been imagining a far better solution as early as his flight over the Alaska crash site. If he could create a database of all the world’s terrain, the device would see mountain tops and cliffs from miles away. But this was before personal computers and global-positioning services. Even worse, much of the world’s topography was considered secret at the time, a vestige of the Cold War. Then in 1991, in the chaos created by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the detailed maps it had created of the world starting in the 1920s were for sale -- if you knew where to buy them. Bateman asked Frank Daly, the director of engineering at the Sundstrand Corp. division that had swallowed United Control, for his blessing to purchase the data from the U.S. government’s Cold War enemy. “He thought I was crazy,” Bateman said. They wound up sending one of his employees, Frank Brem, in search of maps in Russia and elsewhere. “There isn’t a terrain data store in downtown Moscow,” Daly recalled. “But he would go out and find the right people.” A bigger problem than navigating the black market was the millions of dollars it was costing for the still unproven technology. “We probably weren’t as open with senior management about that process,” Daly said. He sometimes hid costs in other accounts. © Emile Wamsteker/Bloomberg A demonstration of a prototype infrared technology from Honeywell at Morristown Airport in New Jersey in 2010. By the early 1990s, Bateman had developed working prototypes of the new system. Now the company had to sell it. For pilots and safety officers, it was a marvel. Ed Soliday, then director of safety at United Airlines, had been prodding Bateman to improve the warning device. One day in the early 1990s, Bateman called and said he thought he had what Soliday wanted. “Once I flew the thing with Don, it was like an epiphany,” Soliday recalled. “I was sold. I thought if we could make it work, this was a huge breakthrough.” If a plane was flying toward a mountain, a screen popped up automatically marking the high ground in yellow and red on a map. If pilots didn’t respond, it began a series of increasingly dire warnings. Once a collision became almost imminent, a mechanical voice implored, “Terrain, terrain. Pull up! Pull up!” Compared to the earlier system, it was almost fool proof. But many of the more cost-conscious corporate chieftains at airlines weren’t convinced, according to Bateman and Daly. A meeting at American Airlines was particularly grim. Daly was on the sales call at the airline’s headquarters with his then chief executive officer. Their host, a senior executive at the airline, was hostile. “He was almost apoplectic and said, ‘We don’t want another box. We don’t want to have to replace the existing system,’ ” Daly said. “Here I am justifying spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and my boss has just been soundly beaten on the shoulders by the customer.” Soliday had more success at United. The airline agreed to help Bateman’s team test it so it could be certified by the FAA, he said. Most other carriers balked. It took another high-profile fatal crash to change their minds. As American Flight 965 neared Cali, Colombia, from Miami on the evening of Dec. 20, 1995, a pilot accidentally entered the wrong data into the plane’s flight computers. The crew didn’t notice as it began a slow left turn toward mountains lying invisible in the darkness. The Boeing 757 was equipped with the earlier version of Bateman’s warning device and its mechanical voice began warning of “terrain.” But 13 seconds later, after the pilots added full throttle to climb as steeply as possible, it rammed into a ridge. All but four of the 163 people aboard died. Within days the airline wanted the new device, which would have issued an alert far earlier and likely prevented the crash, Bateman and Daly said. First American and then United agreed to voluntarily install them. Other carriers followed. The FAA began requiring them in 2001. In the end, the products spawned by Bateman’s device were a financial boon to Honeywell. There are 45,000 units on aircraft today, worth more than $4 billion at list prices, according to the company. Both Bateman and Daly wonder whether the decades-long effort to develop and improve the warning system would be possible in today’s risk-averse corporate world. “Today new projects need to be blessed by many people,” Daly said. “You need to have hard evidence. They just would not speculatively fund something like this, especially when we were being resisted by the aircraft manufacturers, the airlines. “But Don’s faith, the genius of his team and a little support from the company -- and it happened.” Go to MSN Home More in News The slow-burning hatred that led Thomas Mair to murder Jo Cox The Guardian Scotland Yard probes 58 GHB-related deaths after Stephen Port killings Evening Standard Brexit vote means £122bn extra borrowing chancellor admits The Guardian Man guilty of randomly punching baby in face at supermarket fined £900 Evening Standard Former England footballer David White sexually abused as a young player The Guardian Cat forced to eat other cats to survive after being abandoned by owner The Independent Up Next White supremacist will die in jail for murdering pro-EU MP Jo Cox Sky News More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © 2016 Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam Newsletter

"If the market's not going to demand it, we're not going to go," Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the sidelines of an investor conference in New York by global investment bank Jefferies, confirming remarks made during the formal program. "It's not the end of the world" if Boeing keeps 787 production at 12 a month instead of lifting it to 14 as planned, Smith said during the event. "We can still be profitable in the program as I see it today at 12." Analysts said Smith's statement confirmed that Boeing will not overproduce widebody planes and, most importantly, does not foresee an accounting charge for the 787 if output stays at 12. Boeing took about $1.7 billion in after-tax charges in its latest result for the 787 and 747 programs to account for excess 787 inventory and slow 747 sales. Smith said the company would decide in the next two months whether to cut 777 output further. If it fails to sell enough 777s to bridge the gap to new 777X production, "then we will make an adjustment accordingly," he said. His comments went beyond what he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told analysts after the company released quarterly results last month. Muilenburg said Boeing would "keep supply and demand in balance" but did not discuss keeping 787 production at 12 a month or cutting 777 further. Low oil prices and a series of boom years have slowed orders for new widebody jetliners, raising concerns that Boeing will notch down cash and profit targets. Smith said on Wednesday that Boeing still has about two years to decide whether to raise 787 output, given lead times for components, and could still generate rising cash flow and profit if production rates "moderate" on the 787 and 777. The list price for the mid-sized 787 is $264.6 million, but airlines typically receive steep discounts. Boeing has won eight net 777 orders this year and 19 net 787 orders. It already plans to reduce 777 production by 15 percent next year as it switches to the 777X. Boeing shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $132.28 on the New York Stock Exchange. -Reuters- Add comment Name (required) E-mail (required, but will not display) Website Notify me of follow-up comments Refresh Send Cancel JComments News National News International News Business News Sports News Documentary Links CNN News BBC News AseanMedia Channel News Asia Others About Us Contact Us Feedback Copyright © 2016 RTB News Website.

Smith indicated that the dearth of widebody jet sales may mean Boeing won’t raise output of the 787 Dreamliner as high as planned. A further 777 production rate cut and a lower-than-planned 787 rate — added to the possibility signaled last month that Boeing could shutter the 747 jumbo jet assembly line — would mean less work in the Seattle-area city of Everett and potential job cuts there. Boeing has already committed to slowing production of the current 777 from today’s rate of 8.3 jets per month — that’s 100 per year — down to 7 jets per month in 2017. The rate will decrease further to 5.5 jets per month during the transition to the new model 777X in 2018. Speaking at the Jefferies Industrials Conference in New York, Smith said it’s unclear if new orders will arrive in time to match those planned rates. “Over the next couple of months, we’ll know,” Smith said. “We’ll either solidify those orders or we’ll modify the production rate.” Boeing has said it needs to sell 40 to 60 jets per year to fill all the open 777 delivery slots between now and the end of the decade. This year it has booked just eight net new orders. Smith did not indicate how much lower the rate might go. Local aviation analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham.net said the 777 order backlog suggests a rate of about 4 aircraft per month is sustainable without further sales. One indicator that the 777 market is in trouble came in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late last month by global aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation. Intrepid, which has six 777s on order from Boeing, revealed it hasn’t yet found airlines to take four of those planes — three scheduled for delivery next fall and the other in early 2018. Sam Pearlstein, aerospace analyst with Wells Fargo, wrote in a note to investors that “this highlights why Boeing’s goal of 40-plus annual new 777 orders will remain a challenge.” Smith also lowered expectations on production of the 787 Dreamliner. Next year, 787 production is set to rise from today’s 10 jets per month to 12. And Boeing had planned to make 14 per month by the end of the decade. Now that second rate hike looks uncertain. “We’re going to match supply and demand, and if it doesn’t play out to be 14, then we’ll adjust accordingly,” Smith said. “It’s not the end of the world if you went from 14 to 12. We can still be profitable.” While the 787 sold at record levels prior to entering service, sales slowed dramatically afterwards. In the first five years of sales, Boeing sold 700 Dreamliners. In the five and a half years since, it has sold 400 more. So far this year, Boeing has added just 19 net new orders for the jet. Last week, Leeham.net’s Hamilton wrote that even the planned rate of 12 Dreamliners per month could be challenging to sustain without more 787 sales.

(MIke Siegel/The Seattle Times) Boeing will decide in the next couple of months whether to further cut back planned production of its large 777 jet and may also cancel a planned production increase for the 787 Dreamliner. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Citing “softness” in the widebody-jet market, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said Wednesday that the airplane manufacturer will decide in the next couple months whether to further cut back planned production of its large 777 jet. Smith indicated that the dearth of widebody-jet sales may also mean Boeing won’t raise output of the 787 Dreamliner as high as planned.   Coming on the heels of last month’s signal that Boeing could shutter the 747 jumbo-jet assembly line, the latest wavering on production means Boeing’s Everett plant could lose substantial work that would trigger significant job cuts. Jon Talton's column Back to the future: a new Boeing recession? Boeing has already shed more than 3,500 jobs in Washington state so far this year, with more to come due to previously announced cost-cutting efforts. John Monroe, a former 777 executive at Boeing and now chief operations officer at the Economic Alliance of Snohomish County (EASC), said the Everett community would feel the impact of a Boeing downcycle at a plant that currently employs about 37,000 people. He said a dip in Boeing work would also hit many suppliers to the jet maker around Everett. “Our experience has been that significant production-rate cuts have been followed by reductions in the workforce,” Monroe said. “Job cuts seem inevitable.” Boeing has already committed to slowing production of the current 777 from today’s rate of 8.3 jets per month — that’s 100 per year — down to 7 jets per month in 2017. The rate will decrease further to 5.5 jets per month during the transition to the new model 777X in 2018. Speaking at the Jefferies Industrials Conference in New York, Smith said it’s unclear if new orders will arrive in time to match those planned production rates. “Over the next couple of months, we’ll know,” Smith said. “We’ll either solidify those orders … or we’ll modify the production rate.” Boeing has said it needs to sell 40 to 60 jets per year to fill all the open 777 delivery slots between now and the end of the decade. So far this year, it has booked just eight net new orders. Smith did not indicate how much lower the rate might go. Local aviation analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham.net said the 777 order backlog suggests a rate of about 4 aircraft per month is sustainable without further sales. One indicator that the 777 market is in trouble came in a regulatory filing late last month by global aircraft lessor Intrepid Aviation. Intrepid, which has six 777s on order from Boeing, revealed it hasn’t yet found airlines to take four of those planes — three scheduled for delivery in fall next year and the fourth in early 2018. Sam Pearlstein, aerospace analyst with Wells Fargo, wrote in a note to investors that, “This highlights why Boeing’s goal of 40-plus annual new 777 orders will remain a challenge.” On Wednesday, Smith also lowered expectations on production of the 787 Dreamliner. Boeing is now producing 12 of the jets per month and planned to raise that to 14 per month by the end of the decade. Now that rate hike looks uncertain. “We’re going to match supply and demand, and if it doesn’t play out to be 14, then we’ll adjust accordingly,” Smith said. “It’s not the end of the world if you went from 14 to 12 … We can still be profitable.” While the 787 sold at record levels before entering service, sales slowed dramatically afterward. In the first five years of sales, Boeing sold 700 Dreamliners. In the five and a half years since, it has sold 400 more. So far this year, Boeing has added just 19 net new orders for the jet. Last week, Leeham.net’s Hamilton wrote that even the current rate of 12 Dreamliners per month could be challenging to sustain without an uptick in 787 sales. In an interview Wednesday, Hamilton said that if 787 production is further pared back, it’s likely the cutbacks will come in Everett rather than at the assembly line in North Charleston, S.C. The South Carolina line’s prospects are bolstered by the fact that Boeing will build the largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, only at that plant. If the 787 rate were cut, along with the possibility of a 777 production cut and the 747 line closing, “By the end of the decade, it’s very possible we could be looking at some lean times in Everett,” Hamilton said. And he warned that the new 777 model in development, the 777X, doesn’t have enough sales to suggest a big recovery when it enters service in 2020. Boeing, which has 306 firm orders for that new jet, has booked no new orders within the past year. Hamilton said that’s only enough to sustain a production rate of four or five a month. “The 777X isn’t going to be any kind of savior,” he said. Hamilton said Washington state officials need to do “a deep dive into the potential scenarios” and come up with a proactive plan to capture new work for Everett — whether that’s Boeing’s next new airplane or aerospace work from other companies. Monroe said his economic- development group is talking to various European companies, both aerospace and non-aerospace, about locating new facilities in Snohomish County and will continue to push an economic-diversification strategy. He said the state should also step up the funding of worker-retraining programs. Over the past couple of years, as Boeing has shed jobs in Washington state, its local unions have ratcheted up the pressure on state legislators to make the company accountable for maintaining jobs here, by linking the state’s aerospace tax incentives to employment levels. Yet as further job losses now loom, Monroe argued for the opposite approach to keep as much Boeing work here as possible. He said state legislators “need to avoid any reductions in the tax incentives programs that could adversely affect Boeing.” Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) district 751, said the union has “great concern” over any job losses. He said that in the event of a real industry downturn, the IAM is prepared to discuss how to handle tax incentives — implying that Boeing needn’t be penalized if job cuts are the result of an industry downcycle beyond its control. But since the previous peak employment in fall 2012, Boeing has shed 11,000 jobs in Washington state, and Holden said this was a period of record production, when Boeing chose to move thousands of jobs to other states. “If there is no accountability (by Boeing), we’ll continue to see infrastructure, capability and capacity created elsewhere,” Holden said. “Even in a downturn, we should protect the infrastructure here so that when there’s an upswing, that upswing will happen in our state.” Smith meanwhile told his Wall Street audience Wednesday that even if the potential cuts he discussed do happen, the company’s cash flow will stay healthy — thanks largely to planned increases in production of the single-aisle 737 jet built in Renton. “You are still going to see growing cash flows going forward,” Smith assured investors. “That is ultimately what matters.” Dominic Gates: 206-464-2963 or dgates@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Which explains those massive planes in Columbus Antonov An-124-100 Ruslan Volga-Dnepr Airlines at ILA 2014 Berlin Air Show RA-82078 Print Email Stephen Koff, cleveland.com By Stephen Koff, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on August 10, 2016 at 11:01 AM, updated August 10, 2016 at 1:21 PM comments WASHINGTON, D.C. -- While the country debated whether Russia was trying to mess with America's presidential election, a massive Russian cargo jet landed in Columbus late last week. The Volga-Dnepr plane is a behemoth, bigger that any cargo aircraft operated by a United States carrier. It had just received special permission from the United States government to pick up a load of five General Electric jet engines -- made in southwest Ohio -- and ferry them to Everett, Washington, to be mounted on new Boeing 787 jetliners. Boeing needed the engines right then, G.E. told the government, saying work on a Boeing production line in Washington had stopped because of delivery delays. Unless you were driving by Rickenbacker International Airport in Ohio's capital on Friday, you had no idea a colossal Russian cargo airline, capable of loading from the front (with its nose flipped up as if on a hinge) and the back, was doing this. Meantime, newspaper columnists, online pundits and the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were debating about Russia, Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, the role his country played in hacking Democratic National Party emails and the use of WikiLeaks to expose the Russian-hacked emails to the world. Russia, went the narrative, should be viewed with suspicion. But guess what, America?  A Russian company has become our Uber for oversize, point-to-point cargo delivery within the United States, exempt or immune from all the geopolitical turmoil and talk. It carries oversize jet parts, components for America's electric infrastructure, parts that propel U.S. satellites into space.  "They even haul things for the U.S. military," said A. Oakley Brooks, president and CEO of the National Air Carriers Association, which presents American cargo companies. Even in times of tension, such as when the White House and Congress were warning Putin not to invade Ukraine, the flights continued unabated. "As a matter of policy, the U.S. has been good about not intertwining aviation with issues of the day," said Robert Silverberg, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney for ABX Air, a Wilmington, Ohio cargo carrier that hauls smaller loads than the Russians carry. Here, based on a cleveland.com review of government records, is how and why the United States relies on this Russian company and a competing Ukrainian firm. They can do it and we can't: American companies rely on the privately owned Volga-Dnepr and its competitor, Antonov Airlines, a state-owned Ukrainian enterprise, because the companies own or lease the world's largest commercial cargo jets and American air carriers don't. The plane of choice is made by a different division of the Antonov industrial enterprise: an Antonov 124 that specializes in heavy and oversize cargo. It's so big and so easy to load that it can fit large parts of other aircraft, including multiple engines and wing assemblies, in its interior. A boast from Antonov on the plane:  "The list of its cargo is endless – in this sense it can be called as the most universal airplane in the whole history of aviation." No domestic carrier in the United States has such a plane. "It's strictly a function of there being no other equivalent aircraft in the U.S.," Silverberg said. For the record, Antonov has an even larger plane -- the world's biggest -- but it seldom flies. Demand hasn't justified building one here: The irony that America's leading aircraft and aerospace companies rely on Russian and Ukrainian companies for their largest interstate deliveries is lost on no one. It is even richer that Boeing, based on Chicago and with extensive manufacturing facilities in Washington state, contracts to make a somewhat smaller cargo jet, the Boeing 747-8, for Volga-Dnepr but not for American airlines.  Two factors make this reasonable: American airlines, including cargo haulers, no longer want the 747, a four-engine jumbo jet that American carriers believe has been eclipsed by newer, more efficient models. Were it not for demand by Volga-Dnepr for new Boeing 747's, the 747 production line might be nearing its end, Bloomberg reported when writing about the latest Volga-Dnepr jet orders. The 747 is big, but the Antonov 124 aircraft is bigger and easier to load. That's why G.E. contracts with Volga-Dnepr and Antonov Airlines to send a giant Antonov-made jet to Columbus every so often to fetch its engines and send them to Boeing -- rather than using a domestic freight airline that uses Boeing-made jets. The market for an extraordinarily big aircraft certainly seems to exist; federal government records show requests are made within the United States every month, and sometimes more often, to hire the Russian company and one of its planes. But demand may not be strong enough to actually build and base one here. Frank Avent, a South Carolinian who runs Airline Information Research, tracking airline industry documents, said domestic carriers have asked Boeing to build a bigger plane, but Boeing balks, and Boeing is "the only game in town for that." "They don't think there's demand," Avent said. Boeing has declined to comment. The U.S. government says this is fine: Federal aviation law normally would ban foreign carriers from offering domestic-only flights. This protects the market for United States airlines. But Volga-Dnepr and Antonov Airlines can apply to the U.S. Department of Transportation for permission on a flight-by-flight basis if they can show they are needed to handle an emergency. The emergencies never seem to stop. How do they define an emergency? They say that a cargo load is ready to go from Point A to Point B in the United States, that over-land delivery is not feasible, and delays are causing a problem. The application must say that no domestic airline is available or can take a load so big. And the foreign carriers must notify domestic cargo carriers so they have a chance to object. American freight airlines object sometimes, said Brooks, of the National Air Carriers Association. "These things are looked at hard by the American carriers, trying to preserve what business they have," he said. Yet U.S. Department of Transportation records show objections are the exception. In fact, the Russian or Ukraine air carrier will file an emergency application one day and routinely get permission the next, for a flight to follow almost immediately. A U.S.-based attorney for one of the overseas cargo carriers disputed that this is a phony emergency. He would not speak for attribution but said that factory production lines rely on just-in-time delivery. The alternatives to requesting an immediate emergency flight -- either scheduling a giant cargo jet without knowing exactly what day it will be needed and then keeping it idle, or else delaying delivery -- would be untenable in billion-dollar industries. The companies make frequent flights -- including for the U.S. space program: Federal regulatory filings show how frequently the giant jets carry American goods from one U.S. city to another. The recent docket for Volga-Dnepr, the Russian company: Aug. 5: Delivery of G.E. jet engines from Columbus to Everett, Washington, for the manufacture of Boeing aircraft. July 27: Delivery of a Boeing 767 wing box and spare parts from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Everett, Washington, for Boeing. May 17: Delivery of five G.E. engines from Columbus to Seattle for Boeing. May 12: Delivery of two G.E. engines from Columbus to Seattle. April 1: Delivery of five Boeing B787 thrust reversers from Yuma, Arizona, to Charleston, South Carolina. Last December, Volga-Dnepr delivered an Atlas V rocket booster from Huntsville, Alabama, to the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on behalf of the United Launch Alliance. The month before, the cargo was an Atlas V booster tank, carried by the Russians from Huntsville, Alabama, to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The launch alliance puts U.S. government satellites, including those for military and intelligence reconnaissance, into space and helps support the International Space Station. It's a joint project of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and its reliance on the Russians to ferry its largest rocket parts within the United States is routine. Last September, the Russian air carrier picked up a combustion turbine rotor in Charlotte, North Carolina, for delivery to EcoEléctrica, a utility in Puerto Rico.  Said the emergency application to the Department of Transportation: Urgent lift was necessary "because EcoEléctrica produces 16 percent of the island's electricity and the rotor is of extraordinary importance for the operation of EcoEléctrica's power plant and thus to the economy of Puerto Rico."  In other words, Russian help was needed for the U.S. territory. The U.S. government stamped its approval almost immediately.

Photographer:AP Don Bateman’s terrain mapping device has nearly eliminated the largest cause of death in jetliner accidents. By Alan Levin | August 10, 2016 Giant flocks of black birds circled the wreckage of an airliner that had struck an Alaska mountain two weeks earlier, killing all 111 aboard. In a small plane overhead, a young engineer directed his pilot to follow the same path the jet had taken toward the craggy terrain. With seconds to spare, an alarm went off. Don Bateman’s plane climbed to safety, but he was frustrated. The electronic device he invented to warn pilots that they were about to hit the ground didn’t leave enough time to have prevented the large airliner from crashing. “I was disappointed,” Bateman, now 84, recalled of the day in 1971 when he flew over the remains of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, which had slammed into a fog-shrouded ridge. “We needed to do better.” That’s exactly what Bateman and his small team of engineers at what is now Honeywell International Inc. did. The device presaged today’s mobile mapping applications, dramatically reduced what had been by far the worst class of air crashes and made Honeywell billions of dollars. Don Bateman with a Honeywell plane the company used to test his safety devices at Paine Field in Everett, Wash. Photographer: Mike Kane/Bloomberg “I would give Don individual credit for having saved more lives than any other individual in the history of commercial aviation,” said Earl Weener, a member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and former chief engineer for safety at Boeing Co. Before retiring in June, Bateman and his band of colleagues dabbled in the world of Cold War espionage, hid the true cost of their endeavor from their corporate masters and endured skepticism from the very airlines whose planes were being lost. In spite of repeated changes in corporate ownership and the blunt-spoken Bateman’s occasional threats to quit, he worked on his mission to save lives with the same group for almost six decades, colleagues said. Eventually Bateman’s Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System became required in most commercial planes around the world, dramatically reducing accidents in which perfectly good aircraft with trained crews plowed into the ground or bodies of water, almost always in poor visibility. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an average of one such fatal accident per month, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. It was by far the largest cause of death in jetliner accidents. President Obama awards Bateman the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011. Photographer: Win McNamee/Getty Images Since the U.S. government began requiring an upgraded version of the device on all but the smallest aircraft starting in 2001, there hasn’t been a single such fatal crash on a U.S. commercial passenger plane equipped with it or competing devices. There have been a few overseas, often when pilots ignored or shut off the devices. President Barack Obama awarded Bateman the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011. Bateman was always fascinated with airplane crashes. As an 8-year-old school boy in 1940 in Saskatoon, Canada, he and a friend sneaked out of class after two military planes collided and crashed nearby. As punishment, his teacher made him write a report on what happened. “That was my introduction to aircraft accidents,” he said recently. The carnage he saw that day helped motivate him years later. After taking a job with Boeing in Seattle, he joined a small aviation firm called United Control in 1958. Airplane accidents continued to fascinate him and he began “making little books” of notes on them. One type stood out. In the arcane world of aviation terminology, these crashes were called Controlled Flight into Terrain, or CFIT. It was a vexing problem: Basic navigation should have kept pilots from crashing. But the cockpit navigation technology of that era wasn’t intuitive and it was too easy to get disoriented, especially at night or in bad weather. “In my mind it became a big issue, even though there wasn’t much being done about it,” Bateman recalled. In the 1960s, Bateman worked with Scandinavian Airlines System, now SAS AB, which had suffered a CFIT crash in Turkey in 1960, to invent a mechanism to warn pilots when they flew too low. It involved a new instrument on planes that used radio waves to determine a plane’s distance from the ground. It helped stem the accident rate and, after a series of crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required it starting in 1974. But it was prone to false alarms and had a glaring weakness: It couldn’t look forward, so was of little use if a plane was flying toward steeply increasing ground, such as a mountain. For years, Bateman tinkered with the device to improve it. He also consulted with NTSB investigators, poring over accident reports. “He would come to me and say what do we know about this accident?” said Jim Ritter, director of the NTSB’s Office of Research and Engineering, who was a technician at the time. “The whole time, the gears were spinning and he was trying to make things safer.” Bateman had been imagining a far better solution as early as his flight over the Alaska crash site. If he could create a database of all the world’s terrain, the device would see mountain tops and cliffs from miles away. But this was before personal computers and global-positioning services. Even worse, much of the world’s topography was considered secret at the time, a vestige of the Cold War. Then in 1991, in the chaos created by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the detailed maps it had created of the world starting in the 1920s were for sale -- if you knew where to buy them. Bateman asked Frank Daly, the director of engineering at the Sundstrand Corp. division that had swallowed United Control, for his blessing to purchase the data from the U.S. government’s Cold War enemy. “He thought I was crazy,” Bateman said. They wound up sending one of his employees, Frank Brem, in search of maps in Russia and elsewhere. “There isn’t a terrain data store in downtown Moscow,” Daly recalled. “But he would go out and find the right people.” A bigger problem than navigating the black market was the millions of dollars it was costing for the still unproven technology. “We probably weren’t as open with senior management about that process,” Daly said. He sometimes hid costs in other accounts. A demonstration of a prototype infrared technology from Honeywell at Morristown Airport in New Jersey in 2010. Photographer: Emile Wamsteker/Bloomberg By the early 1990s, Bateman had developed working prototypes of the new system. Now the company had to sell it. For pilots and safety officers, it was a marvel. Ed Soliday, then director of safety at United Airlines, had been prodding Bateman to improve the warning device. One day in the early 1990s, Bateman called and said he thought he had what Soliday wanted. “Once I flew the thing with Don, it was like an epiphany,” Soliday recalled. “I was sold. I thought if we could make it work, this was a huge breakthrough.” If a plane was flying toward a mountain, a screen popped up automatically marking the high ground in yellow and red on a map. If pilots didn’t respond, it began a series of increasingly dire warnings. Once a collision became almost imminent, a mechanical voice implored, “Terrain, terrain. Pull up! Pull up!” Compared to the earlier system, it was almost fool proof. There are 45,000 units on aircraft today, worth more than $4 billion at list prices But many of the more cost-conscious corporate chieftains at airlines weren’t convinced, according to Bateman and Daly. A meeting at American Airlines was particularly grim. Daly was on the sales call at the airline’s headquarters with his then chief executive officer. Their host, a senior executive at the airline, was hostile. “He was almost apoplectic and said, ‘We don’t want another box. We don’t want to have to replace the existing system,’ ” Daly said. “Here I am justifying spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and my boss has just been soundly beaten on the shoulders by the customer.” Soliday had more success at United. The airline agreed to help Bateman’s team test it so it could be certified by the FAA, he said. Most other carriers balked. It took another high-profile fatal crash to change their minds. What the Pilot Sees The current version of Bateman’s device, Honeywell International Inc.’s Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, uses a color-coded map display to show pilots where dangerous high ground lurks ahead. Hazards grow in danger from yellow to red. A solid red area means a collision will occur within 30 seconds if pilots don't act. The device also has warning horns and can instruct pilots to “pull up!” in an emergency. As American Flight 965 neared Cali, Colombia, from Miami on the evening of Dec. 20, 1995, a pilot accidentally entered the wrong data into the plane’s flight computers. The crew didn’t notice as it began a slow left turn toward mountains lying invisible in the darkness. The Boeing 757 was equipped with the earlier version of Bateman’s warning device and its mechanical voice began warning of “terrain.” But 13 seconds later, after the pilots added full throttle to climb as steeply as possible, it rammed into a ridge. All but four of the 163 people aboard died. Within days the airline wanted the new device, which would have issued an alert far earlier and likely prevented the crash, Bateman and Daly said. First American and then United agreed to voluntarily install them. Other carriers followed. The FAA began requiring them in 2001. In the end, the products spawned by Bateman’s device were a financial boon to Honeywell. There are 45,000 units on aircraft today, worth more than $4 billion at list prices, according to the company. Both Bateman and Daly wonder whether the decades-long effort to develop and improve the warning system would be possible in today’s risk-averse corporate world. “Today new projects need to be blessed by many people,” Daly said. “You need to have hard evidence. They just would not speculatively fund something like this, especially when we were being resisted by the aircraft manufacturers, the airlines. “But Don’s faith, the genius of his team and a little support from the company -- and it happened.” Editors: Jon Morgan, Elizabeth Wasserman

Aug 10th 2016, 2:28 PM 40,293 Views 36 Comments Share1489 Tweet Email5 David (right) with the Boeing 767 Image: Quirky Nights Glamping Village DAVID MCGOWAN MADE headlines in May when he and a team of people transported a Boeing 767 plane from Shannon Airport to his glamping site in Co Sligo. The undertaker now has his sights set on a train … and a helicopter. Speaking to the Anton Savage Show on Today FM, McGowan said 40,000 people have visited the glamping site in Enniscrone since the plane landed. “Enniscrone is booming and that’s what we set out to do,” McGowan said. He said nine couples have asked if they can get married on the plane, and a band has asked to record a video on it. “We won’t refuse any business. Don’t worry, we’ll cater for them.” McGowan is now finalising the logistics of bringing a train from London, which he bought for €25,000, to the site. The logistics to move this will be nearly as big as the plane. I rang Irish Ferries yesterday morning and do you know what he said to me? ‘I’ve been waiting for your call. Are you the plane man? We’ve been following you for the last six months.’ “We’ll have to bring her by water I suppose. We’ll have to bring her into Dublin. She’s 63 foot long. The carriages, they’re 40 tonnes. The engine one I thought was 40 tonnes but it’s 50 tonnes, we weighed her.” McGowan is hoping to put tracks on a low loader to transport the train via the Port Tunnel. If this doesn’t work out, McGowan said: “Oh she’d have to come over O’Connell Bridge, she’d be some sight coming over there. But if we have to do it we’ll do it.” Posted by on Wednesday, 23 November 2016 Continuing with the transport theme on the site, McGowan also hopes to include a helicopter. I’m after finding a helicopter … Do you know where I found it? Above in a hay shed in Mullingar. And she’s 40 foot long, right … I’ll get a double bed into it no problem. “And wait ’til you hear the best one – she was en route to a museum. She was leaving this country ‘til I got wind of it.” McGowan said he has convinced the owner to sell the helicopter, which was once part of the Royal Air Force, to him.

The habitats are all orbital, space or deep space based, and are not meant to be used on a surface of a planet or a moon. Nasa is investing $65 million initially (Approximately Rs 433 Crore), with more investment planned further down the line. The companies that Nasa has partnered with are expected to bear 30 per cent of the cost. The companies are Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas, Boeing from Pasadena in Texas, Lockheed Martin of Denver, Orbital ATK of Dulles in Virginia, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems of Louisville in Colorado and NanoRacks of Webster in Texas. Bigelow Aerospace: Bigelow Aerospace will develop the Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE). The Xbase is an expandable habitat that is meant to be attached as a visiting module to existing space stations. The module will use technologies and techniques learnt after the recent successful deployment of the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM)  at the ISS. the modules can potentially be used for stations in low earth orbit as well as deep space. The Xbase is being tested for commercial uses in the low earth orbit usage scenario. Multiple capsules of these kind can be strung together. The Xbase habitat is 330 cubic meters. The Xbase will be based on Bigelow’s B330 module, which is being developed for research purposes, space manufacturing projects, missions to Mars or the Moon, and even Space Hotels.

The capsule will be used to assess how humans can live and work in space for extended periods of time. The full scale prototype will be used to test interface standards, system functionality and critical technologies. The habitats are low cost, and very simple. They can be modified for deep space use in long term missions. The full sized module will act as a high fidelity test bed for routine functions of both crew and technologies. Boeing will be leveraging its experience in designing, building and maintaining the International Space Station for fifteen years for developing this modular habitat.

The Orion spacecraft is meant for resupplying the International Space Station, and ferrying crew to and from it. The Orion spacecraft is also designed for longer duration missions, including any potential Mars missions. The supply module from Lockheed Martin can be used for ferrying crew and equipment to any potential deep space habitats. The main component within the multi-purpose logistics module is the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). The logistics module is also expected to provide communication support to the Orion spacecraft, as well as deep space habitats. Concept of Lockheed Martin’s NextSTEP-2 habitat with Orion. Credit: Lockheed Martin Orbital ATK: Orbital ATK makes the cargo supply ships for the International Space Station in the form of the Cygnus Spacecraft. The Cygnus Spacecraft will be the basis of the new prototype that Orbital ATK will develop, to be used in tandem with the Orion Spacecraft and other deep space modules. The interfaces between these modules will be tested. The cargo supply spacecraft derived design will be modified and tested for deep space exploration. It will also be modified to accommodate human spacefarers. The prototype will be used to come up with a road map that will lead to a long term mission to Mars. Concept of Orbital ATK’s cislunar Habitat based on Cygnus Credit: Orbital ATK Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems: Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems is also a cargo resupplier to the International Space Station. Both pressurised and unpressurised cargo is ferried in modules on board the Dream Chaser spaceplane. This is basically an unmanned reusable space vehicle. The habitat is based on the cargo module used for the ISS resupply. This habitat is being fine tuned to work with inflatable habitats simlar to the one being prototyped by Bigelow Aerospace, as well as the ECLSS module from Lockheed Martin. One of the objectives of the prototype is to make sure all the critical sub systems work seamlessly when assembled together. This habitat has a modular design. The key technology being tested is building a long term space habitat over three or four consecutive launches. Sierra Nevada Corporation’s habitat module concept based on its cargo module. Credit: Sierra Nevada Corporation NanoRacks: This habitat is being developed by NanoRacks with a partnership with two other companies, Space Systems Loral and United Launch Alliance. The efforts are combined under the name “Ixion.” This is a cutting edge attempt at some outer space jugaad. The attempt is a feasibility study, to check how to re-purpose the propellant tanks of existing launch vehicles, into a habitat that can be occupied by humans. The propellant segment is called an upper stage in launch vehicles, and this is usually discarded after the propellant is used up to launch the vehicle. This is a cost saving measure, if it works, and can be used with many rocket systems. Concept of re-purposing the propellant segment into a habitat.

The idea is to explore outward from the low earth orbit of the International Space Station, to the region covered by the orbit of the moon around the earth. This region is called cislunar space. All the habitats that Nasa is developing is designed for cislunar space as well as any eventual explorations towards Mars.

An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fueling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls at the end of the flight. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 square kilometer (46,000 square mile) area being searched, some experts have suggested. But extensive testing by aircraft manufacturer Boeing and new Australian defense department data analysis both suggest that — regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots — the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops — dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said, according to the report. The sharp dive was confirmed by a new data analysis by Australia's defence department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 “was likely to have crashed in the 120,000 square kilometer (46,000 square mile) area now being searched,” the paper said. The area was defined under the ATSB's “most likely” scenario that no-one was at the controls and the plane ran out of fuel. “The Australians leading the search do not doubt that the pilot may well have been responsible for the jet's disappearance but they say critics of the search strategy are wrong to assume that means they are looking in the wrong place,” the report added. Malaysian officials said last week that one of the pilots used a home-made flight simulator to plot a very similar course to MH370's presumed final route, but warned this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

As intern Edwin Mercado-Colon sat at a computer typing commands, the drone began to move around the room and an unmanned vehicle automatically followed.  But Mercado-Colon wasn’t using a controller to direct the drone. Instead, he picked a destination for the drone without telling it how to get there. “He’s picking a spot in the lab to fly to,” said Mike Abraham, manager of Boeing’s Collaborative Autonomous Systems Laboratory. “That command goes to the vehicle. The vehicle knows where it is because of the motion capture system. It’s determining how to get to the next point, on its own.” Developing unmanned vehicles that can work together on their own represents the latest in drone technology, a global industry that analysts predict could be worth $127 billion by 2020. Listen Listening... / 3:43 St. Louis Public Radio's Eli Chen explains Boeing's role in the developing drones that can communicate with each other. Boeing is among the leaders in such research, testing collaborative drones in its new laboratory, an 81,000-square-foot warehouse where the company tests the ability of drones developed by universities and businesses. In the near future, drones could handle such complicated tasks as surveying natural disasters or conducting search and rescue missions. Although unmanned vehicles already can help people perform such jobs, military and business leaders hope drones will one day communicate with other machines to accomplish such missions more effectively. At Boeing’s new facility, researchers are testing systems that could help make that possible. The new laboratory looks like a film set, with a system of motion-capturing cameras that lets a drone know its exact position in the room. “It’s the same technology they use in the movie industry,” Abraham said. Engineers at the laboratory recently conducted an experiment where an unmanned air vehicle and an unmanned ground vehicle had to communicate together to resolve a disaster. In the simulation, the machines had to work together to shut off a makeshift gas valve. The air vehicle scanned the area for a usable path to reach the valve and sent directions to the ground vehicle. “In collaborating with the air vehicle and the ground vehicle, you kept people safe by not having people in that dangerous situation,” Abraham said. “Between the two vehicles, you are more able to accomplish the task.” Research has shown that using multiple drones is more effective and efficient than using one. For example, a 2014 study conducted by the RAND Corporation found that, in a “hunter-killer mission,” a remotely piloted unmanned aircraft could track a target well. A group of drones performed better than one drone, even though the sole vehicle had more sophisticated features. “For the main part of the mission, the difficulty was in locating the target,” said Lance Menthe, the study’s lead author. “In that case, having multiple points of view was as good as having one large eye.” The Air Force commissioned that study to learn how to make drones more cost-effective and more advanced than the ones used so far in Iraq and Afghanistan. If teams of drones could be programmed to carry out missions on their own, the armed services would need fewer people to monitor them. “For some of our military customers, we want them to get more and more automated where vehicles are pretty much reacting by themselves and then informing everyone else what they’re doing,” Abraham said. Additionally, autonomy can improve safety, particularly so that one vehicle does not accidentally collide into another. “You don’t want to wait for a human operator to say, ‘yes, avoid that other aircraft,’” Abraham said. However, challenges remain in developing such technology. Maintaining communication between a group of drones, for instance, isn’t easy, Menthe said. Any number of things can cause lapses in communication between two devices, similar to how cell phones often drop calls. Also, placing trust in a team of drones that can operate on their own presents an ethical dilemma that’s worthy of science fiction literature. “Generally speaking, we don’t like them to be able to shoot on their own,” Menthe said, thinking of the artificial intelligence in the “Terminator” movies. “I mean, nobody wants to create Skynet.” For Menthe, what’s more important than making sure two drones can talk to each other is ensuring that human handlers maintain control over the technology. The algorithms being tested at Boeing’s new laboratory are critical in developing faith that the machines will perform as intended. “[Getting] the technologies to talk back and forth between the aircraft is only half the puzzle,” Menthe said. “The other half is making sure that you’ve got the people who are piloting or working with the data able to give the right commands. It’s a human-computer team.” Tags:  Unmanned Drones Boeing Robotics Top Stories Audio Features TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread.

KARIM SAHIB / AFP/Getty Images Share Adjust Comment Print Boeing will open a data analytics lab in Vancouver this fall, adding 50 new high-income jobs to the Lower Mainland. The announcement was made Thursday by B.C. technology minister Amrik Virk at the Aerospace, Defence and Security Expo in Abbotsford. “These are not entry-level jobs,” Virk said. “These are very experienced, highly educated, graduate-level jobs that are high-paying that add to the supply chain… and they will be based right here in British Columbia. We have an opportunity with our 50 doing very, very high level work and analysis that will have impact around the world.” Boeing owns Richmond-based AeroInfo, which also specializes in flight data analysis. The entire operation — both the Richmond facility and the Vancouver lab — will be rebranded as Boeing Vancouver. Boeing officials said they chose Vancouver due to the availability of highly-trained workers, stemming from a close relationship between the aerospace sector and academia, including a partnership with UBC. “The expansion represents a natural extension of Boeing Vancouver’s analytics, software development and professional consulting work,” Boeing Vancouver president Bob Cantwell said in a statement, adding that AeroInfo is one of the largest analytics groups within Boeing and is well suited to house the new lab. The analysis at the new lab, officials say, involves tracking the performance of aircraft components over time. It allows Boeing to assess with a high degree of accuracy which parts may need to be repaired or replaced at what time, which in turn allows Boeing to suggest flight routes to plane owners and operators to ensure planes don’t have to travel out of their way to get the replacement parts from a certain Boeing location when they need them. “They are going to work on a number of the aviation industry’s largest challenges,” Virk said. “One aircraft, I’m told, has 5,000 to 10,000 sensors in it. The data analytics team will track when you need a replacement, how do you make a better flight plan and route your aircraft better to reduce costs.” The expo, which coincides with the high-profile Abbotsford International Airshow this weekend, features hundreds of companies and government agencies. The exhibition is the biggest in B.C. and one of the biggest of its kind in the country. Organizers say the show’s goal is to showcase B.C.’s aerospace sector — as well as companies throughout Western Canada — to regional and global players that may be interested in partnering up. Officials also say the expo will play a key role in introducing companies outside of Canada to the western Canadian security sector. Statistics from the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada show that 8,300 people in B.C. work in the sector and it generates $2.4 billion in revenue every year. This year’s theme, “growth and innovation in the Asia Pacific,” shows a logical shift of attention toward rapidly growing markets such as India, where recent whole-scale economic reform under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is driving demand from communications technology to transportation infrastructure. Defence and aerospace are also included in New Delhi’s plans. A report last week — compiled partly by management consultancy Roland Berger — showed India’s aerospace and defence electronics sector is expected to balloon to $72 billion US ($93.4 billion) within the next 12 years. The sector is currently valued at $1.7 billion US ($2.2 billion). Major global companies taking notice include U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin, which has offered to build its latest rendition of the F-16 fighter jet in India. Rahul Gangal, partner at Roland Berger, spoke to the expo’s attendees and reiterated the attractiveness of the Indian market, but cautioned that foreign companies face major challenges such as local partners expecting higher profit margins than global industry norms, as well as constantly changing regulations and frequent delays in carrying out plans. “Something that Canada needs to think about, looking at the case with other countries, is government-to-government sale,” Gangal said, noting Boeing’s success in India is achieved largely through a strong relationship with the Indian air force. “Those tend to be the fastest going through. In order for Canada to be successful, you will need to find someone with a strong relationship to link you to that market.” chchiang@postmedia.com Full steam ahead for B.C.'s buoyant boating industry No more salmon sports fishing on the lower Fraser River, DFO...

Glass that switches from transparent to opaque may soon replace the need for blinds The new glass switches from transparent to opaque Similar technologies exist, but these drain power while they are on The new glass requires no power to maintain its state, apart from a little electricity to switch from one state to another  By Colin Fernandez for the Daily Mail Published: 11:11 EST, 11 August 2016 | Updated: 11:28 EST, 11 August 2016 e-mail 114 shares 54 View comments Curtains have been used for hundreds of years – but new technology means their reign could be drawing to a close. And Venetian blinds too may lose their pulling power. Researchers have come up with a way of making glass windows switch from being transparent to opaque. Scroll down for video  Once the glass is switched from clear to dark, or vice versa, the new system requires little to no power to maintain its new state; unlike other materials, it only needs electricity when it’s time to switch back again THE NEW GLASS  The windows work by sandwiching a sheet of electrochromic material – so called because electricity makes it change colour - between two glass panes. The researchers say that the new material is an improvement on existing ‘self- shading’ windows. The new glass requires no power to maintain it’s state, apart from a little electricity to switch from one state to another.  While similar technologies have been developed before – the windows of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner use them – these drain electric power while they were on. The new glass requires no power to maintain its state, apart from a little electricity to switch from one state to another. MIT professor of chemistry Mircea Dinca and doctoral student Khalid Al-Khabbi outlined their discovery in the journal Chem. The windows work by sandwiching a sheet of electrochromic material – so called because electricity makes it change colour - between two glass panes. The researchers say that the new material is an improvement on existing ‘self- shading’ windows. He said that in the case of the Boeing 787 windows, which can be darkened by turning on the voltage, but Professor Dinca said, ‘when you flip the switch, it actually takes a few minutes for the window to turn dark. Obviously, you want that to be faster.’ The slowness is because the old style changing glass relies on charged particles called ions flowing through the material – and this process is slower than electric current. While similar technologies have been developed before – the windows of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner use them – these drain electric power while they were on And the 787 windows can only change to a dark shade of green, rather than going opaque. To make their breakthrough, Professor Dinca and his students achieved the long-sought goal of producing a coating that can go all the way from perfectly clear to nearly black by blending two complementary colors, green and red). The new material is made by combining two chemical compounds, an organic material and a metal salt. Once mixed, these self-assemble into a thin film of the switchable material. Professor Dinca said: ‘It's this combination of these two, of a relatively fast switching time and a nearly black color, that has really got people excited.’ Curtains have been used for hundreds of years – but new technology means their reign could be drawing to a close As well as cutting down on glare, the windows could also help their users save money – by cutting down on air conditioning costs in hot countries. He said users ‘could flip a switch when the sun shines through the window, and turn it dark,’ or even automatically make that whole side of the building go dark all at once, he says. The properties of the material – technically known as a metal-organic framework - have now been demonstrated in a laboratory setting, the team's next step is to make a small-scale device for further testing: a 1-inch-square sample, to demonstrate the principle in action for potential investors in the technology, and to help determine what the manufacturing costs for such windows would be. Further testing is also needed, Professor Dinca says, to demonstrate what they have determined from preliminary testing: that once the switch is flipped and the material changes colour, it requires no further power to maintain its new state. No extra power is needed until the switch is flipped to turn the material back to its former state, whether clear or opaque.  THE 'UNBREAKABLE' GLASS  Corning has revealed its newest version of Gorilla Glass, and it can withstand drops from more than half a meter higher than the previous model. According to the firm, the glass can survive a fall from 1.6 metres high onto a rough surface – about equal to the height you reach while taking a selfie. Lab tests have shown that the glass survives up to 80 percent of face-down drops from 1.6 metres high.   Read more: www.cell.com/che...

Daryl Taylor, Vice President & General Manager, Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility, speaks during a delivery ceremony for the 1st U.S.-produced aircraft for American Airlines at the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility Delivery Center in Mobile, Ala., on Tuesday May 17, 2016. (Sharon Steinmann/ssteinmann@al.com) ((Sharon Steinmann/ssteinmann@al.com)) By  Christopher Harress | charress@al.com AL.com Email the author Follow on Twitter on August 11, 2016 at 7:00 AM, updated August 11, 2016 at 7:20 PM Print Email Law enforcement officials from the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office have opened an investigation into Airbus' sales practices for deals made in Asia and the Middle East, which could have serious long-term effects on the company's global operation and eventually hurt the long-term viability of its assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama.   While the company is unlikely to experience any serious short-term effects to its business, which includes an impressive order book containing thousands of deals, the SFO's investigation will take years and likely delve deeply into how Airbus conducts some of its biggest sales. More importantly, however, it could damage the French-based company's international reputation and give an edge to its biggest rival Boeing. "The news came as a shock, since the issue had been downplayed," Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christophe Menard said in a note to investors Monday. "It could turn out to be more serious than envisaged." The investigation was formally opened by the U.K.'s SFO in July after Airbus officials self-reported instances of unusual business practices, specifically the use of third-party agents in getting multi billion aircraft deals done. Ordinarily, the U.K. Export Finance Agency is charged with assisting in completing sales and organizing credit guarantees for overseas deals, such as those made at the Farnborough airshow, one of the year's big aviation events where aircraft manufacturers sign multi billion dollar contracts. The guarantees are essentially a backstop for the selling company against the buyer experiencing financial issues, but Airbus severed ties with U.K. Export Finance in April after first raising the issue of its sales practices. The investigation centers on Airbus' conduct in emerging markets where it hopes to gain greater influence and beat rival Boeing. However, gaining a foothold in the Middle East, Asia and other growing regions comes with risk. Because it can take years to establish a business relationship with some of the governments in those regions, which often own a stake in the national airlines and dictate purchases, some companies find it easier to rely on local, established agents that already have connections with government officials. While it's not technically illegal to use a middleman in such sales, it adds another layer to the process and complicates oversight in Western countries, where many of the deals are initially made. It's believed that Airbus admitted to using the agents in an effort to avoid criminal implications. In the event of being found criminally liable, Airbus will likely attempt to obtain what's known as a deferred prosecution agreement in exchange for paying a fine, future compliance and help in bringing charges against other individuals or companies involved in the case. Banks in the U.S. often make use of such agreements, but it's less common in the U.K. Airbus said in a statement Sunday that it was fully cooperating with the SFO. "Airbus Group has been informed by the SFO that it has opened a criminal investigation into allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption in the civil aviation business of Airbus Group relating to irregularities concerning third party consultants," the company stated. "Airbus Group continues to cooperate with the SFO." While it's not yet clear if the investigation will damage global Airbus sales, Richard Aboulafia, Vice-President of analysis at Teal Group, a Virginia-based aerospace and defense think tank, told AL.com in a phone interview that he doesn't believe it will. "It sounds like it (Airbus) is fully cooperating and it doesn't sound like it's a terribly adversarial ordeal," said Aboulafia, who pointed out that previous SFO investigations usually end in a fine. However, SFO investigations are not quick and often drag a company's dirty-laundry into the public domain, as is being demonstrated by the near-four year look at Rolls Royce's use of third-party agents in China and Indonesia. The investigation also adds to Airbus' ongoing business troubles, including production problems with the wide-body A350 commercial jet, slow sales of the A380 super-jumbo, delays on its A400M military transport, and the grounding of the Super Puma helicopter after a fatal accident in April.  About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

Thanks to This Man, Airplanes Don’t Crash Into Mountains Anymore Bloomberg 8/11/2016 The wreckage of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, a Boeing 727, smolders as recovery workers search for the bodies of 111 victims on Sept. 7, 1971, in Juneau, Alaska. Giant flocks of black birds circled the wreckage of an airliner that had struck an Alaska mountain two weeks earlier, killing all 111 aboard. In a small plane overhead, a young engineer directed his pilot to follow the same path the jet had taken toward the craggy terrain. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 149.62 +0.10 +0.07% Honeywell International Inc HON ▲ 113.69 +1.17 +1.04% SAS AB SASDY ▼ 3.42 -0.21 -5.90% United Continental Holdings Inc UAL ▲ 69.76 +0.26 +0.37% With seconds to spare, an alarm went off. Don Bateman’s plane climbed to safety, but he was frustrated. The electronic device he invented to warn pilots that they were about to hit the ground didn’t leave enough time to have prevented the large airliner from crashing. “I was disappointed,” Bateman, now 84, recalled of the day in 1971 when he flew over the remains of Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, which had slammed into a fog-shrouded ridge. “We needed to do better.” That’s exactly what Bateman and his small team of engineers at what is now Honeywell International Inc. did. The device presaged today’s mobile mapping applications, dramatically reduced what had been by far the worst class of air crashes and made Honeywell billions of dollars. < PREVIOUS SLIDESLIDE 1 of 4NEXT SLIDE > Don Bateman with a Honeywell plane the company used to test his safety devices at Paine Field in Everett, Wash. © Mike Kane/Bloomberg “I would give Don individual credit for having saved more lives than any other individual in the history of commercial aviation,” said Earl Weener, a member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and former chief engineer for safety at Boeing Co. Before retiring in June, Bateman and his band of colleagues dabbled in the world of Cold War espionage, hid the true cost of their endeavor from their corporate masters and endured skepticism from the very airlines whose planes were being lost. In spite of repeated changes in corporate ownership and the blunt-spoken Bateman’s occasional threats to quit, he worked on his mission to save lives with the same group for almost six decades, colleagues said. Eventually Bateman’s Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System became required in most commercial planes around the world, dramatically reducing accidents in which perfectly good aircraft with trained crews plowed into the ground or bodies of water, almost always in poor visibility. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was an average of one such fatal accident per month, according to the AviationSafetyNetwork website. It was by far the largest cause of death in jetliner accidents.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Since the U.S. government began requiring an upgraded version of the device on all but the smallest aircraft starting in 2001, there hasn’t been a single such fatal crash on a U.S. commercial passenger plane equipped with it or competing devices. There have been a few overseas, often when pilots ignored or shut off the devices. President Barack Obama awarded Bateman the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011. Bateman was always fascinated with airplane crashes. As an 8-year-old school boy in 1940 in Saskatoon, Canada, he and a friend sneaked out of class after two military planes collided and crashed nearby. As punishment, his teacher made him write a report on what happened. “That was my introduction to aircraft accidents,” he said recently. The carnage he saw that day helped motivate him years later. After taking a job with Boeing in Seattle, he joined a small aviation firm called United Control in 1958. Airplane accidents continued to fascinate him and he began “making little books” of notes on them. One type stood out. In the arcane world of aviation terminology, these crashes were called Controlled Flight into Terrain, or CFIT. It was a vexing problem: Basic navigation should have kept pilots from crashing. But the cockpit navigation technology of that era wasn’t intuitive and it was too easy to get disoriented, especially at night or in bad weather. “In my mind it became a big issue, even though there wasn’t much being done about it,” Bateman recalled. In the 1960s, Bateman worked with Scandinavian Airlines System, now SAS AB, which had suffered a CFIT crash in Turkey in 1960, to invent a mechanism to warn pilots when they flew too low. It involved a new instrument on planes that used radio waves to determine a plane’s distance from the ground. It helped stem the accident rate and, after a series of crashes, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration required it starting in 1974. But it was prone to false alarms and had a glaring weakness: It couldn’t look forward, so was of little use if a plane was flying toward steeply increasing ground, such as a mountain. For years, Bateman tinkered with the device to improve it. He also consulted with NTSB investigators, poring over accident reports. “He would come to me and say what do we know about this accident?” said Jim Ritter, director of the NTSB’s Office of Research and Engineering, who was a technician at the time. “The whole time, the gears were spinning and he was trying to make things safer.” Bateman had been imagining a far better solution as early as his flight over the Alaska crash site. If he could create a database of all the world’s terrain, the device would see mountain tops and cliffs from miles away. But this was before personal computers and global-positioning services. Even worse, much of the world’s topography was considered secret at the time, a vestige of the Cold War. Then in 1991, in the chaos created by the breakup of the Soviet Union, the detailed maps it had created of the world starting in the 1920s were for sale -- if you knew where to buy them. Bateman asked Frank Daly, the director of engineering at the Sundstrand Corp. division that had swallowed United Control, for his blessing to purchase the data from the U.S. government’s Cold War enemy. “He thought I was crazy,” Bateman said. They wound up sending one of his employees, Frank Brem, in search of maps in Russia and elsewhere. “There isn’t a terrain data store in downtown Moscow,” Daly recalled. “But he would go out and find the right people.” A bigger problem than navigating the black market was the millions of dollars it was costing for the still unproven technology. “We probably weren’t as open with senior management about that process,” Daly said. He sometimes hid costs in other accounts. By the early 1990s, Bateman had developed working prototypes of the new system. Now the company had to sell it. For pilots and safety officers, it was a marvel. Ed Soliday, then director of safety at United Airlines, had been prodding Bateman to improve the warning device. One day in the early 1990s, Bateman called and said he thought he had what Soliday wanted. “Once I flew the thing with Don, it was like an epiphany,” Soliday recalled. “I was sold. I thought if we could make it work, this was a huge breakthrough.” If a plane was flying toward a mountain, a screen popped up automatically marking the high ground in yellow and red on a map. If pilots didn’t respond, it began a series of increasingly dire warnings. Once a collision became almost imminent, a mechanical voice implored, “Terrain, terrain. Pull up! Pull up!” Compared to the earlier system, it was almost fool proof. But many of the more cost-conscious corporate chieftains at airlines weren’t convinced, according to Bateman and Daly. A meeting at American Airlines was particularly grim. Daly was on the sales call at the airline’s headquarters with his then chief executive officer. Their host, a senior executive at the airline, was hostile. “He was almost apoplectic and said, ‘We don’t want another box. We don’t want to have to replace the existing system,’ ” Daly said. “Here I am justifying spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and my boss has just been soundly beaten on the shoulders by the customer.” Soliday had more success at United. The airline agreed to help Bateman’s team test it so it could be certified by the FAA, he said. Most other carriers balked. It took another high-profile fatal crash to change their minds. As American Flight 965 neared Cali, Colombia, from Miami on the evening of Dec. 20, 1995, a pilot accidentally entered the wrong data into the plane’s flight computers. The crew didn’t notice as it began a slow left turn toward mountains lying invisible in the darkness. The Boeing 757 was equipped with the earlier version of Bateman’s warning device and its mechanical voice began warning of “terrain.” But 13 seconds later, after the pilots added full throttle to climb as steeply as possible, it rammed into a ridge. All but four of the 163 people aboard died. Within days the airline wanted the new device, which would have issued an alert far earlier and likely prevented the crash, Bateman and Daly said. First American and then United agreed to voluntarily install them. Other carriers followed. The FAA began requiring them in 2001. In the end, the products spawned by Bateman’s device were a financial boon to Honeywell. There are 45,000 units on aircraft today, worth more than $4 billion at list prices, according to the company. Both Bateman and Daly wonder whether the decades-long effort to develop and improve the warning system would be possible in today’s risk-averse corporate world. “Today new projects need to be blessed by many people,” Daly said. “You need to have hard evidence. They just would not speculatively fund something like this, especially when we were being resisted by the aircraft manufacturers, the airlines. “But Don’s faith, the genius of his team and a little support from the company -- and it happened.” Go to MSN Home More in Money 7 successful icons who had a brush with bankruptcy InvestorPlace 20 best money tips of all time from Tony Robbins GOBankingRates 7 CEOs heading to the chopping block InvestorPlace The most dangerous states in America 24/7 Wall St. 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money Up Next What the richest 1 percent earns in every state Money Talks News AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

(NASA/Handout via Reuters) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Space Business August 11, 2016 By 2030, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) wants to send humans to Mars. In order to make the Journey to Mars, which began at the start of this decade, a reality, the space agency will have to figure out how to establish habitation systems that could provide a safe place for its astronauts on the red planet. NASA has selected six private U.S. companies to develop concepts and prototypes of deep space habitats on Earth, with the idea that they’ll eventually be used on our solar system neighbor. The companies will have 24 months to assist with “the commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions,” NASA announced on Aug. 9. The six companies are: Bigelow Aerospace Boeing Lockheed Martin Orbital ATK Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems NanoRacks “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems, according to the release. “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” This is part two of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program. In 2015, four partners—Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK—were selected to work on deep space exploration and habitats. NextSTEP-2 will hone in on “missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s,” NASA states. “These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars.” Bigelow is a pioneer of sorts when it comes to deep space habitats. Earlier this year, the Las Vegas-based company launched its latest experiment: the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), which was the first inflatable habitat NASA allowed to be attached to the International Space Station (ISS). The module was flown into space on SpaceX’s cargo capsule, attached to the ISS, and expanded and pressurized on May 28. For the next two years, it’ll remain in orbit above the earth to test how well expandable habitats hold up against conditions like solar radiation and extreme temperatures. NanoRacks’ inclusion in NASA’s current program signals an expansion of their existing relationship; the Texas-based company already has a mini-satellite launcher on the ISS. Orbital ATK will be advancing designs for Cygnus, its current commercial cargo space craft that flies to the ISS. The other three companies will be creating or refurbishing and modifying ground demonstrators or prototypes of habitats. Over the next two years, each of the six selected companies will be awarded varying amounts of funding for their diverse projects, but the combined total cost will be close to $65 million. In their press release announcingNextSTEP-2, NASA implied that, if necessary, the project would continue into 2018 and additional funding would then be pumped into it. Of course, nothing guarantees functional finished products by 2018—or ever, for that matter. But NASA has a track record of successful partnerships with private companies leading to real results, like Red Dragon, SpaceX’s spacecraft that aims carry astronauts to the ISS by 2018.

Yuma News Now NASA Selects Six Companies to Develop Prototypes, Concepts for Deep Space Habitats Details Written by Kathryn Hambleton Published: 10 August 2016 Washington, DC - NASA has selected six U.S. companies to help advance the Journey to Mars by developing ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, Appendix A, NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. The selected companies are: Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas Boeing of Pasadena, Texas Lockheed Martin of Denver Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado NanoRacks of Webster, Texas Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our Journey to Mars.  “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The contract award amounts are dependent on contract negotiations, and NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK.  This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects, such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment using SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles. In addition to U.S. industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable fully operational deep space habitation capability. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. AES is pioneering innovative approaches and public-private partnerships to rapidly develop prototype systems, advance key capabilities, and validate operational concepts for future human missions beyond Earth orbit.

Boeing has been using it since the 1990s to speed up installing the hundreds of miles of writing inside its planes. But those early systems were both clunky and expensive, and, so far, more portable augmented reality wearables like Google Glass haven't taken off. Microsoft's mixed reality HoloLens looks set to change that. Microsoft announced last week that businesses can buy HoloLens now with the Microsoft HoloLens Commercial Suite. They get the Development Edition hardware as well as enterprise features for security and device management. [ Also on CIO.com: Beginner's guide to virtual reality ] It's not too early to plan how your business could use HoloLens, suggests Laurens Frijters, CEO of Dutch consultancy Sparked, which has been working with the first HoloLens units available in Holland. "The next six months is a good time to start exploring, because in every new technology area it's the first few who are successful. Now is a good time to start your research and to look at how you can innovate in your business processes using mixed reality."

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:30 PM, August 10, 2016 Updated: 5:30 AM, August 11, 2016 NEW YORK - Boeing Co <BA.N> said on Wednesday it will not increase 787 output and could further cut 777 output unless sales of both jets improve, its clearest indication yet that its production of large jetliners may have peaked for now. "If the market's not going to demand it, we're not going to go," Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on the sidelines of an investor conference in New York by global investment bank Jefferies, confirming remarks made during the formal program. "It's not the end of the world" if Boeing keeps 787 production at 12 a month instead of lifting it to 14 as planned, Smith said during the event. "We can still be profitable in the program as I see it today at 12." Analysts said Smith's statement confirmed that Boeing will not overproduce widebody planes and, most importantly, does not foresee an accounting charge for the 787 if output stays at 12. Boeing took about $1.7 billion in after-tax charges in its latest result for the 787 and 747 programs to account for excess 787 inventory and slow 747 sales. Smith said the company would decide in the next two months whether to cut 777 output further. If it fails to sell enough 777s to bridge the gap to new 777X production, "then we will make an adjustment accordingly," he said. His comments went beyond what he and Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told analysts after the company released quarterly results last month. Muilenburg said Boeing would "keep supply and demand in balance" but did not discuss keeping 787 production at 12 a month or cutting 777 further. Low oil prices and a series of boom years have slowed orders for new widebody jetliners, raising concerns that Boeing will notch down cash and profit targets. Smith said on Wednesday that Boeing still has about two years to decide whether to raise 787 output, given lead times for components, and could still generate rising cash flow and profit if production rates "moderate" on the 787 and 777. The list price for the mid-sized 787 is $264.6 million, but airlines typically receive steep discounts. Boeing has won eight net 777 orders this year and 19 net 787 orders. It already plans to reduce 777 production by 15 percent next year as it switches to the 777X. Boeing shares rose 0.6 percent to close at $132.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.

By Gazette Staff   |   August 10, 2016 In mid-July, Gov. Mary Fallin, along with a number of state and community leaders, praised Boeing aerospace company as it cut a blue ribbon symbolizing the $80 million, 290,000-square-foot facility was open for business in southeast Oklahoma City. According to NewsOK.com, leaders praised an aerospace engineers tax credit for luring Boeing, which in return promised 800 new jobs. The company is known for designing, manufacturing and selling airplanes, rotorcrafts, rockets and satellites. Boeing moved operations from Washington to Oklahoma City; St. Louis, Missouri; Jacksonville, Florida; and Patuxent River, Maryland. A week after the OKC fanfare, Boeing handed layoff notices to OKC employees, NewsOK.com reported. The company was mum on the number of workers impacted by the potential layoffs. “Boeing is still committed to doing business in Oklahoma,” Jennifer Hogan, a Boeing spokeswoman, told NewsOK.com.

Boeing (NYSE: BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA), Sierra Nevada, Bigelow Aerospace and NanoRacks were chosen through the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 initiative, the agency said Wednesday. The six companies will perform work over a two-year period and contribute at least 30 percent of the overall program cost, NASA noted. NASA sought proposals for the second batch of NextSTEP partners in April to perform research and development work on deep space habitation systems, advanced propulsion technologies and small satellites. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion,” said Jason Crusan, NASA director of advanced exploration systems. “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth,” Crusan added. Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed and Orbital ATK compose the initial batch of the agency’s NextSTEP partners. NextSTEP-2 efforts will support commercial investment in low-Earth orbit, operational deep space habitation for missions near the moon as well as the planned expedition to Mars in the 2020s, according to NASA. The prototypes will be developed to help establish design standards, common interfaces and requirements and mitigate risks for the final flight systems. The agency also looks to collaborate with international partners to achieve deep-space habitation goals.

[Image above] Credit: NIST   NANOMATERIALS   Carbon nanotube “stitches” strengthen composites The newest Airbus and Boeing passenger jets flying today are made primarily from advanced composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic—extremely light, durable materials that reduce the overall weight of the plane by as much as 20% compared to aluminum-bodied planes. Such lightweight airframes translate directly to fuel savings, which is a major point in advanced composites’ favor.   Swapping substrates improves edges of graphene nanoribbons Miniscule ribbons of graphene are highly sought-after building blocks for semiconductor devices because of their predicted electronic properties. But making these nanostructures has remained a challenge. Now, a team of researchers from China and Japan have devised a new method to make the structures in the lab.   X-ray microscopy technique images nanoscale workings of rechargeable batteries There’s a new tool in the push to engineer rechargeable batteries that last longer and charge more quickly. An X-ray microscopy technique recently developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has given scientists the ability to image nanoscale changes inside lithium-ion battery particles as they charge and discharge.     ENERGY   Formula of cadmium-tellurium solar cells optimized Solar cells based on cadmium and tellurium could move closer to theoretical levels of efficiency because of some sleuthing by researchers at the Oak Ridge National Lab. The team used advanced microscopy techniques to discover efficiency differences of crystalline structures of various mixtures of cadmium, tellurium, and selenium. In fact, selenium is an integral part of the formulation that resulted in a world record for solar cell efficiency.   Moisture helps catalyst in fuel cells: Proton pinball on the catalyst Thanks to a reaction that resembles a sort of proton pinball game, a thin layer of moisture on the surface of a catalysts can improve the efficiency of fuel cells, devices used to transform chemical energy (a fuel like hydrogen, for example) directly into electricity without releasing greenhouse gases in emissions.   Tiny high-performance solar cells turn power generation sideways University of Wisconsin–Madison engineers have created high-performance, micro-scale solar cells that outshine comparable devices in key performance measures. The engineers created a densely packed, side-by-side array of miniature electrodes on top of transparent glass. The resulting structure separates light-harvesting and charge-conducting functions between the two components.   Next generation anode to improve lithium-ion batteries Researchers at the University of California, Riverside have created a new silicon-tin nanocomposite anode that could lead to lithium-ion batteries that can be charged and discharged more times before they reach the end of their useful lives. The longer-lasting batteries could be used in everything from handheld electronic devices to electric vehicles.   Making nail polish while powering fuel cells Hydrogen is widely regarded as a promising and clean alternative energy source. The traditional source of hydrogen (H2) for fuel cell use is water, which is split into H2 and oxygen (O2). But O2 is a low-value product. So, this week in ACS Central Science, researchers report a new approach and a new catalyst that can produce not just hydrogen but also valuable chemicals, including the most common ingredient in nail polish.   Semi-transparent solar cells with thermal mirror capability developed Using perovskites, a Korean research team at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Sungkyunkwan University developed a semi-transparent solar cell that is highly efficient and, additionally, functions very effectively as a thermal-mirror. The team has developed a top transparent electrode (TTE) that works well with perovskite solar cells.   Iowa State scientists develop quick-destructing battery to power ‘transient’ devices Iowa State University scientists have developed a self-destructing, lithium-ion battery capable of delivering 2.5 V and dissolving or dissipating in 30 minutes when dropped in water. The battery can power a desktop calculator for about 15 minutes.     OTHER RESEARCH   Olympians suit up in high-tech apparel to shave seconds When seconds count, the right clothing matters. For the Rio Olympics, Nike used 3-D printing technology to develop small silicone protrusions for redirecting air flow around the runner. Body scanners helped Adidas design suits to keep swimmers in ideal form. Swiss cycling specialist Assos turned to wind tunnels to craft custom, form-fitting suits for the U.S. cycling team.   Unlocking the secrets of creeping concrete Researchers at UCLA found that calcium-silicate-hydrates, the binding phase that holds cement paste together, tend to dissolve at high-stress regions, and re-precipitate at low-stress regions. This is in correspondence with Le Chatelier’s principle, also known as the equilibrium law. “As a result of such dissolution-precipitation behavior, a macroscopic, time-dependent ‘creep’ deformation manifests.”   Method predicts which alloys will form bulk metallic glass Bulk metallic glasses are metallic alloys whose neatly ordered atomic structure can be altered into an amorphous, non-crystalline structure. However, these alloys are complex, often containing five or six different elements, including expensive noble metals like gold or palladium—and scientists have no clue which combinations of elements will form them. Now, researchers have developed a method to predict which alloys may form a bulk metallic glass.   Novel porous materials made from flexible ‘spaghetti-like’ molecules Known for their extraordinary surface area, a sugar packet equivalent of MOF provides a city block of area to absorb gas or catalyze reactions. But scientists recently uprooted the belief that these frameworks must be made from rigid starting materials. Their new design strategy transformed flexible polymers into 3-D porous structures by incorporating the flexible polymers into the synthesis of MOFs.   Ultracompact photodetector for optical data transmission Glass-fiber cables transmit information over long distances at the speed of light. Once they have reached their destination, however, these optical signals have to be converted into electrical signals for subsequent processing in the computer. Karlsruhe Institute of Technology researchers have now developed a novel type of photodetector that needs far less space than conventional ones.   Power amplifiers for 5G made of gallium nitride Fraunhofer scientists are manufacturing transistors and microchips that are only a few square millimeters in size out of the semiconductor material gallium nitride. “Due to its special crystal structure, the same voltages can be applied at even higher frequencies, leading to a better power and efficiency performance,” says one of the researchers.   Back to Previous Page « « Previous Post     |    Next Post » » Tags: advanced composites, aerospace composites, alloy, anode, apparel, batteries, battery charge, bulk metallic glass, cadmium-tellurium solar, carbon nanotubes, catalyst, composites, concrete, concrete creep, data transmission, fuel cells, gallium-nitride, graphene, graphene nanoribbonss, high-tech apparel, li-ion, lithium-ions, materials stories, metallic glass, MOF, nail polish, nanotubes, Olympics, OMS, optical data, other materials, photodetector, porous materials, power amplifier, proton, rechargeable batteries, self-destructing battery, semiconductors, solar, solar cells, solar efficiency, solar energy, solar power, thermal mirror, TTE, X-ray microscopy Related Posts Other materials stories that may be of interest Ceramic and glass business news of the week Video: Magnetic ink prints self-healing devices that fix themselves in mere milliseconds Other materials stories that may be of interest Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

The world of luxury travel is epitomized by the image of stepping off a private jet to some high power meeting or exclusive destination. However the allure of actually owning your own private jet appears to be fading fast for many corporations and wealthy people as a range of other options hit the market. VistaJet provides private jet travel on its fleet of more than 65 Bombardier jets without committing clients to any asset purchase. The company was founded in 2004 by Swiss national Thomas Flohr. He told CNBC that revenues in his business are currently booming. "Companies are presently reluctant to put a $50 million plane on their own balance sheet. That's a pretty hard sell for any CFO walking in to boardroom at this time." Flohr set up his business in the belief that the private jet market was being underserved by a handful of U.S. firms who offer different businesses a fractional stake in a plane, which they then share. Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images A Netjets Inc. sign stands hear a new Embraer Phenom 300 jet at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. One of the better known who does this is NetJets, a subsidiary of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway. NetJets clients sign contracts that choose an appropriate plane and then pay for the hours that they need it to fly, an arrangement which the company described to CNBC as 'vastly less costly' than owning a plane. Mark Wilson, President of NetJets Europe said while global growth is flat lining, Europe is picking up. "To date 2016 has also been a strong period of growth for us and we continue to increase our market share; we have seen a 4.1 percent increase in revenue flights for the first half of the year year-on-year and a 7.5 percent increase in passengers flown during the same period," he told CNBC. Wilson said he also sees a more 'cost savvy' customer who doesn't see value in owning a jet. "NetJets manage every aspect, from ground transport to slot bookings and flight permits. "Previously corporations would have had to employ an entire flight department or management company to take care of this," he said. Victor is a private jet service based out of London. The company doesn't sell jets for full or fractual ownership but focuses solely on 'on demand' chartering of third party operators. Clive Jackson, CEO & founder of Victor agrees that European private aviation is expanding. "Private jet travel is up 2.8 percent across Western Europe with private jet charter, specifically, on the up in 18 of Europe's top 20 airports. "We have seen a significant upsurge in bookings this summer on a global scale – everywhere from Las Vegas and Miami through to Ibiza, Mallorca, Nice and Sardinia. Summer requests for Ibiza, in particular, are up 441 percent year-on-year," he told CNBC by email Tuesday. Jackson said European business no longer looks upon owning a private jet as a worthy investment, but they still see the value of using one. "[Our] users are highly entrepreneurial and competing on both a European and global business stage – looking to gain competitive advantage from recent Brexit developments by getting things done – moving - more quickly than many of their institutional competitors," he said. In terms of what is next for private aviation, Jackson sees limited scope for subscription-style charter models who demand an upfront fee for the promise of a future service. The Victor founder is betting that business will opt instead for an app based 'on demand' service as businesses veer away from commercial flying.

The Boeing 777 disappeared on March 8, 2014 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard. An extensive underwater hunt in the southern Indian Ocean has not yet found the crash site, fuelling speculation it may be outside the current search zone, particularly if someone was at the controls. A manned plane could have been glided down, allowing it to enter the water outside the 120,000 square kilometre (46,000 square mile) area being searched, some experts have suggested. But testing by Boeing and fresh Australian defence department suggest that — regardless of the possible actions of one or both of the pilots — the jet dived into the ocean at high speed, The Australian reported. Once MH370 ran out of fuel and the engines flamed, it slowed before plunging down towards the water in a series of swoops — dropping from 35,000 feet at a rate of between 12,000 feet a minute and 20,000 feet a minute, Boeing said. The sharp dive was confirmed by new data analysis by Australia’s defence department involving signals sent automatically between the plane and a satellite, the head of the agency leading the MH370 hunt said. Australian Transport and Safety Bureau chief Greg Hood said this supported the view MH370 “was likely to have crashed in the 1,20,000 square kilometre area now being searched,” the paper said. Parts of the plane have been recovered on islands across the Pacific.

Video IT Resume Makeover: How to start from scratch NASA this week picked six companies to develop prototype deep space habitats that astronauts could somewhat comfortably live in on long space journeys – particularly to Mars. According to NASA, an effective habitat contains “pressurized volume plus an integrated array of complex systems and components that include a docking capability, environmental control and life support systems, logistics management, radiation mitigation and monitoring, fire safety technologies, and crew health capabilities.”  +More on Network World: The weirdest, wackiest and coolest sci/tech stories of 2016 (so far!) “The ground prototypes will let NASA and the partners evaluate configurations of the habitat, how the various systems interact together and with other capabilities like propulsion modules and airlocks, and will provide platforms to test and ensure the standards and common interfaces being considered are well thought out,” NASA stated. NASA said the six companies would have about 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30% of the cost of the overall proposed effort, the space agency said. “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems in a statement. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” +More on Network World: The Martian author Andy Weir calls for massive new space station to prep humans for Mars trip+ The prototype habitats are part of a NASA program called Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP), which is developing all manner of deep space systems from advanced propulsion to satellites. Announced in 2014, NextSTEP programs for habitat development are already underway at a number of space industry companies such as Bigelow, Boeing and Orbital. Congress earlier this year urged the space agency to move along its ideas for how humans would live on planets or other places far from Earth. With that pressure as a backdrop NASA said it wants US companies, universities, and non-profit organizations to offer up their best ideas for space living systems would include reliable life support systems, fire safety, atmosphere revitalization and monitoring, water processing, lighting, and fire detection and radiation protection. Here are the companies an their prototypes as described by NASA: Bigelow Aerospace will develop and test a prototype of Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), a 330 cubic meter expandable habitat and test platform for deep space hardware. XBASE is based on the B-330 expandable spacecraft for the mission-specific purpose of attaching to the International Space Station as a visiting vehicle. XBASE leverages the lessons learned from the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), a 16 cubic meter expandable spacecraft, which was recently deployed on the space station.

This includes the production of a full-scale habitat that will provide design analysis and high-fidelity demonstration and test capability to simulate how humans can safely live and work in deep space for extended periods of time. This ground demonstrator will test and validate interface standards, systems features and critical exploration technologies.  Boeing Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module.

The high-fidelity environmental control and life support systems prototype will provide risk reduction and form and fit testing. The avionics prototype will prove data communication between the habitat and Orion and demonstrate crew interfaces between a deep space habitat and Orion.  Lockheed Martin Concept image of Lockheed Martin's refurbished multi-purpose logistics module prototype Credits: Lockheed Martin Orbital ATK will mature the mission architecture and design of their initial cislunar habitat concept, based on the Cygnus spacecraft that currently services the space station.

(Photo : NASA/Getty Images) NASA approves a $65 million budget to be spent on developing deep-space habitats, which are expected to be used on the mission to Mars. The budget will be spread over two years between 6 participating companies; which indicates the level of priority NASA have set onto the project as the mission to Mars would likely see transit in the coming few years, according to NASA website. NASA had already handpicked its team of companies to develop deep-space-ready habitats, which likely includes building prototypes, sharing and comparing notes and concepts between these companies. The chosen companies are all based in the U.S., which include Bigelow Aerospace, which is based in Las Vegas; Lockheed Martin, which is from Denver; Boeing, which is based in Texas; Orbital ATK of Virginia; Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems, which is based on Colorado; and NanoRacks, which is from Texas, as well. The research is part of NASA's NEXTStep project, which is an ongoing program under the agency's Advanced Exploration Systems. The aforementioned projects aim to further humankind's knowledge on space exploration, as well as funding private research to develop technologies to be used in such projects, TechCrunch reported. The recently announced project, along with its budget, is significantly larger than the previous years. The previous contracts have allotted a mere $15 million, which was divided between 10 parties, while the current NASA project have bumped its sum to $65 million, to be split 6 ways, according to NewsLedge. The selected companies bring with itself a diversity between approaching the problem facing space exploration; sustainability. The companies are quite well known by their unique approach and respective company views, which would likely raise the odds of developing an apt habitat for humans in deep space. NASA's self-imposed deadline for the Mars Mission is fast approaching, which is on 2020. On a side note, NASA have recently teamed up with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is adamant that the private company would bring humans to the Red Planet in as early as 2018.

Ogg August 11, 2016 3:10 pm EST Print Email Tweet There is some potentially big news in the defense and warfare industry, but more in process than in size. It is also important to realize that this is not yet written in stone. The U.S. State Department has now approved the potential sale of precision-guided munitions and equipment to its NATO partners. This is a pilot program where NATO could spend about $231 million, whereby NATO’s own support and procurement unit would be the actual buyer for militaries inside of NATO. If the sale is approved by Congress, NATO member countries like the Czech Republic, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain would be able to get the precision-guided munitions by sharing costs and pooling resources to actually buy and pay for the weapons. This deal is said to be in tranches and was a two-year pilot program that started in early 2015 via the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency. What makes this effort different than so many years worth of prior orders is that arms sales by U.S. companies are traditionally made with individual nations. This is effectively a procurement alliance, and it is aimed at saving money by being able to get a larger grouped order or orders. How it will work through time, and whether it ultimately cannibalizes higher margin individual nation sales, remains to be seen. One issue that could delay or block this new effort and process might be a concern about whether the technology could be transferred to outside parties or nations. Still, we shall have to wait and see whether the order is given the final approval. This order specifically names subsidiaries of Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) and Raytheon Co. (NYSE: RTN) as the beneficiaries. We have taken a look at the details compared to the larger picture for each company below. The news release’s quote from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, edited down, said: The proposed sale improves NATO members’ capability to meet current and future ground threats with precision. They will use the enhanced capacity as a deterrent to regional threats, and to increase interoperability within contingency operations. Many of the purchasing nations already have precision-guided munitions in their inventories and will have no difficulty absorbing these additional munitions. … Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to NATO. … There is no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. … This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded. NATO Support and Procurement Agency showed a list of which systems will make up this approximately $231 million order. They were as follows: 500 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Guidance Kits, KMU-556 F/B 40 JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU-557 F/B 1,500 JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU-572 F/B 1,000 MAU 210 E/B Computer Control Groups for 1,000-lb. Enhanced Paveway IIs 300 MAU 210 E/B Computer Control Groups for GBU-49s 1,025 MAU 169 L/B Computer Control Groups for GBU-12s 1,350 Joint Programmable Fuzes, FMU-152 A/B 60 Bomb Fin Assembly and Airfoil Group 650-MXU K/B for GBU-12s 1,025 Bomb Fin Assembly and Airfoil Group, MXU-650 K/B AFG for GBU-12s The order also included the following: Detector Sensing Unit (DSU)-38A/B Laser sensors; DSU-33D/B proximity sensors; Wireless Paveway Avionics Kit (WIPAK) interfaces for Enhanced Paveway II bombs; FMU-139C/B electronic bomb fuzes; repair and return services; transportation; engineering services; and other support services. Normally 24/7 Wall St. would not get too excited about a $231 million order that is being split among two multi-billion defense contractors. Still, this is the first, and it could ultimately lead to larger single orders rather than so many small orders. The impact on Boeing might be harder to evaluate as important in the big picture since so much of its revenue-generating government and agency orders are based on planes and space systems. Boeing’s market cap is $83 billion, and its 2015 revenue was $96.1 billion. At $133.34, its shares were up 0.8% late on Thursday. Boeing has a 52-week trading range of $102.10 to $150.59 and a consensus analyst price target of $149.00. Raytheon’s market cap is almost $42 billion, and its shares were up 0.8% at $141.95 late on Thursday. Its 52-week range is $96.68 to $142.15, and its consensus price target is $150.77. Raytheon’s 2015 revenue was $23.25 billion. This is one of those news announcements in which the implication of the order and the process of it could greatly outweigh what the mere $231 million size might indicate. Ultimately this could alter how hundreds of millions of dollars or even billions of dollars in orders could be handled. Stay tuned.

These lawsuits follow close on the heels of ones against MIT, NYU and Yale. Aug 11, 2016 @ 1:56 pm By Greg Iacurci + Zoom Duke University It's been two days since Yale, MIT and NYU were sued for excessive fees in their retirement plans, and lawyers have already added four more to the pile: Duke University, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Pennsylvania and Vanderbilt University. The same law firm, Schlichter, Bogard & Denton, is responsible for each of the seven university lawsuits, which allege breach of fiduciary duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for allowing the plan to incur excessive investment, record-keeping and administration fees that cost participants millions of dollars in lost retirement savings. The firm's managing partner, Jerry Schlichter, pioneered excessive-fee litigation in the 401(k) market, where he has been bringing cases for about a decade. It seems he and his firm are broadening their reach to the realm of 403(b) plans, which are defined-contribution plans for nonprofit institutions. The lawsuits earlier this week were the first to be filed among university 403(b) plans. “What seems to have happened is plaintiffs' attorneys have discovered there's a whole world of plans in the educational community, and having now discovered them, they're exploring whether or not there are settlements to be extracted,” said Andrew Oringer, partner and co-chair of the employee benefits and executive compensation group at Dechert. Those settlements have the potential to be hefty. Mr. Schlichter, for example, won the largest-ever sum in cases such as these from Lockheed Martin Corp. last year, to the tune of $62 million. He's won several more, including a $57 million sum from The Boeing Co., earning more than $300 million in aggregate. Mr. Schlichter didn't return a request for comment. ALLEGATIONS The Duke, Johns Hopkins, UPenn and Vanderbilt 403(b) plans each have more than $3 billion in assets and tens of thousands of participants. Participants in the plans are bringing suit on behalf of a proposed class. Allegations among the lawsuits are nearly identical. Over the relevant time periods, plaintiffs claim the university plans used multiple record keepers, imprudently used revenue sharing to pay for record-keeping services and harbored too many investment options, many of which were underperforming funds in a retail share class as opposed to a less-expensive institutional share class. These factors led participants to pay excessive fees, constituting a breach by fiduciaries to ensure participants incur reasonable fees, plaintiffs claim. Vanderbilt's and Duke's plans, for example, used four separate record keepers — Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Co., Vanguard Group Inc., TIAA and the Variable Life Insurance Co. The inefficiencies of using multiple providers as well as excessive revenue-sharing payments to these providers, contributed to $45 million in lost savings in the last six years for Duke's participants, and $25 million for Vanderbilt's, according to plaintiffs. Johns Hopkins University used five record keepers, and UPenn two. Three out of four of the plans offered more than 300 investment options, the vast majority of them proprietary and split between mutual funds, insurance pooled separate accounts and fixed and variable annuities. Johns Hopkins' plan, for example, offered more than 440 investment options, Duke more than 400, Vanderbilt 340 and UPenn 78. Plaintiffs allege this number of options causes duplicative investment strategies, which is confusing for participants and doesn't allow fiduciaries to take advantage of economies of scale to achieve better pricing. “Duke provides a range of options that give employees flexibility in designing retirement plans to meet their individual needs,” said Michael Schoenfeld, a spokesman for the university. “These investments are reviewed and carefully managed in accord with federal law to provide low costs and good outcomes for our employees. We will continue to commit to these guiding principles.” Similarly, UPenn spokeswoman Phyllis Holtzman said the university uses a “rigorous process to review all aspects of the investment options offered to its faculty and staff to ensure they are administered with the highest degree of care and prudence.” UPenn plans to defend itself vigorously against the lawsuit, she said. Vanderbilt hasn't yet been served with the complaint, and hasn't had the opportunity to review allegations, spokeswoman Beth Fortune said. Johns Hopkins spokeswoman Jill Rosen said the university offers its employees a “generous and carefully managed benefits program,” and is in the process of reviewing its lawsuit as well as the others filed this week. The litigation appears to attack traditional aspects of the 403(b) market, according to Michael Hadley, a partner at the law firm Davis & Harman. “Having lots of options and lifetime income products available is pretty fundamental to university 403(b) plans,” he said. “The 403(b) market has moved closer to how we administer 401(k) plans over time. But it's certainly not the same as a 401(k) plan.” Mr. Hadley believes it's “way too early” to determine the validity of the suits' arguments. Mr. Oringer thinks "you'd really have to establish there was material inefficiency in the use of multiple record keepers that cost participants money in a way that was not defensible. And it just seems to me that that's potentially a tough claim to make.” Further, courts tend to favorably view providing an expansive number of choices, he said. 0 Comments What do you think?

The companies will have 24 months to assist with “the commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions,” NASA announced Aug. 9. The six companies are: Bigelow Aerospace Boeing Lockheed Martin Orbital ATK Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems NanoRacks “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems, according to the release. “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” This is part two of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships, or NextSTEP, program. In 2015, four partners—Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK—were selected to work on deep space exploration and habitats. NextSTEP-2 will hone in on “missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s,” NASA states. “These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars.” Bigelow is a pioneer of sorts when it comes to deep space habitats. Earlier this year, the Las Vegas-based company launched its latest experiment: the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, which was the first inflatable habitat NASA allowed to be attached to the International Space Station. The module was flown into space on SpaceX’s cargo cargo capsule, attached to the ISS, and expanded and pressurized on May 28. For the next two years, it’ll remain in orbit above the Earth to test how well expandable habitats hold up against conditions like solar radiation and extreme temperatures. NanoRacks’ inclusion in NASA’s current program signals an expansion of their existing relationship; the Texas-based company already has a mini-satellite launcher on the ISS. Orbital ATK will be advancing designs for Cygnus, its current commercial cargo space craft that flies to the ISS. The other three companies will be creating or refurbishing and modifying ground demonstrators or prototypes of habitats. Over the next two years, each of the six selected companies will be awarded varying amounts of funding for their diverse projects, but the combined total cost will be close to $65 million. In their its release announcing NextSTEP-2, NASA implied that, if necessary, the project would continue into 2018 and additional funding would then be pumped into it. Of course, nothing guarantees functional finished products by 2018—or ever, for that matter. But NASA has a track record of successful partnerships with private companies leading to real results, like Red Dragon, SpaceX’s spacecraft that aims carry astronauts to the ISS by 2018.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ Unofficial _Sources f t ✉ ⎕ 50 Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Donald Trump Talks Tough About Military Contractors, But Quietly Signals Friendship Naomi LaChance Naomi LaChance 2016-08-11T18:13:22+00:00 Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Donald Trump, who has railed against the political influence of military contractors, denounced wasteful Pentagon spending, and promised a less interventionist foreign policy has nevertheless added to his transition team the leader of a group of defense contractors who advocate greater American militarism. Michael Rogers, the hawkish former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, will be advising the Trump transition team on national security, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. After leaving Congress, Rogers founded a pressure group called Americans for Peace, Prosperity, and Security, intended to “help elect a president who supports American engagement and a strong foreign policy.” As Lee Fang reported for The Intercept last year, the business executives helping APPS included several defense contractors who stand to gain financially from continued militarism. At a rally in February, Trump criticized defense spending. “I will build a military bigger, better, stronger,” he said. “I guarantee we can do it for less money. I hear stories like they are ordering missiles they do not want because of politics; because of special interests. Because the company that makes the missiles is a contributor. … We are ordering missiles that the generals do not want because of politics.” Trump has also advocated reduced military intervention. In July, when asked about the attempted coup in Turkey, he told the New York Times: “I think right now when it comes to civil liberties, our country has a lot of problems, and I think it’s very hard for us to get involved in other countries when we don’t know what we are doing and we can’t see straight in our own country.” In the same interview, he argued against the NATO alliance: “We’re talking about countries that are doing very well. Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, ‘Congratulations, you will be defending yourself.’” Despite Trump’s noninterventionist talk, a financial analyst predicted in April that a Trump presidency would be good for the defense industry. In June, the Trump campaign met with representatives of defense contractors Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin, the Daily Beast reported. Defense contractors were also an important part of Rogers’s congressional bids. During his 2014 run, for example, he took campaign contributions from ManTech International, L-3 Communications, Motorola Solutions, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. Rogers founded APPS with leftover campaign money after he retired from Congress last year. The group has held campaign events in which candidates discussed national security. Most recently, APPS held a national security forum at the RNC with Chris Christie. Since last April, the group has held 27 forums on national security with 14 GOP candidates. Rogers is part of a minority in the national security community that supports Trump — none of the other leaders at APPS has endorsed the candidate, for example. APPS advisory board member Danielle Pletka, who is vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in CNN last month that Trump “not only knows nothing about national security, he doesn’t care to know.” Kevin Madden, national advisor to APPS and senior advisor to Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign, told the Daily Beast in May that he will not vote for Trump. And George W. Bush’s national security advisor, Stephen Hadley, a board member at APPS and Raytheon, declined to endorse either candidate. Fifty Republican former national security officials recently signed a letter opposing Trump. Donald Rumsfeld, George W. Bush’s first defense secretary, is the most prominent national security expert to endorse Trump. On Monday, Trump attacked the former national security officials who came out against him. He said in a statement that the letter was “politically motivated,” and that “they are nothing more than the failed Washington elite looking to hold onto their power.” Related Contact the author: Naomi LaChance✉naomi.lachance@​theintercept.comt@lachancenaomi ˅ ⎕ 50 Comments (closed) The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

A string of cases have fuelled suspicions in the US and beyond that some Chinese firms will resort to any measures to obtain valuable intellectual property that could give them a technological leg-up. In 2010, former Boeing engineer Dongfan “Greg” Chung was jailed for 15 years and nine months for economic espionage after he was convicted of passing trade secrets to Beijing to assist the Chinese aviation industry. The engineer, who worked on Nasa’s space shuttle programme, had stored binders full of information about US military aircraft in his home, collecting data that he passed on to China over three decades. The documents included design manuals for the US Air Force’s B-1 bomber, the C-17 military cargo plane, the F-15 fighter jet, as well as Chinook helicopters. In letters to a Chinese state official, Chung said that he wanted to “make some contributions to the modernisations [sic] of the Motherland”. One letter from a Chinese official, found at Chung’s house and written in 1987, said: “It is your honour and China’s fortune that you are able to realise your wish of dedicating yourselves to the services of your country.” FBI agents began looking into Chung while investigating a separate case against Chinese-born naturalised US citizen Chi Mak. Mak was found guilty in 2007 of conspiring to export sensitive defence technology to China while working for defence contractor Paragon Power. He was caught when family members were searched at Los Angeles airport and found to have a CD full of classified information. The information Mak passed on allegedly helped China build its own version of Aegis, an American radar system built to protect military ships. He was sentenced to 24 years in prison for acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. More recently Chinese citizen Mo Hailong, commonly known as Robert Mo, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal agricultural trade secrets. In January Mo admitted digging up corn seeds from an Iowa farm to send back to China, breaching the intellectual property rights of agrochemicals conglomerate Monsanto and seed producer Du Pont Pioneer. He is yet to be convicted or sentenced, but conspiracy to steal trade secrets is a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The Justice Department (DoJ) said the theft was on behalf of “companies controlled by the government of the People’s Republic of China”. Repeated allegations of spying by state-sponsored hackers have also added to tensions between the west and China. In 2014, the DoJ indicted five Chinese military officers with stealing data from six US companies and unions in an eight-year espionage campaign that targeted firms including metals giant Alcoa and nuclear firm Westinghouse Electric. Oil giants BP, Shell and Exxon Mobil were among companies which had their systems infiltrated by hackers in China, uncovered by internet security firm McAfee in 2011. The attacks, part of a lengthy campaign nicknamed “Night Dragon”, targeted “project-financing information with regard to oil and gas fields and operations”, according to McAfee, including information about the location of potentially lucrative oil reserves. Google’s travails in China, where the search engine is banned, are well documented. In 2010, the US internet firm said a cyber-attack originating in China had targeted its intellectual property. Google said the attackers’ main aim was to infiltrate the email accounts of Chinese dissidents and human rights activists, but it also flagged up efforts to steal information from companies in industries including chemicals, technology and finance. In 2014, a Chinese hacker group called Putter Panda, thought to be based in the offices of the People’s Liberation Army, was said by security experts to have hacked satellite technology companies in the US and UK. A report by BT and KPMG warned earlier this year of the “industrialisation of cybercrime”. The report said today’s cybercriminals often work for complex operations akin to businesses, with human resources divisions and budgets for research and development. Some are so sophisticated that they are able to hijack senior executives’ email accounts and fake correspondence to convince junior company employees to approve transactions.

QRZ Callsign Search  Page last updated on: Wednesday, August 10, 2016 NASA TV to air installation of space station docking port NASA Television will bring to viewers around the world live coverage Friday, Aug. 19, as two NASA astronauts install a new gateway for American commercial crew spacecraft at the International Space Station - a significant milestone in NASA’s work to return crew launches to U.S. soil. Coverage of the spacewalk will begin at 6:30 a.m. EDT Aug. 19, on NASA TV and the agency’s website, with the spacewalk scheduled to begin at 8:05 a.m. Leading up to the spacewalk, NASA TV will air a briefing from the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston at 2 p.m. Monday, Aug. 15, during which station and commercial crew experts will discuss the process and significance of installing and connecting the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs) that will be used for the future arrivals of Boeing and SpaceX commercial crew spacecraft. The briefing participants are: Kenneth Todd, International Space Station Operations Integration manager Steve Stich, deputy manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program Zeb Scoville, spacewalk flight director Glenda Brown, lead spacewalk officer The adapter was launched on a SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and arrived at the station July 20. Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams, KD5TVQ and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins, KG5FYJ of NASA will conduct the spacewalk to install the equipment. This will be the fourth spacewalk in Williams’ career, the first for Rubins, and the 194th for the space station. The two astronauts will venture outside the space station’s Quest airlock to install the first IDA onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2, located on the forward end of the Harmony module. On Wednesday, Aug. 17, ground controllers will use the Canadarm2 robotic arm, and its attached “Dextre” Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, to extract the IDA from the trunk of Dragon, and position it just inches away from PMA-2. There will be no live coverage of the trunk removal and IDA positioning. Commercial crew flights from Florida’s Space Coast to the International Space Station will restore America’s human spaceflight launch capability and increase the time U.S. crews can dedicate to scientific research, which is helping prepare astronauts for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars. NASA TV’s Public Channel (NTV-1) will broadcast enhanced coverage of the spacewalk including operational commentary, in-studio experts and features, and its Media Channel (NTV-3) will broadcast a clean feed of video from space station with operational commentary.

For one thing, the new glass technology pioneered by a team of scientists at MIT is capable of changing shades much faster that what you’ll find on those ultra-hip eyeglasses. It also covers a broader spectrum of opacity than such photochromic substances. The material also differs from the electrochromic variety you’ll find on the windows of Boeing 787 Dreamliner to prevent glare. Again, it’s quicker, in part due to the slow speeds of electronics and ions required to create the material change in the older technology. Utilizing spongy metal-organic frameworks, the new stuff conducts both quickly. The material is also capable of running the spectrum from completely clear to nearly black, the latter of which it accomplishes by combining different chemical compounds. The material, highlighted in the new issue of the online journal Chem, could be used to reduce glare (a la Boeing), produce e-ink-style displays and cut down on energy costs by going opaque for cooling purposes when the sun is particularly glaring outside. And while, like other electrochromic solutions, the material requires a current to change shades, electricity isn’t required to keep it in that state. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Tesla and SolarCity-powered Island | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Windows glass MIT Science Popular Posts Featured Stories The OnePlus 3T makes one of Android’s best bets even better 5 hours ago | Brian Heater Google’s AI translation tool seems to have invented its own secret internal language 18 hours ago | Devin Coldewey, Contributor Starbucks starts selling Ember mugs, which keep your drink at a steady temp for hours 19 hours ago | Lora Kolodny Facebook built censorship tool to get into China despite human rights risks 19 hours ago | Josh Constine Latest From TechCrunch Gong says it’s cracked news personalization 15 minutes ago | Anthony Ha A longtime VC on the virtues of not swinging for the fences 20 minutes ago | Connie Loizos Amazon makes good on its promise to delete “incentivized” reviews 26 minutes ago | Sarah Perez Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures back Apptopia’s next-gen app intelligence platform 2 hours ago | Sarah Perez Comment moderation powered by Up Next Microsoft acquires Beam interactive game live streaming service Posted Aug 11, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings CRM Berater (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland) C++ Developer - Qt Product Development (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland) Full Stack Engineer at FactorChain at The Sourcery (Los Altos, CA, United States) UI Engineering @ FactorChain at The Sourcery (Los Altos, CA, United States) Senior Backend Engineer @ MeetMe at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Rubins and Williams will conduct a spacewalk in August 2016 to install the first International Docking Adapter, the new docking port that will enable the future arrival of U.S. commercial crew spacecraft. Credit: NASA. A pair of astronauts tried on U.S. spacesuits this morning ahead of a spacewalk next week. Afterward, the crew explored heart cells, fluid pressure in the head and the eyes and the composition of meteors. NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins are due to work outside the International Space Station on Aug. 19 for 6.5 hours. The duo tried on the spacesuits today they will wear during the spacewalk to complete the installation of the first of two International Docking Adapters to the Harmony module. Commercial Crew vehicles are being developed by Boeing and SpaceX that will dock to the new adapters in the future. Rubins then moved on to observing heart cells with a specialized microscope. The heart cells are derived from stem cells that were manufactured from human skin cells. Williams joined cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin for ultrasound scans and vision checks. That work was part of the Fluid Shifts study that is exploring how the lack of gravity influences head pressure and eye shape possibly affecting an astronaut's vision. Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi replaced a hard drive on a laptop computer that collects data on the composition of meteors entering Earth's atmosphere. Cosmonauts Oleg Skripochka and Alexey Ovchinin participated in a study that seeks to improve the ability of a crew member to pilot a spacecraft. On-Orbit Status Report Fluid Shifts Operations in the Service Module: With ground team assistance, crewmembers continued Fluid Shifts Imaging exams by conducting the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) exam, Ultrasound scans, the Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) tests, and a Tonometry exam. This investigation characterizes the space flight-induced fluid shift, including intra- and extravascular shifts, intra- and extracellular shifts, changes in total body water and lower vs. upper body shifts. Results from this investigation are expected to help define the causes of the ocular structure and vision changes associated with long duration space flight, and assist in the development of countermeasures. Mouse Epigenetics Cage Unit Maintenance: The crew completed standard maintenance activities for the Mouse Epigenetics experiment by refilling the water in the Mouse Habitat Cage Unit located in the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF). The Mouse Epigenetics investigation studies altered gene expression patterns in the organs of male mice that spend one month in space, and also examines changes in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of their offspring. Results from the investigation identify genetic alterations that happen after exposure to the microgravity environment of space. Heart Cells Microscope Operations: The crew set up the Heart Cells microscope, removed the BioCell Habitat from the Space Automated Bioproduct Lab (SABL) and the Multiwell BioCell from the BioCell Habitat and inserted into the microscope before conducting Heart Cells operations. The Heart Cells investigation studies the human heart, specifically how heart muscle tissue, contracts, grows and changes (gene expression) in microgravity and how those changes vary between subjects. Understanding how heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, change in space improves efforts for studying disease, screening drugs and conducting cell replacement therapy for future space missions. Meteor Hard Drive Change: The crew R&Rd the hard drive in the Meteor Laptop located in the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF) in preparation for upcoming meteor showers. The Meteor investigation provides the first space-based measurement of meteor flux. It also allows for the monitoring of carbon-based compounds. Continuous measurement of meteor interactions with the Earth's atmosphere could also spot previously unforeseen meteor showers. Dose Tracker: The crew completed entries for medication. This investigation documents the medication usage of crewmembers before and during their missions by capturing data regarding medication use during spaceflight, including side effect qualities, frequencies and severities. The data is expected to either support or counter anecdotal evidence of medication ineffectiveness during flight and unusual side effects experienced during flight. It is also expected that specific, near-real-time questioning about symptom relief and side effects will provide the data required to establish whether spaceflight-associated alterations in pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD) is occurring during missions. MSG Video File Transfer Issues - Yesterday, the Microgravity Sciences Glovebox (MSG) experienced an issue with the Video Unit Equipment (VUE). Ground teams were unable to access the solid state storage devices during HeartCell video downlink operations. A soft reboot was attempted with no success. A power cycle was then conducted and the drives were recovered. In addition, ground teams are having difficulties in downlinking large files associated with the payload. The HeartCell data is being recorded, so no loss of science at this time. If required, the current work-around is to have the crew utilize a thumb drive to allow the files to be downlink. Currently, the VUE is functional except for downlinking large files. Ground teams are investigating. Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The crew continued preparations for the IDA2 EVA scheduled on August 19. This morning they performed pressurized Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) On Orbit Fit Check Verification (OFV) of EMUs 3003 and 3008 to assess fit and feel of the suits prior to the EVA.

However, a trip to the red planet using current propulsion technologies can take up to eight months, during which astronauts need to be able to survive the extremely hostile environment of the cold and dark beyond, which, if things go wrong, can kill them in the blink of an eye. In order to ensure that humans survive the grueling journey, NASA has long been trying to design and develop deep space habitats and systems. On Wednesday, in another step toward this effort, the space agency announced that it had selected six companies as part of its Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program to develop full-sized ground prototypes and concepts for deep-space habitats. Concept image of the interior of a deep space habitat. Photo: NASA The six selected partners are — Lockheed Martin, which will refurbish and test a multi-purpose logistics module, Boeing, which will develop a full-scale modular habitat system, Orbital ATK, which will work on perfecting the design and architecture of its cislunar habitat concept, Bigelow Aerospace, which will develop and test a prototype of its XBASE habitat, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems, which will study and refine a flexible architecture and concept of operations for a deep space habitat, and NanoRacks, which will, along with its partners Space Systems Loral and the United Launch Alliance, conduct a feasibility study regarding the conversion of an existing launch vehicle’s upper stage into a pressurized habitat. Concept image of Lockheed Martin's refurbished multi-purpose logistics module prototype Photo: Lockheed Martin “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems, said in a statement. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” Related Stories 'Ice House' Could Keep Astronauts Cozy On Mars Apollo Astronauts Face Higher Risk Of Heart Disease Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. Photo: Boeing The space agency estimates that the contracts would add up to $65 million over the next two years. The selected companies are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the total cost. NASA would seek to ensure that at least some of these habitats would be a part of its ambitious mission to Mars, and it hopes to put these technologies to test in the true deep space environment near the moon during the 2020s. However, until that happens, the ground prototypes will allow NASA and the partner companies to evaluate configurations of the habitat and test how the various systems interact together and with other capabilities like propulsion modules and airlocks.

In the meantime, we need to develop ways for humans to live safely in space for extended periods of time. That’s the goal of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2). The latest initiative in this program is the development of six deep space human habitats here on Earth for in-depth testing. Each of the six habitats will be developed by a different private company over the course of this year and next. You’re probably familiar with some of the ideas and companies that are participating in the habitat test. For example, Bigelow Aerospace, which made news recently with an inflatable module on the International Space Station. Bigelow will be developing a prototype of the XBASE (Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement) that is larger than the BEAM modules on the ISS. The XBASE will be 330 cubic meters in size, compared to just 16 cubic meters for the BEAM. Space heavyweights Boeing and Lockheed Martin are also getting involved. Boeing doesn’t have many details, just that it plans to develop a module habitat system. Lockheed has an interesting plan that involves refurbishing logistics modules in space for use as habitats. Orbital ATK has worked with NASA on a number of big projects, too, and it’s designing a habitat version of its Cygnus cargo vessel. The lesser known firms working on the habitat project include Sierra Nevada Corporation, which will develop a prototype module space station design that can be assembled in orbit in 3-4 launches. NanoRacks is the final participant and will explore the feasibility of converting the upper stages of existing launch vehicles into habitable volume in orbit. NASA expects to award about $65 million in total for work done on these feasibility studies, some of which could eventually become real space habitats.

(Photo : NASA via Getty Images) The continues advancement in space technology requires calculated steps and complex maneuvers to complete, like the installation of the new kind of docking port to the International Space Station (ISS). Advertisement Last July, SpaceX delivered cargo to space including the docking port that will be used in the new few years for the new breed of space capsules that can transport crew to space including the ones currently being developed by SpaceX and Boeing. NASA is ready to share the history as it unfolds when the agency announced that the installation of the new docking port will be televised and will be available for viewing around the world. NASA TV will air the space walk to install the port on Friday, Aug. 19, according to the agency's press release. Walking in space alone poses a threat to the astronauts performing their duty, but the new mission of installing a dock into the ISS adds to the level of difficulties that astronauts will need to survive in order to perform their duty. The docking port will serve as the new gateway at the ISS. The coverage that will record the intricate spacewalk to install the port will start at 6:30 am on Aug. 19 on NASA television (NASA TV). The briefing for the event will also be conducted on the same day at the Johnson Space Center at 2:00 pm. During the briefing, key individuals concerned with the project will discuss the important points of the mission; the list includes Kenneth Todd, the International Space Station Operations Integration manager, Steve Stich, deputy manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Zeb Scoville, spacewalk flight director and Glenda Brown, lead spacewalk officer, according to PR Newswire. The new type of docking board called International Docking Adapters (IDAs) that is fitted to receive Boeing and SpaceX' space capsules for crew transport.   Advertisement     TagsISS, International Space Station, Spacewalk, space walk, spacewalk live, NASA TV spacewalk live, watch spacewalk live, ISS docking port installation, space © 2016 NatureWorldNews.com All rights reserved.

(Photo : NASA via Getty Images) Developing space habitats is a vital step in NASA's deep space explorations as providing the crew with decent and habitable area in space in crucial to the success of future missions. Advertisement NASA is looking at developing other deep space habitats from different companies and is planning to build full-scale model of each here on Earth. The agency teamed up with six private companies to produce full-scale prototypes of space habitats from their original design. The designs were chosen from the submissions to the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships, according to Engadget. Earlier this year, a habitable inflatable module was sent to the International Space Station (ISS), the first inflatable module sent to space developed by Bigelow Aerospace. Bigelow Aerospace will also develop its space habitat version called Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE), the XBASE is capable of attaching to existing space stations. The companies chosen includes Boeing that will test their modular habitat system. Boeing is also developing a new generation of space capsule that can transport crew to space called CST-100 Starliner. Lockheed Martin is also part of the program and will transform their multi-purpose modules that used to carry supplies into space to habitats with integrated avionics and Environmental Control System, while Orbital ATK will continue to develop its cislunar habitat. Other companies also working with NASA in developing space habitats include Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems, another cargo resupply company to the ISS. They will modify their Dream Chase space plane originally designed from unmanned cargo resupply missions, according to a report. While for cost-effective measures, Space Systems Loral and United Launch Alliance are working on NanoRacks under their team name "Ixion." They are attempting to study the feasibility of transforming tanks from former launch vehicles into space habitats. This way, the former parts of space vehicles that are doomed to waste might get another shot at life by providing shelter to the crew in space. All the habitats will be designed with space in mind and future deep space explorations like Mars. The companies are expected to build full-scale deep space habitat prototypes on Earth.

And from the end of next year, the centre will be used to train a new generation of Qantas pilots on the next generation aircraft.” Qantas has previously announced plans to recruit 170 pilots between now and 2020 as part of its Dreamliner program. This is in addition to training some of its existing pilots on the new aircraft. “The 787-9 will be the first new major aircraft type introduced into the Qantas fleet since we started flying the Airbus A380 in 2008 and provides us with the ability to replace older, less efficient aircraft and deliver potential new routes,” Mr Joyce said. Some of the key features of the Dreamliner include reduced engine noise, a 20% reduction in emissions and fuel burn, and technology to reduce turbulence. Qantas’ first 787-9 is expected to enter service by the end of 2017. Most pilots spend up to 24 hours a year in a simulator specific to the type of aircraft they fly as part of their ongoing training and professional development. Pilots using the B787 simulator will be working towards their certification to fly the new aircraft, which in the case of a pilots already operating as a captain on a Boeing aircraft takes 44 hours of ‘sim time’.

Pops! Resident orchestra gains quick following Adam Parker For The Gazette Aug 10, 2016 (…) Buy Now The North Charleston Pops! orchestra is regularly drawing an audience of 1,000 people or more. It’s catching on fast. Now at the cusp of its fifth season, the North Charleston Pops! is luring thousands of patrons to the Performing Arts Center for concerts featuring Broadway and movie music, big band tunes, famous singers such as Mary Wilson and a relaxed atmosphere. The pops orchestra comprises professional players led by conductor Nick Palmer, who is about to start his second season as music director. “I wasn’t expecting it to become so important to the community so quickly,” said Executive Director Tacy Edwards, who devotes many hours to the ensemble on a volunteer basis. “Nick is the perfect match for what Pops wants to do”: provide great entertainment and harness the spirit of a growing city. They manage to do a lot with a small but growing annual budget. This year it’s $180,000, with a big chunk of it coming from Boeing, the orchestra’s main sponsor. The city helps, too, providing venues, marketing and money. This enables the Pops to keep ticket prices low, Edwards said. The partnership with the city began at an opportune moment, just as the region began to see substantial growth in the aftermath of the 2008 recession. The Pops ensemble satisfies a need, Edwards said. “There’s lots of pride that the community has its own orchestra.” The expanded new season begins on Sept. 10 with “Broadway Rocks!” The concert includes tunes from popular shows such as “Wicked,” “Hairspray,” “The Lion King,” “Rent,” “The Wiz” and “Mamma Mia!” Four more concerts follow. Plans also are being laid to present a few outdoor concerts in Riverfront Park, Palmer and Edwards said. They also want to take the Pops orchestra on the road for performances in the Southeast. Edwards remembers her joy at seeing more than 700 patrons in the audience for the first-ever Pops concert in November 2012. Nowadays, concerts easily draw at least 1,000. The final concert of last season filled the PAC with 1,220 people. Once, in February 2014, a concert featuring Cirque de la Symphonie sold out with more than 2,000 in attendence. “We are finding, as each concert happens, we sell more tickets,” she said. “Word-of-mouth advertising is very powerful.” Palmer, who has enjoyed a long career as a composer, arranger and conductor, said he’s especially excited about the opportunities opening up for the North Charleston Pops! orchestra. It’s about a lot more than presenting concerts. The group operates a successful instrument donation program, providing low-income children a chance to learn and perform music. And now Palmer and his colleagues are working on setting up a Pops chorus and string orchestra. Eventually, he hopes to develop a full-scale Youth Pops Orchestra, he said. Edwards, a flutist with years of performing and administrative experience, said the orchestra is fortunate to have found Palmer. “I have worked with many music directors,” she said. “It’s hard to find a person so well-rounded. ... Nick, he loves people, goes into the community, he’s responsive, outgoing, easy to work with, very supportive of what we do.” And he is full of ideas and has a clear vision for the organization. “He knows a lot of artists out in the world, so he’s able to bring us talent at a fraction of the typical cost.” Most Popular Articles Articles Edisto Beach State Park to reopen Friday Hanahan's Dyson inks with Crusaders Hawks counting on versatility Second person dies in apparent murder/suicide in Goose Creek Cane Bay girls team seeking consistency Gators lose 25 seniors, expect better 2017 Championship dreams at stake in playoffs Gators dealing with huge loss Charleston Southern to offer new BS in Cyber Security degree Cobras fend off Crestwood Friends2Follow Poll What do you think of the new ourgazette.com website?

David Goldfein brief reporters. (Photo: U.S. Air Force, Scott M. Ash) Updated on August 15 to reflect KC-46 production approval More than 60 U.S. Air Force acquisition and upgrade programs could be affected if the Congress approves stopgap legislation instead of passing the Fiscal Year 2017 defense appropriations bill, warned Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James. Production of the joint direct attack munition (JDAM) and the KC-46 refueling tanker would be less than planned next year, as would spending on the B-21 long-range strike bomber. James delivered the warning during a “State of the Air Force” briefing August 10 at the Pentagon. It was her first such briefing with Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, who was sworn in to the post on July 1. He succeeded Gen. Mark Welsh. The service is “hearing” that Congress may pass a six-month or a year-long continuing resolution, or stopgap spending measure, James said. A long-term “CR” would fund the Air Force at $1.3 billion less than the amount it seeks in FY2017, she instructed. Lesser funding would limit production of Boeing’s JDAM precision guidance tail kits—much in demand for overseas contingency operations against the Islamic State and other extremists—to the FY2016 level. Similarly, the Northrop Grumman B-21 program, now at the engineering and manufacturing development stage, would be capped at the FY2016 level. Production of the Boeing KC-46 would be capped at 12 aircraft instead of the 15 sought. This “couldn’t help but push back” the KC-46 program’s contractual required assets available (RAA) date, said James, who expressed concern that the contract could be renegotiated. “That’s a serious question because of course we do have favorable terms and we do not want to reopen the contract (or) change requirements in any way,” she added. The “key meeting” leading to a Milestone C decision to begin low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the tanker will happen later this month, James said. “We believe that the aircraft has met all of the wickets that are required to meet Milestone C,” she attested. But undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics Frank Kendall must approve the decision. (The Air Force announced on August 12 that Kendall gave Milestone C approval to begin LRIP. The service said it will soon award Boeing contracts for two production lots totaling 19 aircraft, for a combined pre-negotiated value of $2.8 billion.) Separately of the budget discussion, James said the Air Force has made progress on a “get well plan” to shore up its remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) corps, which is challenged to attract and retain pilots and sensor operators. It is “well on the way” to fully manning training units and from FY2015 to FY2017 will double the number of RPA graduate and undergraduate pilots from 188 to 334. As of October 1, the service will raise its RPA pilot retention bonus from $25,000 to $35,000. Air National Guard units are supporting active-duty and reserve airmen, providing for three additional air combat patrols. The Air Force is also relying more on contractors to conduct non-strike missions. This fall, it will announce candidate bases for locating a new wing of RPA airmen, James said. While the Air Force has made progress on RPA recruitment, it faces an accute shortage of up to 1,000 fighter pilots in the next couple of years (from 700 now) and is seeking authorization from Congress to improve their compensation. “Why is this so? Well, the airlines are forecasted to be hiring a lot more. They already are,” James said. A reporter asked if the situation represents a crisis. “I believe it’s a crisis,” Goldfein said. “Air superiority is not an American birthright. It’s actually something you have to fight for and maintain.” Regulations and Government http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2016-08-10/budget-delay-could-slow-programs-air-force-secretary-warns There are no comments yet, please Login or Register to begin a discussion.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday November 24, 2016 Life & Style Travel Larger / SmallerNight Mode Singapore Airlines Airbus A350 arrives at Melbourne Airport for first time Craig Platt 10 Aug 2016, 8 p.m. Singapore Airlines' next-generation Airbus A350 has touched down in Australia for the first time, but be quick if you want to fly on it. Singapore Airlines' next-generation Airbus A350 has touched down in Australia for the first time. Flight SQ207 touched down at Melbourne Airport on Wednesday evening after flying in from the Asian city-state. The new A350-900 is Airbus' rival to the Boeing Dreamliner. Like its rival, the A350 is also a lightweight aircraft, but with some key differences. Unlike the Dreamliner, which has a body is composed primarily of carbon fibre, the A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials, helping airlines save on fuel. Singapore Airlines' A350 features three classes - 42 business class seats, 24 premium economy and 187 economy. The seat layout is 1-2-1 in business class, 2-4-2 in premium and 3-3-3 in economy. The airline currently has five A350s in its fleet and 62 on order. Singapore is the second carrier to bring the A350 to Australia, after Qatar Airways began daily flights from Qatar to Adelaide in May. Passengers looking to experience the A350 on the Melbourne-Singapore route will need to be quick - the new aircraft is only flying to Melbourne on a temporary basis. The A350 will fly between Melbourne and Singapore daily until October 22, before being redeployed on non-stop flights between Singapore and San Francisco from October 23. The A350-900 has a range of 8100 nautical miles (15,000km), but seven of Singapore Airlines' future A350s will be the ULR (ultra long range) variant, which Airbus says will be able to complete epic 19-hour long-haul journeys. The aircraft manufacturer says its A350 uses 25 per cent less fuel than Boeing's longest-range plane, the 777. Singapore has previously flagged that when it receives the ULR aircraft it will restart the world's longest commercial route, non-stop flights from Singapore to New York City. Emirates currently flies the world's longest route, from Dubai to Auckland non-stop. Follow the writer on Twitter and Instagram.

Aug 10, 2016 Inside MRO EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement ASKY Airlines based in Lomé,Togo and shareholder, Ethiopian Airlines are planning to establish an aircraft MRO and training center in West Africa. This is a significant development as West Africa currently does not have any local stations capable of heavy maintenance. The International Aviation Group (IAG) and Arik Air may also seek to get a slice of the region’s MRO pie. Tewolde Gebremariam, CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, explained that ASKY was in discussions with the Togolese government and that if approved, the MRO facility will cater to Boeing and Bombardier aircraft. The training facility will train back-office staff and cabin crew. He said: "Our main MRO hub remains in Addis Ababa and [we] will have regional MRO hubs in Lomé, Lilongwe and Kigali [home to partner RwandAir]. Our planned Lomé MRO hub would maintain aircraft operating in Nigeria, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal.” IAG plans to establish an MRO facility in Abuja, Nigeria. This comes in the wake of local industry stakeholders berating the government for the lack of an MRO facility, which they claim is part of the reason for the high demand of foreign exchange in the industry, lack of developed technical manpower and the inability of Nigeria to carry out C-checks and D-checks. Yesterday (August 9) James Odaudu, deputy director, press and public affairs, at Nigeria’s ministry of aviation, said the venture was because IAG saw potential in the following factors: the huge traffic in and out of the country, the need to reduce the cost of maintaining aircraft abroad and the chance of attracting work from neighboring countries. In addition, IAG intends to start a Nigerian aviation academy that will be affiliated to a UK-based university. Lagos’ Arik Air has also been considering setting up its own MRO hangars in Nigeria in collaboration with its German partner, Lufthansa Technik.

Photo: Zaharie Ahmad Shah August 5th 2016 4 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/World/ Wanted. A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 — similar to the one missing in the Southern Indian Ocean. Picture: Supplied Robyn IronsideNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend ONE of the longest serving ships of the MH370 search will head home tomorrow leaving just two vessels to complete the 120,000 square kilometre hunt for the missing plane that disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board in March 2014. Fugro Discovery has been on the hunt for MH370 since October 2014, but is required to undergo maintenance and then undertake a new project in Singapore. MH370 DIVED FROM THE AIR, NEW ANALYSIS MALAYSIA AIRLINES CONFIRM PILOT USED FLIGHT SIMULATOR Saying goodbye. Fugro Discovery encountering rough seas during its search for MH370. Picture: ATSBSource:Supplied A spokesman for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said the departure of Fugro Discovery from the search for the Malaysia Airlines’ Boeing 777-2H6ER, an international passenger flight which disappeared only an hour into its flight to Beijing, China, from Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 8 2014, had been in the planning for some time. “The search plan provides for the remaining search area to be completed using the other vessels (Fugro Equator and Dong Hai Jiu 101),” said a statement from the ATSB. In almost two years, the ship conducted 16 “swings” of about 40-days each and searched 51,000 square kilometres of ocean floor. A total of 124 people have worked on the vessel — 13 of whom have worked on more than seven swings. To date, more than 110,000 square kilometres of the search area have been scoured leaving less than 10,000 square kilometres. MALAYSIA AIRLINES DEFENDS MH370 PILOT EIGHT QUESTIONS ON MH370 THAT NEED ANSWERS Tough job. Fugro Discovery encountered 18-metre waves during its search for MH370. Picture: ATSBSource:Supplied Only Fugro Equator has made a greater contribution to the MH370 search, having been on the job since mid-2014 conducting bathymetric surveys in preparation for the complex operation. With only two ships on the job, it is expected to take till year’s end to fully search the “most prospective” area in the Southern Indian Ocean. ATSB Chief Commissioner Greg Hood said during that time, the search vessels would ensure any “small gaps” in the area scoured would be thoroughly scanned by sensitive equipment. In close to two-years of searching, no trace of the Boeing 777 has been found in the Southern Indian Ocean, prompting Fugro search director Paul Kennedy to comment recently that “if it’s not there, it means it’s somewhere else”. Almost done. Less than 10,000 square kilometres of seabed is left to be searched in the hunt for MH370. Picture: ATSBSource:Supplied He denied the comment was an admission the search was occurring in the wrong place. On March 8, 2014, MH370 disappeared 40-minutes into a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing after turning back towards Malaysia and then heading south. Despite the discovery of a similar route on the pilot’s home flight simulator, the ATSB and Malaysia Airlines have insisted there was no evidence Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah deliberately flew the plane off course. There were 239 people on board the flight including six Australians and 153 Chinese people. Malaysian investigators are continuing to examine the mystery.

Space Six companies partner with NASA for NextSTEP mission; Will develop space habitat for humans These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that is still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. By Shivangi Sharma - Aug 12, 2016 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter NASA is developing full-size ground prototypes of habitats, so that people can live outside Earth. The US space agency has chosen six deep space habitat projects for NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP). Jason Crusan, Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA Headquarters said “The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit” Prototype for Modular habitat system will be developed by Houston based aerospace company that is Boeing. It will provide design analysis and high-fidelity demonstration and test capability to simulate how humans can safely live and work in deep space for extended periods of time. Lockheed Martin’s project will be based on the loading modules that used to ferry cargo between the ISS and space shuttle. The high-fidelity ECLSS prototype will provide risk reduction and form and fit testing Orbital ATK is working on a separate project to make launch vehicles habitable for longer terms in deep space based on Cygnus spacecraft that will establish a proposed roadmap that leads to Mars exploration. Sierra Nevada Corporation is working on a space habitat that will include a durable fabric house by combining space shuttle-like Dream Chaser Vehicle with the inflatable component. The fifth company is Texas- based NanoRacks will check the feasibility by acknowledging weather launch vehicle’s upper stage into an environment fit to live. There’s also the XBASE (Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement) prototype from Bigelow Aerospace. It’s based on the space house currently attached to the 330 cubic metre ISS, BEAM, to know whether it can survive the climate beyond earth which the company also built. This one, however, will be built for the conditions of deep space which means that it could go much further. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate that is building prototypes to send humans outside our planet.

The agency's Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) program ask private companies to build ground-based prototypes of various modules, meeting a number of criteria from basic life support to fire safety tech and radiation mitigation. ground prototypes will allow NASA to test the habitats Six partners have been selected for the NextSTEP program, now in its second iteration. These include a number of familiar names from the US aerospace industry: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems, Bigelow Aerospace, and Nanoracks. Some of these firms will be building habitation modules, while others will focus on communication infrastructure, propulsion systems, and other key aspects of deep space survival. Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. (Image credit: Boeing) NASA is hoping these habitats will eventually be part of its crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, an ambition that has occupied the space agency for the last six years. But before NASA sorts out living arrangements for this mission, it's going to need to make sure the rockets it uses are also up to scratch. A federal report on NASA's Mars mission released this month cast doubts on this, suggesting that the agency's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule won't meet their development schedules and that current launch dates for the rockets are overly ambitious. As with the most ambitious aerospace plans, whatever happens next, will happen slowly, playing out over years to come.

Zsolt Czegledi / EPA Airspace management is key to Arabian Gulf economy Ben Kiff August 10, 2016 Updated: August 10, 2016 08:20 PM Related Why US airlines are set to suffer more disruptions Abu Dhabi takes flight in next phase for aviation Abu Dhabi Airports Company celebrates 10th anniversary Congested airspace could cost Middle East $16 billion over next decade Gulf airlines remain at close quarters over open skies With the contract award of phase 3 of the UAE Airspace Restructuring Project to an international firm roughly two months ago, the UAE has taken a critical step forward in supporting aviation’s growth both in the country and the wider region. Airspace is the invisible pillar of every nation’s transport infrastructure and is a fundamental, if sometimes overlooked, building block for economies seeking growth and modernisation. For the UAE, which boasts one of the world’s highest aviation growth rates, investment in airspace management is of paramount importance. Passenger traffic through Dubai International Airport exceeded 78 million people last year, and the airport led the world in the number of international passengers. The total economic impact of the aviation sector in Dubai alone was US$26.7 billion in 2013, the most recent year for which figures are available; this is equivalent to 8.1 per cent of Dubai’s total GDP and 416,500 jobs, or 21 per cent of total employment. By 2020 it is expected to be US$31.4bn,. This will support 449,500 jobs – 17.6 per cent of total employment. Regionally, the number of passengers transported by GCC carriers has more than tripled in the past decade to 150 million, and according to Boeing, air traffic in the GCC is expected to grow by 6.2 per cent a year over the next 20 years. The current vitality of the sector and the ability to attain these lofty – but reachable – goals must not be taken for granted. A report commissioned last year by Nats and produced by Oxford Economics showed that unless changes are implemented in airspace management, the region can expect a $16.3bn loss of economic growth caused by increased delays to flights resulting from insufficient air traffic capacity, management and staffing. This loss can be avoided if the right measures are put in place early enough. Governments in the region should look to public-private partnerships to play a role in the collaborative development of the region’s airspace, alongside airlines, airports, governments and civil and military authorities. A key area where these partnerships can help is in enabling the most efficient use of military airspace. Half of the airspace in the GCC is exclusively for military use. Through partnerships with leading private firms, new technologies can be deployed to help the UAE and other GCC countries expand the flexible use of this airspace while still maintaining critical national security. Just last month the company for which I work, Nats, announced an agreement with the Japan Air Navigation Service, paving the way for a joint approach to air traffic management in Japanese civil and military airspace above the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. It will require crucial collaboration and cooperation between civil and military authorities, which will promote aviation-led economic development while ensuring national security in a complex and evolving geopolitical environment. It will also enable better use of the airspace, which will directly benefit all stakeholders, inbound and outbound travellers, and wider society. The United Kingdom is an example of a country with a long history of successfully integrating civil and military operations, where air-traffic management companies work side-by-side with military controllers to manage the airspace in the most optimal way. It is therefore encouraging to see that the UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority has created this type of partnership to implement a road map to restructure the UAE’s airspace through phase 3 of the UAE Airspace Restructuring Project. This is certainly a significant step in the right direction, but it is also important that these partnerships tackle wider issues such as developing the skills of our local workforce; well-trained people remain at the heart of any sustain­able strategy for the successful growth of aviation in the region. Nats, through strategic partnerships with local government entities, has helped to train nationals across the region, including the training and qualification of 115 Omani engineers. With nationalisation rates as low as 20 per cent in some countries, it is crucial that any air traffic management strategy includes comprehensive training programmes for nationals to ensure that they are able to fill the positions that are key to their nation’s strategies for economic growth and diversification.

An MoU was signed by Air India Engineering Services CEO H R Jagannath and Spicejet vice president Arun Kashyap in the presence of top AI officials here on Tuesday. With the signing of the agreement, Spicejet will send its aircraft from the fleet of 42 planes to Nagpur MRO in immediate future, Kashyap told reporters during their visit to the MRO. Kashyap also said Spicejet was in the process of acquiring 100 more aircraft in the days to come. He said the first Spicejet aircraft was expected to roll in for MRO facility within two months. It was already sending its aircraft to GMR, Hyderabad, but now onwards, Spicejet will be using the MRO facility of Air India at Nagpur, he said. Jagannath said after being formally handed over by aircraft manufacturer major Boeing International on December 29, 2014, the MRO started its maintenance operation from March this year and so far handled eight aircraft, while the ninth aircraft was on the pit. Spread over 50 acres of land adjacent to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport, the Rs 600 crore MRO, which is connected by a 3.5 km taxiway, offers a world class facility. It is carrying out maintenance facility of all types including 'D' check of wide bodied aircraft which is mandatory for an aircraft after flying for 3,000 days. A team of dedicated engineers and technicians are positioned to carry out a detailed maintenance of Boeing aircraft to make it air worthy. The construction work of the MRO, funded by Boeing, commenced in March 2011 and completed in a record period of 3.5 years. It was finally handed over to Air India on December 29, 2014, and actual operations commenced from August 27 last year.

The airline’s “Pride of Africa” slogan rang uncomfortably hollow when the 26.22-billion-shilling (US$259-million) loss was announced, driven by higher borrowing costs and unfavourable exchange rates. Kenya Airways, founded in 1977 following the demise of East African Airways, was considered a cash cow just a decade ago, but is now floundering, said independent analyst Aly-Khan Satchu. “In the history of Kenya, no other listed company has ever recorded such an important loss,” Satchu said. A misguided expansion strategy launched in 2011 is the root of the catastrophic state of the firm, a move that called for the purchase of new Boeing planes with the objective of doubling the size of its network. But since then the Ebola virus and terror attacks on the continent have decimated Africa’s tourist numbers, while rivals such as state-owned Ethiopian Airlines and Qatar Airways have boosted their offerings. The firm has also lost out on rock-bottom fuel prices. Like many airlines, it “hedges” its fuel costs by entering into fixed-price contracts. But Kenya Airways was locked into longer-term contracts than most of its competitors, which gained a competitive advantage as fuel prices have plunged since mid-2014. Foreign currency “and fuel hedging are exceptional items, yes, but a company like KQ (Kenya Airways) should be able to deal with this,” said Satchu about the airline’s latest results. To the dismay of Kenya Airways’ two biggest backers — Air France-KLM and the Kenyan government — the firm’s share price has dropped from 140 shillings in 2006 to 3.85 shillings. The company’s debts exceed a billion US dollars. GETS RID OF HEATHROW SLOT Despite the gloom, analysts still see some cause for optimism in the numbers. Revenue was up five per cent and operating losses shrank thanks to a series of shock treatments imposed on the airline by management last year. “The operational result is what I’ll take from the latest results,” said Eric Musau, analyst at Kenya’s Standard Investment Bank. “KQ is on the right track, even if they could do a bit more in terms of assets sales,” he told AFP, describing the net loss as largely down to exceptional factors. A number of structural changes are beginning to show fruit. Kenya Airways has sold or rented out planes that were sitting idle, reducing its fleet size by a third, and has rid itself of an expensive permanent landing slot at London’s Heathrow airport, opting to rent one instead. What is at stake is more than just cash. “It is a matter of national and geopolitical interest for Kenya to have a national carrier. You can’t be the economic leader of the East African region if you don’t have a national carrier,” emphasised Satchu. “I wonder whether Kenya’s shoulders are broad enough to rescue KQ again and again. Kenya is not a country like UAE or Qatar,” which underwrite world-class airlines such as Qatar Airways, he added. Kenya Airways’ pilots have had a particularly fraught relationship with management, which at one point suggested they could be lent on occasion to rapidly growing Ethiopian Airlines. Protests and strikes followed and the idea was abandoned, but the firm still has to deal with a bloated workforce left over from the disastrous expansion plan. The fleet and those who fly it are in the sights of chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze. “The first thing that we are doing now is making sure that we get our business at the right size in order to grow responsibly, and that right size is both revenue and costs,” he said. Ngunze announced in March the airline will cut 600 jobs out of its 4,000-strong workforce. ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES   1. We welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

NASA has selected six US companies to help develop prototypes and concepts of deep space habitats for future manned missions to Mars. Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our journey to Mars, NASA said. "NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the journey to Mars, and we're utilising the innovation, skill and knowledge of the both the government and private sectors," said Jason Crusan, director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems. "The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion," said Crusan. "We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth," he said. The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems and NanoRacks. The six partners will have up to about 24 months to develop ground prototypes and conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. NASA has estimated that the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be about USD 65 million. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 per cent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. The selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyse commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Orion x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ WASHINGTON: NASA has selected six US companies to help develop prototypes and concepts of deep space habitats for future manned missions to Mars. Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our journey to Mars, NASA said. "NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the journey to Mars, and we're utilising the innovation, skill and knowledge of the both the government and private sectors," said Jason Crusan, director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems. "The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion," said Crusan. "We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth," he said. The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems and NanoRacks. The six partners will have up to about 24 months to develop ground prototypes and conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. NASA has estimated that the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be about USD 65 million. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 per cent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. The selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyse commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that is still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. The activities of these awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects, such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy Air India’s Nagpur MRO to service SpiceJet aircraft Rahul Wadke   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet The Hindu File Photo of one of Air India’s maintenance repair overhaul (MRO) facilities A source of revenue for national carrier’s under-used facility Mumbai, August 10:   Air India has finally found better use for its ₹600-crore maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility at the Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN). The national air carrier has entered into an agreement with SpiceJet for maintaining the latter's’ aircraft. Both the companies have signed an MoU under which Air India will provide support to SpiceJet for the maintenance of the latter’s B737 aircraft and landing gear replacement at the Nagpur facility. The MoU was signed by Air India Engineering Services CEO HR Jagannath and SpiceJet Vice-President (Engineering and Maintenance) Arun Kashyap. Revenue source A senior engineer at Air India said on condition of anonymity that the MRO is currently under-utilised, and that the tie-up with SpiceJet will provide some revenue to Air India. In the mid-2000s, when Air India had placed an order for 68 aircraft with Boeing, it had committed to setting up an MRO in India for servicing the aircraft. Boeing had built the facility for Air India and it was operational by 2015. Kashyap told BusinessLine that the MRO has been newly built with the latest infrastructure and is therefore better equipped to handle SpiceJet’s aircraft — carrying out the airframe checks that every aircraft needs to undergo every 24 to 36 months. Engine overhaul will not be carried out at MIHAN, he added. Both the companies will work on each other’s strengths, Kashyap added. Since Air India has better experience in terms of maintenance, major checks will happen at Nagpur. SpiceJet does not require full facility, so about two bays will be used for aircraft maintenance. Supply of spares SpiceJet’s aircraft are currently maintained in Hyderabad and Hosur, but Air India will be able to supply the spares at Nagpur in a better manner, he said. On the issue of viability of taking aircraft to Nagpur, Kashyap said that since the city has a functional airport, it can be worked out such that the aircraft fly with a passenger load. Cost factor SpiceJet is working on the costs required for using the facility. Under the new aviation policy, MRO services do not have to pay VAT and service tax, which would be advantageous to SpiceJet, he said. MIHAN is being developed for the past 11 years by the State government through Maharashtra Airport Development Company Ltd (MADC), a special purpose vehicle. The main MIHAN site, spread over 4,000 hectares, is located about 15 km away from downtown Nagpur. The airport, MRO, SEZ and other manufacturing areas are closely located. It was originally envisaged as a Multi-modal International Cargo Hub for servicing global cargo companies and their aircraft. Union Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari had provided a major push to the project. Under the new aviation policy, MRO services do not have to pay VAT and service tax, which would be advantageous to SpiceJet, said SpiceJet Vice-President (Engineering and Maintenance) Arun Kashyap.

Photo: John Devlin ALASTAIR DALTON 10:02 Thursday 11 August 2016 00:18 Friday 12 August 2016 19 Have your say Emirates will fly the world’s largest passenger plane on its Glasgow-Dubai route, the airline’s UK chief has predicted. The 517-seat Airbus A380 would mark a further expansion of the service, which is carrying four times as many passengers as when it was launched 12 years ago. Emirates vice-president UK Laurie Berryman said: “I think it’s a question of when rather than if.” He expected a double-deck aircraft on the route to come before a third daily flight. He said: “I think the A380 is more likely, but I could not put a timescale on it. It’s a game changer and always drives traffic.” Mr Berryman said the route was continuing to grow despite the turmoil following terrorist attacks and the Brexit vote, and two other Middle East airlines launching flights to their hubs from Edinburgh. Emirates carried 410,000 passengers on its twice-daily flights from Glasgow in the year to March – more than four times more than 2004-05. The airline has since added a second flight and put on larger planes – 360-seat Boeing 777s. In 2013, Mr Berryman had predicted either the A380 or a third flight on the Glasgow route by 2017. One of the superjumbos visited Glasgow two years ago for a one-off visit to mark the route’s tenth anniversary. Mr Berryman said the airport would need to install a second air bridge walkway for passengers and make taxiway improvements for regular flights. Emirates already operates the giant aircraft from Heathrow, Gatwick. Manchester and Birmingham. Three in four passengers from Glasgow travel on from the airline’s Dubai hub to places such as Australia, Thailand and Mauritius. Bangkok is the most popular single destination from Glasgow and the Thai island of Phuket the fastest growing. A Glasgow Airport spokesman said: “We would welcome any added capacity on the route in due course. “If Emirates decided to operate the A380 out of Glasgow, then of course we’d look at making the necessary upgrades.” Scotsman Food & Drink: ideas, inspiration and guides Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

The facts as they are Local News Reports OP-ED Political Analysis Business Lifestyle In The Media Reports Our Yemen war: The U.S. plays a quiet role in a heinous conflict 3 months ago by NY Staff Written by NY Staff Post Gazette — Yemen peace talks have dead-ended for the moment. U.S.-supported Saudi Arabian and other bombing of Yemeni sites, including the capital, Sana, resumed Tuesday, with lethal results. The multiparty Yemen civil war, with substantial international involvement, has continued for 15 months now, with thousands of casualties from the fighting and particularly the bombing, but also taking a high toll among the civilians of this poorest of Middle Eastern states. It pits Houthi Shiite Muslim rebels, backed to a degree by predominantly Shiite Iran, supported by Sunni Muslim supporters of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, against the Sunni Muslim government of Yemen President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Sunni states of the Persian Gulf. Yemen peace talks have dead-ended for the moment. U.S.-supported Saudi Arabian and other bombing of Yemeni sites, including the capital, Sana, resumed Tuesday, with lethal results. The multiparty Yemen civil war, with substantial international involvement, has continued for 15 months now, with thousands of casualties from the fighting and particularly the bombing, but also taking a high toll among the civilians of this poorest of Middle Eastern states. It pits Houthi Shiite Muslim rebels, backed to a degree by predominantly Shiite Iran, supported by Sunni Muslim supporters of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, against the Sunni Muslim government of Yemen President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Sunni states of the Persian Gulf. These are led by Saudi Arabia and include Bahrain, Egypt, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates. What the list leaves out is that the United States provides technical and intelligence support to the Sunni side, based in part on the fact that the air forces of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states were largely sold to them by American companies, including McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. It is unlikely that Saudi Arabia could put these warplanes in the air to bomb Yemen without substantial U.S. assistance. Washington declines to say whether there are ever U.S. co-pilots in the aircraft. There were peace talks involving the parties to the conflict under the auspices of the United Nations underway in Kuwait for the past nine weeks, but these have now collapsed, without success, at least for the moment. The United States has not promoted the talks, reflecting Saudi lack of enthusiasm for an end to the conflict without victory for its side. This approach to a brutal intra-Islamic war is an unacceptable policy position for the United States to take. President Barack Obama should weigh in with a strong initiative to resume the Yemen peace talks on an urgent basis and to pursue them to a successful close, for humanitarian as well as political reasons. If the Saudis are perceived to be dragging their feet, Washington should threaten to cut off U.S. support of their bombing in Yemen. Commercial commitments do not provide a sufficient argument for the perpetuation of the war and the continued killing of Yemenis through U.S.-supported bombing.

Covering Innovation & Inequality in Education Topics Blended Learning Teacher Preparation Higher Education Early Education Mississippi New Orleans All Topics About Hechinger About × Close × Menu Race and Equity Twitter Facebook The rural school district Obama fought to save In a small town the president promised to help 8 years ago, here’s what changed, and what didn’t by Alan Richard August 11, 2016 This story also appeared in PBS Newshour Advertisement Advertisement Now shuttered, this portion of J.V. Martin Middle School in Dillon dates to 1896 and was still in use when then-Senator Barack Obama visited in 2007 during his presidential campaign. Photo: Alan Richard DILLON, S.C. — In 2007, when U.S. Senator Barack Obama was running for president, he visited the public schools here in flat, sandy Dillon County, part of South Carolina’s so-called “Corridor of Shame,” a poor region that stretches from north to south along Interstate 95. Obama toured the old J.V. Martin Middle School, part of which dated to 1896 and was still in use. The building still had a furnace fueled by coal. Students in Dillon had little access to Advanced Placement courses, art and music; and teacher salaries were much lower than in other parts of the state. J.V. Martin had the lowest ratings possible for achievement and improvement on its state report card that year. Nearly half of its students scored “below basic” on the state’s English language arts exam. “I think this school exemplifies some of the enormous problems that we’re having just in terms of getting enough resources to educate our kids,’’ the future president said, shooting a little basketball in the heavy heat of August in a gym with no air conditioning. Once he became president, Obama made education, and narrowing the achievement gaps between poor students and their better-off peers, one of his major priorities. Nine years later, as he approaches the end of his second term, educators and kids in Dillon County say President Obama made good on many of his promises. Here, that came in the form of helping the town replace the decrepit J.V. Martin campus with an impressive new building. And his visits called more national and local attention to under-resourced, rural schools serving mostly minority populations. “I think this school exemplifies some of the enormous problems that we’re having just in terms of getting enough resources to educate our kids.” Then Senator Barack Obama, speaking on the campaign trail in 2007 But in other ways, the president came late to addressing what experts and locals say are the specific needs of poor rural communities like Dillon, where roughly two-thirds of students are African-American, one-third are white and 90 percent are low-income. Dillon was lucky to have the president personally invested in improving its schools. President Obama’s signature education policies such as Race to the Top and the expanded School Improvement Grant program to turn around low-performing schools didn’t always reach places like Dillon and Southern communities like it, however, where schools face the triple problems of poverty, a legacy of racial segregation and distance from jobs and resources that could help uplift the community. Related: How teacher-training programs are trying to get teachers into rural schools “The challenges in rural communities are very real—funding, teacher recruitment and retention, access to technology, poverty, ever-changing expectations, and professional development and support,” U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King Jr. told The Hechinger Report. “These issues, though national, are often felt first, deepest and longest in rural schools.” Half a dozen of the 4,100 students in Dillon gathered in a conference room at Dillon High School and said they’re proud of their school and community, which is near the North Carolina border 70 miles northwest of Myrtle Beach. Not only is the middle school new, but the high school graduation rate has soared from 57 percent to 91 percent in four years. Still, just half of Dillon’s new graduates enroll in two- or four-year college, compared with 70 percent statewide. The science labs at Dillon High are too old to use, said Daijuwan Smith, a senior who plans to study engineering at South Carolina State University. It’s still hard to get good teachers to come here and stay, with average teacher salaries at about $43,300 in Dillon in 2013-14, compared with more than $50,000 in the state’s more affluent districts, meaning any progress is tough to maintain. “Teachers, we’re short of them,” Smith said. “We have a lot of students in one class.” How Obama found Dillon Young girls cheer for Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) as he speaks to supporters at a rally in a high school gymnasium January 23, 2008 in Dillon, South Carolina. Photo: Chris Hondros/Getty Images Bud Ferillo is a preppy, genteel sort of hellraiser. The activist and former legislative aide* from Columbia, S.C., produced and directed a documentary film called Corridor of Shame, released in April 2005 and shown on public television statewide. He recalls Feb. 10, 2007, when Senator Obama announced he’d run for president in Springfield, Illinois. Because six days later on Friday, Ferillo and his daughter stood in line at the Columbia, South Carolina convention center to hear the candidate speak. Then on Monday, he got a call. Obama had seen Corridor and wanted to meet him and the people in the film from Dillon and elsewhere. Weeks later, in March, Obama gathered with about 45 educators and advocates at West Florence High School, halfway between the state capital and Dillon. They had box lunches and sat on metal folding chairs for an hour as Obama grilled them with questions about the state’s rural schools. Then on Aug. 23, the senator came to Dillon. Superintendent Ray Rogers showed him around the village of rusty portable classrooms at J.V. Martin. “Heck, Ray, what’s up with these learning cottages?” Obama asked. “They looked like hell,” the superintendent admitted. Obama won the Democratic Party primary election in South Carolina in January 2008, and Ferillo remembers seeing the senator in a rope line that night after the victory. Obama embraced him and said, “We’ll follow up. We’ll follow up,” Ferillo said. Dillon Superintendent Ray Rogers takes a call while showing a collection of photographs of then-Senator Barack Obama’s visit in 2007. Photo: Alan Richard After he was elected, the town of Dillon stayed on Obama’s radar. A local teenage girl named Ty’sheoma Bethea wrote the president and members of Congress in February 2009, pleading for their help in replacing J.V. Martin, a section of which had been condemned since the president’s visit a few months earlier. “We just want to have a chance at a decent education,” she wrote. Related: For rural districts, housing not enough to attract teachers Bethea and her mother were invited to the White House and sat with the First Lady during the president’s first address to Congress on Feb. 23, 2009. The president read a line from her letter. Members gave her a standing ovation. And the president cited Dillon in his first primetime news conference at the White House that same month. Local voters had approved a penny sales tax in December 2007 to fix the schools but the recession was in full swing and the district couldn’t borrow the additional money it needed for the new middle school. 57 percent to 91 percent The growth in the graduation rate at Dillon High School over four years. Still, just half of the South Carolina town’s new graduates enroll in two- or four-year college, compared with 70 percent statewide. The Obama administration stepped in. The U.S. Department of Agriculture provided the district a $3 million development grant—and backing for a $60 million bond. Rogers has no doubt the president made it happen. Now, the superintendent shows off the new district office, an auditorium next door, and upgraded athletics fields. Most importantly, the old J.V. Martin campus is now shuttered, and students attend the sparkling new Dillon Middle School. But more needs to be done, locals say. Another school in Dillon dates to 1926 and needs to be replaced. An after-hours school ceiling collapse bent students’ desks like they were cardboard. An aircraft parts supplier to the massive new Boeing plant in Charleston has opened in Dillon and could employ thousands in the years to come, and Rogers wants his students to be ready for those jobs. Could Washington do more? Eighth-grader Tamari Ladson, standing, classmate Riziki Nizeyimana at far right, and other students say they’re proud of the new Dillon Middle School and their community, but need art classes, more foreign languages and better opportunities to prepare for college. Photo: Alan Richard Noelle Ellerson, a leading rural education advocate on Capitol Hill, credits President Obama for increasing funds across the board for education the past eight years, which has benefitted rural schools. The administration fought off cuts to the Rural Education Achievement Program, or REAP, during the recession. The E-rate program to connect schools with the web and more technology has grown to just under $4 billion, helping many rural schools. State waivers under the old No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) also gave rural schools needed flexibility, said Ellerson, the associate executive director for policy and advocacy at the American Association of School Administrators (AASA). And yet, Ellerson, who through AASA also represents the National Rural Education Association, added that the trouble with the administration’s approach for rural schools has been its reliance on competitive grant programs to disperse education funding, such as Race to the Top, Investing in Innovation Fund (or i3), and the School Improvement Grant program. Related: After years of reform, a sign of hope for a rural Mississippi school Many rural school districts don’t have the grant writers or expertise to apply for most federal grants, so they can’t benefit like larger suburban and urban school systems do, Ellerson said. “That has negatively and disproportionately hit rural schools [that] were least positioned and had the least capacity to pursue competitive grants,” she said. In June, the White House announced that 20 new communities joined the president’s My Brother’s Keeper mentoring initiative for youths of color. Only two of the new sites are rural: Indianola, Mississippi, and the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. They’ll share in $100 million from foundations and the government for mentoring programs that now reach nearly 10,000 students in 30 communities. Secretary King said in a statement that the Obama administration has been serious about “serving rural communities across the nation, to help them overcome the challenges of distance and isolation and help them connect with critical resources of all types.” The secretary plans to visit smaller communities in a back-to-school bus tour of other parts of the South this fall. “We’re taking steps that should yield real and meaningful progress,” the secretary said. The Obama administration and Dillon taxpayers teamed to build a new district office and auditorium, in addition to the new Dillon Middle School. Photo: Alan Richard More broadly, the nation’s students who come from low-income families have made some progress under Obama’s watch. Achievement gaps have narrowed somewhat for minority students, but the differences remain glaring: 72.5 percent of African-American males finish high school on time, even as the national graduation rates reached a record high of 82 percent in 2013-14 (the latest year available). The gap in graduation rates between black and white males grew to 21 percentage points in 2012-13, the Schott Foundation for Public Education found—although federal data show a narrowing gap. South Carolina graduated just 51 percent of black males that year. Achievement for rural students has been mostly flat in the Obama years, the National Assessment of Educational progress, or NAEP, shows. Since 2007, rural students’ scores in reading and math for both 4th and 8th graders have either stayed the same or increased by an amount not considered statistically significant. Nationwide averages for all students in both reading and math have inched upward during the same period. “Teachers, we’re short of them. We have a lot of students in one class.” Daijuwan Smith, a senior at Dillon High School Under the new Every Student Succeeds Act, which replaces the NCLB, Congress must study possible changes to Title I, the provision that provides schools with billions of dollars for students from low-income families. Rural advocates have pushed for Title I changes for years, arguing that larger school systems see greater benefits because the distribution of funds is based too heavily on the number of students from low-income families rather than percentages of those students. The new ESSA law also requires the U.S. Department of Education to inventory its efforts to help rural schools.

The state has forced too much of school funding in rural districts “on the backs of those who just don’t make enough to pay more taxes,” said Rogers, who grew up here and worked at the Piggly Wiggly supermarket. “You can’t squeeze blood out of a turnip.” Although many families here are poor, Dillon sits alongside America’s busiest north-south highway. There are stores, fast food eateries and a few larger employers here. That makes it better off than many of the 36 rural districts that sued South Carolina in 1993 demanding more state funding. Their case is finally coming to a head. These photographs shows then-Senator Barack Obama’s 2007 visit to Dillon, South Carolina. Superintendent Ray Rogers gave the senator a tour. Later as president, Obama and his administration helped the town build a new middle school. Photo: Alan Richard Suburban schools in booming areas of the state offer dozens of AP courses and take-home technology for almost every student, but many rural districts have nothing of the kind, said Terry Peterson, senior adviser to former South Carolina Gov. Richard W. “Dick” Riley for 16 years when he was U.S. education secretary and two-term governor. In its final ruling in the case in late 2014, the South Carolina Supreme Court ordered the Legislature to fix rural “educational ghettos” across the state. Republican Gov. Nikki Haley appealed the court’s decision twice, but has proposed a $200 million-a-year package for school construction and home internet access in rural areas. This spring, lawmakers approved little new funding specifically for the rural districts; per pupil funding was raised by about $200, but the increase applies to all districts. ‘I could be one of those people’ $43,300 How much the average teacher made in Dillon in 2013-14, compared with more than $50,000 in the state’s more affluent districts. Jackie Hayes wears two tall hats in Dillon: He’s been the football coach for 24 years and also serves as a state legislator. The Dillon Wildcats have won four state football championships during his tenure, tying a state record. Dozens of his players have graduated to professional football. The Democrat credits his fellow lawmakers for adding $9 million in recent years for teacher recruitment and retention in poor school districts. “A lot of good, positive things are happening, but the thing is, you have to maintain that,” he said. To help build the new Dillon Middle School, local taxpayers approved a penny sales tax, and the Obama administration provided a $3 million grant and backing that allowed the district to borrow additional funding. Photo: Alan Richard Shawn Johnson just finished his fourth year as the first black principal at Dillon High School since desegregation. He has worked to make the school more rigorous and to provide students with more support. Test scores have risen: Dillon outperforms schools with similar poverty rates on the state’s end-of-course exams in all subjects; still, they’re below state averages on all end-of-course exams, and student-teacher ratios are high for this state at 30-to-1 compared with a 22-to-1 average in schools with similar demographics. At the new Dillon Middle School, eighth-graders in Teresa Stephens’ South Carolina history class looked to the future of their community. “On some things we get a good education,” said Alexus Davis, sitting with her class at long tables in the school’s media center. “I think we have very good teachers, especially in math,” said Riziki Nizevimana, whose family came to the U.S. from Tanzania. “I also think we need to bring art back to school,” added classmate Ashley Graves. Media specialist Marcia Bethea said the new school’s media center is nice, with good technology. But when the new building opened in 2015, the school district didn’t have enough money for her to order new library books. They need a lot more, she said. At the high school, students like the new dual-enrollment courses from the local community college. “They’re a good experience and they challenge us,” Junior Marniga Lewis said. “We have a lot of potential.” Remarking that President Obama’s eldest daughter, Malia, had just announced she will attend Harvard University in 2017 after taking a year to travel, junior Jermaine McDaniel said he’s glad just to be able to make football recruiting visits to Ivy League schools—and possibly attend one. “His daughter is going there,” Jermaine said. “I could be one of those people.” *Correction: This story has been updated with an accurate description of Bud Ferillo’s previous job, as a legislative aide.

NASA announced yesterday that it will partner with six private companies to refine deep space habitation solutions in advance of a possible Mars mission.  By Christina Beck, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. Boeing/NASA View Caption About video ads View Caption of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has its sights set far beyond the moon, toward the mysteries of deep space. NASA announced Tuesday that as its mission objectives expand to human exploration of deep space, including planned missions to an asteroid in 2025, and Mars by 2030, it is working together with six US companies to help develop deep space habitats to support human exploration. “NASA is increasingly embracing public-private partnerships to expand capabilities, and opportunities in space,” said director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems (AES), Jason Crusan, in a NASA press release when the program was first announced in 2015. “Our NextSTEP partners commit their own corporate resources toward the development – making them a true partner in the spaceflight economy.” Recommended: How well do you know the moon? Take our quiz! NASA announced NextSTEP in May, 2015 , in a Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) Broad Agency Announcement. NASA later selected 12 projects to help innovate deep space solutions, including advanced propulsion, habitation, and small satellite projects. Test your knowledge How well do you know the moon? Take our quiz! Infographic Space Race, The Sequel: Who is exploring the cosmos today? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Now, NASA has chosen six project proposals out of all the applications it received for the NextSTEP habitation project. It will be working with these six companies to innovate deep space habitation solutions in anticipation of a mission to Mars within the next few decades. The deep space habitats will be tested in an area near the moon, a “proving ground” before the planned mission to Mars, according to NASA scientists. Habitats will include features such as docking capabilities for spacecraft, life support systems, fire safety mechanisms, crew health capabilities, and radiation monitoring, among others, according to a NASA blog post. Once the habitats are constructed, NASA says, it will be able to test how the many systems involved (including airlocks, docking systems, etc.) function, and how they will function in deep space. Each of the six companies will work on a slightly different product. One of the most recognizable names, Boeing, has already worked on systems in use at the International Space System. The company says that it will use this experience to guide the creation of its habitat, which will include, “the production of a full-scale habitat that will provide design analysis and high-fidelity demonstration and test capability to simulate how humans can safely live and work in deep space for extended periods of time.” Lockheed Martin, another private company well known for its involvement in space technology innovation, plans to refurbish an existing multi-purpose logistics module. Orbital ATK also plans to work off an existing product, its initial cislunar habitat concept, based off the company’s Cygnus craft. Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems plans to modify its own Dream Chaser module and combine it with an inflatable fabric module and life support systems, while Bigelow Airspace LLC plans to develop a 330-cubic-meter inflatable habitat called the XBASE. According to NASA, “the testing conducted on this platform will advance approaches for deep space missions and serve as a basis for commercialization in low-Earth orbit.” Finally, lesser known Texas company NanoRacks plans to modify an existing launch vehicle’s second stage to convert into a habitat, which it says could be a low cost habitat solution. NASA says that these habitat plans will help inform the space agency’s approach to planned deep space explorations. “The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment utilizing SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles,” wrote NASA in a blog post. “In addition to U.S. Industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable a robust fully operational deep space habitation capability."

At Large In Ballard: Finished Lives 08/11/2016 It’s the stories. For the final stage of Ballard Historical Society’s Mapping Historic Ballard project volunteers have researched and provided background material on just 150 properties out of hundreds with historic value. I volunteered as one of 15 researchers to do a single one. Flash forward three months (two since targeted completion) and it’s down to Sue Cromarty, mapper and researcher extraordinaire, and me. We are hooked on piecing together lives. I’ve always loved crossword puzzles and acrostics. Trying to fit together the clues assembled by the volunteers who scanned and uploaded all the property cards and photographs is rewarded by what they reveal: the lives, loves and losses of those who lived in the apartment above the corner grocery, the Mench house, the pharmacy that was replaced by the telephone exchange building. I was hooked on my first property, the Grankull’s home on NW 70th. While turning over clues like game cards…fee owner on the side sewer card, name on the census with address, I learned the death card is usually first. Once I’d matched a resident to an obituary I worked backwards to birth of children, marriage, engagement, drunk driving (mostly confined to fishermen who boarded where I live now), resident by resident, owner by owner. Plying the Seattle Public Library’s special collections I did all my sleuthing from home, blowing up census pages and city directories, submitting and re-submitting variations of street names and possible residents to the 1895-present archives of the Seattle (Daily) Times. I found valor in Donald Billington of 7042 18th NW, stationed aboard the Pennsylvania at Pearl Harbor who served 25 months in the South Pacific. Forty years later the homeowner was a Seattle teacher on strike. I tracked children from birth to fishing derbies, through graduation and marriage. I read of service pins awarded for 50 years of service, to the city, to a bank, to a business. There was an invalid wife and a brother who died while waiting for the bus to work. Always the community club elections, the decorating contests, the Elks and the Odd Fellows. Photographers in a dark room hold their paper in a chemical bath waiting for images to appear. That’s what it’s like hoping a square preview will surface on a blank screen meaning the combination of name and address has yielded a result. Then waiting as whatever magic exists between our homes and scanned, old newsprint takes form in front of me, peering at the tiny print to see if it’s just a false lead, a Nelson born too soon or too late. Finding Percy C. Sankey, Ballard merchant, helping to avert a garbage strike and his son Percy D. working for the City of Seattle for 46 years. Obsession is the only word. Ignoring the clock I feel that I have to knit the family back together before I can go to bed. Who was Mrs. Betty Cox who suddenly appeared in the household? Ah, it’s the daughter Elizabeth married at 19, divorced at 22, later remarried and in her own home. There’s her father’s long service as a railway man and mention of his collection of train photographs. Am I trying to drown out today’s news by reading the articles that flank those written in 1920, 1945, 1966? I look at grainy wedding photos and download an obituary that tickles my fancy with the headline, “Former Writer…” Friends bought a house in West Seattle and feeling like a magician, a librarian wannabe, I found part of their first home’s past, a mountain-climbing man, President of the Seattle Outdoors Good Manners Association. He railed against thoughtless hikers in a newspaper story titled, “Wreckreationists.” They want to frame the article. An archeologist without dirt, a genealogist for families I’ve never met. I may be the last to finish but so many other volunteers have been winding their way through Ballard’s past as well, watching the sons and daughters marry and move closer to Boeing, south to Renton and north to Everett. Making new of the old is very satisfying. Volunteer Mia Hannula ventured to the downtown construction files and emerged with a French Canadian widow whose daughter Valencia married Lem Fong Chin. Valencia was herself widowed and later remarried, but she lived on 19th NW for 50 years of her adult life, first with her mother and siblings, and then her husband and children. I started with Arthur and Hilda Grankull, both from Finland who lived on Seaview and then moved up to a new corner home on 70th NW in 1930. They were in their home 50 years, until their deaths. I want to award them 50-year pins. So when I found a family who lived around the corner, a Norwegian (Cornelius) married to a Swede (Hannah), I reveled in the names of the four Asmervig daughters, Mathilda, Eugenia, Selma and Delia. Mathilda married Chester Walling, who’d served in World War I. Their entire married life, during his 46 years with Seattle Transit and on into retirement they lived in a beautiful home near Sunset Hill Park. After their deaths her sister Mrs. Eugenia Roo was the one who sold the home to its current, and only second owners. This strikes me as a happy ending to finished lives, which may be at the root of any present, and former, writer’s obsession.

News.Az — Your Window to the Region Wednesday, Nov 23, 2016 Search iPhone Twitter Facebook RSS Mobile Archive About Politics Economy Society Sports Culture Interviews Karabakh Commentary World Photos NASA selects six U.S. companies to held advance Journey to Mars Thu 11 August 2016 05:40 GMT | 09:40 Local Time Text size: NASA has selected six U.S. companies to help advance the Journey to Mars by developing ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, Appendix A, NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions, NASA's official website reported. The selected companies are: Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas Boeing of Pasadena, Texas Lockheed Martin of Denver Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado NanoRacks of Webster, Texas Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our Journey to Mars.  “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The contract award amounts are dependent on contract negotiations, and NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK.  This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects, such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment using SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles. In addition to U.S. industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable fully operational deep space habitation capability. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. AES is pioneering innovative approaches and public-private partnerships to rapidly develop prototype systems, advance key capabilities, and validate operational concepts for future human missions beyond Earth orbit.

  News Magazines Media Industry Directory Events Products   Home >> News: August 11th, 2016 >> Story Satnews Daily August 11th, 2016 Prepping For The Push Continues For Arianespace Flight VA232 Preparations continue for Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 and their launch to orbit by Arianespace aboard an Ariane 5 on August 4th. These two satellites are advancing through their payload preparation phases during parallel activity at the Spaceport in French Guiana. Designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace's numbering system, this will be the company's sixth launch to be performed in 2016 as well as the fourth this year using a heavy-lift Ariane 5. Arianespace's full launcher family is rounded out by the medium-weight Soyuz and light-lift Vega. The latest payload preparations for Ariane 5’s Flight VA232 are captured above. In the photo at left, Intelsat 33e is shown being lowered for integration atop the SYLDA dual-passenger dispenser system; while at right, the Intelsat 36 co-passenger is “topped off” with its onboard propellant. Photos are courtesy of Arianespace. Intelsat 33e—the first of the two payloads to arrive in French Guiana—has completed initial checkout and, during preparations that have been successfully completed, the satellite was installed on the launch vehicle's SYLDA dual-passenger dispenser system. The latter step was performed in the Spaceport's Final Assembly Building and positions Intelsat 33e for the upper slot of Ariane 5's payload arrangement. As the second spacecraft of the nexgen Intelsat EpicNG series, Intelsat 33e—which was produced by Boeing—integrates one of the most advanced commercially-available digital payloads in the world. The first Intelsat EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e, was successfully delivered to geostationary transfer orbit on an Ariane 5 mission performed in January. Flight VA232's Intelsat 36 co-passenger also marked an important pre-launch milestone with the loading of the onboard propellant. This event occurred in the S5A hall of the Spaceport's S5 payload preparation facility. Following the satellite's upcoming transfer to the Final Assembly Building, Intelsat 36 will be integrated as the August 24 mission's lower payload. Built by SSL (Space Systems Loral), Intelsat 36 will enhance Intelsat's premier DTH neighborhood in Africa after reaching the final orbital position. www.arianespace.com Topical Tags :  Events    Launch    Satellite Operator    Service Provider          Regional Tags :  Europe    South/Central America                 FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News SWOT's Up With NASA & SpaceX?

January 28th 2016 10 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Travel/ There’ll be no excuses for ignoring emails in flight when Qantas rolls out high speed Wi-Fi next year. Picture: Qantas Airways Robyn IronsideNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend QANTAS has high hopes for its high-speed Wi-Fi when it’s connected later this year, promising it will lead to less turbulence, fewer medical diversions and no more missed connections. And the Flying Kangaroo has reiterated its undertaking that the service will be free for all passengers — becoming one of the first airlines to do so. In addition to allowing travellers to stream live sports, send emails and update social media, the high-speed Wi-Fi will allow pilots to get real-time weather info for flight routes that will assist in avoiding turbulence. Next step. On-board Wi-Fi will allow Qantas pilots to get real-time weather data on flight routes. Picture: Brett WinstoneSource:Supplied Other benefits of the on-board internet include the ability to conduct electronic heart scans on patients who fall ill, and send the data by Wi-Fi to medical officers on the ground. “This will provide a better diagnosis of the passenger which then informs flight crew whether they need to divert to another airport, or if the passenger is stable enough to be treated upon landing at the original destination,” said a Qantas spokesman. Maintenance delays should also be minimised because information generated by the engines can be assessed while the aircraft is in flight. “Pilots are alerted to anything important but a lot of other data can’t really be assessed until the aircraft is on the ground,” the spokesman said. “By streaming this information back to base via the internet, our engineers can closely monitor the technical performance of the aircraft and be ready if something needs attention.” Useful. Electronic devices will provide a range of benefits for passengers when Qantas enables on-board Wi-Fi. Picture: ThinkStockSource:ThinkStock The problem of flight delays resulting in missed connections should be another problem solved by in-flight Wi-Fi, said the spokesman. “We have a team inside our Integrated Operations Centre that looks after rebooking passengers when this happens, but you often can’t get this information until you land,” he said. “With on-board Wi-Fi, we’re looking at sending passengers an updated itinerary in-flight so that they have more certainty and can make any other arrangements ahead of time.” About 100 Boeing 737s and Airbus A330s will be fitted with the technology from early-2017 after a trial on-board a single 737 later this year. Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has promised speeds up to ten times faster than conventional on-board Wi-Fi thanks to a model that taps into the NBN network. “This service will give Qantas customers download speeds in the air similar to what they’re used to on the ground,” Mr Joyce said. Virgin Australia is also planning the rollout of in-flight Wi-Fi next year but has released few other details other than it will be a ‘”seamless, next Generation experience” for passengers.

U.S.-supported Saudi Arabian and other bombing of Yemeni sites, including the capital, Sana, resumed Tuesday, with lethal results. The multiparty Yemen civil war, with substantial international involvement, has continued for 15 months now, with thousands of casualties from the fighting and particularly the bombing, but also taking a high toll among the civilians of this poorest of Middle Eastern states. It pits Houthi Shiite Muslim rebels, backed to a degree by predominantly Shiite Iran, supported by Sunni Muslim supporters of the former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, against the Sunni Muslim government of Yemen President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Sunni states of the Persian Gulf. These are led by Saudi Arabia and include Bahrain, Egypt, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates. What the list leaves out is that the United States provides technical and intelligence support to the Sunni side, based in part on the fact that the air forces of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states were largely sold to them by American companies, including McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. It is unlikely that Saudi Arabia could put these warplanes in the air to bomb Yemen without substantial U.S. assistance. Washington declines to say whether there are ever U.S. co-pilots in the aircraft. There were peace talks involving the parties to the conflict under the auspices of the United Nations underway in Kuwait for the past nine weeks, but these have now collapsed, without success, at least for the moment. The United States has not promoted the talks, reflecting Saudi lack of enthusiasm for an end to the conflict without victory for its side. This approach to a brutal intra-Islamic war is an unacceptable policy position for the United States to take. President Barack Obama should weigh in with a strong initiative to resume the Yemen peace talks on an urgent basis and to pursue them to a successful close, for humanitarian as well as political reasons. If the Saudis are perceived to be dragging their feet, Washington should threaten to cut off U.S. support of their bombing in Yemen.  Commercial commitments do not provide a sufficient argument for the perpetuation of the war and the continued killing of Yemenis through U.S.-supported bombing.

The FAA has been open to granting permits to private companies to travel into space for several years now. NASA has been working with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to deliver supplies to the space station. NASA is also working in conjunction with SpaceX to facilitate the exploration and colonization of Mars. Musk has a goal to take humans to live on Mars in about ten years. It is hoped that cooperation between various corporations and NASA will lead to the colonization of Mars by 2025. NASA is building partnerships with several commercial industry corporations including ULA Orbital/ATK and many others through programs called NextSTEP and NextSTEP 2, in order to advance the rapid development of propulsion, habitats, satellites and more. Selected companies are working in partnership with NASA, developing the technology needed for mankind to probe deep space. They will be focusing on both Mars and the space around the moon. Elon Musk of SpaceX has the goal of beginning the colonization of Mars in the next decade. He plans to make commercial space travel and colonization a reality in his lifetime, according to The Washington Post. Mr. Musk is the mastermind behind both Tesla and SpaceX. He is one of the most brilliant minds of our time. An innovator and businessman, Elon has a track record of making dreams a reality and turning his plans into tangible results. Comparing his project to the colonization of America, Mr. Musk explains why he thinks people will agree to move to mars. “The months-long journey is sure to be hard, risky, dangerous, difficult, [but] just as with the establishment of the English colonies, there are people who love that. They want to be the pioneers.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ndpxuf-uJHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Commercial space travel with the goal of eventual colonization of Mars is being facilitated by Elon Musk, SpaceX and a variety of companies under NASA’s NextSTEP program. The project allows NASA to combine their own efforts with teamwork and delegation to private companies who are committed to their mutual goal of transporting potential pioneers to Mars. Companies working through the NextSTEP program are partnering with NASA to build actual size, on the ground habitats and test them for safety. This private and public partnership allows various corporations to develop different aspects of different projects with the common goal of deep space exploration and colonization. The six prototypes will be developed by six different companies including Boeing. They will be responsible for design analysis, demonstration, and testing according to The Te Cake. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pPlYpbSMFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Commercial space travel, including travel, transport, and colonization under the NextSTEP program, is a cooperative effort. The companies signed on through the NextSTEP corporation, are working on projects intended to facilitate the development of extraplanetary travel technology quickly and efficiently according to NASA. The human race will no longer be earthbound, and they will have corporations to thank for designing these projects. Not all the projects are similar. Lockheed Martin worked to build new parts for the ISS. The space shuttle transported these parts to the ISS. The Sierra Nevada Corporation is working on inflatable fabric space habitat components to attach to interplanetary travel vehicles. NASA and NextSTEP partner Orbital ATK is working to make launch vehicles more comfortable for long term habitation, while Texas-based NanoRacks will be responsible for conducting a feasibility study, involving the conversion of an existing launch vehicle’s upper stage, which is the propellant segment, into a pressurized inhabitable volume, or livable area, in space. Space X [Photo by NASA/Getty Images]Commercial space travel including exploration, transportation, and colonization through NextSTEP is being managed by NASA under the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. The purpose is stated to be the building of prototypes. These prototypes are being designed to make the habitation of Mars and perhaps eventually other planets possible. These are vital when SpaceX takes human beings off the Earth and onto another planet for the first time. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is preparing for a launch their Falcon 9, which will launch the JCSAT-16 satellite into space, according to NASA Space Flight. This latest Falcon 9 is tasked with lofting the JCSAT-16 satellite into its Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GEO) on August 14, once again involving the first stage making a landing attempt on the drone ship. Elon wants to develop spacecraft that are reusable, rather than waste all the parts, on every trip. This would make travel to another planet more affordable. Ultimately, though, Mr. Musk’s goal is to colonize Mars. Part of Elon’s plan is affordability. He wants ordinary people to be able to afford to travel to Mars if they want to move there.

At present, SpiceJet has a fleet of 42 aircraft and over 100 on order. The airline said it will save nearly 25% on the maintenance costs. Most of the airlines take their aircraft to foreign countries for maintenance, repairs and overhaul (MRO) activities due to lack of facilities and high taxation in India. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows it costs about Rs 24 lakh on just on fuel to service an aircraft at Abu Dhabi, the largest MRO near Mumbai, apart from other charges such as navigation, payment to crew. The agreement between SpiceJet and AIESL's was signed at newly-constructed MRO facility set up at the cost of over Rs 600 crore at Mihan in Nagpur. "It is a strategic tie-up with SpiceJet," said H R Jagannathan, CEO, AIESL. Arun Kashyap, head of engineering & maintenance, AIESL, said, "The MRO services by Air India are a national asset and we should use it in the interest of the nation." Apart from Air India and its other subsidiary airlines, Air India Express and Alliance Air, other airlines including Jet Airways and GoAir have started doing maintenance works with AIESL. The MRO unit is also in talks with IndiGo and other domestic and international carriers for business, the officials said. It is also seeking work from Indian Air Force for its IL76 and AN32 aircraft, which has a base in Nagpur. According to an estimate, the civil and military MRO industry is pegged at about $2 billion, which is on the threshold of growth, especially after recent policy changes that gave several concessions to the industry to pep up growth. The MRO facility at Nagpur, set up by aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing, was handed over to Air India as part of its multi-billion dollar 113 aircraft purchase deal. The facilities has been built over 50 acre of land inside the Special Economic Zone of Mihan. " Around the world airline's primary job is to make passengers and cargo travel from point to point and they are more than happy to outsource their plane's maintenance and overhauling work. We intend to tap that market in India by approaching the airlines. The regional connectivity, as new aviation policy has also opened a huge scope for us," Jagannathan said.

Veteran of the Week Lew McCreary� STANLEY EARL CORNWELL, Dobbin, Texas Born the son of an oilfield roughneck, in Brownwood, Stan is 73 years old. Before entering the service he married his high school sweetheart Sandra and they began raising three children together. He received his draft notice in 1964 and joined the USAF experiencing twelve weeks of boot camp at Lackland AFB in San Antoniothen to Wichita Falls training as helicopter mechanic. In 65 he relocated to the NAS at El Centro, CA. He tested out very well becoming crew chief on a T-28 trainer. By late that year he was flown a very roundabout way to Tan So Nut AFB Vietnam as an E-3, becoming helicopter mechanic (E-4) and returned home after his one year obligation as A/1. His daily routine in Vietnam was flying missions just about everywhere as they had adopted the slogan You call and we haul aboard their sturdy twin turbine engine CH3C heavy lift chopper that Stan maintained in working order. They routinely dodged ground fire but their closest scrape and only slight injury was on the ground due to incoming mortar fire. Fortunately they were not in their chopper that sustained damages. The crew received bruises caused by flying debris. Stan had top secret clearance because of occasional trips to Laos and Cambodia. One mission (Laos) was collecting dirt samples to be examined for future US bombing strategies. On other occasions they inserted and retrieved three man sniper teams during 20 minute rendezvous using predetermined coordinates and lots of stealth. Stan returned to Patrick AFB in Florida becoming a flight engineer and loadmaster. During one Atlantic Ocean assignment they made an emergency landing on a storm tossed destroyer to pick up an injured sailor as the seas tossed the vessel around violently. His most memorable assignment was during the launching of missiles from a Polaris submarine for telemetry and salvage purposes. They carried frogmen to help recover 20 foot missile antennas that were designed to float temporarily before sinking. They successfully captured the first but the second sank. The salvaged antenna was to be secured to their choppers chain hoist and cable. Stan was lowered on a lanyard to help secure it to their helicopter and safely make the trip back to base. There was significant risk but fortunately he was not bumped very seriously and injured during the ordeal of securing their cargo to the helicopter. Another exciting assignment occurred during the Apollo Program series and the Saturn booster. Their mission was precautionary in case the capsule needed to be sprayed with water to cool it offbut mainly to gather up the crew should the launch be aborted. Stan spent 67-68 at Patrick AFB and was then discharged. Unfortunately there were multiple exposures to Agent Orange during his Vietnam tour and by 2004 he developed as cancerous prostate that was surgically removed. Symptoms returned in 2009 and radiation treatments were necessary. At that time he received a military disability. As a civilian he spent time working for LTV, Boeing Aircraft and Bell Helicopters. Next he utilized his G.I. Bill to secure an industrial engineering degree at West Texas State University. He then spent employment opportunities with Schlumberger and Texas Oil and Gas, both in Conroeas well as 15 years with Reed Roller Bit and the next 15 at Time Manufacturing in Waco. Stan retired from the business world in 2008 and settled in Dobbin. What advice would he give to graduating seniors? If you dont have the funds for college, join the military and let them teach you skills for industry. His current hobbies are enjoying the plethora of nature located near their homebut during more serious moments he built a Shelby Cobra hot rod automobile and also refurbished a 68 Thunderbird. A long time Christian and stalwart Cowboy Church member, the Cornwells can be observed most Sundays at church in Montgomery. A very recent newcomer to the Poplar Business Park veteran gatherings, Stan pledges to return soon. Sitemap { Newspaper Template by bulletlink.com }

Under the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) program, NASA officials selected six U.S. companies to develop deep space habitat ground prototypes and concepts. NASA estimates the combined total of all contracts covering work in 2016 and 2017 will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. The NextSTEP-2 program, consisting of NASA and industry partners, aims to expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit (LEO), and at the same time improve deep space exploration capabilities. The goals of the ground prototypes are to support integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will leverage commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions. The six companies selected are: Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas; Boeing in Pasadena, Texas; Lockheed Martin in Denver; Orbital ATK in Dulles, Virginia; Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems in Louisville, Colorado; and NanoRacks in Webster, Texas. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. Officials say, these missions will demonstrate human, robotic, and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that’s still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors,” says Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The first round of selected companies consists of Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Orbital ATK. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities.

Patel Space Travel August 10, 2016 On Tuesday, NASA announced it had finally selected six companies to build deep space habitat prototypes for ground testing as part of the overall effort to expand human space and habitation throughout cis-lunar space and advancing technologies that will be critical for sending astronauts to Mars by 2040. The announcement comes just a few months after NASA put out a call for design proposals to the private spaceflight industry. The agency was likely spurred by instructions from Congress to provide a report within the first half of the year to explain how federal funds would be used to build and test a deep space habitation model. NASA has clearly missed that deadline, but it looks like it’s still shooting to have an operational prototype ready for ground testing by 2018. The six selections are part of NASA’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 program, or NextSTEP-2, which is meant to forge public-private partnerships between NASA and commercial companies to advance future space exploration. NASA’s “habitation strategy” is focused on two goals: allowing humans to survive up to 1,000 days in space inside a single module in order to make deep space travel and duration possible, and turning over low Earth orbit operations and development to the commercial industry. In commissioning these prototypes through NextSTEP-2, NASA wants to kill two birds with one stone. Already, the agency has seen a successful delivery and installation of BEAM — Bigelow Aerospace’s expandable module — up on the International Space Station. The technology behind expandable structures like BEAM could be a cost-effective and easy way to launch space habitats and get them up and running in no time. Bigelow is building a follow-up prototype as part of its selection for NextSTEP-2. As the only company on the list which has launched and is currently testing technology related to deep space habitation, it is already ahead of the game. In fact, Bigelow hopes to build and launch a 12,000 cubic foot habitat into space by 2020. The company has some stiff competition in its way. Here are the six selected companies for NextSTEP-2, and the designs they’re working on right now. Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. Boeing This full-scale habitat design works off of the construction and on-orbit assembly of the ISS, for which Boeing has been heavily involved with during the entire 16-year operational station lifetime. You can perhaps think of it as the spiritual successor of the ISS. Concept image of Lockheed Martin's refurbished multi-purpose logistics module prototype Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin’s prototype is actually a refurbished multi-purpose module that is similar to the cargo hulls the space shuttles used to lug supplies to and from the ISS. The company is turning this design into a testbed for habitation technologies. If it ain’t broke, recycle it. Concept image of Bigelow Aerospace's XBASE docked to the International Space Station. Bigelow Aerospace The company’s expandable XBASE (Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement) design is the successor to BEAM. It’s the same size as the B-330 (330 cubic meters) expandable spacecraft design — but whereas that spacecraft is intended for low-Earth orbit commercialization, XBASE is focused on facilitating deep space habitation. Concept image of Orbital ATK's cislunar habitat based, based on the design of the Cygnus spacecraft. Orbital ATK Orbital actually showed this design off a couple of months ago, saying they imagined it as a lunar orbit outpost tat could actually dock with NASA’s deep-space Orion crew capsule. This cislunar habitat concept is based off the Cygnus spacecraft currently used for some ISS resupply missions. Concept image of Sierra Nevada Corporation's habitation prototype, based on its Dream Chaser cargo module. Sierra Nevada Corporation SNC essentially wants to build a version of its Dream Chaser spacecraft that can fly into deep space. Concept image representing the feasibility study that NanoRacks will conduct related to converting a launch vehicle's upper stage into a habitable volume. NanoRacks A collaboration with Space Systems Loral and United Launch Alliance, this design will look to convert the upper stage of a typical launch system into a pressurized space habitat. This would be an incredible way to make the launch of deep space modules cheaper.

Nasa has selected six companies to develop prototypes and concepts of deep space habitats for future manned missions to Mars. Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our journey to Mars, Nasa said. “Nasa is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the journey to Mars, and we’re utilising the innovation, skill and knowledge of the both the government and private sectors,” said Jason Crusan, director of Nasa’s Advanced Exploration Systems, adding, “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation's Space Systems and NanoRacks. The six partners will have up to about 24 months to develop prototypes and conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. Nasa has estimated that the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be about $65 million. The ground prototypes will be used for three main purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are part of a phased approach that will catalyse commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions such as to Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment that is still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars.

Now comes the hard part: Finding qualified flight controllers to operate it. Designed by HOK, the same firm that drafted Apple Inc’s research headquarters in California, the tower will be operational in about six months. Yet, it may struggle to handle more flights without enough controllers, according to aviation officials. The nation’s busiest airport needs 600 of the technicians ideally for stable operations, but employs only 360, the officials say. The shortfall has meant existing ATCs (air traffic controllers) are overworked. “It is a huge safety hazard,” said Mr Mohan Ranganathan, a former commercial pilot and an independent aviation safety consultant based in the southern Indian city of Chennai. “The air traffic controllers are being flogged in violation of fatigue rules.” The dearth of talent is threatening to reach crisis proportions as a slew of budget carriers unveil plans to add hundreds of aircraft to cater to the travel boom fuelled by rising incomes and lower fares. Adding to the challenge is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious programmes to connect smaller towns and villages by air. The situation came to a head when the United States Federal Aviation Administration downgraded India’s aviation safety rating in 2014, concluding the nation could not find enough officials to ensure the safe operation of flights. The US regulator said India’s oversight processes did not meet global standards, putting the country on par with Zimbabwe. The ranking was restored a year later after some corrective action to address shortcomings. Even so, the air-traffic controller shortage will only intensify in the coming years as local carriers buy more planes. Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 aircraft valued at US$265 billion over the next two decades. At least 709 planes are already on order. Go Airlines India said it will buy 72 A320neos from Airbus. SpiceJet is in talks for 150 aircraft and IndiGo, the nation’s biggest carrier, has ordered 430 Airbus narrow-body jets on top of more than the 100 it already flies. “There is a huge disconnect between what is required in terms of infrastructure, both physical and manpower, and what is being planned,” said Mr Kapil Kaul, South Asia CEO for Sydney-based Capa Centre for Aviation. “We are heading towards a serious infrastructure shortage but choose to ignore reality.” A new aviation policy unveiled in June by Mr Modi is also fuelling carriers’ expansion plans. In the making for more than a decade, it aims to revive hundreds of unused Indian airports, and provide subsidy to airlines that fly to remote areas. More routes, more planes mean more controllers. The problem is not just limited to India. By 2030, the world will need another 40,000 air traffic controllers to handle flights, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Icao). Yet, there are so few training facilities in Asia — the fastest-growing travel market — that the region will have a deficit of more than 1,000 controllers each year, Icao said. The Indian government is in the process of hiring as many as 600 air traffic controllers, who will be trained at three facilities across the country, but only about 60 will be deployed in New Delhi, according to airport officials. The new policy has a passing mention of an intention to set up a “world-class training centre” for local and overseas air traffic officials. It still has no clear and well thought out strategy to build skills and capabilities, according to Capa.

Concept art of a deep space habitat. Photo credit: NASA 10 Aug 2016 at 17:01, Katyanna Quach Katyanna Quach Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Recent Articles Apple allowed to put up bit barn in the Fields of Athenry Hey, turn down that radio, it's alien season and we're hunting aliens Ten-trillionths of your suntan comes from intergalactic photons Living in space is about to get a lot more cushty as NASA invests $65m to be shared between six companies chosen to design and develop deep space habitats. The collaboration between NASA and private companies is part of the space agency’s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) set up to advance human space flight missions. But, the chance to enter to space won’t just be limited to just trained astronauts, NASA hinted. Jason Crusan, director of advanced exploration systems at NASA, said the NextSTEP partnerships were not just to advance deep space habitation development, but also for “stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit.” In order for deep space habitats to be effective for human habitation, NASA lists several requirements, including: a pressurized container; a docking capability; environmental control; life support systems; crew health capabilities; fire safety technologies; logistics management; and radiation mitigation and monitoring. The six companies will have approximately two years to develop ground prototypes and will be subjected to systems and operations testing in order to define design standards. The six chosen American aerospace technology companies are: Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems and NanoRacks. NASA’s push for deep space habitats is part of its obsession with the idea of life beyond Earth – their ultimate goal is to eventually send humans to Mars. NASA announced its Journey to Mars mission in 2010 and it starts of small; to live on an asteroid by 2025 and then the Red Planet by the 2030s. Videos and images from the propulsion tests into the Space Launch System were released this week. Space geeks worldwide marvelled in the massive flames bellowing from the rocket’s exhausts. The SLS will be the most powerful rocket to be built by NASA, and will be used to propel the Orion Spacecraft – which NASA says will take humans farther than they’ve ever gone before. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 36 Comments More from The Register NASA opens ISS to private sector modules The plan is to to build wider experience useful for Izzy's successor 17 Comments Jovial NASA says Juno flyby a success Downloads will take days 22 Comments NASA spools up ultra-high def aurora movie Illuminating 4K timelapse shot from ISS 10 Comments By Juno!

Army-technology.com wraps up key headlines from July. Military coup attempt to oust government fails in Turkey The Turkish Armed Forces' violent attempt to take control of the country by suspending the constitution failed. At least 290 people were killed and more than 1,000 were injured as a result of the 48-hour coup, from 15 to 16 July. The coup attempt failed after the military-imposed curfew was strongly opposed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's supporters. 84 people killed in truck attack in Nice, France A gunman reportedly linked to a militant group drove a truck into a crowd in Nice, France, killing nearly 84 people and injuring more than 50. The ‘terror attack’ occurred during the Bastille Day fireworks at the Promenade des Anglais on Thursday. The driver was shot dead by the police and the truck he was driving contained weapons and grenades, according to media sources. Nato to invest €3bn in defence technology until 2019 The Nato Communication and Information (NCI) Agency planned to invest €3bn in defence technology until 2019. The planned investments were expected to bolster Nato's cyber and air defence, satellite communications and response forces, as well as command and control for complex multinational operations. The agency will award contracts for the procurement of cyber, air and missile defence systems, as well as advanced software products. UK to lift ban on women in ground close combat roles The UK was set to lift ban on women serving in ground close combat roles in the British Armed Forces from 2016. Female soldiers will be allowed to join certain units of the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) from November.  Women will be able to apply for combat roles in a phased approach over the next three years. UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: "Women have already given exemplary service in recent conflicts, working in a variety of highly specialised and vital roles. By opening all combat roles to women, we will continue to build on these successes and improve the operational capability of our military." US and ROK to deploy THAAD system to counter North Korean missile threats The US and the Republic of Korea (ROK) joined forces to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. The THAAD system will be deployed to ROK to counter missile threats from North Korea. The decision on the THAAD deployment was based on the recommendations made by ROK Defence Minister Han, Min Gu and US Forces Korea commander general Vincent K Brooks, and approved by the ROK and US Governments. US to deploy more troops to support ISIS combat mission in Iraq US Defence Secretary Ash Carter announced the deployment of additional troops to support Iraqi forces in the fight against ISIS. According to Carter, 560 more personnel will be sent to Iraq to help local forces that aim to free Mosul from ISIS. The latest deployment will bring the number of US personnel in Iraq to more than 4,650, the BBC reported. The troops were expected to provide support in areas such as infrastructure and logistics at an airfield near Qayyarah. North Korea test-fires three ballistic missiles South Korea's Joint Chiefs Of Staff (JCS) reported that North Korea launched three ballistic missiles off its eastern coast. The JCS claimed the country had fired the missiles from an area near Hwangju region and they flew between 500km and 600km into the sea, media sources reported. The US military said that the latest launches involved two Scud missiles and one Rodong, Reuters reported. Boeing to supply 50 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters to British Army Boeing was to supply 50 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters to the British Army, as part of a $2.3bn deal between the US and UK governments. To be flown by Army Air Corps pilots from the Joint Helicopter Command, the new fleet of Apaches can carry more weapons and use fuel more efficiently than their predecessors. The first batch of helicopters was expected to be produced by 2020, and entered into service with the British Army in 2022. Otokar wins €106.1m contract to deliver COBRA II armoured vehicles Otokar was contracted to supply COBRA II tactical wheeled armoured vehicles to the Turkish security forces. The €106.1m order included COBRA II 4x4 tactical wheeled armoured vehicles, as well as maintenance and support systems. Otokar general manager Serdar Gorguc said: "Last year we were awarded the first two orders for Cobra II that we designed at Otokar with our own intellectual property rights and specifically against increasing threats. "Armed with our engineering capabilities and R&D strength, we will keep on providing state-of-the-art solutions for our users." BAE Systems to produce 32 BvS10 all-terrain vehicles for Austrian Army BAE Systems received a contract to build 32 armoured personnel carrier variant of the BvS10 military all-terrain vehicles for the Austrian Army. To be carried out under a government-to-government arrangement with Sweden, the contract will benefit Austria's mission in the European Union Mountain Training Warfare Initiative (EU MTI), which aims to enhance military effectiveness in mountainous terrains.

NASA announced yesterday that it will partner with six private companies to refine deep space habitation solutions in advance of a possible Mars mission.  By Christina Beck, Staff August 10, 2016 Save for later Saved Concept image of Boeing's prototype habitation module. Boeing/NASA View Caption About video ads View Caption of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has its sights set far beyond the moon, toward the mysteries of deep space. NASA announced Tuesday that as its mission objectives expand to human exploration of deep space, including planned missions to an asteroid in 2025, and Mars by 2030, it is working together with six US companies to help develop deep space habitats to support human exploration. “NASA is increasingly embracing public-private partnerships to expand capabilities, and opportunities in space,” said director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems (AES), Jason Crusan, in a NASA press release when the program was first announced in 2015. “Our NextSTEP partners commit their own corporate resources toward the development – making them a true partner in the spaceflight economy.” Recommended: How well do you know the moon? Take our quiz! NASA announced NextSTEP in May, 2015 , in a Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) Broad Agency Announcement. NASA later selected 12 projects to help innovate deep space solutions, including advanced propulsion, habitation, and small satellite projects. Test your knowledge How well do you know the moon? Take our quiz! Infographic Space Race, The Sequel: Who is exploring the cosmos today? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Now, NASA has chosen six project proposals out of all the applications it received for the NextSTEP habitation project. It will be working with these six companies to innovate deep space habitation solutions in anticipation of a mission to Mars within the next few decades. The deep space habitats will be tested in an area near the moon, a “proving ground” before the planned mission to Mars, according to NASA scientists. Habitats will include features such as docking capabilities for spacecraft, life support systems, fire safety mechanisms, crew health capabilities, and radiation monitoring, among others, according to a NASA blog post. Once the habitats are constructed, NASA says, it will be able to test how the many systems involved (including airlocks, docking systems, etc.) function, and how they will function in deep space. Each of the six companies will work on a slightly different product. One of the most recognizable names, Boeing, has already worked on systems in use at the International Space System. The company says that it will use this experience to guide the creation of its habitat, which will include, “the production of a full-scale habitat that will provide design analysis and high-fidelity demonstration and test capability to simulate how humans can safely live and work in deep space for extended periods of time.” Lockheed Martin, another private company well known for its involvement in space technology innovation, plans to refurbish an existing multi-purpose logistics module. Orbital ATK also plans to work off an existing product, its initial cislunar habitat concept, based off the company’s Cygnus craft. Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems plans to modify its own Dream Chaser module and combine it with an inflatable fabric module and life support systems, while Bigelow Airspace LLC plans to develop a 330-cubic-meter inflatable habitat called the XBASE. According to NASA, “the testing conducted on this platform will advance approaches for deep space missions and serve as a basis for commercialization in low-Earth orbit.” Finally, lesser known Texas company NanoRacks plans to modify an existing launch vehicle’s second stage to convert into a habitat, which it says could be a low cost habitat solution. NASA says that these habitat plans will help inform the space agency’s approach to planned deep space explorations. “The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment utilizing SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles,” wrote NASA in a blog post. “In addition to U.S. Industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable a robust fully operational deep space habitation capability."

The Boeing 737-800 came down in poor weather as it sought to land on March 19 killing all 55 passengers and seven crew. Aristos Socratous was the pilot of the FlyDubai jet which crashed in Russia, killing all 62 people on board Russian Emergency Ministry employees investigate the wreckage of a crashed plane at the Rostov-on-Don airport, about 600 miles south of Moscow, Russia on Sunday Until now, theories for the crash have included pilot error, crew exhaustion or technical problems, and these continue to be investigated. Earlier this year, a Russian media outlet reported that he had resigned due to an unbearable schedule - and that the flight was due to be one of his last.  Now, says Interfax news agency, the probe is also examining whether 'deliberate actions of the pilot might have caused the crash' of Flight FZ 981 from Dubai. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The final selfie: Passenger aboard doomed FlyDubai flight... Two pilots flying doomed FlyDubai jet which crashed in... 'Is the weather better?' The last words of the doomed pilot... Revealed: Russia jet crash pilot was on his last flight... Share this article Share 137 shares An anonymous source was quoted as saying: 'A preliminary inquiry has determined that the Boeing 737-800 captain, who presumably was aware of his actions and properly assessed the situation and the aircraft's position relative to the ground, kept the control knob switched on for 12 seconds, so turning the horizontal stabilizer to the nosedive position.' The source stated that black box records show that captain Aristos Socratous, 38, ignored his co-pilot's questions over the practicability of his actions. 'To all of the co-pilot's questions, the captain responded that everything was okay. His tone was calm, and no nervousness is heard in his voice,' the source said. Emergencies Ministry members work at the crash site of a Boeing 737-800 Flight FZ981 operated by Dubai-based budget carrier FlyDubai Interfax said its source is aware of the course of investigation. Officially, the committee which uses the Russian abbreviation MAK, said it is unaware of the the suggestion that the pilot deliberately crashed the aircraft. 'MAK has nothing to do with this information so we cannot comment on it,' said a spokesman. The plane crashed after aborting its landing at an altitude of 220 metres possibly due to a sudden increase in wind speed, according to provisional findings of the investigation issued in April by the Interstate Aviation Committee, in charge of the probe. When the jet reached the altitude of 600 metres, the pilot pushed the control wheel off, thus producing a decrease of the vertical load factor and an automatic retraction of the flaps to 10 degrees. The pilot pulled the control wheel and continued the climb. At the altitude of 900 metres, the control column was pushed and the jet's stabiliser was turned for nosing-down, resulting in the Boeing's descent from an altitude of 1,000 metres. 'The later actions of the crew didn't make it possible to avoid staking into the ground,' the committee said in April. At his funeral in June, the pilot's cousin in a eulogy said: 'We lost one of the most important members of our family, our pillar.' Socratous was survived by a son born after the crash. The pilot was 'a very great man, dignified, principled, honest and kind-hearted,' she said at the ceremony held at St Nicholas church in Limassol. A view of the runway at the Rostov-on-Don airport where a FlyDubai Boeing 737-800 crashed The crash 'should and could have been avoided and responsibilities will be sought'. The Dubai-based budget airline was hit by claims that it forced exhausted pilots to fly dangerously long hours despite protests over safety. A leak of reports written by its pilots alleged the schedule left them dangerously fatigued. Flydubai denied the claims and stressed its first priority is safety. 'We operate to the highest standards,' said a spokesman.  The budget carrier FlyDubai launched in 2009, with a network of up to 90 destinations. They operate more than 1,700 flights each week. Its Facebook page says: 'From our hub in Dubai, we strive to remove barriers to travel and enhance connectivity between different cultures across our ever-expanding network. 'Our agility and flexibility as a young airline has enhanced Dubai's economic development, in line with the Government of Dubai's vision, by creating trade and tourism flows in previously under-served markets.'   Read more: Pilots ‘worked to death’: Flydubai whistleblower says fatigue-related crash predicted (RT EXCLUSIVE) — RT News Fatal crash pilot resigned over exhausting hours: report - Cyprus Mail Cyprus Mail Share or comment on this article e-mail 137 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima 'Die baby, die': Two women admit to 'dementia doll' abuse Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

NASA is working with partners in its NextSTEP program to developed deep space habitats that will be used in future space research and exploration. Those partners have all now unveiled their ground prototypes for these modules. NASA previously selected six US firms to help expand the knowledge and commercial capability of space exploration by developing ground-based, full-size prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats under the NextSTEP program, specifically known as NextSTEP-2. “The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit,” said Jason Crusan, Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA Headquarters. The six partners that were selected include Bigelow Aerospace LLC from Las Vegas with its XBASE (Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement) which is a 330 cubic meter expandable habitat. This is a newer version of that BEAM module from Bigelow that is currently in testing on the ISS. Boeing of Houston is showing off a modular habitat ground demonstrator that will allow the company to test and validate interface standards and other technologies. Bigelow Aerospace’s XBASE Lockheed Martin’s multi-purpose logistics module prototype Lockheed Martin of Denver, Colorado has plans to refurbish a multi-purpose logistics module such as those that were used to carry supplies to and from the ISS by the space shuttle into a full-scale habitat prototype with integrated avionics and ECLSS. Orin ATK plans to work on maturing the design of their cislunar habitat concept as on the Cygnus spacecraft that is servicing the space station now. Sierra Nevada Corp has a prototype based on the Dream Chaser cargo module that could be combined with an inflatable fabric environment module, ECLSS system, and propulsion system. The final company is Nanorocks that pans to perform a study on turning an existing launch vehicle upper stage, the propellant segment, into a pressurized space habitat.

Credits: NASA    In a bid to help advance the manned flight to Red Planet, the US space agency has selected six US companies to develop ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Don't Miss: Hatchimals in Stock at Walmart Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as scientists move beyond Earth on the journey to Mars. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2), NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. "NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we're utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of the both the government and private sectors," said Jason Crusan, director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems, in a statement. The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. "We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth," Crusan added. The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation and NanoRacks. The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. NASA has estimated the total of contract award amounts to be approximately $65 million. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. This round of NextSTEP selections will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability in the area of space near the moon which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s.

Now comes the hard part: finding qualified flight controllers to operate it. Designed by HOK, the same firm that drafted Apple’s research headquarters in California, the tower will be operational in about six months. Yet, it may struggle to handle more flights without enough controllers, according to aviation officials. The nation’s busiest airport needs 600 of the technicians ideally for stable operations, but employs only 360, the officials say. The world’s fastest-growing major aviation market is grappling with a paucity of traffic controllers to meet growing demand, as many of them shun employment with the state-run Airports Authority of India, where starting monthly salaries can be as low as US$250, and choose monetarily rewarding jobs with private airlines. About a third of India’s planned air-traffic controller positions are vacant, the government said last year. SpiceJet plans more India-China flights The shortfall has meant existing controllers are overworked. “It is a huge safety hazard,” said Mohan Ranganathan, a former commercial pilot and an independent aviation safety consultant based in the southern Indian city of Chennai. “The air traffic controllers are being flogged in violation of fatigue rules.” The dearth of talent in the world’s second-most populous country is threatening to reach crisis proportions as a slew of budget carriers unveil plans to add hundreds of aircraft to cater to the travel boom fueled by rising incomes and lower fares. Adding to the challenge is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious programmes to connect smaller towns and villages by air. Air India suspends pilot and flight attendants after ‘overstay in cockpit’ The situation came to a head when the US Federal Aviation Administration downgraded India’s aviation safety rating in 2014, concluding the nation couldn’t find enough officials to ensure safe operation of flights. The US regulator said India’s oversight processes don’t meet global standards, putting the country on par with Zimbabwe. The ranking was restored a year later following some corrective action to address shortcomings. Even so, the air-traffic controller shortage will only intensify in the coming years as local carriers buy more planes. Boeing estimates India will need 1,850 aircraft valued at US$265 billion over the next two decades. At least 709 planes are already on order. Go Airlines India said it will buy 72 A320 neos from Airbus at Farnborough last month. Air India flight to London returns to Mumbai after rat spotted on board SpiceJet is in talks for 150 aircraft and IndiGo, the nation’s biggest carrier, has ordered 430 Airbus narrow-body jets on top of more than the 100 it already flies. “There is a huge disconnect between what is required in terms of infrastructure, both physical and manpower, and what is being planned,” said Kapil Kaul, South Asia CEO for Sydney-based CAPA Centre for Aviation. “We are heading towards a serious infrastructure shortage but choose to ignore reality.” A new aviation policy unveiled in June by Modi is also fueling carriers’ expansion plans. In the making for more than a decade, it aims to revive hundreds of unused Indian airports, and provide subsidy to airlines that fly to remote areas. More routes, more planes mean more controllers. The problem is not just limited to India. By 2030, the world will need another 40,000 air traffic controllers to handle flights, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Terminal illness: The ghost airports in India where the only thing that flies are the pigeons Yet, there are so few training facilities in Asia, the fastest-growing travel market, that the region will have a deficit of more than 1,000 controllers each year, ICAO said. The Indian government is in the process of hiring as many as 600 air traffic controllers, who will be trained at three facilities across the country, but only about 60 will be deployed to New Delhi, according to airport officials. The new policy has a passing mention of an intention to set up a “world-class training centre” for local and overseas air-traffic officials. It still has no clear and well thought out strategy to build skills and capabilities, according to CAPA. “It is surprising that the ministry of civil aviation hasn’t felt the need for more stringent supervision and review of manpower,” said Jitender Bhargava, a former executive director of flag carrier Air India. “The problem is systemic and unless accountability is introduced, the vicious cycle of shortages will continue.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: India’s air traffic controller shortage sends shock waves   Most Popular Viewed 1 Xi Jinping gives nod to work of Hong Kong government and urges CY to be ‘resolute’ in safeguarding national unity 2 CY Leung’s mobile phone number among billions ‘leaked’ by smartphone security apps 3 Abercrombie & Fitch to shut Hong Kong store in wake of economic downturn 4 What Hong Kong has to learn from the rise and fall of Manila 5 India’s China policy off target, says Modi’s Mandarin-speaking ‘guided missile’ Shared 1 Abercrombie & Fitch to shut Hong Kong store in wake of economic downturn 2 CY Leung’s mobile phone number among billions ‘leaked’ by smartphone security apps 3 What Hong Kong has to learn from the rise and fall of Manila 4 Xi Jinping gives nod to work of Hong Kong government and urges CY to be ‘resolute’ in safeguarding national unity 5 Chinese defence ministry on high alert as fighting breaks out in Myanmar border towns Commented 1 Xi Jinping gives nod to work of Hong Kong government and urges CY to be ‘resolute’ in safeguarding national unity 2 Xi tells Duterte that Scarborough Shoal will stay open to Philippine fishermen 3 Don’t read too much into handshakes with Beijing leaders for Hong Kong’s chief executive race 4 Too early to ‘grade’ CY Leung’s performance, engineer group contesting Election Committee polls says 5 CY Leung’s mobile phone number among billions ‘leaked’ by smartphone security apps Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like Hong Kong ‘The future of Hong Kong is not ours’: Minority groups feel shut out of one of Asia’s richest cities 19 Nov 2016 - 9:23am 28 Dazzling festivals throughout December: Macau’s seasonal delights to light up the city In partnership with Macao Government Tourism Office Post Magazine The complex origins of Chinese names demystified 18 Nov 2016 - 3:25pm 5 Good Eating Win dinner for two 16 Nov 2016 - 12:19pm The weird and wild toilets of history, and the progress in getting them to everyone 19 Nov 2016 - 12:06pm 1 China China, US hold joint military drills in Southern China Nov 19th 2016, 8:44pm 1 China More doubts cast over Chinese scientist’s claim of gene editing tool ‘breakthrough’ 17 Nov 2016 - 10:21pm 2 Hong Kong Chinese government rebukes US over comments on Hong Kong removal of legislators-elect 17 Nov 2016 - 11:45pm 90 China Trump expected to welcome Chinese investment in US, despite threatening tough tariffs on country’s products 16 Nov 2016 - 8:43am 5 Game changes in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council after ban of two localist lawmakers 17 Nov 2016 - 11:15am 67 Hong Kong Joseph Lau slams ‘greedy’ ex-girlfriend in video interview, confirms he wrote newspaper statement about breakup 16 Nov 2016 - 9:11pm 12 Hong Kong Dream of owning a home is over for most young Hong Kong people 15 Nov 2016 - 11:29pm 43 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as scientists move beyond Earth on the journey to Mars. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2), NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. "NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we're utilising the innovation, skill and knowledge of the both the government and private sectors," said Jason Crusan, director of NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems, in a statement. The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. "We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth," Crusan added. The selected companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation and NanoRacks. The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. NASA has estimated the total of contract award amounts to be approximately $65 million. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. This round of NextSTEP selections will catalyse commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability in the area of space near the moon which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. --IANS na/py/ SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

US Army Cadets Ordered to Walk a Mile in HeelsA new policy is expected to be put in place by Pentagon officials later this year, which upends the standard “tape test” that measures body mass index. Instead, new technology will be put into use to distinguish between those who are obese and those, such as bodybuilders, who have nontraditional body types, but are fit for duty. “When you have groups of individuals who are fit and highly trained, then BMI is absolutely useless,” Dr. Dympna Gallagher, director of the body composition unit at the New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center, told Military Times. Currently, the military requires troops to maintain fat levels below 26 percent for men and 36 percent for women. The standards are currently shrinking the pool of potential recruits, as recent studies have confirmed that 75 percent of young Americans are ineligible for service because of their weight. © Flickr/ Canadian Pacific Not So Fat! Boeing Jets Forced to Fly Shorter Distances Due to Passengers' ObesityInstead, officials are looking to determine locations of body fat on an individual, to determine fitness levels. “Is it visceral fat around the abdominal organs? Or is it total body fat?” a defense official who spoke to the Military Times on a condition of anonymity said. “So the goal is to try to determine, based on the science, how do you test — in hundreds of thousands of individuals — the type of fat they have, in a manner that is quick and attainable and is relevant to health?” Some officials have expressed concerns that the military will be at a disadvantage on the battlefield if they lower standards through the use of the new policies. A study of troops in Afghanistan found that those who are overweight are 40 percent more likely to be injured while deployed. “If we do that, we have a potential liability on the battlefield. The minute we lose that competitive advantage in combat because our enemies are training harder than we are, we’ll have more problems than we have right now,” Command Sgt. Maj. John Troxell said. ...

Pigs are fat, and they are rounded and hard. Most of so called fat people, don't look or feel anything like that. They are soft and flabby. I think it's human cellular waste, that the body either can't get rid of, because it's overloaded as it is, dealing with everything else, or it's just a protective cushion for injured muscles, even if injuries are minor or microscopic.

If the sale is approved by Congress, the weapons, worth an estimated $231 million, would be sold to the NATO Support and Procurement Agency and then distributed to Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain. In January 2015, US Navy Vice Adm. J.W. Rixey, head of the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) wrote in a memo that his organization was launching a two-year pilot program to see if weapons could be sold directly to NATO in order to allow partner nations to pool their resources and find cost efficiencies. This precision-guided munitions sale would represent the first such sale, a State Department spokesman confirmed. According to a notice posted on the website of DSCA, the potential sale would include “five hundred (500) Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Guidance Kits, KMU-556 F/B; forty (40) JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU-557 F/B; one thousand five hundred (1,500) JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU-572 F/B; one thousand (1,000) MAU 210 E/B Computer Control Groups for 1,000-lb. Enhanced Paveway IIs; three hundred (300) MAU 210 E/B Computer Control Groups for GBU-49s; one thousand twenty-five (1,025) MAU 169 L/B Computer Control Groups for GBU-12s; one thousand three hundred fifty (1,350) Joint Programmable Fuzes, FMU-152 A/B; sixty (60) Bomb Fin Assembly and Airfoil Group 650-MXU K/B for GBU-12s; one thousand twenty-five (1,025) Bomb Fin Assembly and Airfoil Group, MXU-650 K/B AFG for GBU-12s.” Work will primarily be done at Boeing’s facility in St Louis, Missouri, and Raytheon’s Tucson, Arizona, location.

CGNPC employee Szuhsiung Ho is accused of conspiring to develop nuclear material in China without US approval. Who is he and what is his background? Szuhsiung ‘Allen’ Ho, a nuclear engineer employed by the China General Nuclear Power Company. Photograph: Knox County sheriff's office Rob Davies Thursday 11 August 2016 13.18 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.38 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Dr Szuhsiung “Allen” Ho is, according to a motion filed by his lawyer, a 66-year-old American citizen who was born in Taiwan, educated in the US and lives in Wilmington, Delaware. In character statements submitted to a court in Tennessee, friends and neighbours described him as an honest and law abiding member of the community who loved the US and would eventually be exonerated of charges of nuclear espionage brought against him by the US government. Ho came to the US in 1973 to attend the University of California and married his wife Anne a year later. He received a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Illinois in 1980, and became a naturalised US citizen three years later. . The couple are childless, but Ho fathered a son outside the marriage in 2007. Neighbours said his wife had declared herself willing to help raise the child in the US. They are described as active members of the local Chinese American Community Centre in Wilmington, where Anne Ho is involved in running a women’s book club. The couple live in a large house in the town, which has sizeable Chinese community, but Ho spends much of his time in China working for his nuclear consulting business, Energy Technology International, which was set up in 1996. Prosecutors say he has two flats in China, one of his own and another for his son and the boy’s mother. Ho has worked as a consultant for China General Nuclear Power, which has a 33% stake in the UK’s £18bn Hinkley Point C project. Prosecutors allege that he enticed US nuclear experts at the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority energy corporation to pass sensitive information to Beijing by paying them bribes. They also allege that he failed to register with the Department of Justice as an agent of a foreign state and that he is paid by the Chinese government. Ho is charged with helping a foreign power produce nuclear material, a term that refers to enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear reactor fuel. His lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, said in court papers Ho had “no expertise or experience in the development or production of special nuclear material”. He said Ho was helping nuclear plants in China to run safely in order to avoid a Chernobyl-style disaster. Ho was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, in April and has been jailed pending trial. If found guilty he could face life in prison. Zeidenberg has requested bail, pointing out that Ho, 66, is “not a young man” and is “poorly equipped for dealing with the stress and potential dangers inherent in detention”. He said that at one facility where Ho was held, he had to be segregated from other inmates after they were heard discussing a plan to harm him. “It has been brutal for him in every way imaginable,” a friend of Ho’s said. Neighbours and family friends have provided statements praising his character, according to filings with the court intended to support his bail request, which will be heard on Tuesday. Gwen and David Chen, also of Wilmington, said Ho was a “bright, honest, warm, mild, likable [sic], and friendly man”, adding that the allegations “must be some misunderstanding”. Friend Amy Chien said he was a “man of filial piety” who always visited his family in Taiwan when he travelled to China and was “well liked and respected in his circle of friends”. Shirley and Evan Tseng said he spent a lot of time in China for work, but that he had “roots deeply planted in Delaware” and loved the US. “This is his home and his country, and he would never betray it,” they said. Ho’s sister-in-law, Donna En Ning Lee, said Ho “has not – nor will he ever – evade the law” and offered to put her house up as a bail bond. Zeidenberg said Ho was not a flight risk, had no criminal history or drug or alcohol problems, and was prepared to submit to house arrest with an ankle bracelet to monitor his movements.
