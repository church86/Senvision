The defense firm declined to comment. Simmons has led the GOP staff since 2005, after being recruited by former Chairman Duncan Hunter Sr. (R-Calif.), but before that ran the San Diego-based aerospace manufacturer Senior Aerospace. House Armed Services Committee chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) said in a statement that Simmons “has been an outstanding staff director” and he will miss his counsel.  “Bob has served his country with unparalleled energy, honor, and integrity,” Thornberry said. “He has spent every day of the last twelve years working to see that Congress acted — on a bi-partisan basis — to keep our military strong, to care for our men and women in uniform, and to make America safe. He has served his country well and we will miss him.”  Thornberry has named Jenness Simler — currently the Committee’s deputy staff director — to take over Simmons's role, also effective immediately. Simler has served on the committee staff since 2005, first as a professional staff member and later policy director, according to the statement.  “I have full confidence in Jenness to lead the Committee Staff in the days ahead,” Thornberry said. “Not only does she have a sweeping command of the issues before the Committee, but as the child of a military family, she knows first-hand how our choices affect men and women in uniform.”  The statement also said that Thornberry “has instituted a rigorous transition structure to ensure that no conflict of interest issues arise, in accordance with the Rules of the House, while Simmons completes his service to the Committee.”   View the discussion thread.

By Scutify May 01, 2017 7:46 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. With autos and general consumer spending rolling over, the two things propping up the economy are housing and durable goods orders, more specifically airplane orders. What's up with that? Durable Goods New Orders and Shipments Compare durable goods new orders with capital goods new orders excluding aircraft. The latter is known as core capital goods because it is a measure of actual business investment. Despite sentiment numbers that are through the roof, businesses are not putting their money where their sentiment is. I asked a friend connected to the industry his take. I also asked about order cancellations. Here is his reply. Hi Mish This is drip by drip. Part of your answer is found in this article: American Airlines Delays Boeing, Airbus Jet Deliveries. These orders were placed years ago. Some are deferred, some canceled. Boeing does not disclose the cost to cancel, but there is some. Typically there is a % down payment with additional payments as the airplane assembly progresses. Boeing usually, in a normal market, is able to place these canceled/deferred airplanes with other customers. Boeing is very good with its customers and accommodates to the extent possible. But, wide-body airplane demand is collapsing. Emirates just pulled 12 flights per day as US-Mideast travel is in decline due to Trump's actions. 2018 and 2019 look grim for Boeing. Expenses are high and they are laying off to stay ahead of the curve. Five-Year Slump in Wide-Body Leeham News reports Pontifications: Five-Year Slump in Wide-Body Demand Seen. The above analysis has not translated into economic reality yet. Perhaps it won't. But credit card defaults have soared, autos are heading South, consumer spending is weak, wages have not kept up with inflation, and regional bank lending has collapsed.

EnCore was one of 13 companies honored April 12 for distinguished performance in working with Boeing. While EnCore is a newer company, founders Jim Downey and Tom McFarland have a long-standing relationship with Boeing over the course of their 40 years of experience in the industry. "Being named Supplier of the Year by Boeing is a humbling experience," explains Tom McFarland, CEO of the EnCore Group. "Our goal is to be predictable and reliable for Boeing no matter what the challenge, consistently without fail." "Boeing's success is a testament to the partnerships we hold with the finest aerospace suppliers in the world such as EnCore," said Kent Fisher, Boeing's leader for enterprise Supplier Management. "Together we will continue to deliver affordable, technologically advanced products and services that give our customers a competitive edge." With a growing reputation for on-time delivery and a commitment to quality, the four companies of the EnCore Group are making a name for themselves in aviation. In 2016, EnCore Interiors dominated North American 737 MAX Galley orders and added its first two customers in the European market, while EnCore Composite Structures saw sales double since its founding in 2011. Meanwhile, EnCore International doubled capacity to meet the EnCore Group's machining demand, and achieved all required Boeing qualifications to be able to deliver EnCore's first 787-10 production parts directly to Charleston, SC, all within one year of setting up operation. And still relatively new to the aircraft seating industry, LIFT by EnCore opened their new certification facility and announced two launch customers for their first product, 737 Tourist Class Seating. This year's recipients represent an elite group among more than 13,000 active Boeing suppliers in 48 countries around the world. This selection was based on stringent performance criteria for quality performance, delivery performance, cost, environmental initiatives, customer service, and technical expertise. About the EnCore Group Founded in 2011 by Jim Downey and Tom McFarland, the EnCore Group is comprised of four dedicated aerospace companies, each with its own specific focus. EnCore Interiors is a full floor-to-floor design, manufacturing, and certification company. They offer galleys, lavatories, class dividers, closets, flooring, and other components. EnCore Composite Structures has become a leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered components that utilize composite and other lightweight materials for commercial and military applications. EnCore International is a multi-process facility that opened in November 2015 to support the EnCore Group's growing production needs. By utilizing new manufacturing technologies, they are able to work fluidly with the other companies in the group to offer support and expedite production. LIFT by EnCore is an airline seating supplier with a focus on revolutionizing the industry by delivering superior results.

Economy Federal Reserve Capitol Report Economic Report Columns Darrell Delamaide Irwin Kellner Rex Nutting Tools Economic Calendar Real Estate Location Scouts realtor.com My MarketWatch Watchlist Alerts Games Log In Home Press Release Hawaiian Airlines Unveils New Brand and Livery By Published: May 1, 2017 3:15 p.m. ET Share HONOLULU, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's carrier, today revealed an updated brand identity and the freshly-painted livery of a Boeing 717 (N488HA), the first of its fleet of more than 50 aircraft that will feature the new design. Pualani (Flower of the Sky), the beloved icon of Hawaiian's brand for more than four decades, continues to gaze forward on the tail of the aircraft; beneath her, a silver maile lei with woven pakalana flowers wraps around the fuselage in a larger-than-life expression of the aloha spirit.   "Our new livery embodies a stronger, more contemporary representation of Hawaiian Airlines' culture of service and hospitality, which is the bedrock of our guest experience," said president and CEO Mark Dunkerley, who unveiled the new brand design at Honolulu International Airport during a special employee event on Lei Day, a statewide annual celebration of Hawaiian culture. "It acknowledges our place as Hawaii's airline and underscores the commitment our employees make every day to provide our guests with a gracious and genuine island welcome."         In addition to the refreshed livery, travelers across Hawaiian's U.S. and international networks will begin to see the new logo throughout their journey -- on web and digital assets, airport lobby signage and kiosks, and at boarding gates. Painting of all aircraft and ground service equipment is scheduled to be complete by 2020. Videos and images of the new designs are available at HawaiianAirlines.com/brand-refresh.            Hawaiian worked with Lippincott, a global creative consultancy, on the new identity. Hawaiian's brand team and Lippincott spent a year studying the airline's history, working with a committee of front-line employees, and immersing themselves in Hawaiian culture to arrive at the new design. "So much of our visual identity, which is 15 years old, still resonated deeply with our guests and employees," said Avi Mannis, senior vice president of marketing for Hawaiian. "Our aim was to retain the essence of our brand and arrive at a bolder, truer expression of our unique Hawaiian hospitality."        The new identity retains Hawaiian's distinctive color palette of purple, fuchsia and coral. Pualani—the singular icon of the brand—remains at its core. The new logo and livery emphasize Pualani by featuring her more prominently and liberating her from the floral "holding shape" of the former logo. She gazes proudly with the wind in her hair, adorned with a hibiscus flower and framed by a Hawaiian sunrise. The expressive, organic graphics reflect the natural forms of Hawai'i.    The addition of the lei elements to the livery accentuate the three-dimensional contours of the aircraft fuselage while also incorporating a rich, meaningful cultural narrative that reflects the carrier's strong sense of place and identity. Updated typography and bright, emotive imagery support Hawaiian's positioning as a premium leisure airline, focused on warm hospitable service.        "The Hawaiian Airlines' brand has been and always will be iconic," said Su Mathews Hale, senior partner at Lippincott. "The refreshed look honors their rich history and culture, while continuing to celebrate the unique, authentic spirit that has led the airline industry for years." Serving as a brand constant, Pualani has evolved at pivotal moments in the carrier's ever-changing phases of growth as seen in a historical timeline online. Debuting in October 1973, she was one of the first female icons painted on the tail of a commercial airline and marked Hawaiian's transformation to an all-jet airline with the entry of McDonnell Douglas DC-9s. While slight variations were made to the red hibiscus in her hair over the next 28 years, Pualani's last evolution was in 2001 when Hawaiian's new interisland Boeing 717s and transpacific Boeing 767s entered the fleet, ushering in a more competitive and sophisticated airline at the time expressed through brand adaptations representing the look of a 21st century Island woman.   The new visual identity preludes the next chapter in Hawaiian's 88-year history with the arrival of the medium-haul, single-aisle A321neo fleet later this year. It is the next step in a series of major investments Hawaiian has made to aircraft cabins, lounges, and other aspects of the customer experience over the past five years, to elevate the carrier's service and ensure Hawaiian's position as the preferred airline for travelers flying to and within Hawaii. To complement its new phase of growth, the airline will also roll out new uniforms for its frontline employees, themed Ku Makou or Together We Stand, by the end of 2017. Since 2001, Hawaiian has more than doubled its route network, from 13 to 27 airports served, including 11 international destinations. Hawaiian currently operates a fleet of 23 Airbus A330s, 20 Boeing 717 aircraft and eight Boeing 767s. It also provides turbo-prop flights using three ATR-42 aircraft through its 'Ohana by Hawaiian service. The airline expects to take delivery of 18 new A321neo aircraft between the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2020.             About Hawaiian AirlinesHawaiian®, the world's most punctual airline as reported by OAG, has led all U.S. carriers in on-time performance for each of the past 13 years (2004-2016) as reported by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Consumer surveys by Condé Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure have ranked Hawaiian the highest of all domestic airlines serving Hawai'i.            Now in its 88th year of continuous service, Hawaiian is Hawai'i's biggest and longest-serving airline, as well as the largest provider of passenger air service from its primary visitor markets on the U.S. Mainland. Hawaiian offers non-stop service to Hawai'i from more U.S. gateway cities (11) than any other airline, along with service from Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa and Tahiti. Hawaiian also provides approximately 170 jet flights daily between the Hawaiian Islands, with a total of more than 250 daily flights system-wide.             Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. is a subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

HONOLULU, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's carrier, today revealed an updated brand identity and the freshly-painted livery of a Boeing 717 (N488HA), the first of its fleet of more than 50 aircraft that will feature the new design. Pualani (Flower of the Sky), the beloved icon of Hawaiian's brand for more than four decades, continues to gaze forward on the tail of the aircraft; beneath her, a silver maile lei with woven pakalana flowers wraps around the fuselage in a larger-than-life expression of the aloha spirit.   "Our new livery embodies a stronger, more contemporary representation of Hawaiian Airlines' culture of service and hospitality, which is the bedrock of our guest experience," said president and CEO Mark Dunkerley, who unveiled the new brand design at Honolulu International Airport during a special employee event on Lei Day, a statewide annual celebration of Hawaiian culture. "It acknowledges our place as Hawaii's airline and underscores the commitment our employees make every day to provide our guests with a gracious and genuine island welcome."         Hawaiian Airlines Unveils New Brand and Livery In addition to the refreshed livery, travelers across Hawaiian's U.S. and international networks will begin to see the new logo throughout their journey -- on web and digital assets, airport lobby signage and kiosks, and at boarding gates. Painting of all aircraft and ground service equipment is scheduled to be complete by 2020. Videos and images of the new designs are available at HawaiianAirlines.com/brand-refresh.            Hawaiian worked with Lippincott, a global creative consultancy, on the new identity. Hawaiian's brand team and Lippincott spent a year studying the airline's history, working with a committee of front-line employees, and immersing themselves in Hawaiian culture to arrive at the new design. "So much of our visual identity, which is 15 years old, still resonated deeply with our guests and employees," said Avi Mannis, senior vice president of marketing for Hawaiian. "Our aim was to retain the essence of our brand and arrive at a bolder, truer expression of our unique Hawaiian hospitality."        The new identity retains Hawaiian's distinctive color palette of purple, fuchsia and coral. Pualani—the singular icon of the brand—remains at its core. The new logo and livery emphasize Pualani by featuring her more prominently and liberating her from the floral "holding shape" of the former logo. She gazes proudly with the wind in her hair, adorned with a hibiscus flower and framed by a Hawaiian sunrise. The expressive, organic graphics reflect the natural forms of Hawai'i.    The addition of the lei elements to the livery accentuate the three-dimensional contours of the aircraft fuselage while also incorporating a rich, meaningful cultural narrative that reflects the carrier's strong sense of place and identity. Updated typography and bright, emotive imagery support Hawaiian's positioning as a premium leisure airline, focused on warm hospitable service.        "The Hawaiian Airlines' brand has been and always will be iconic," said Su Mathews Hale, senior partner at Lippincott. "The refreshed look honors their rich history and culture, while continuing to celebrate the unique, authentic spirit that has led the airline industry for years." Serving as a brand constant, Pualani has evolved at pivotal moments in the carrier's ever-changing phases of growth as seen in a historical timeline online. Debuting in October 1973, she was one of the first female icons painted on the tail of a commercial airline and marked Hawaiian's transformation to an all-jet airline with the entry of McDonnell Douglas DC-9s. While slight variations were made to the red hibiscus in her hair over the next 28 years, Pualani's last evolution was in 2001 when Hawaiian's new interisland Boeing 717s and transpacific Boeing 767s entered the fleet, ushering in a more competitive and sophisticated airline at the time expressed through brand adaptations representing the look of a 21st century Island woman.   The new visual identity preludes the next chapter in Hawaiian's 88-year history with the arrival of the medium-haul, single-aisle A321neo fleet later this year. It is the next step in a series of major investments Hawaiian has made to aircraft cabins, lounges, and other aspects of the customer experience over the past five years, to elevate the carrier's service and ensure Hawaiian's position as the preferred airline for travelers flying to and within Hawaii. To complement its new phase of growth, the airline will also roll out new uniforms for its frontline employees, themed Kū Mākou or Together We Stand, by the end of 2017. Since 2001, Hawaiian has more than doubled its route network, from 13 to 27 airports served, including 11 international destinations. Hawaiian currently operates a fleet of 23 Airbus A330s, 20 Boeing 717 aircraft and eight Boeing 767s. It also provides turbo-prop flights using three ATR-42 aircraft through its 'Ohana by Hawaiian service. The airline expects to take delivery of 18 new A321neo aircraft between the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2020.             About Hawaiian Airlines Hawaiian®, the world's most punctual airline as reported by OAG, has led all U.S. carriers in on-time performance for each of the past 13 years (2004-2016) as reported by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Consumer surveys by Condé Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure have ranked Hawaiian the highest of all domestic airlines serving Hawai'i.            Now in its 88th year of continuous service, Hawaiian is Hawai'i's biggest and longest-serving airline, as well as the largest provider of passenger air service from its primary visitor markets on the U.S. Mainland. Hawaiian offers non-stop service to Hawai'i from more U.S. gateway cities (11) than any other airline, along with service from Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa and Tahiti. Hawaiian also provides approximately 170 jet flights daily between the Hawaiian Islands, with a total of more than 250 daily flights system-wide.             Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. is a subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) SpaceX, the aerospace company founded by Elon Musk, launched a Falcon 9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center Monday, breaking up the Lockheed Martin (LMT)-Boeing (BA) stronghold on U.S. military contracts. Continue Reading Below Musk’s Falcon 9 received certification from the U.S. Air Force in 2015, paving the way for SpaceX to handle national security missions and enter a business long dominated by a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Space Exploration Technologies’ launch on Monday was completed as part of a contract between spacecraft maker Ball Aerospace (BLL) and the National Reconnaissance Office, which oversees U.S. spy satellites. NROL-76, the designation for the classified satellite launch, was SpaceX’s first dedicated mission for the military. The 23-story-tall Falcon 9 rocket took off at 7:15 a.m. ET from a launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Fla. After splitting from its payload, the rocket landed back to Earth at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX has specialized in testing rocket landings and launching used rockets back into space. The Hawthorne, Calif.-based company flew its first recovered booster last month, as Musk attempts to lower the cost of rocket launches. United Launch Alliance, the Lockheed-Boeing partnership, was the sole company launching satellites for the military for the last 10 years. In 2014, SpaceX sued the U.S. Air Force in a dispute over an $11 billion contract awarded to ULA. SpaceX pulled the lawsuit after a settlement with the military, which said it would make future contracts available to other companies. SpaceX now holds two launch contracts with the Air Force. The contracts call for SpaceX to launch Global Positioning System satellites in 2018 and 2019. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Musk is also the founder and CEO of Tesla (TSLA).

While the outcome of the case is uncertain, they said the Montreal-based company’s efforts to sell the plane into the American market could be hampered by the prospect of preliminary duties resulting from Boeing’s anti-dumping petition. “Purchasers tend to back away from making commitments until they know the outcome of the proceedings, so I would expect that there will be some form of commercial repercussions,” international trade lawyer Lawrence Herman said in an interview from Toronto. Boeing petitioned the US Department of Commerce and the US International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It said more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far have allowed Bombardier to engage in “predatory pricing” for an aircraft that competes directly against its 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 airplanes. Bombardier and the Canadian government have rejected Boeing’s claims. Herman expects the case could drag on for years even though an investigation and imposition of preliminary duties could known in a few months. Boeing faces a challenge proving its complaints because government funding for the CSeries came in the form of equity rather than traditional subsidies, he said, adding that Boeing has received US government support in the form of research and development grants along with military contracts. Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group called Boeing’s legal approach “ill-advised.” He said the CSeries has a small impact on Boeing’s planes, adding that the argument that the plane was sold well below cost was odd since that’s standard industry practice for new planes. “The impact of the CSeries on their product line is incredibly marginal. It’s the Delta deal and not much else,” he said. Aboulafia also said Boeing could risk an order for its Super Hornet jet fighter by taking on a key sector of the Canadian economy. Herman said Boeing’s move could prompt Airbus to take a similar legal action against Bombardier, adding this could stall CSeries sales in Europe. Airbus declined to comment. Brazil has already filed a complaint about the Canadian government’s support for Bombardier with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer. McGill University professor Karl Moore said Boeing is taking advantage of President Donald Trump’s approach to trade to take an opportunistic hit at Bombardier, the world’s third-largest aerospace manufacturer. “It’s just the way the game is played these days,” he said from Abu Dhabi. “You rattle your sabre and try to scare customers a bit.” By filing a complaint in the Washington instead of Geneva, Boeing could take a quicker toll on Bombardier, said University of Ottawa professor Patrick Leblond. “A little like the softwood lumber file, we could see the imposition of countervailing duties on Bombardier products,” he said. Boeing’s legal manoeuvre is the latest challenge to Canadian trade with the United States, coming days after the Trump administration criticized Canada’s dairy sector and imposed duties on softwood lumber. The US government’s protectionist tone could make it tough for other Canadian companies as well, said trade lawyer Alan Wolff. “It’s a pro-enforcement administration. That will mean that there’s a greater likelihood of these types of cases being filed,” he said from Washington, DC.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Boeing Plots Full-Scale Assault on Lockheed Martin's F-35 Billions of dollars of fighter jet profits are at stake. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 1, 2017 at 11:13AM President Donald Trump loves Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) "fantastic new F-35 jet fighter" -- at least now that Lockheed Martin has cut its price on the F-35, he does. That said, last we heard, the president still wanted  Boeing (NYSE:BA) to price out a "comparable F-18 Super Hornet" so that he can comparison-shop. And Boeing is only too happy to do that. Boeing is pitching an Advanced Super Hornet as an alternative to Lockheed's F-35. Image source: Boeing. Paper chase In recent weeks, word has been filtering out of a new "white paper" being circulated around Washington, D.C., which touts Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet as a better value proposition than Lockheed's F-35 -- and makes the case for the U.S. Navy to buy more of the former and less of the latter. As reported on DefenseOne.com last month, the white paper in question states the case thusly: "The U.S. Navy currently plans to have a Carrier Air Wing mix of 3 squadrons of F/A-18 Super Hornets and 1 squadron of F-35Cs in 2028 transitioning to 2 squadrons of F/A-18 Super Hornets and 2 squadrons of F-35C in 2033." (Plus supporting sub-hunting, electronic-warfare, and airborne early warning aircraft.) Boeing, however, argues that buying all the F-35s required to obtain the air-wing mix as described "will be prohibitively expensive" and "leaves the Navy with a significant inventory shortfall" in the near term, because of production delays with the F-35C. So what is Boeing's solution? Glad you asked... Buy more F/A-18s, of course. Specifically, Boeing in this white paper argues that the Navy should buy some 120 current-model F/A-18E/F fighters and substitute 200 units of a new and improved, stealthier variant of its Super Hornet -- which it calls alternately the F/A-18XT, Block 3 Super Hornet, or Advanced Super Hornet -- for F-35Cs that the Navy would otherwise buy. (The Navy's total planned purchases of F-35Cs number 350 units, so Lockheed would still sell some F-35Cs -- just not nearly as many as it had hoped.) Now what would all this mean to investors? Lockheed Martin's F-35C currently costs about $122 million. That's about $43 million more than the $79 million Boeing says it would charge for an Advanced Super Hornet. Thus, by switching out 200 purchases of F-35s for 200 purchases of Advanced Super Hornets, Boeing says the Navy could save about $8.6 billion. What's more, Boeing also says its Advanced Super Hornet would be easier to maintain. Factoring savings from operations and maintenance costs into the equation adds up to "about $30 billion" saved over 20 years. That's enough to buy the Navy two brand-new Ford-class supercarriers with the savings -- which is a proposition attractive enough that it might persuade the Navy to give Boeing's proposal a listen. What it means to investors Now what does all this mean to investors? If Boeing succeeds in persuading the Navy to follow its strategy and buy 120 current model F/A-18s at about $70 million each, plus 200 Advanced Super Hornets instead of 200 F-35Cs, the revenue opportunity for Boeing would be immense -- about $24.2 billion. At the 9.8% operating profit margin that Boeing currently earns on its military aircraft (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), that would work out to an additional $2.4 billion in profit for Boeing. (Granted, Boeing's white paper doesn't say how long it would take to build these planes and book these profits, but with 62% of the Navy's F/A-18 fleet currently out of service, requiring parts or major repairs, one imagines that the time frame for buying new planes -- whatever the type -- is fairly urgent.)  On the flip side, losing 200 F-35C sales would be disastrous for Lockheed Martin. For one thing, at Lockheed's operating profit margin of 10.5%, the $24.4 billion in revenue expected from 200 F-35C sales implies $2.6 billion in operating profit -- all of which would be lost if Boeing's white paper wins traction in the Pentagon. For another, shrinking the overall number of F-35s built would mean Lockheed cannot spread research and development costs out among as many aircraft -- increasing the cost per plane, and making the F-35 less attractive to future buyers, creating a snowball effect of higher prices leading to fewer sales, and vice-versa. That's what's at stake here, as Boeing makes its full-court press against Lockheed's fighter-jet business. While there's no guarantee Boeing will succeed with this gambit, now you know why it's still trying.  Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

A total of 5 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft will have entered Gulf Air’s fleet by the end of 2018 with an additional 2 aircraft arriving in 2019 and 3 arriving by in 2020. “We are 12 months away from welcoming the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner to the Gulf Air fleet – a historic moment in our trajectory and yet another important step in our strategic direction towards furthering Gulf Air’s fleet modernization process and supporting our network and overall passenger experience enhancement strategies. As we look to strengthen our presence across the globe, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners will also serve to enhance Gulf Air’s operational efficiency while offering enhanced passenger comfort. I am confident our guests will be delighted with the experience of flying with our newest aircraft,” said Maher Salman Al Musallam, Gulf Air Chief Executive Officer.

The industry-leading technology of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner boasts superior fuel efficiency, environmentally friendly operations and range flexibility that will facilitate Gulf Air’s planned network expansion and fleet optimisation at a lower operating cost. “The 787 customer base is growing not just globally but in the Middle East as well with airlines such as Gulf Air taking delivery of the Dreamliner,” said Marty Bentrott, Vice President – Sales, The Middle East, Turkey, Russia & Central Asia, Boeing Commercial Aeroplanes.  “We are confident that the 787-9 will help Gulf Air achieve a new level of efficiency and profitability and will contribute to their future growth and success.” The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an all-new, super-efficient family of commercial aeroplanes that brings big-jet ranges and speed to the middle of the market with 20 to 25 percent less fuel and 20 to 25 percent fewer emissions than the aeroplanes they replace.

China’s answer to Boeing now just needs to sell The first C919 passenger jet made by the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) shows during a news conference at the company’s factory in Shanghai in November 2015. Photo: Stringer/Reuters When China unveiled a historic order for its first large commercial jetliner at a national air show in 2010, Western journalists were kept away, and only local media were allowed to witness a major turning point in China’s aviation ambitions. The Comac C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force – illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years. But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China’s answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing and Airbus. “They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there’s a risk of getting bled dry,” said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group. Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it’s rolling out a pilot training programme, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say. And though still unproven, Comac could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China’s own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this. Beijing’s backing for the single-aisle plane gives Comac a springboard in the world’s fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad. “You can’t compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they’re in a different strategic stage... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue [of plane development], it will also take many years to solve the second [market] problem,” said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for Comac. “After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane’s and Comac’s market competitiveness.” The safety certification of the new plane could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from Comac, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919. The C919 has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies, but says it is not able to give a breakdown. In comparison, the latest version of the Boeing 737 had more than 3,000 firm orders before it flew last January. Those types of numbers from the two big global planemakers come after decades of trimming costs and honing marketing pitches. The two have global support networks able to respond whenever a jet breaks down just about anywhere, and the number of jets flying makes it easier for airlines to raise loans to buy them. While Chinese financiers have muscled into the global aviation arena, Comac has a relatively low-key presence at international air shows and has said the C919 would initially be aimed at the domestic market. But there are signs it’s adopting a more outward-facing approach. While operating manuals for Comac’s smaller ARJ21 regional jet, which took its first flight in 2007, were written in Mandarin, the C919’s will be in English to support sales. Comac’s sales and support networks – it has at least 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, says Cheng – are, however, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus. Still, Comac’s home advantage is significant as Chinese airlines are likely to drive airplane demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes – mostly from Boeing and Airbus. “Their sales person is the government,” said a Chinese airline executive, who didn’t want to be named for risk of damaging business relationships. “As long as the government tells the state airlines to purchase planes, that will happen.” Airline executives say the first flight is when Comac can realistically start discussing deposits and firming up customers, even if the plane still faces years of testing. “We haven’t placed a deposit; at the moment it’s intentions,” said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines, which has committed to buying up to 50 of the 158-seat C919s. “We signed for 50, but we actually want to buy 30. We have to see if they’re able to produce it... They (Comac) are very enthusiastic, they meet us every month and send us updates.” Executives at two Chinese airlines which have not placed orders for the aircraft said they wanted to see the C919’s safety record, as well as the creation of a global support team. The safety certification of the new plane – which state media says will have a catalogue price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 – could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally. Having a plane certified to fly commercially is tough enough even for Western jetmakers as aircraft become more complex and supply chains expand. There is still uncertainty over approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold beyond China, with the US and the EU having the most influence. Although the EU has agreed to recognise some of the checks carried out by China, it is expected to insist on some of its own tests before issuing a safety certificate and is trying to understand where discrepancies between the two systems lie. “We are just at the start of the process,” said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency. The US Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Without Western approvals, China would only be able to sell to countries that accept its certification standards. Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Tajikistan have previously bought Chinese planes. Without Western certification, “sales of the aircraft in developed economies and many developing economies will be difficult to impossible”, said Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher at Aviation Week. The C919’s only real foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, whose parent General Electric co-built the plane’s engine with France’s Safran. “Only once our plane enters the market and is tested can we see what gaps it has,” Cheng said. « Brexit: everything is negotiable Saudi Aramco to boost oil loading capacity with reopened terminal » Advert See our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

Subscribe Information that drives Canadian industry News Features Insights Technology Centre Events Plant Expo Upcoming Events More Digital Edition Plant West Salary Calculator Contacts Advertise Bombardier rejects Boeing claim CSeries dumped into US below cost Economic Development Minister says government objects to the allegations, vows ``a vigorous defence.'' April 28, 2017 by Ross Marowitts Topics General Industries Aerospace Government Manufacturing CSeries FTV2 during a test flight. Photo: BombardierMONTREAL — Bombardier and the federal government have rejected Boeing’s claim in a complaint filed with the US government that its Canadian rival has dumped its new CSeries commercial jet into the United States at below cost. “Bombardier structures its commercial dealings to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those issues raised by Boeing,” the Montreal-based aircraft manufacturer said in an emailed statement. The world’s third-largest airplane maker said it spends about US$3 billion annually with US suppliers and employs about 7,000 people in dozens of facilities in both rail and aerospace across 17 states. The Seattle-based competitor said it petitioned the US Department of Commerce and the US International Trade Commission for investigations into subsidies and pricing of the CSeries. It is also seeking an order to be issued against the sale of the plane in the important American market. Economic Development Minister Navdeep Bains said the government objects to the allegations and vowed to mount “a vigorous defence.” “We are confident that our programs are consistent with Canada’s international obligations,” he said in a statement. Boeing said it asking the Trump administration to act “to end Bombardier’s illegal and unfair business practices before it is too late to prevent significant harm to America’s aerospace industry and thousands of good-paying aerospace jobs.” The aerospace giant said the threat against its suppliers will only grow as Bombardier increases the annual production rate of the CSeries to between 90 and 120 airplanes by 2020. It said more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far have allowed Bombardier to engage in “predatory pricing” for an aircraft that competes directly against its 737-700 and 737 MAX 7 airplanes. Boeing claimed Bombardier has sold CSeries planes that cost US$33 million to produce for less than US$20 million each and at prices below what it charged in Canada. “It’s selling the aircraft in the U.S. at prices that are millions lower than those that they’re charging in Canada, which is the very definition of dumping,” Boeing spokesman Daniel Curran said in an interview. Boeing joins Brazil, which filed a similar complaint with the World Trade Organization at the urging of rival manufacturer Embraer. Delta Air Lines will become the first US CSeries carrier after placing a firm order a year ago for 75 CS100 aircraft valued at US$5.6 billion. It also has options for 50 more planes and can covert some of the aircraft to larger CS300s. Air Canada followed by ordering 45 CS300s for US$3.8 billion at list prices, plus options for 30 more planes. Airlines typically pay much less than list prices and early buyers of new planes usually get low prices. The latest challenge against Bombardier’s largest aircraft came just days after the US imposed preliminary duties of up to 24% on softwood lumber imported from Canada.

The 23-story tall rocket took off from its seaside launch pad at Kennedy Space Center at 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT.) It will put into orbit a classified satellite for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, an agency within the Defense Department that operates the nation’s spy satellites. Nine minutes after takeoff, the rocket’s main section touched down on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just south of NASA’s spaceport. Landing A post shared by Elon Musk (@elonmusk) on May 1, 2017 at 6:44am PDT Last month, Space Exploration Technologies Corp flew its first recovered booster on a second mission, a key step in company founder Elon Musk’s quest to cut launch costs. The National Reconnaissance Office bought SpaceX’s launch services via a contract with Ball Aerospace, a Colorado-based satellite and instrument builder. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. Musk battled for years to break the monopoly on the military’s launch business held by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. SpaceX sued the U.S. Air Force in 2014 over its exclusive multibillion-dollar contract with United Launch Alliance. The company later dropped the suit after the military agreed to open more launch contacts to competitive bidding. SpaceX has since won two launch contracts from the Air Force to send up Global Positioning System satellites in 2018 and 2019. Monday’s launch was the 34th mission for SpaceX and the fifth of more than 20 flights planned for this year. The privately owned firm, based in Hawthorne, California, has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth about $10 billion.

The plane is marketed as a platform for advanced pilot training, with the US Air Force considered its primary customer. "The jet handled exactly like the first aircraft and the simulator, meeting all expectations," Boeing Test Pilot for Air Force Programs Matt Giese said in a press release. "The front and back cockpits work together seamlessly and the handling is superior. It's the perfect aircraft for training future generations of combat pilots." The T-X has a single-engine, is twin-tailed, and is double-seated with embedded training technology in the cockpit. "This aircraft was built to Air Force requirements and designed to fulfill the Air Education and Training Command mission," lead test pilot Steve Schmidt said. The T-X is anticipated to replace the venerable T-38 training aircraft that dates back to 1959, and is expected to be operational by 2024. The first model was revealed by Boeing and Saab in 2016, and has been in flight since December of 2016. "Boeing T-X is a production aircraft; it is not a prototype," Boeing has previously said of the aircraft. "The system also includes state-of-the-art ground-based training and a maintenance-friendly design for long-term supportability."

Basically, the Air Force's "assured access to space" policy mandated that the nation have two rockets that could launch DoD missions, but there wasn't enough military launches to support two companies in the market.  So Boeing and Lockheed Martin teamed up by creating ULA, which operates two lines of rockets, the Atlas V and Delta IV.  Then, SpaceX came along.  The California-based company started by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is all about dropping the price of their rockets, with an ultimate goal of reusing the entire system, something that no other company currently does.  They have already landed 10 booster stages after they launched a mission, but they have only reused one of those so far.  SpaceX claims they can drop the price of launch by as much as 80% though reusability.  SpaceX eventually went after the military launch certification as well, obtaining it for the Falcon 9 rocket in 2015.  The first launch they could submit a bid for was the NROL-76 mission, and they won the contract in a no contest decision because ULA did not submit a bid, citing lack of engines and inability to provide a competitive bid because of the way their accounting systems operated on what's called a "block buy" policy.  The mission launched successfully, and SpaceX landed the booster yet again.  There's not much information out there about what the NROL-76 payload is or what it will be doing, but that's standard procedure for NRO missions.  Spy agencies like their secrets.  ULA has since resumed bidding on military launches, putting forward their workhorse, and cheaper, Atlas V rocket.  They have plans to phase out both the Atlas V and Delta IV vehicles since they do not have to maintain two rockets with the Falcon 9 flying military missions.   Eventually, ULA hopes to fly the Vulcan rocket by the end of the decade, which in some ways, is a combination of the Atlas V and Delta IV.  They say maintaining a single rocket line and its associated infrastructure, as well as designing it to be manufactured as efficiently as possible, will drop the price of their launches significantly, making them more competitive in both the commercial, civil and military launch markets.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and banks. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) TOKYO (AP) — Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. “The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating,” Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market’s anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings,” said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine — AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

John Raoux/AP | Caption Loading... Weston Williams Staff | @westonwolf359 May 1, 2017 —On Monday morning, the private space company SpaceX launched their latest Falcon 9 rocket into orbit. But while the company has launched several payloads into space for a number of clients, this mission was a little bit different. Instead of the more typical communications satellite or scientific equipment, the rocket carried a spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). The NRO is an agency of the US Department of Defense. As such, the Monday launch marked the breaking of a 10-year monopoly on launching US military and national security satellites previously held by the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. By breaking the monopoly, the launch became something of a coup for both SpaceX and private space companies in general. Governmental organizations like NASA are increasingly turning to private companies for tasks ranging from satellite deployment to human transportation into space, blurring the line between public and private space missions. While NASA has worked with commercial companies before, the degree of responsibility given to private companies like SpaceX has risen considerably in recent years, according to Mariel Borowitz, a technology and space policy specialist and associate professor at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology. "Private space launch companies have been around for a long time – Arianespace became the first commercial launch company in 1980, and Orbital Sciences, Lockheed, and Boeing have been involved in commercial launch activities since the 1990s," Dr. Borowitz tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email. "What's different now is that NASA is relying fully on commercial entities to provide the ability to launch cargo and crew to low Earth orbit," she adds. "The transition to a reliance on private industry occurred because there was a realization that travel to low Earth orbit has become more routine and can safely be handed off to commercial entities. Relying on companies to transport cargo and humans to the Space Station and other locations in low Earth orbit allows NASA to focus its efforts on cutting edge technologies, like the heavy lift launch capabilities needed to travel to the moon or Mars." Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Of course, sending satellites (and eventually astronauts) into orbit at the behest of NASA is one thing, but sending a classified NRO satellite into space carries a different set of challenges. For instance, SpaceX was not allowed to provide any details about the Falcon 9's cargo and gave no news about the rocket's trajectory beyond confirming second stage ignition. In addition, the company was also required to cut off the broadcast of the launch after a few minutes, which is standard practice for NRO missions. Despite the lack of specifics, the launch appeared to go off without a hitch, after a one-day delay to resolve an issue with an engine sensor. The SpaceX team achieved even the mission's secondary goal of returning the booster to Earth for later re-use – a feature the company has touted as an example of the cost-effective and innovative features of commercial rockets for potential clients, including the US government. "Working with the private sector in the way NASA has with the Commercial Orbital Transportation Program and the Commercial Crew Program allows the agency to take advantage of innovation and unique capabilities in the private sector," says Borowitz. "Working with more than one launch company ensures that there is competition in the market, which also helps to keep costs down." But while private innovation and competition have their benefits, she says, the government no longer has such precise control over the design of new launch vehicles. This means that SpaceX, ULA, and other launch providers still have to work closely with NASA to ensure safety and meet other requirements.  "It is important to keep in mind that these arrangements are truly public-private partnerships, especially in the case of launching humans," Borowitz adds. "NASA gains significant benefits by working with the private sector, but the private sector also would not be able to succeed without support from NASA." This relationship can be a lucrative one for companies sending satellites into space. But corporations like SpaceX also have their sights on space tourism, putting ordinary consumers into orbit and beyond. Commercial space travel has lingered tantalizingly on the horizon for years, but there are a number of obstacles to overcome before it can finally become a reality, says Jeffrey Forrest, head of the Aviation and Aerospace Science department at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. "[Commercial space travel] will not be as straightforward as airline travel," Dr. Forrest tells the Monitor via email. "Passengers will need training and medical screening. The environment of zero-gravity, even for short periods of time, can be tenuous on folks, even highly trained astronauts.... Long term space flight is far more challenging."

Sign Up × Still, at one time, carrying cargo into space for NASA and the Department of Defense once seemed similarly daunting for spaceflight startups, says Borowitz. "When NASA chose SpaceX and Orbital Sciences under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Program, which stated that these companies would develop vehicles to transport cargo to the International Space Station, neither company had ever flown the vehicles they were proposing," she says. "These companies have been meeting key development milestones, and we can be confident that they will soon be launching humans to the International Space Station. Once this capability is developed, the companies will be able to transport not only NASA astronauts, but private space tourists, as well." Give us your feedback, please.

Activists are targeting corporations they claim support President Trump's agenda with new #BackersOfHate campaign May Day protesters gather in Los Angeles — REUTERS By Shane Dixon Kavanaugh May 01, 2017 at 4:02 PM ET The heads of some of the most renowned companies in the U.S. may soon become targets of an anti-Trump torrent that has already damaged brands and sent politicians ducking for cover. The CEOs and board members of Boeing, Disney, and seven other corporations are now in the crosshairs of progressive groups who say these business giants are complicit in some of the most controversial pieces of President Donald Trump’s agenda. The campaign, launched by Make the Road New York, the Center for Popular Democracy, and more than a dozen other left-leaning organizations around the country, seeks to channel a groundswell of liberal outrage since Trump’s inauguration toward these companies and their top brass. “Some of America’s most well-known companies are cashing in on the exploitation of immigrants and workers,” said Ana Maria Archila, an executive director with the Center for Popular Democracy. “They can’t be allowed to operate under the radar any longer.” Corporate Backers of Hate The name-and-shame campaign also zeroes in on Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, IBM, BlackRock, Uber, and The Blackstone Group. Activists claim that these companies have cultivated ties to the Trump administration and are poised to profit off the president’s signature issues. Boeing, for example, donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration committee and has a seat on the president’s manufacturing initiative. With investments in the private prison industry, companies like JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs stand to make a mint from the White House’s immigration crackdown. The tip of the campaign’s spear is an online platform called “Corporate Backers of Hate,” which organizers unveiled late last week. The website provides details of the alleged ties between Trump and each company and lists the CEO and board members of the businesses by name. The platform then urges visitors to “Give ‘Em Hell” by allowing them to send messages directly to these company bigwigs. Activists are also taking their fight to the streets. Hundreds of demonstrators who participated in the nationwide May Day and “Day Without Immigrants” rallies on Monday showed up outside the headquarters of JPMorgan and a nearby Wells Fargo in Manhattan to highlight the banks’ financing of private Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. Around a dozen protestors were arrested, according to reports. Neither JPMorgan nor Wells Fargo immediately responded to requests for comment. Organizers behind Corporate Backers of Hate hope to seize on the surging wave of activism on the left that’s formed since Trump’s victory in November. Activists have relentlessly hounded elected officials with phone calls, emails, faxes, and protests, urging them to publicly disavow the president. They have also pressured retail giants like Nordstrom to no longer carry products sold under the brand of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and forced other companies to pull advertising from Fox News and Breitbart, two media outlets with a decidedly pro-Trump bent. “Whether we like it or not, everything is political now, including business,” Aaron Chatterji, associate professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, told Time. “We can leverage the way people interact with campaigns to the way they interact with companies.”

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▼ 182.39 -2.44 -1.32% “That remains on track,” Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg told reporters Monday following the company’s annual general meeting in Chicago. “It’s really important that at every step of the process, we’re working on this hand-in-hand with the U.S. government.” The $16.6 billion deal with Iran Air and a separate $3 billion agreement with Iran Aseman Airlines bring two of President Donald Trump’s initiatives into conflict: his campaign vows to “get tough” on Iran and his promise to bolster U.S. exports supporting thousands of manufacturing jobs. Airbus SE, Boeing’s European rival, already has delivered the initial planes in a $19 billion sale struck last year after a nuclear accord with Iran lifted some international restrictions on trade with the country. The prospect of renewed aircraft deliveries to the Islamic republic continues to rankle conservatives, who say the jetliners will be used for military purposes or to support terrorist groups. The U.S. House voted last year to block financing for aircraft sales to the Iran, and Senator Marco Rubio and U.S. Representative Peter Roskam, both Republicans, have called on Trump to intervene. “Boeing’s deals with Iranian airlines seem incompatible” with the company’s mission of protecting American values, said David Almasi, vice president at the National Center for Public Research, a conservative think tank, said at the annual meeting. Bolstering the 777 The Iran Air transaction would provide a crucial sales boost for Boeing’s 777 as sales slow for long-range jetliners and customers wait for an upgraded model that is expected to enter the market in 2020. Boeing has 124 unfilled orders for the current generation 777, the company’s largest twin-engine jet. The 15 aircraft ordered by Iran Air would give assurance that production runs smoothly in 2018 and 2019. “We’ve gone through the licensing process,” Muilenburg said. The planemaker is “working the financing structure.” If the Iran Air aircraft are added to the backlog, Boeing’s production would be 90 percent sold out for the next two years, Muilenburg said. That would lower the risk of a third production slowdown -- and of potential layoffs. The company has booked nine orders for the 777 this year and has additional sales campaigns under way, Muilenburg said. “I’m bullish about the prospects for the 777.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Airbus SE, Boeing’s European rival, already has delivered the initial planes in a $19 billion sale struck last year after a nuclear accord with Iran lifted some international restrictions on trade with the country. The prospect of renewed aircraft deliveries to the Islamic republic continues to rankle conservatives, who say the jetliners will be used for military purposes or to support terrorist groups. The U.S. House voted last year to block financing for aircraft sales to the Iran, and Senator Marco Rubio and U.S. Representative Peter Roskam, both Republicans, have called on Trump to intervene. “Boeing’s deals with Iranian airlines seem incompatible” with the company’s mission of protecting American values, said David Almasi, vice president at the National Center for Public Research, a conservative think tank, said at the annual meeting. Bostering the 777 The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up The Iran Air transaction would provide a crucial sales boost for Boeing’s 777 as sales slow for long-range jetliners and customers wait for an upgraded model that is expected to enter the market in 2020. Boeing has 124 unfilled orders for the current generation 777, the company’s largest twin-engine jet. The 15 aircraft ordered by Iran Air would give assurance that production runs smoothly in 2018 and 2019. “We’ve gone through the licensing process,” Muilenburg said. The company is “working the financing structure.” If the Iran Air aircraft are added to the backlog, Boeing’s production would be 90 percent sold out for the next two years, Muilenburg said. That would lower the risk of a third production slowdown -- and of potential layoffs. The company has booked nine orders for the 777 this year and has additional sales campaigns under way, Muilenburg said. “I’m bullish about the prospects for the 777.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Hawaiian Airlines Unveils New Brand and Livery HONOLULU, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's carrier, today revealed an updated brand identity and the freshly-painted livery of a Boeing 717 (N488HA), the first of its fleet of more than 50 aircraft that will feature the new design. Pualani (Flower of the Sky), the beloved icon of Hawaiian's brand for more than four decades, continues to gaze forward on the tail of the aircraft; beneath her, a silver maile lei with woven pakalana flowers wraps around the fuselage in a larger-than-life expression of the aloha spirit.   "Our new livery embodies a stronger, more contemporary representation of Hawaiian Airlines' culture of service and hospitality, which is the bedrock of our guest experience," said president and CEO Mark Dunkerley, who unveiled the new brand design at Honolulu International Airport during a special employee event on Lei Day, a statewide annual celebration of Hawaiian culture. "It acknowledges our place as Hawaii's airline and underscores the commitment our employees make every day to provide our guests with a gracious and genuine island welcome."         In addition to the refreshed livery, travelers across Hawaiian's U.S. and international networks will begin to see the new logo throughout their journey -- on web and digital assets, airport lobby signage and kiosks, and at boarding gates. Painting of all aircraft and ground service equipment is scheduled to be complete by 2020. Videos and images of the new designs are available at HawaiianAirlines.com/brand-refresh.            Hawaiian worked with Lippincott, a global creative consultancy, on the new identity. Hawaiian's brand team and Lippincott spent a year studying the airline's history, working with a committee of front-line employees, and immersing themselves in Hawaiian culture to arrive at the new design. "So much of our visual identity, which is 15 years old, still resonated deeply with our guests and employees," said Avi Mannis, senior vice president of marketing for Hawaiian. "Our aim was to retain the essence of our brand and arrive at a bolder, truer expression of our unique Hawaiian hospitality."        The new identity retains Hawaiian's distinctive color palette of purple, fuchsia and coral. Pualani—the singular icon of the brand—remains at its core. The new logo and livery emphasize Pualani by featuring her more prominently and liberating her from the floral "holding shape" of the former logo. She gazes proudly with the wind in her hair, adorned with a hibiscus flower and framed by a Hawaiian sunrise. The expressive, organic graphics reflect the natural forms of Hawai'i.    The addition of the lei elements to the livery accentuate the three-dimensional contours of the aircraft fuselage while also incorporating a rich, meaningful cultural narrative that reflects the carrier's strong sense of place and identity. Updated typography and bright, emotive imagery support Hawaiian's positioning as a premium leisure airline, focused on warm hospitable service.        "The Hawaiian Airlines' brand has been and always will be iconic," said Su Mathews Hale, senior partner at Lippincott. "The refreshed look honors their rich history and culture, while continuing to celebrate the unique, authentic spirit that has led the airline industry for years." Serving as a brand constant, Pualani has evolved at pivotal moments in the carrier's ever-changing phases of growth as seen in a historical timeline online. Debuting in October 1973, she was one of the first female icons painted on the tail of a commercial airline and marked Hawaiian's transformation to an all-jet airline with the entry of McDonnell Douglas DC-9s. While slight variations were made to the red hibiscus in her hair over the next 28 years, Pualani's last evolution was in 2001 when Hawaiian's new interisland Boeing 717s and transpacific Boeing 767s entered the fleet, ushering in a more competitive and sophisticated airline at the time expressed through brand adaptations representing the look of a 21st century Island woman.   The new visual identity preludes the next chapter in Hawaiian's 88-year history with the arrival of the medium-haul, single-aisle A321neo fleet later this year. It is the next step in a series of major investments Hawaiian has made to aircraft cabins, lounges, and other aspects of the customer experience over the past five years, to elevate the carrier's service and ensure Hawaiian's position as the preferred airline for travelers flying to and within Hawaii. To complement its new phase of growth, the airline will also roll out new uniforms for its frontline employees, themed Kū Mākou or Together We Stand, by the end of 2017. Since 2001, Hawaiian has more than doubled its route network, from 13 to 27 airports served, including 11 international destinations. Hawaiian currently operates a fleet of 23 Airbus A330s, 20 Boeing 717 aircraft and eight Boeing 767s. It also provides turbo-prop flights using three ATR-42 aircraft through its 'Ohana by Hawaiian service. The airline expects to take delivery of 18 new A321neo aircraft between the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2020.             About Hawaiian Airlines Hawaiian®, the world's most punctual airline as reported by OAG, has led all U.S. carriers in on-time performance for each of the past 13 years (2004-2016) as reported by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Consumer surveys by Condé Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure have ranked Hawaiian the highest of all domestic airlines serving Hawai'i.            Now in its 88th year of continuous service, Hawaiian is Hawai'i's biggest and longest-serving airline, as well as the largest provider of passenger air service from its primary visitor markets on the U.S. Mainland. Hawaiian offers non-stop service to Hawai'i from more U.S. gateway cities (11) than any other airline, along with service from Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa and Tahiti. Hawaiian also provides approximately 170 jet flights daily between the Hawaiian Islands, with a total of more than 250 daily flights system-wide.             Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. is a subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc.

By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman EnCore Group Receives “Supplier of the Year” Award from Boeing Company recognized as Global Supplier of the Year in the Production & Design Category HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The EnCore Group has been recognized as Supplier of the Year in the Production & Design Category by The Boeing Company. EnCore was one of 13 companies honored April 12 for distinguished performance in working with Boeing. While EnCore is a newer company, founders Jim Downey and Tom McFarland have a long-standing relationship with Boeing over the course of their 40 years of experience in the industry. "Being named Supplier of the Year by Boeing is a humbling experience," explains Tom McFarland, CEO of the EnCore Group. "Our goal is to be predictable and reliable for Boeing no matter what the challenge, consistently without fail." "Boeing's success is a testament to the partnerships we hold with the finest aerospace suppliers in the world such as EnCore," said Kent Fisher, Boeing's leader for enterprise Supplier Management. "Together we will continue to deliver affordable, technologically advanced products and services that give our customers a competitive edge." With a growing reputation for on-time delivery and a commitment to quality, the four companies of the EnCore Group are making a name for themselves in aviation. In 2016, EnCore Interiors dominated North American 737 MAX Galley orders and added its first two customers in the European market, while EnCore Composite Structures saw sales double since its founding in 2011. Meanwhile, EnCore International doubled capacity to meet the EnCore Group's machining demand, and achieved all required Boeing qualifications to be able to deliver EnCore's first 787-10 production parts directly to Charleston, SC, all within one year of setting up operation. And still relatively new to the aircraft seating industry, LIFT by EnCore opened their new certification facility and announced two launch customers for their first product, 737 Tourist Class Seating. This year's recipients represent an elite group among more than 13,000 active Boeing suppliers in 48 countries around the world. This selection was based on stringent performance criteria for quality performance, delivery performance, cost, environmental initiatives, customer service, and technical expertise. About the EnCore Group Founded in 2011 by Jim Downey and Tom McFarland, the EnCore Group is comprised of four dedicated aerospace companies, each with its own specific focus. EnCore Interiors is a full floor-to-floor design, manufacturing, and certification company. They offer galleys, lavatories, class dividers, closets, flooring, and other components. EnCore Composite Structures has become a leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered components that utilize composite and other lightweight materials for commercial and military applications. EnCore International is a multi-process facility that opened in November 2015 to support the EnCore Group's growing production needs. By utilizing new manufacturing technologies, they are able to work fluidly with the other companies in the group to offer support and expedite production. LIFT by EnCore is an airline seating supplier with a focus on revolutionizing the industry by delivering superior results.

Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday.

The 23-story tall rocket took off from its seaside launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. It will put into orbit a classified satellite for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, an agency within the Defense Department that operates the nation's spy satellites. Nine minutes after takeoff, the rocket's main section touched down on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just south of Nasa's spaceport. Last month, Space Exploration Technologies Corp flew its first recovered booster on a second mission, a key step in company founder Elon Musk's quest to cut launch costs. Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket carrying a classified satellite lifts off from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral Credit: AP/John Raoux The National Reconnaissance Office bought SpaceX's launch services via a contract with Ball Aerospace, a Colorado-based satellite and instrument builder. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. Musk battled for years to break the monopoly on the military's launch business held by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. SpaceX sued the U.S. Air Force in 2014 over its exclusive multibillion-dollar contract with United Launch Alliance. The company later dropped the suit after the military agreed to open more launch contacts to competitive bidding. SpaceX has since won two launch contracts from the Air Force to send up Global Positioning System satellites in 2018 and 2019. Monday's launch was the 34th mission for SpaceX and the fifth of more than 20 flights planned for this year. The privately owned firm, based in Hawthorne, California, has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth about $10 billion.

The 23-story tall rocket took off from its seaside launch pad at Kennedy Space Center at 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT.) It will put into orbit a classified satellite for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office, an agency within the Defense Department that operates the nation's spy satellites. Nine minutes after takeoff, the rocket's main section touched down on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just south of NASA's spaceport. Last month, Space Exploration Technologies Corp flew its first recovered booster on a second mission, a key step in company founder Elon Musk's quest to cut launch costs. The National Reconnaissance Office bought SpaceX's launch services via a contract with Ball Aerospace, a Colorado-based satellite and instrument builder. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. Musk battled for years to break the monopoly on the military's launch business held by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. SpaceX sued the U.S. Air Force in 2014 over its exclusive multibillion-dollar contract with United Launch Alliance. The company later dropped the suit after the military agreed to open more launch contacts to competitive bidding. SpaceX has since won two launch contracts from the Air Force to send up Global Positioning System satellites in 2018 and 2019. Monday's launch was the 34th mission for SpaceX and the fifth of more than 20 flights planned for this year. The privately owned firm, based in Hawthorne, California, has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth about $10 billion.

Sean Rayford/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Sean Rayford/Getty Images President Trump addresses a crowd at Boeing's facilities in North Charleston, S.C., on Feb. 17. Sean Rayford/Getty Images President Trump has said over and over that creating jobs is at the top of his agenda. It may seem unfair to judge his progress on this goal in his first 100 days, but Trump has opened the door to scrutiny by making his own assertions on job creation. During a White House meeting with CEOs on April 11, Trump claimed his administration had already created over 600,000 jobs. "You see what's going on. You see the numbers," he said. "We've created over 600,000 jobs already in a very short period of time, and it's going to really start catching on now because some of the things that we've done are big league and they are catching on." Politics Trump Can't Bring Back All Those Jobs From China. Here's What He Can Do Since the beginning of the year, the Labor Department says, the U.S. has created 533,000 jobs. Of course, Trump only took office on Jan. 20, and the January numbers are generally attributed to the outgoing president, because the new president hasn't had a chance to put his policies in place. So, at most Trump could take credit for 219,000 jobs in February and 98,000 in March. That's a total of about 317,000 — about half his original claim. (The White House website now touts "over 500,000 new jobs.") And there's a good argument to be made that presidents shouldn't take credit for a role in job creation until well into their first term, after they've had a chance to influence the course of events with policies or leadership. Trump has announced a number of executive actions that he says will help create U.S. jobs, but so far the effect of those actions has been minimal. Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and top economic adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, points out that Trump inherited an economy near full employment. "That's a very different world than his predecessor Barack Obama entered," says Holtz-Eakin. Obama faced "hundreds of thousands of jobs lost every month," and so "a lot of job creation needed to be done." Obama managed to get a big stimulus package through Congress, along with taking additional action to rescue automakers during his first 100 days. Politics What Trump Misses About Energy Jobs In America But, Holtz-Eakin says, "the task is different now." Trump's job is not faster job creation, but switching the focus to boosting the productivity of workers, which could support higher wages and make incomes grow more rapidly, Holtz-Eakin says. That will require passing complex plans like business tax reform and health care legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Holtz-Eakin says it remains to be seen whether Trump and the Congress can achieve those goals. What about Trump's flurry of activity during the presidential transition — after he was elected but before he took office? Trump has made a big deal of twisting corporate arms to save U.S. jobs at automakers and companies like Carrier. The Two-Way Shaming Firms That Export Jobs Has Worked For Trump So Far Business Carrier Got Cut A Deal, But Can Other Companies Expect The Same? In the case of Carrier, about 800 jobs were preserved in one factory. Trump was especially vocal, taking credit for car company announcements that they were expanding factories and adding thousands of workers. However, most of the companies said the expansions were in the works before Trump was elected. Holtz-Eakin says the "direct impacts [of Trump's arm-twisting] were modest." But Holtz-Eakin does believe Trump's election may have boosted confidence enough at some businesses that they added jobs anticipating a stronger economy and stronger demand for their goods and services. He says the quick rollback of a number of Obama-era regulations also likely boosted the spirits in the business community and led to more hiring. But, Holtz-Eakin says, there's still no hard evidence to back that up. And, he says, a 100-day report card on job creation really tells us very little about what long-term impact a president will have.

Elon Musk, the visionary who built SpaceX and Tesla, has outlined his latest plan to build a network of high-speed freeways deep underneath Los Angeles, starting from a 500-foot-long experimental tunnel now under construction in Hawthorne. Musk addressed the most glaring potential road blocks, such as the incredibly high cost and low productivity of tunneling, in a 40-minute TED Talk interview Friday at the end of the TED2017 conference in Vancouver titled “The Future You.” “Right now, I think one of the most soul-destroying things is traffic,” Musk said. “It takes away so much of your life. It’s horrible. It’s particularly horrible in L.A. We’re trying to dig a hole under L.A. This is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3-D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion.” The talk came the day after a tunnel-boring machine arrived at SpaceX to dig a hole that will be used for “research and experimental purposes,” said interim City Manager Arnie Shadbehr. “This tunneling will be conducted by excavating a large bore pit almost 20 feet by 150 feet and 13.5-foot diameter,” Shadbehr wrote, in an email, adding that the tunnel itself will measure 500 feet in the SpaceX parking lot. It’s not clear if Musk will go forward with earlier plans to build a pedestrian tunnel for employees beneath Crenshaw Boulevard to link SpaceX’s parking structure with its headquarters building. “If they ever decide to undertake something beyond their private property, it is going to involve a whole slew of various initial and full-blown impact studies within various jurisdictions and geotechnical explorations to select the most feasible and cost-effective alignment,” Shadbehr said. Tunneling through the clutter But Musk said he’s going to bypass underground utilities and pipelines altogether by simply digging deeper tunnels. According to a 3-D simulation of Musk’s vision that he shared in the interview, cars would get deep underground via an elevator. “A couple things that are important in having a 3-D-tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance and exit seamlessly into the fabric of the city,” Musk said. “By having an elevator, sort of a car skate that’s on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance and exits to the network just by using two parking spaces.” Once in the network, vehicles would sit atop skates that would ferry them along a track at 130 mph. “You should be able to get from Westwood to LAX in five or six minutes,” he said. Advertisement Making digging cheaper Still, avoiding underground conflicts is only a piece of the puzzle. Digging is costly and slow. Musk has a plan to reduce the cost of tunneling, just as he reduced the cost of spaceflight. SpaceX rockets can deliver payloads into orbit at a third or fourth the cost charged by The Boeing Co. His tunnel-making business, which he dubbed The Boring Co., won’t work unless he can make tunnels much more cheaply, he said. As an example of the exorbitant costs of tunneling, Musk cited the $2 billion price tag of LA Metro’s Crenshaw/LAX Line extension connecting the Green Line in El Segundo to the Expo Line in South Los Angeles. It will open in 2019 but the tunneling finished earlier this month. “The L.A. subway extension, a 2.5-mile extension, was just completed for $2 billion. This is not the highest utility subway in the world so, yeah, it’s quite difficult to dig tunnels normally,” Musk said. “I think we have to have at least a 10-fold improvement in the cost-per-mile of tunneling.” To get there, he wants to reduce the diameter of single-lane traffic tunnels by more than half, to 12 feet. The second upgrade would be to make it possible for tunnel-boring machines to work constantly. As it is, the machines only work about half the time they’re underground because workers have to stop digging to periodically reinforce tunnel walls, he said. In addition to constant digging, Musk wants to amp up the power of his tunnel borer. “These machines are far from being at their power or thermal limit,” he said. “So you can jack up the power to the machine substantially.” What’s more, he said, “there’s no real limit to how many levels of tunnel you can have (underground). You can go much farther deeper than you can go up (in the air). This is a very important point.” The case for tunnels Tunneling engineers have criticized Musk’s tunneling ambitions as naive and ridiculous. But, in his explanation, his plan isn’t only reasonable, it’s overdue. “We’ve got a pet snail named Gary (at SpaceX). Currently, Gary is capable of going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine,” Musk said. “So, we want to beat Gary. Victory is beating the snail.” In planning mass-transit systems of the future, Musk says underground freeways sound a lot better to him than flying cars. “If something’s flying over your head, and there are a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation,” he said. “You don’t think to yourself: ‘Well I feel better about today.’ You’re thinking, ‘Did they service their hubcaps or is it going to come off and guillotine me.’ ” The Earth absorbs vibrations well, so deep tunneling will be completely unnoticed on the surface. But tunneling is only a small part of Musk’s visions of the future. He only spends “2 or 3 percent” of his time working on tunnels, he said. He’s busy revolutionizing space travel with SpaceX, and expanding his growing electric car and battery storage businesses. “This is basically interns and people doing it part-time,” he said. “We bought some second-hand machinery. It’s kinda puttering along but it’s making good progress.” In July, Tesla is set to release its long-awaited Model 3, an all-electric vehicle with autonomous driving capabilities starting at the comparatively low price of $35,000. Then, in September, a heavy-duty, all-electric semi truck will debut to compete with Toyota’s hydrogen fuel-cell powered truck. Both emit no pollution, but it’s not yet clear which technology is more adaptable. Musk is sure that electric power is the best bet for the energy of the future. His Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada is already mass producing lithium-ion batteries for cars and solar home and business energy storage. He has plans to add four more Gigafactories this year. Meanwhile, he’s also working to build the largest-ever spacecraft, and clear the path to human colonization of Mars. “It’s important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live,” Musk said. “If the future doesn’t include being out there among the stars, and being a multiplanet species, I find that incredibly depressing. “I’m not trying to be anyone’s savior. I’m just trying to think about the future and not be sad.” Click here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author Reporter covering Carson, Hawthorne, Hermosa Beach and the environment.

The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and President Ronald Reagan at the 1988 G7 summit. (Photo: Reuters) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Jay Nordlinger May 2, 2017 12:00 AM @jaynordlinger On capitalism, Wikipedia, Trump, Reagan, Obama, golfers, sopranos, and more ‘We are going to come first in all deals,” President Trump tweeted. The thing about deals — many deals, the right kind of deal — is that no one comes “first” or “second” or “third.” A deal works out for all. There is some zero-sum in life. Of course. But there is also mutual benefit. Years ago, someone gave me the “Thank you,” “Thank you” formulation. I don’t know who came up with this formulation. I don’t remember who introduced me to it! But I hope I will not forget it. America is a “Thank you,” “Thank you” society. The double “thank you” is part of capitalism’s nature. You hand over your money to the clerk. He says, “Thank you.” He hands you the purchase. You say, “Thank you.” Everybody’s happy. This is relatively rare in human history, I understand. Much of human history has been: Someone’s gonna get screwed, regardless. Trade deals ought to work out for everybody — ought to be in all parties’ interests. You don’t have to come “first.” You have to get something out of it. Not to be too kumbaya, but everybody is “first.” Steve Mnuchin is working overtime as Treasury secretary, it seems to me. I’ll tell you what I mean. At a recent press conference, he said that the president would not release his tax returns. Then he said, “The president has released plenty of information and, I think, has given more financial disclosure than anybody else.” Huh. Before that, Mnuchin said of Trump, “He’s got perfect genes. He has incredible energy and he’s unbelievably healthy.” Geez! I appreciate appreciation. And I know that Mnuchin is a master of the universe (to borrow Tom Wolfe’s phrase). But this approaches Dear Leader territory … The other day, I was appreciating Wikipedia (for all my gripes with it). A guest on my Q&A podcast was Eric Monkman, one of the quizzing champions of the world (a star of the just-concluded season of University Challenge). He told me that, when people looked back on the early 21st century, they would see Wikipedia as one of its glories. In Turkey, Erdogan has banned Wikipedia. Not for its inaccuracies, surely. For its accuracies. That’s a dictatorial thing to do: ban Wikipedia. On the campaign trail, Trump talked about seizing Iraq’s oil. He did it again, early in his presidency. The defense secretary, James Mattis, went to Iraq. He was asked about seizing that country’s oil. He said that we Americans “have generally paid for our gas and oil, and I’m sure that we will continue to do that.” A little later, the president said that Germany owed us a lot of money: for NATO services rendered over the years. Mattis calmly explained to a Senate committee that this was not how NATO worked. Huh. You can do that, if you’re a cabinet secretary? You can contradict the boss so baldly? Just recently, President Trump said that South Korea would have to pay for THAAD, the missile-defense system we have just put in. Then H. R. McMaster, the national-security adviser, comes along and says, Nope. I’m inclined to credit the president: for letting his men get away with this kind of thing. Or do they have a good cop–bad cop routine going? This administration will make for fascinating studies in the future, I wager. A note on Realpolitik and “idealism”: You can do business with China, because you have to. But you don’t have to heap praise on its No. 1 — the boss of the Communist party. You can do business with Egypt. But you don’t have to heap praise on its strongman. You can do business with the Philippines. But you don’t have to pretend that Duterte is anything but a murderous thug. This ought to be elementary. And America ought to stand for something in the world. In an interview, Trump put me in mind of Thomas L. Friedman. Show you what I mean. Here’s the president: You look at the rules of the Senate, even the rules of the House — but the rules of the Senate and some of the things you have to go through — it’s really a bad thing for the country, in my opinion. They’re archaic rules. And maybe at some point we’re going to have to take those rules on, because, for the good of the nation, things are going to have to be different. Friedman has the concept of “China for a day” — wishing America could be China for a day, ignoring democratic procedures, just rammin’ things home. You remember that Trump criticized Boeing, as a company ripping off the government (and thus the taxpayer). Well, Boeing has published a full-page ad, praising Trump for his magnificent first 100 Days. Okay. But is that sort of thing in a democracy kind of queasy-making? Let me quote from a recent column of mine, please — a “California Journal”: The garbage truck has a mechanical arm, picking up bins designed to go with the arm. A human being is driving the truck. But he seems to be the only one necessary. Is this a good thing, a great technological and human advance? Or is it a bad thing, leading to greater unemployment, narrowing people’s options? I suppose people have debated this kind of thing since the Industrial Revolution, if not before. So, robots will pick fruit. Is this better than illegal aliens? Or other human beings? Economics, like life — I should say “like the rest of life” — can be messy. You and I, being good right-wingers, can call Senator Schumer the “Head Clown.” Or the host of Meet the Press “Sleepy Eyes Todd.” Or the senior senator from Massachusetts “Pocahontas.” But should the president? Should the president engage in that kind of name-calling? At an earlier time, I think, there would have been no argument about this among conservatives. Shortly after he left office, the Gipper went to Japan to collect $2 million in speaking fees. Our media were aghast. Reagan was cashing in on the presidency! Brazenly! I remember what PJB — Patrick J. Buchanan — said in his defense: “This is the Reagans’ retirement fund.” I thought of this when reading about Barack Obama and his $400K for a speech. Is he cashing in on the presidency? Sure. But doesn’t everyone cash in? Bear with me: Didn’t Elvis Presley cash in on his talent? His looks, his voice, his personality — all of it? Apples and oranges! you may say. And I wouldn’t argue with you. But this is a big and complicated subject — people working their advantages. In 2007, Syria was building a nuclear facility. They were doing it with the help of North Korea. Israel went in and destroyed it. Will no one thank Israel? Yes — no one will thank Israel (’cept me). (And you, I bet.) I very much appreciate the formulation of Tom Nichols, the conservative professor and writer (and historic Jeopardy! champion!): “Liberals have to stop overreacting to Trump. Conservatives have to stop underreacting to him.” Reading an obit of Tom Fleming, a marathon runner, I thought of golfers. And singers. And others. There are some golfers who love the senior tour, and play on it till their legs can support them no more. Arnold Palmer was one such. He had been one of the greatest golfers in the world. But he simply wanted to be out there, playing and playing till the last trump. Jack Nicklaus was a little different. He played the senior tour for a bit — mainly to help that tour, I think. He won everything. And then, before he declined further, he quit. I brought this up with Renée Fleming once. (She is a famous soprano.) There are golfers — pro golfers — who will only play for money. The idea of recreational golf, social golf, is distasteful to them. They are pros. Does Renée sing, just for the hell of it? On her days off, does she flit about the house going “la la la”? No, no. Back to Tom Fleming, the marathoner: When he couldn’t win anymore — when he couldn’t compete at the highest level — he quit. “He was intense,” said the great Bill Rodgers, Fleming’s fellow marathoner. “He couldn’t jog. He had to race.” I understand (though don’t expect me to race — or jog).   A word from the National Review Store: To get Digging In: Further Collected Writings of Jay Nordlinger, go here.

It’s endlessly adaptable to human needs and technological trends, unlocking incredible potential for analysis, and helping solve tomorrow’s grand engineering challenges. At least, that’s the theory. In practice, adapting lofty MBSE principles to real-world conditions can be challenging. Over the last fifty years, models have become dramatically more complex, adding more functions, non-linear interactions and emergent properties with every iteration. What’s more, systems failures remind us that for all its promise, MBSE is an inherently human endeavor – imperfect, yet filled with promise. The friction between MBSE theory and practice is one of the core themes explored by MIT’s “Model-Based Systems Engineering: Documentation and Analysis,” a four-week online course led by Dr. Bruce Cameron starting on June 5. “Our aim is to put theoretical ideas alongside real-world examples – from companies like Boeing, GM and GE,” says Cameron, who serves as director of MIT’s System Architecture Lab. “You can see examples of MBSE being used to drive business outcomes across many different fields.” Consider BMW. Optimizing its suspension systems used to mean physically swapping out individual springs, dampers and chassis components, and hoping for the best. But with MBSE, the company was able to create a new, predictive model of its vehicles that virtualized each suspension component – and simulated their effects on ride quality. This allowed for extensive iteration and experimentation without costly early-run manufacturing and time-consuming physical testing. Early-stage MBSE benefits like these are well established: Low-risk exploration of new design ideas, and simpler collaboration based on common understanding. The long-term indicators have been just as encouraging. In many cases, MBSE has not only enabled next-generation traceability, but has become a powerful tool for validation, verification and testing. While benefits like maximizing time efficiency and lowering production costs can be a siren call to aspiring MBSE practitioners, Cameron stresses the importance of critical thinking when using models in real-world situations. “Antoine Vernon, a systems engineer for a large energy company who has completed his certificate, agrees." “I've learned to be more critical of the models I’m using. Sometimes it’s best to say, ‘We do not know and we cannot tell,’ which is a difficult thing to admit as a professional.” The origins of MBSE can be traced back to work done at Bell Telephone Laboratories and the US Department of Defense during the 1940s. As the discipline has evolved, it has been adapted by numerous large organizations. However, many participants in this course find the principles applicable to organizations of any size. “I may not be able to deploy MBSE at the scale of some of the examples seen in the class, but I think by modularizing and reusing parts of larger models, the main concepts can be applied in ways that are very useful,” says recent participant Lydia Lostan, a program manager at a large energy company. This course, beginning on June 5, is part of a 4-course program “Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems”. The course may be taken individually, without enrolling to the full certificate.

It might seem to be an incredible idea, but if they completely solve the fuel problem, which is one of the biggest expense items in the aviation market, they will be profitable by almost 30%. Wright Electric has potential when we look at the core team. The core team is made up of a group of electric planes researchers working on NASA’s. The design team is made up of experienced people like who have worked on Boeing and Cessna. As a first step according to blog sharings, they will first try the system they developed on Piper Cherokee aircraft. At the same time, they are hoping to provide resources to be able to pass the concept plane to life. After that project, they plan to produce the first commercial (9-seat) planes to fly without jet fuel. According to the BBC, Wright Electric has succeeded in attracting interest from EasyJet, Europe’s popular cheap airline company. EasyJet plans to contribute their own experience with this project, which is compatible with their dream of transporting passengers from London to Paris with a fully-powered airplane over the next 10 years. Electric plane test is not a new development recently. Airbus has set up E-Fan to explore the potential of electric planes and even the first aircraft they produce has crossed the English Channel in 2015. Despite this success, Airbus has developed a hybrid version of E-Fan, both electric and internal combustion engines, because it could have been more sustainable. Wright, depending on how fast the battery industry will move forward over the next few years, they can also advance with a hybrid system. But they do not neglect to mention that airline companies will do anything ethically possible to reduce operating costs. While biological fuels are being tested in the US, there is no reason why different designs and studies are not done for electric aircraft. With such an improvement, both airline companies, indirectly customers and most the environment can benefit of it. The reduction in the use of jet fuel will be really beneficial for the environment.

Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market’s anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41. Online retailer Amazon.com stood out among consumer-focused companies as it picked up $23.44, or 2.5 percent, to $948.43. With investors reassured, they sold bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.32 percent from 2.29 percent. That sent interest rates higher, which allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans. Capital One Financial advanced $1.19, or 1.5 percent, at $81.57 and Citizens Financial rose 56 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.13. Aerospace companies struggled after aircraft parts distributor Wesco Aircraft Holdings gave a weak second-quarter forecast. The company also said its president and CEO retired, and its stock tumbled $2.20, or 18.1 percent, to $9.95. Boeing fell $2.44, or 1.3 percent, to $182.39 and aircraft and helicopter maker Textron gave up 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.13. Industrial companies lagged the rest of the market following a report that output by U.S. factories didn’t grow as much as analysts expected. The Institute for Supply Management said new orders and hiring grew more slowly in April. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 6 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver fell 42 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $16.84 an ounce. Copper rose 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.66 a pound. The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111.44 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0906 from $1.0895. Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for May Day. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6 percent. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey.

The #Minuteman Iii is an ICBM equipped for conveying nuclear bombs. Originally constructed during the 1970s, it started off priced as $7 million. Today, its price tag stands at $40 million. The Air Force upgraded the missile over the years, including its framework systems. The Vandenberg Air Force Base directed the rocket launch in California. It sent the nuclear warhead approximately 4,200 miles to a test location somewhere near the Marshall Islands. Advertisements The U.S., THAAD, and North Korea Colonel John Moss said the dispatch served as a vital demonstration of what #The United States is capable of in their nuclear abilities. Advertisements He mentioned that American missile tests are imperative to approving the viability and availability of the nation’s operational atomic frameworks. A few days ago, the U.S. started introducing a hostile rocket battery in South Korea to safeguard against dangers from North Korea. In a declaration meant for congressional staff, U.S. Pacific Command Admiral Harry Harris addressed this new collaboration and that it entails. The THAAD framework, initially produced by Lockheed Martin, anticipates its operation in South Korea within the next few days. As the world awaits, the U.S. Navy has already sent a strike assembly towards the Korean peninsula via their USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier. American plans for battle amid congressional discussion The Pentagon is the primary source conducting this whole operation. Their move comes after the White House scheduled a Senate briefing expecting to discuss their issues with North Korea next week. The leaders of the conference are as follows: Rex Tillerson, State Secretary James Mattis, Defense Secretary Dan Coats, Director of National Intelligence General Joseph Dunford, executive of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Senator Mitch McConnell requested for Trump’s political cabinet to continuously inform all congressional staff of any updates surrounding this future meeting.. Advertisements He also issued a statement during a White House press conference. He stated that Kim Jong-Un is no longer predictable in how he chooses to escalate certain situations in North Korea. In every aspect, his administration stopped making the same derogatory moves that lured the United States into a transaction that concentrated on concessions. He believes Kim seems willing to risk any objection handed to him by the United Nations by engaging in his nuclear testing programs. North Korea's becoming a severe atomic risk and a unique intercontinental challenge when it comes to Donald Trump. The president pledged to keep North Korea from having the ability to strike America with one of their nuclear rockets. Foreign policy specialists say Kim Jong-Un could have nuclear weapons ready for war in the city of Pyongyang by 2020.

In 2.01pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9 percent. In 1.46pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq climbed to a record high 6,100.73. US Treasuries slid, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher to 2.33 percent Financial markets were closed in most of Europe, as well as China and India. The Dow moved higher, led by gains in shares of Apple and those of Microsoft, recently up 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Boeing and those of IBM, down 1.1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Apple is set to report its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the market close. The latest data on the US economy were tepid. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity fell to 54.8 in April, the lowest level in four months and down from a reading of 57.2 in March. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed consumer spending was unchanged in March, steady for a second straight month. The personal consumption expenditures index—the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation—fell 0.2 percent in March, the first drop in more than a year. The reports arrived a day before Fed policy makers gather for a two-day meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday, though it has signalled plans to lift rates two more times this year. Investors will scrutinise the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday. It’s expected to show US employers added 193,000 new jobs in April, while the unemployment rate inched higher to 4.6 percent, from 4.5 percent. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston, told Reuters. "While we're starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong,” Miskin noted. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he’s actively considering a break up of giant Wall Street banks, giving a push to efforts to revive a Depression-era law separating consumer and investment banking, Bloomberg reported. “I’m looking at that right now,” Trump said of breaking up banks in a 30-minute Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. “There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we’re going to look at that.” (BusinessDesk) ends © Scoop Media BusinessDesk Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. Technology companies and banks have stood out in the first quarter, said David Schiegoleit, the head of investments at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. He said many different types of technology companies are doing well, especially ones that cater to consumers. A key reason is that after years of trouble, economies outside the U.S. are improving. “Emerging market economies are starting to get better momentum and we’re also starting to see some pretty decent activity out of Europe,” he said. “All the different major components of the technology sector are posting double-digit (earnings) gains.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for technology companies and banks to rise 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. While most banks have already released their results, there are dozens of technology companies remaining to report. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41. Consumer-focused companies also rose, as online retailer Amazon.com picked up $23.44, or 2.5 percent, to $948.43. Before dawn on Monday, Congress unveiled a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The House is currently scheduled to vote on the bill Wednesday. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. With investors reassured, they sold bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.32 percent from 2.29 percent. That sent interest rates higher, which allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans. Capital One Financial advanced $1.19, or 1.5 percent, at $81.57 and Citizens Financial rose 56 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.13. Investors also sold high-dividend stocks including utilities, phone companies and makers of household goods.

The company also said its president and CEO retired, and its stock tumbled $2.20, or 18.1 percent, to $9.95. Boeing fell $2.44, or 1.3 percent, to $182.39 and aircraft and helicopter maker Textron gave up 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.13. Industrial companies lagged the rest of the market following a report that output by U.S. factories didn’t grow as much as analysts expected. The Institute for Supply Management said new orders and hiring grew more slowly in April. Tribune Media rose after the Financial Times reported that Twenty-First Century Fox and Blackstone may make a joint takeover bid for the company. Tribune Media has stakes in Food Network, WGN cable network and owns TV stations. Tribune stock gained $2.19, or 6 percent, to $38.75. The companies declined to comment. Sinclair Broadcast Group is also reported to be interested in buying Tribune. Investment management company AllianceBernstein fell after it replaced Peter Kraus as chairman and CEO and removed most of the directors of its board. Kraus has led the company since 2008. The company named a new non-executive chairman and separate CEO, and removed nine of the 11 members of the board. It named six new directors. The stock gave up 75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $22.15. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London.

The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111.44 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0906 from $1.0895. Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for May Day. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6 percent. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey.

The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday, though it has signalled plans to lift rates two more times this year. Investors will scrutinise the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday. It’s expected to show US employers added 193,000 new jobs in April, while the unemployment rate inched higher to 4.6 percent, from 4.5 percent. “The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,” Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston, told Reuters. “While we’re starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong,” Miskin noted. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he’s actively considering a break up of giant Wall Street banks, giving a push to efforts to revive a Depression-era law separating consumer and investment banking, Bloomberg reported. “I’m looking at that right now,” Trump said of breaking up banks in a 30-minute Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. “There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we’re going to look at that.” (BusinessDesk) ends Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman While you were sleeping: Nasdaq climbs to fresh high Tuesday, 2 May 2017, 10:00 am Article: BusinessDesk Tuesday 02 May 2017 06:58 AM While you were sleeping: Nasdaq climbs to fresh high By Margreet Dietz May 2 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street climbed, sending the Nasdaq to a fresh record high, amid optimism about corporate earnings such as from Apple, while US Treasuries declined. In 2.01pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9 percent. In 1.46pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq climbed to a record high 6,100.73. US Treasuries slid, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher to 2.33 percent Financial markets were closed in most of Europe, as well as China and India. The Dow moved higher, led by gains in shares of Apple and those of Microsoft, recently up 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Boeing and those of IBM, down 1.1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Apple is set to report its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the market close. The latest data on the US economy were tepid. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity fell to 54.8 in April, the lowest level in four months and down from a reading of 57.2 in March. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed consumer spending was unchanged in March, steady for a second straight month. The personal consumption expenditures index—the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation—fell 0.2 percent in March, the first drop in more than a year. The reports arrived a day before Fed policy makers gather for a two-day meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday, though it has signalled plans to lift rates two more times this year. Investors will scrutinise the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday.

Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged.

The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. ENERGY North Dakota asks Trump for federal aid North Dakota's governor is asking President Donald Trump for federal reimbursement of $38 million in state law enforcement costs related to months of protests over construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Gov. Doug Burgum e-mailed Trump Saturday seeking a presidential disaster declaration to pave the way for federal aid. Burgum spokesman Mike Nowatzki confirmed the request to the Associated Press on Monday. White House officials didn't immediately comment on the likelihood of Trump declaring a disaster. PHARMACEUTICALS FDA OKs advanced bladder cancer drug U.S. regulators have approved a new drug that harnesses the immune system to treat advanced bladder cancer. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Imfinzi along with a companion diagnostic test for identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from it. Imfinzi, also known as durvalumab, is part of a new generation of drugs which stimulate the immune system to help fight cancer. AstraZeneca, Imfinzi's developer, says the average monthly list price for the drug is roughly $15,000, but varies with the patient's weight. It's given by IV every two weeks.

By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen.

The American flag flies above the Wall Street entrance to the New York Stock Exchange. Tech stocks lifted a Wall Street rally today. ASSOCIATED PRESS BLADE Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rose today as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. BLADE Enlarge RELATED: Searchable stock index Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. Technology companies and banks have stood out in the first quarter, said David Schiegoleit, the head of investments at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. He said many different types of technology companies are doing well, especially ones that cater to consumers. A key reason is that after years of trouble, economies outside the U.S. are improving. “Emerging market economies are starting to get better momentum and we’re also starting to see some pretty decent activity out of Europe,” he said. “All the different major components of the technology sector are posting double-digit (earnings) gains.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for technology companies and banks to rise 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. While most banks have already released their results, there are dozens of technology companies remaining to report. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41. Consumer-focused companies also rose, as online retailer Amazon.com picked up $23.44, or 2.5 percent, to $948.43. Before dawn today, Congress unveiled a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The House is currently scheduled to vote on the bill Wednesday. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. With investors reassured, they sold bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.32 percent from 2.29 percent. That sent interest rates higher, which allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans. Capital One Financial advanced $1.19, or 1.5 percent, at $81.57 and Citizens Financial rose 56 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.13. Investors also sold high-dividend stocks including utilities, phone companies and makers of household goods. Aerospace companies struggled after aircraft parts distributor Wesco Aircraft Holdings gave a weak second-quarter forecast. The company also said its president and CEO retired, and its stock tumbled $2.20, or 18.1 percent, to $9.95. Boeing fell $2.44, or 1.3 percent, to $182.39 and aircraft and helicopter maker Textron gave up 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.13. Industrial companies lagged the rest of the market following a report that output by U.S. factories didn’t grow as much as analysts expected. The Institute for Supply Management said new orders and hiring grew more slowly in April. Tribune Media rose after the Financial Times reported that Twenty-First Century Fox and Blackstone may make a joint takeover bid for the company. Tribune Media has stakes in Food Network, WGN cable network and owns TV stations. Tribune stock gained $2.19, or 6 percent, to $38.75. The companies declined to comment. Sinclair Broadcast Group is also reported to be interested in buying Tribune. Investment management company AllianceBernstein fell after it replaced Peter Kraus as chairman and CEO and removed most of the directors of its board. Kraus has led the company since 2008. The company named a new non-executive chairman and separate CEO, and removed nine of the 11 members of the board. It named six new directors. The stock gave up 75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $22.15. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 6 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver fell 42 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $16.84 an ounce. Copper rose 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.66 a pound. The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111.44 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0906 from $1.0895. Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for May Day. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6 percent. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey.

Johnson Technology’s Brilliant Factory in Norton Shores held a grand opening today, the Muskegon Chronicle reported. A company release said the 35,000-square-foot facility links design, engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, distribution and services into one system. The system collects and analyzes data to make the factory smarter, resulting in higher quality parts for the GE90 engine. There are about 2,500 engines in service and over 67 million flight hours. Johnson Technology, a subsidiary of GE Aviation, said it has hired 90 people since fall 2016, putting the company’s total employees in the state at nearly 800. The company received an $800,000 performance-based grant from the Michigan Economic Development Corporation for the project, plus a 12-year, 50-percent property tax abatement from the city of Norton Shores. “GE Aviation is one of our largest manufacturing employers, and one of the fastest growing employers in Norton Shores,” city administrator Mark Meyers said. “We’re pleased to be able to assist them in expansion.” The company’s headquarters are in the city of Muskegon, and its second facility is adjacent to the new one in Norton Shores. The facility has been operational since early 2017. GE Aviation is an operating unit of General Electric Company, and provides commercial and military jet engines as well as avionics, digital solutions and electrical power systems for aircraft.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Hawaiian Airlines Unveils New Brand and Livery HONOLULU, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii’s carrier, today revealed an updated brand identity and the freshly-painted livery of a Boeing 717 (N488HA), the first of its fleet of more than 50 aircraft that will feature the new design. Pualani (Flower of the Sky), the beloved icon of Hawaiian’s brand for more than four decades, continues to gaze forward on the tail of the aircraft; beneath her, a silver maile lei with woven pakalana flowers wraps around the fuselage in a larger-than-life expression of the aloha spirit.   „Our new livery embodies a stronger, more contemporary representation of Hawaiian Airlines’ culture of service and hospitality, which is the bedrock of our guest experience,” said president and CEO Mark Dunkerley, who unveiled the new brand design at Honolulu International Airport during a special employee event on Lei Day, a statewide annual celebration of Hawaiian culture. „It acknowledges our place as Hawaii’s airline and underscores the commitment our employees make every day to provide our guests with a gracious and genuine island welcome.”         In addition to the refreshed livery, travelers across Hawaiian’s U.S. and international networks will begin to see the new logo throughout their journey — on web and digital assets, airport lobby signage and kiosks, and at boarding gates. Painting of all aircraft and ground service equipment is scheduled to be complete by 2020. Videos and images of the new designs are available at HawaiianAirlines.com/brand-refresh.            Hawaiian worked with Lippincott, a global creative consultancy, on the new identity. Hawaiian’s brand team and Lippincott spent a year studying the airline’s history, working with a committee of front-line employees, and immersing themselves in Hawaiian culture to arrive at the new design. „So much of our visual identity, which is 15 years old, still resonated deeply with our guests and employees,” said Avi Mannis, senior vice president of marketing for Hawaiian. „Our aim was to retain the essence of our brand and arrive at a bolder, truer expression of our unique Hawaiian hospitality.”        The new identity retains Hawaiian’s distinctive color palette of purple, fuchsia and coral. Pualani—the singular icon of the brand—remains at its core. The new logo and livery emphasize Pualani by featuring her more prominently and liberating her from the floral „holding shape” of the former logo. She gazes proudly with the wind in her hair, adorned with a hibiscus flower and framed by a Hawaiian sunrise. The expressive, organic graphics reflect the natural forms of Hawai’i.    The addition of the lei elements to the livery accentuate the three-dimensional contours of the aircraft fuselage while also incorporating a rich, meaningful cultural narrative that reflects the carrier’s strong sense of place and identity. Updated typography and bright, emotive imagery support Hawaiian’s positioning as a premium leisure airline, focused on warm hospitable service.        „The Hawaiian Airlines’ brand has been and always will be iconic,” said Su Mathews Hale, senior partner at Lippincott. „The refreshed look honors their rich history and culture, while continuing to celebrate the unique, authentic spirit that has led the airline industry for years.” Serving as a brand constant, Pualani has evolved at pivotal moments in the carrier’s ever-changing phases of growth as seen in a historical timeline online. Debuting in October 1973, she was one of the first female icons painted on the tail of a commercial airline and marked Hawaiian’s transformation to an all-jet airline with the entry of McDonnell Douglas DC-9s. While slight variations were made to the red hibiscus in her hair over the next 28 years, Pualani’s last evolution was in 2001 when Hawaiian’s new interisland Boeing 717s and transpacific Boeing 767s entered the fleet, ushering in a more competitive and sophisticated airline at the time expressed through brand adaptations representing the look of a 21st century Island woman.   The new visual identity preludes the next chapter in Hawaiian’s 88-year history with the arrival of the medium-haul, single-aisle A321neo fleet later this year. It is the next step in a series of major investments Hawaiian has made to aircraft cabins, lounges, and other aspects of the customer experience over the past five years, to elevate the carrier’s service and ensure Hawaiian’s position as the preferred airline for travelers flying to and within Hawaii. To complement its new phase of growth, the airline will also roll out new uniforms for its frontline employees, themed Kū Mākou or Together We Stand, by the end of 2017. Since 2001, Hawaiian has more than doubled its route network, from 13 to 27 airports served, including 11 international destinations. Hawaiian currently operates a fleet of 23 Airbus A330s, 20 Boeing 717 aircraft and eight Boeing 767s. It also provides turbo-prop flights using three ATR-42 aircraft through its ‚Ohana by Hawaiian service. The airline expects to take delivery of 18 new A321neo aircraft between the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2020.             About Hawaiian Airlines Hawaiian®, the world’s most punctual airline as reported by OAG, has led all U.S. carriers in on-time performance for each of the past 13 years (2004-2016) as reported by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Consumer surveys by Condé Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure have ranked Hawaiian the highest of all domestic airlines serving Hawai’i.            Now in its 88th year of continuous service, Hawaiian is Hawai’i’s biggest and longest-serving airline, as well as the largest provider of passenger air service from its primary visitor markets on the U.S. Mainland. Hawaiian offers non-stop service to Hawai’i from more U.S. gateway cities (11) than any other airline, along with service from Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa and Tahiti. Hawaiian also provides approximately 170 jet flights daily between the Hawaiian Islands, with a total of more than 250 daily flights system-wide.             Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. is a subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: HA). Additional information is available at HawaiianAirlines.com.

Photo / Getty Images Wall Street climbed, sending the Nasdaq to a fresh record high, amid optimism about corporate earnings such as from Apple, while US Treasuries declined. In 2.01pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9 per cent. In 1.46pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 0.3 per cent. The Nasdaq climbed to a record high 6,100.73. US Treasuries slid, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher to 2.33 per cent. Financial markets were closed in most of Europe, China and India. The Dow moved higher, led by gains in shares of Apple and those of Microsoft, recently up 2.1 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Boeing and those of IBM, down 1.1 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively. Apple is set to report its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the market close. The latest data on the US economy were tepid. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity fell to 54.8 in April, the lowest level in four months and down from a reading of 57.2 in March. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed consumer spending was unchanged in March, steady for a second straight month. The personal consumption expenditures index-the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of inflation-fell 0.2 per cent in March, the first drop in more than a year. The reports arrived a day before Fed policy makers gather for a two-day meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday, though it has signalled plans to lift rates two more times this year. Investors will scrutinise the government's monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday. It's expected to show US employers added 193,000 new jobs in April, while the unemployment rate inched higher to 4.6 per cent, from 4.5 per cent. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston, told Reuters. "While we're starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong," Miskin noted. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he's actively considering a break up of giant Wall Street banks, giving a push to efforts to revive a Depression-era law separating consumer and investment banking, Bloomberg reported. "I'm looking at that right now," Trump said of breaking up banks in a 30-minute Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. "There's some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we're going to look at that." - BusinessDesk Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The compromise measure, released early Monday morning, would keep the government open through the end of September. Under House procedures, a vote could be held as early as Wednesday. GOP leaders eager to focus on health-care and tax overhauls bowed to Democratic demands to eliminate hundreds of policy restrictions aimed at curbing regulations, leaving the Trump administration with few victories. The White House sought funding to begin building the border wall, as well as $18 billion in cuts to domestic agencies, and both demands were rebuffed. The spending deal includes money for Planned Parenthood, despite Republican demands to defund the group over its provision of abortions. Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon, although $2.5 billion of that money is contingent on the administration delivering a new plan to fight Islamic State. It also falls well short of the $30 billion he had originally requested. Border Security Trump will get $1.5 billion for border security, but it can’t be used for the border wall or additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to one congressional aide. There are also no new restrictions on money going to so-called sanctuary cities that don’t fully enforce federal immigration laws. “Reports that the package makes a major down payment towards the president’s security priorities are encouraging,” John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement. Republicans failed to get a number of conservative provisions in the bill, including one that would have blocked the Labor Department’s fiduciary rule limiting financial advice to retirees. Congressional Republicans say spending riders have become a less important tool for the party because the Trump administration is already intent on rolling back regulations they dislike and can take many actions on its own. Overall, the compromise resembles more of an Obama administration-era budget than a Trump one. The National Institutes of Health, for example, would see a $2 billion boost, reflecting the popularity of medical research among lawmakers. The deal includes $990 million for famine aid, along with a $1.1 billion boost for disaster recovery funds. “It is a solid bill that reflects our common values and that will help move our nation forward, and I urge its quick approval by the Congress and the White House,” House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey said in a statement early Monday. Defense Increase He said the measure represents a $25 billion increase in national defense funding over current levels, when extra money former President Barack Obama secured in December is included. In addition, he noted provisions including an extension of miners’ health benefits and increases in health research and opioid addiction treatment and prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency, which Trump has sought to shrink dramatically, would receive a 1 percent reduction of $81 million in funding and no staff cuts. The deal also includes steady or slight increases in funding for agencies within the Department of Energy, such the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which would get a $17 million increase, and the Office of Science, which would get a boost of $42 million compared to fiscal 2016 funding levels, the aide said. The Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, which aims to fund experimental energy research and has been targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, would get a $15 million increase. H-2B Visas, Truckers The omnibus also includes measures of interest to the business community. One provision allows the secretary of Homeland Security to temporarily increase the cap in H-2B visas for temporary labor through the end of September — a provision sought by senators in both parties. The provision frees up space by the maximum amount previously allowed for temporary workers returning to the U.S. from other countries. The budget also includes a rider on trucker hours and increases for the NASA Space Launch System and Orion important to Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. It does not, however, change the quorum for the Export-Import Bank needed to approve deals over $10 million, so a major backlog will continue until Trump’s nominees are confirmed. Of interest to home-builders and the insurance industry, the bill contains provisions clarifying flood mapping under the National Flood Insurance Program. There’s also a new $100 million fund to counter Russian influence in Europe. Notably, agencies Trump has sought to eliminate, like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Appalachian Regional Commission, would get modest increases in funding instead. National Parks The deal also includes a 2 percent increase for national parks, including nearly $40 million in new funding to address deferred maintenance and construction needs, according to the aide. The legislation would classify power produced by biomass, such as wood, as a carbon-neutral renewable energy source, a change backed by groups such as the American Forest & Paper Association, a trade group that represents companies such as Deltic Timber Corp. and Resolute Forest Products, according to a senior congressional aide. Environmentalists have been opposed to the change. More than 70 anti-environmental policy riders in the bill were defeated, the aide said. The deal would provide a permanent, $1.3 billion extension of health-care benefits for coal miners. It would be offset by a boost in customs fees. The provision was backed by coal-state lawmakers in both chambers. The bill contains language that would prevent the Justice Department from restricting the dispensing of medical marijuana in states where it has been legalized. It also contains $323 million for the construction of a new headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The package would provide $68 million extra in local law enforcement funds to reimburse New York City and other localities for protecting Trump. Democrats’ Praise “This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday night in a statement. “The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren’t used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle-class relies on, like medical research, education, and infrastructure.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also praised the deal, saying that Democrats won the removal of about 160 partisan riders. “The bill also increases funding for wildfire and federal highway emergency relief, and for Puerto Rico’s underfunded Medicaid program,” she said in a statement. Under the tentative deal, the island would get some relief with $295 million in unspent money for territories for a limited time, said a congressional aide. Democrats were pushing for an infusion of at least $600 million, so there could be more fights ahead. Vote This Week The bipartisan deal — reached by appropriators in both chambers in coordination with party leaders — would avert a government shutdown when a one-week stop-gap funding bill expires Friday. It would fund the government through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. The House Rules Committee has scheduled a hearing for 3 p.m. Tuesday to consider advancing bill, including setting procedures for a floor vote. Agreement on the omnibus bill has been delayed by fights over a number of policy areas; Trump’s dropping of his demand last week for inclusion of money to begin work on wall along the U.S.-Mexico border was the most important breakthrough. While Republicans control the House, Senate and the White House, congressional Democrats held some leverage in the talks because their votes will be needed in the Senate, and likely the House, for passage of the bill. The Senate needs 60 votes to advance legislation, meaning the 52 Republicans will need help from at least eight Democrats. In the House, passing a spending bill for the remainder of fiscal 2017 was always going to be a challenge. A solid bloc of fiscal conservatives regularly oppose big spending bills, and House Republicans have had to rely on some Democratic votes consistently since taking over the majority in 2011. Sixteen House Republicans on Friday voted against the one-week extension of current spending that kept government open. Delayed Action The spending bill package would finish the job of appropriating agency spending seven months after the fiscal year began. The drawn-out fight could have been avoided in December had the incoming administration not instructed Congress to hold off on passing a bipartisan spending measure in order to give it a chance to weigh in. Beyond the border wall, obstacles to an agreement included White House resistance to demands from Democrats to guarantee the payment of billions in cost-sharing payments used under Obamacare to offset health-care premiums for low-income people. A stronger chance for a government shutdown could come in October. Trump has sought $54 billion in defense increases paired with $54 billion in domestic cuts. Republican leaders may be less willing to bow to Democrats without the excuse of being more than halfway through the fiscal year. Congress and the president will also need to agree on a debt ceiling increase in the fall, and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney has said he wants to use the debt ceiling to impose new spending restraints.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and banks. Mark Lennihan, File AP Photo National May 01, 2017 11:49 PM Asian shares mostly higher despite soft China factory data By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TOKYO Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

The 23-story tall rocket took off from its seaside launch pad at Kennedy Space Center at 7:15 am EDT (1115 GMT.) It will put into orbit a classified satellite for the US National Reconnaissance Office, an agency within the Defense Department that operates the nation's spy satellites. Nine minutes after takeoff, the rocket's main section touched down on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just south of NASA's spaceport. Last month, Space Exploration Technologies Corp flew its first recovered booster on a second mission, a key step in company founder Elon Musk's quest to cut launch costs. The National Reconnaissance Office bought SpaceX's launch services via a contract with Ball Aerospace, a Colorado-based satellite and instrument builder. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. Musk battled for years to break the monopoly on the military's launch business held by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. SpaceX sued the US Air Force in 2014 over its exclusive multibillion-dollar contract with United Launch Alliance. The company later dropped the suit after the military agreed to open more launch contacts to competitive bidding 0 0 SpaceX rocket lifts off on first launch for US military was posted in Sci-Tech of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on May 01, 2017 and was last updated on May 01, 2017.

Request a sample report @ https://www.htfmarketreport.com/sample-report/385442-global-unmanned-aerial-vehicle-6 Summary About UAV Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred as drones, are aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight is controlled either autonomously, or by an onboard computer, or by remote control from the ground or another vehicle. The large-sized remotely pilot aircraft (RPA) are powered by internal combustion engines, while relatively small UAVs are driven by electric motors. Such small electric-powered UAVs are mainly used for military and defense applications, as without combustion, they produce low sound and are, hence, found to be more suitable for spy missions. In addition, there has been an increasing interest in civilian or commercial applications of UAVs, such as aerial photography, agriculture, 3D mapping, and wildlife protection. Research analysts forecast the global UAV market to grow at a CAGR of 12.7% during the period 2017-2021. Covered in this report The report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global UAV market for 2017-2021.

By Irene Klotz, Space.com May 1, 2017 12:15 PM EDT Share on Facebook Tweet this article Email CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A SpaceX Falcon rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday (May 1) to boost a classified spy satellite into orbit for the U.S. military, then turned around and touched down at a nearby landing pad. It was the 34th mission for SpaceX, but its first flight for the Department of Defense, a customer long-pursued by company founder Elon Musk. The privately owned SpaceX once sued the Air Force over its exclusive launch services contract with United Launch Alliance (ULA), a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Monday's 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT) liftoff of a classified satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) officially broke ULA's 10-year monopoly on launching U.S. military and national security satellites. [In Photos: SpaceX's First US Military Satellite Launch] Launch was delayed one day to resolve a problem with a first-stage engine sensor. NRO Launch Services Integrator contractor Ball Aerospace arranged for the Falcon 9 flight on behalf of the NRO, said agency spokeswoman Karen Furgerson. In addition to the NRO's business, SpaceX has won two Air Force contracts to launch Global Positioning System satellites in 2018 and 2019. For now, the military's business is a fraction of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion, slated to fly on SpaceX rockets. But with up to 13 more military satellite launches open for competitive bidding in the next few years and ULA's lucrative sole-source contract due to end in 2019, SpaceX is angling to become a major launch service provider to the Department of Defense. At the request of the NRO, SpaceX cut off launch coverage 2 minutes and 48 seconds after liftoff, some 30 seconds after the booster’s first-stage separated from the upper-stage. At that time, the rocket's second-stage had fired up to carry the spy satellite into a low-Earth orbit , SpaceX’s launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration showed. The NRO declined to provide further details about the satellite or its orbit.   SpaceX continued to broadcast the booster's return flight and touchdown at the company's nearby Landing Zone 1at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

Credit: SpaceX Flickr Advertisement | Report Ad CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A SpaceX Falcon rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Monday (May 1) to boost a classified spy satellite into orbit for the U.S. military, then turned around and touched down at a nearby landing pad. It was the 34th mission for SpaceX, but its first flight for the Department of Defense, a customer long-pursued by company founder Elon Musk. The privately owned SpaceX once sued the Air Force over its exclusive launch services contract with United Launch Alliance (ULA), a partnership of Lockheed-Martin and Boeing. Monday's 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT) liftoff of a classified satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) officially broke ULA's 10-year monopoly on launching U.S. military and national security satellites. [In Photos: SpaceX's First US Military Satellite Launch] Launch was delayed one day to resolve a problem with a first-stage engine sensor. NRO Launch Services Integrator contractor Ball Aerospace arranged for the Falcon 9 flight on behalf of the NRO, said agency spokeswoman Karen Furgerson. In addition to the NRO's business, SpaceX has won two Air Force contracts to launch Global Positioning System satellites in 2018 and 2019. For now, the military's business is a fraction of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion, slated to fly on SpaceX rockets. But with up to 13 more military satellite launches open for competitive bidding in the next few years and ULA's lucrative sole-source contract due to end in 2019, SpaceX is angling to become a major launch service provider to the Department of Defense. At the request of the NRO, SpaceX cut off launch coverage 2 minutes and 48 seconds after liftoff, some 30 seconds after the booster’s first-stage separated from the upper-stage. At that time, the rocket's second-stage had fired up to carry the spy satellite into a low-Earth orbit , SpaceX’s launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration showed. The NRO declined to provide further details about the satellite or its orbit. SpaceX continued to broadcast the booster's return flight and touchdown at the company's nearby Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. “And we have touchdown! The first stage has landed back at Landing Zone 1,” SpaceX lead mechanical design engineer John Federspiel said during launch commentary. “Another good day for us at SpaceX. That is a beautiful sight to see.” A month ago, SpaceX for the first time launched one of its previously flown rockets to send an SES communications satellite into orbit, a key step in Musk's quest to demonstrate reusability and slash launch costs.

By Todd Shriber, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 1, 2017, 10:27 am EDT Get GE alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: The 3 Best ETFs for the Rest of Trump’s Presidency The 10 Best Low-Cost Index Funds to Buy Now The 3 Best Vanguard ETFs to Buy Now Recent Posts: The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLI): The Quick Guide to XLI The 3 Best ETFs for the Rest of Trump’s Presidency Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK): The Quick Guide to XLK View All Posts The industrial sector is often thought of as stodgy and slow-moving, but that should not diminish industrials’ opportunity set in the eyes of investors. One of the easiest ways for gaining broad-based exposure to the S&P 500’s fifth-largest sector weight is with The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:XLI). XLI debuted in late 1998 as part of the sector SPDR suite of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and today is the largest industrials ETF, with $10.6 billion in assets under management. XLI’s approach to the cyclical industrial sector is straight-forward. This industrials ETF is weighted by market capitalization and its 69 holdings have a weighted average market capitalization of $70.2 billion, according to issuer data. Among XLI’s 69 holdings are plenty of familiar names, including five members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That quintet includes General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) and Boeing Co (NYSE:BA). Those three stocks combine for over 20% of the fund’s weight. The XLI: Business, Politics And Consumers The Industrial SPDR’s 69 holdings are spread across 12 industry groups that are part of the industrial sector. XLI’s two largest industry weights are aerospace and defense, and industrial conglomerates. Those groups account for a combined 43% of the fund’s weight. The 10 Best Vanguard Funds for 2017 The Aerospace and defense holdings lever XLI and rival industrial ETFs to multiple themes, including government spending and the health of the civilian airline industry. It is not a coincidence that the industrial sector rallied in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprising victory in the November U.S. presidential election. President Trump has promised to bolster U.S. military and defense spending, which benefits many of the SPDR’s holdings. Industrial companies such as Boeing are also exposed to the health of the airline industry and that industry’s need to maintain its current fleets while upgrading with new aircraft. In fact, airlines account for almost 5.7% of XLI’s weight, which somewhat exposes the ETF to U.S. business and tourist travel. Cyclical Makes Sense Another interesting element regarding the industrial sector is that its cyclical nature actually makes it a solid idea when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Interest rate hikes are usually seen as a sign of confidence in the U.S. economy and XLI has historically performed well in the rising-rate environments it has dealt with since late 1998. XLI has tight bid/ask spreads, helping to minimize trading costs. The Goliath industrial ETF charges 0.14% per year, or $14 annually on a $10,000 investment. As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

REUTERS/Joe Skipper    SpaceX Successfully Launches Its First Spy Satellite To Space [VIDEO] Andrew Follett Energy and Science Reporter 11:52 AM 05/01/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5623988 SpaceX Falcon successfully launched a classified military spy satellite into orbit Monday and landed its rocket booster. This was SpaceX’s first flight for the Department of Defense (DoD)’s National Reconnaissance Office, a customer long-pursued by the company’s founder and CEO Elon Musk. The launch was delayed by one day to resolve a problem with a first-stage engine sensor. WATCH: SpaceX’s business rival United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, had previously almost cornered the market for national security-related rocket launches. SpaceX won U.S. Air Force (USAF) certification for national security space missions last year, but this was the company’s first launch. SpaceX wants to become a major launch service provider to the DoD, which intends to launch up to 13 more military satellite in the next few years. The DoD has previously stated that it wants ULA to compete directly against SpaceX for military and intelligence launch contracts. SpaceX once sued the USAF in federal court for the right to compete for national security missions, but now says it understands the decision in this particular case. ULA has been using Russian-built rockets to launch military and civilian payloads into orbit. Although the Russian prototypes have a record of safety and reliability, some in Congress worry that American dependence on Russian equipment may give Russian President Vladimir Putin dangerous leverage over the American military.

Unmanned Russia Missions To The International Space Station Would Cut Costs By Rich Smith On 05/01/17 AT 8:30 AM Close This article originally appeared on the Motley Fool. Russia is forging a new era in space. Ever since the United States retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, NASA astronauts have had to hitch rides to the International Space Station (ISS) in Russian Soyuz spaceships -- paying Russian space agency Roscosmos for the privilege. The plan is for NASA to soon switch over sometime soon to using its own rockets -- built by SpaceX and  Boeing   (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) United Launch Alliance joint venture -- but it remains an open question when these companies will have their spacecraft ready for use. In the meantime, American astronauts must continue to fork over $82 million a seat in payment for rides aboard Soyuz. And what is Russia doing with all that money, you ask? It's using it to develop a new spaceship of its own -- a very interesting spaceship. Going where no cosmonaut has gone before -- on Russia's Federatsiya Roscosmos is currently developing a new and improved spacecraft -- one capable not just of ferrying supplies and astronauts to ISS, but also of fulfilling Russia's dream of one day landing a cosmonaut on the moon, or even Mars.  In a move evocative of both Star Trek and Russia's own official name -- "the Russian Federation" -- it's calling the new spacecraft Federatsiya, or "Federation." (Side note: The current Soyuz spacecraft design was named for the Soviet Union, or Sovyetsky Soyuz). Now here's what we know about the spaceship that will replace the Soyuz. Energia, a publicly traded Russian "rocket and space public corporation," has been working on developing the Federatsiya for more than a decade. According to new reports, completing the effort will require another five years and cost a further $734 million. In a break from tradition, the Soyuz rocket-Soyuz capsule combination of current spaceships will be replaced by the Federatsiya capsule being carried atop a new heavy-lift rocket called Angara. Another change -- instead of launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Angara and Federatsiya will launch out of Roscosmos's new seven-launchpad spaceport in Russia's Amur Oblast, dubbed the "Vostochny Cosmodrome" (the "Eastern Spaceport"). The new Federatsiya capsule will stand 20 feet tall and weigh 14.4 metric tons. Larger than its predecessor Soyuz, Federatsiya will accommodate between four and six cosmonauts. Plans are for Federatsiya to make its first trip to space in 2021, unmanned. Crewed missions are expected to begin as early as 2023, and Russia plans to conduct a manned moon mission with Federatsiya as early as 2025.  No crew, but... Now here's where this story gets weird. Federatsiya's first trip to space in 2021 may be unmanned, but Russia's new spaceship won't be going into space entirely uncrewed. To the contrary, the spacecraft will carry a pilot -- a robot pilot. According to Russian news agency TASS, Russia plans to crew Federatsiya's first mission with a humanoid robot named FEDOR (short for "Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research") at the helm. FEDOR will be the sole passenger aboard Federatsiya's maiden flight. TASS reports that FEDOR is capable of screwing in a light bulb, unlocking and opening a door, and driving a car -- and apparently, a spacecraft, too. Developed by Russia's Android Technics Research and Production Association under contract to the country's Emergencies Ministry, FEDOR was designed to perform work "in extreme conditions." To accomplish its missions, FEDOR has been equipped with both "fine motor skills and decision-making algorithms." Russia plans to test that thesis by giving FEDOR control over Federatsiya. What comes next? That's already pretty amazing. Not only is Russia developing a new spaceship, but it's developing an entirely new way to crew spaceships, too. What could be even more interesting is what Russia plans to do next. For example, FEDOR doesn't need to breathe, and he won't require a spacesuit -- so might Russia also decide to send FEDOR out through the hatch on an extra-vehicular activity mission? A few years from now, could we see FEDOR, or multiple FEDORs, land on and explore the moon itself, no cosmonauts required? The upshot of all this, of course, is that Russia appears set on blazing new trails in space -- even as NASA under the Trump administration endures small but significant budget cuts. Adding insult to injury, Russia is doing all this on our dime -- and will continue to do so until SpaceX, Boeing, and Lockheed get their act together and begin launching their space shuttle replacements. Only then will NASA be able to stop paying Roscosmos for astronaut rides and begin spending that money on developing our own space program again.  Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Rahul Jadhav Global Commercial and Military Aircraft MRO Market Current Scenario 2017 and Future Growth Prospects to 2021 Summary Orbis Research Presents Global Commercial and Military Aircraft MRO Market 2017-2021 has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. Description Global Commercial and Military Aircraft MRO Market 2017-2021 The Following Companies As The Key Players In The Global Commercial And Military Aircraft Mro Market: AAR, Airbus Group, Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins, SIA Engineering Company, and Singapore Technologies Aerospace. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: AMECO, Aviation Technical Services, Delta TechOps, DynCorp International, Elbit Systems, Evergreen Aviation Technologies, Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering (HAECO), Lufthansa Technik, Monarch Aircraft Engineering, SR Technics, StandardAero, and Thales. Commenting on the report, “One trend in market is employment of cold repair technologies. Cold metal transfer (CMT), an NDT technique, is a technology that can replace conventional tungsten inert gas and metal inert gas welding for joining light-gauge sheet metal. Unlike CMT, metal inert gas and tungsten inert gas create excessive amounts of heat and often lead to the undesired phenomena of melt back and warping, which can damage the workpiece.” According to the report, one driver in market is service-life extension of military aircraft. Over the last 15 years, wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia, and Libya have witnessed extensive use of all varieties of aircraft, which has resulted in rapid wear and tear and depletion of jets. Countries involved in wars rely heavily on aerial attacks as they help them to respond within a short period of time and with greater impact on enemy forces. After the wars, these fleets of aircraft have returned to their respective country bases and need maintenance and upgrades. Additionally, the last few years have witnessed vast changes in warfare strategies and tactics. Therefore, countries are constantly leveraging R&D and innovation techniques to ensure that their armed forces remain well-equipped with the latest modern military platforms and technologies. Get a PDF Sample of Global Commercial and Military Aircraft MRO Market Research Report @: http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/275297 Further, the report states that one challenges in market is challenges due to high cost and unavailability of spare parts. Military aircraft are expensive to maintain and operate, and hence, require substantial funding for the upgrade and retrofit of fleets. For example, in 2012, the upgrade of 350 F-16s of the USAF with Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System, to reduce the instances of controlled flight into terrain, was conducted at a budget of $2.8 billion. In a scenario where major military powers such as the US and several European countries are limiting their defense expenditure, the market for military aircraft upgrade and retrofit is expected to see considerable negative impact. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

The NATO Support and Procurement Agency requested to purchase follow-on technical and maintenance support services for three C-17 planes as well as spare and repair parts, inspections, retrofit and modification, in-country contractor services and training support under a potential $300 million FMS contract, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said Friday. Boeing will serve as the prime contractor in the transaction that seeks to help NATO expand strategic airlift and deployment capabilities to other allies in support of contingency missions outside Europe.

Nicholas Quartermont stands in the Air Force Research Laboratory's anti-echo chamber for microwave technology testing at Kirtland Air Force Base. (Adolphe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........Copyright © 2017 Albuquerque Journal Massive ray guns that use microwaves to instantaneously down a swarm of incoming enemy drones are approaching prime-time reality, and could propel New Mexico into a leadership role in the next wave of modern defense technology. The Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base is leading an effort to move such weapons out of the lab and into the hands of war fighters, with help from industry partners like Raytheon Missile Systems’ Ktech division in Albuquerque. Those efforts have strong backing from New Mexico’s congressional delegation, particularly from Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich, who is spearheading a push to pump more federal spending into development programs and to encourage the Pentagon to move faster on deployment. Advertisement Continue reading “This technology using microwaves and lasers is ready for prime time,” Heinrich told the Journal. “We’ve spent a lot on research and development over the years, but today we’re now capable of shooting down rockets, missiles or mortars that could put our troops in danger. It’s developed enough to go beyond research and put this technology into the hands of Americans to make a difference.” This is a mock-up of the CHAMP cruise missile microwave system shooting an electromagnetic wave. (Air Force Research Laboratory) The military has concentrated in recent years on advancing laser weapons for fighter aircraft, Navy ships and Army vehicles. But alongside that work, the Air Force lab in Albuquerque has done extensive research and development for decades on microwave, or high-power electromagnetic technology, to build systems that could add another layer of defense alongside lasers and conventional missiles and explosives – ones that would destroy enemy systems without harming civilians or infrastructure. Mary Lou Robinson Mary Lou Robinson, chief of the High Power Electromagnetics Division at the Air Force lab, calls it game-changing technology. “This is not evolutionary improvement in the way we fight wars, but a revolutionary improvement,” Robinson said. “Directed energy systems (lasers and microwaves) have been called ‘systems of the future.’ They are the future, but the future is now.” The Air Force lab’s role in laser-related work helped build a powerful industry cluster in New Mexico, with commercial contractors creating systems and spinning technology off into commercial markets. The same could occur with microwave technology. Apart from big firms like Raytheon and Boeing Co., dozens of small, local contractors already work with the lab on microwave technology. “The AFRL has become the center of microwave development for the nation,” Robinson said. “The Navy is partnering with us on this because of our expertise in these technologies. … Albuquerque and New Mexico are well-poised to be a center of excellence for it.” The Air Force Research Laboratory’s MaxPower System, which was deployed for nine months of testing in Afghanistan in 2012, uses the concentrated electromagnetic power system mounted on the front to destroy improvised explosive devices. (Adolphe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal) Despite decades of research, only a couple of systems have been deployed on the battlefield for actual use, or for testing and demonstration purposes. That includes the Air Force lab’s MaxPower System, which mounted a concentrated electromagnetic power system onto an armored truck. It was deployed for nine months of testing in Afghanistan in 2012 to destroy improvised explosive devices. Advertisement Continue reading The Air Force also used a nonlethal, vehicle-mounted Active Denial System, or “Pain Ray,” in Afghanistan. It causes a burning sensation on skin to disperse crowds or force people to drop their weapons, but it was never used. Now, the Air Force lab is working with the Navy to adapt its Counter-electronics High-powered Microwave Advanced Missile Project, or CHAMP, for aircraft. The technology would fly over buildings and installations to destroy electronics, computers and other systems using microwaves but no explosions. Raytheon and Boeing helped build that system, which was successfully flight-demonstrated in 2012. One of the CHAMP microwave missiles developed by Raytheon Missile Systems’ Ktech Division and the Boeing Co. (Air Force Research Laboratory) Over the past two years, Congress has approved $15 million for the CHAMP program here, including nearly $5 million for Raytheon to upgrade two original CHAMP missiles that the Air Force and Navy will now continue to develop and adapt. Raytheon delivered the first one early this year, and the second is about to follow, said Raytheon Ktech site director Steve Downie. Raytheon also developed its own “Phaser” ground system to protect bases and installations from incoming enemy drones or missiles. It successfully tested Phaser in 2013 at Fort Sill, Okla., downing two unmanned aerial vehicles simultaneously. It’s designed to take out multiple drones in a single sweep as they cross through the microwaves. “Say there are 20 incoming UAVs,” Downie said. “If they all fly through our field, they all go down.” That’s different from lasers, which must focus on one target. And lasers need a few seconds to destroy something, whereas microwaves are instantaneous. “You don’t need to be Annie Oakley if you’re using a shotgun approach,” Robinson said. “The field spreads out to include a slew of UAVs in a large area. … We’re looking at opportunities to support Raytheon’s research and development on this and demonstrate it for base defense.” If the system is deployed, Raytheon Ktech will manufacture the Phaser in Albuquerque at the Sandia Science and Technology Park, where it has a 103,000-square-foot facility. It’s adding a 72,000-square-foot building at the park this summer to better accommodate work on microwave systems and other technologies. Its workforce is expected to grow from 180 people now to 200 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Heinrich is working to accelerate military efforts to deploy both laser and microwave weapons. He called in March for establishment of a new Directed Energy Weapon System Demonstration Fund to develop the tactics, techniques and procedures for future deployment. But the Pentagon needs to get fully on board to start moving systems from lab to battlefield, Heinrich said. “The biggest challenge now is not technological; it’s cultural,” Heinrich told the Journal. “I’m optimistic, because the interest we’re seeing by other nations in these weapons is having an impact on the top brass at the Pentagon. I believe it will soon become easier to transition this technology into real systems to defend our troops.” Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe Albuquerque News From the newspaper Front Page New Mexico News News Technology Suggested Stories: Report: Air Force lab has $500 million impact in NM – Feb 13, 2015 Ktech wins bid to build directed-energy missile – Mar 23, 2016 Raytheon wins contract for 'directed-energy' missile – Mar 23, 2016 Funding bill strengthens 'pipeline' for students – Dec 21, 2016 Advertisement Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Sometimes the House of Commons makes for uncomfortable viewing, much like those graphic “wildlife: raw and uncut” videos of hyenas eating wildebeest alive. In this instance, it was the hapless Minister of National Defence who was the unfortunate victim of a parliamentary mauling over his comments that he was the “architect” of Operation Medusa, the 2006 Canadian-led offensive in Afghanistan. Harjit Sajjan is a decorated soldier, a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Canadian Regiment who was described by Brigadier-General David Fraser in a letter to the Vancouver Police Department as the “best single Canadian intelligence asset in theatre.” He was awarded the Order of Military Merit for dedication and devotion beyond the call of duty during Medusa, where he was involved in the main assault. He is, in my limited experience, an honourable man. But the architect of Operation Medusa he was not, as he now admits. He was forced to concede the fact as he apologized time and time again during question period Monday. The opposition parties, sniffing blood, called for his resignation. Rona Ambrose, the interim Conservative leader, accused him of intentionally misleading Canadians about his service record in a fashion that people in the military call “stolen valour.” She said he has lost the confidence of men and women in uniform and should resign. If he does not, she said Justin Trudeau should ask for his resignation. The law of the parliamentary jungle is such that when you’ve been weakened and are a potential liability to the pack, you’re on your own The prime minister provided all the political cover he was prepared to, when he said Sajjan still has his full confidence. But the law of the parliamentary jungle is such that when you’ve been weakened and are a potential liability to the pack, you’re on your own. Noticeably, Trudeau refused to stand and defend his minister when Tom Mulcair, the NDP interim leader, piled on. “The Minister of Defence has told a whopper about his record. That’s not something for which you apologize, it’s something for which you step down,” thundered Mulcair. All the while, Sajjan cut a bedraggled figure, repeatedly mumbling his apology, as he was disemboweled by every Conservative MP with a military base in their riding. “Bald-faced lie,” was the refrain that greeted him from across the aisle, as he rose to say that his comments were not intended to diminish the roles of his former colleagues. Sympathy was in short supply after Candice Bergen, the Conservative House leader, pointed out that the minister made the “architect” claim more than once, stating during the 2015 election campaign that General Jonathan Vance, now chief of the defence staff, had once labelled him that. “That’s not a mistake, that’s a fabrication,” charged Bergen. The Tories attempted to build the case that Sajjan is a serial offender The Tories attempted to build the case that Sajjan is a serial offender. They claim he misled the House when he said Canada’s allies were not upset when this country withdrew its CF-18 fighter jets from Iraq, contrary to evidence that emerged later; and that he said Canada has a “capability gap” in the number of fighter planes it needs, thereby justifying the expensive purchase of an interim fleet of Boeing Super Hornets, in contrast to the testimony of senior air force commanders. In addition, the opposition is asking Speaker Geoff Regan to rule on whether Sajjan misled MPs when he blamed the Conservatives for cutting the tax benefits available to Canadian soldiers in Kuwait. Then there are the questions surrounding his role in an investigation by the ethics commissioner into the torture of Afghan detainees transferred by Canadian soldiers. Sajjan, who served as an intelligence officer in Afghanistan at the time, told ethics commissioner Mary Dawson a few months ago that he had no knowledge about the matter, contributing to her decision to close down the investigation. Former NDP justice critic Craig Scott has written to Dawson saying that Sajjan was in a conflict of interest by not calling an inquiry into a matter in which he may have been involved. For a man who boasts of wearing his history on his chest, it’s a list that does not suggest meritorious service. Much of it, of course, is trumped up by the opposition parties, who sense the prospect of unseating a government minister. The really egregious decisions have been made in the Prime Minister’s Office and handed down to Sajjan, the good soldier, who has been forced to implement policies that made no sense — the decision to purchase a stop-gap fleet of Super Hornets — or prevaricate indefinitely — the long-overdue defence review and the commitment to United Nations peace operations in Africa. Sajjan has done all that has been asked of him, without, apparently, questioning the wisdom of reducing military spending to post war lows (as a share of total output). Few observers believe the new defence review will rectify that ignominious state of affairs. As the abject performance in the House of Commons illustrated, Sajjan is a naturally prudent soldier who has succumbed to the self-aggrandizing allure of politics. In doing so, he instinctively calibrates each new situation with the question: what does this do for me? Who believes that the army reserve officer would have made the same claims of the ambitious politician? • Email: jivison@nationalpost.com | Twitter: IvisonJ Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

The estimated cost is $1.46 billion. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale on April 27, 2017. New Zealand has requested the potential sale of up to four (4) P-8A Patrol Aircraft. Each includes: commercial engines, Tactical Open Mission Software (TOMS), Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) MX-20HD, AN/AAQ-2(V)1 Acoustic System, AN/APY-10 Radar, ALQ-240 Electronic Support Measures. Also included are eight (8) Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS); five (5) Guardian Laser Transmitter Assemblies (GLTA) for the AN/AAQ-24(V)N; five (5) System Processors for AN/AAQ-24(V)N; thirty (30) AN/AAR-54 Missile Warning Sensors for the AN/AAQ-24(V)N; ten (10) LN-251 with Embedded Global Positioning Systems (GPS)/Inertial Navigations Systems (EGIs); support equipment; operation support systems; maintenance trainer/classrooms; publications; software, engineering, and logistics technical assistance; foreign Liaison officer support, contractor engineering technical services; repair and return; transportation; aircraft ferry; and other associated training, support equipment and services. The total estimated cost is $1.46 billion. This proposed sale will enhance the foreign policy and national security of the United States by strengthening the security of a Major Non-NATO ally which has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability within the region. New Zealand is a close ally in the region and an important partner on critical foreign policy and defense issues. The Government of New Zealand intends to use these defense articles and services to continue its Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (MSA) capability, following retirement of its P-3K maritime patrol aircraft. The sale will strengthen collective defense and enhance New Zealand’s regional and global allied contributions. New Zealand has procured and operated U.S. produced P-3 MSA for over 40 years, providing critical capabilities to NATO and coalition maritime operations. New Zealand has maintained a close MSA acquisition and sustainment relationship with the U.S. Navy over this period. The proposed sale will allow New Zealand to recapitalize, modernize and sustain its MSA capability for the next 30 years. As a long-time P-3 operator, New Zealand will have no difficulty transitioning its MSA force to the P-8A and absorbing these aircraft into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support does not alter the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractor will be The Boeing Company, Seattle, WA. Additional contractors include: — Air Cruisers Co LLC — Arnprior Aerospace, Canada — AVOX Zodiac Aerospace — BAE — Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC)/EMS — Compass David Clark — DLS/NiaSat, Carlsbad, CA — DRS — Exelis, McLean VA — GC Micro, Petaluma, CA — General Electric, UK — Harris — Joint Electronics — Marin Baker — Northrop Grumman Corp, Falls Church, VA — Pole Zero, Cincinnati, OH — Raytheon, Waltham, MA — Raytheon, UK — Rockwell Collins, Cedar Rapids, IA — Spirit Aero, Wichita, KS — Symmetries Telephonics, Farmingdale, NY — Terma, Arlington, VA — Viking — WESCAM There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will require approximately five (5) contractor representatives to support the program in New Zealand. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded.

Companies Whose Execs Meet With The President Enjoy Major Perks By Lydia O'Neal @LydsONeal On 05/01/17 AT 1:32 PM Close Donald Trump’s White House plans to keep its visitor logs hidden from the public eye, and that decision might amount to more than a simple transparency issue, according to a new study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research this week. Using data from the administration of former President Barack Obama stretching from 2009 to 2015, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign linked company leaders’ White House visits to higher prior campaign contributions, rises in their firms’ stock prices, greater regulatory relief and more government contracts. The study, which excluded follow-up visits and meetings of more than 50 participants, also provided a possible insight into why some companies’ share prices sank in the wake of Trump’s surprise election victory last year. “Using the 2016 presidential election as a shock to firms’ political access, we find that firms with access to the Obama administration deliver significantly lower stock returns following the release of the election result than otherwise similar firms that do not have access,” the authors noted. “Overall, our results provide evidence suggesting that political access is of significant value to corporations.” Of the 2,286 meetings between executives and federal officials included in the study, the most frequent visitors were Honeywell International Chairman and then CEO David Cote, with 30 meetings; General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, with 22; and Roger Altman, founder and former executive chairman of the investment banking firm EverCore Partners, with 21. The study authors could complete their work only because the previous administration granted access to its visitor logs — a tradition Trump’s administration has broken with altogether. So far, Trump has convened White House meetings with executives in the manufacturing, tech, trucking, pharmaceutical, health insurance, retail and banking industries. His business advisory group, chaired by Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO and chairman of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, included the CEOs of General Motors, IBM, PepsiCo, Wal-Mart, Boeing and JPMorgan Chase, among others. Democrats have pushed twin bills in the House and Senate seeking to mandate that Trump disclose who visits not only the White House, but other Trump estates where the former reality TV star meets with diplomats and corporate leaders, such as Trump Tower and the Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago estate — commonly dubbed the “Winter White House.” The nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, along with Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute and the National Security Archive, a non-profit foreign policy research institute, sued the Department of Homeland Security in April over the White House’s failure to disclose visitor records. “We hoped that the Trump administration would follow the precedent of the Obama administration and continue to release visitor logs, but unfortunately they have not,” said CREW’s executive director, Noah Bookbinder, in a press release announcing the April 10 lawsuit. “Given the many issues we have already seen in this White House with conflicts of interest, outside influence and potential ethics violations, transparency is more important than ever, so we had no choice but to sue.” Obama announced in September 2009 after similar litigation that his White House would begin posting visitor logs online.National More Political Capital How Oil And Gas Industry Power Shapes Colorado Politics By David Sirota and Josh Keefe While the state is investigating a deadly explosion at a home that was just a few hundred feet from an aging oil well, Democratic lawmakers struggle to advance any bill opposed by the oil and gas industry.

Most Popular SpaceX By Jay Bennett May 1, 2017 SpaceX is all set to launch a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office this morning. The Falcon 9 is fueled and on the launch pad at Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the launch window opens at 7:00 a.m. Eastern time. The NROL-76 satellite is likely some type of Earth surveillance satellite, but little is known about the classified payload. You can watch a webcast of the launch below. NROL-76 mission patch. NRO Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Today's launch will be the first time that SpaceX lofts a national security payload for the federal government, though the private spaceflight company first received certification to do so back in 2015. The NRO usually opts for United Launch Alliance, a Lockheed Martin-Boeing partnership, when launching spy satellites. This time, however, ULA had trouble competing with SpaceX on the cost of the launch. Related Story 17 Sinister Spy Satellite Logos The NROL-76 launch was originally scheduled for yesterday morning, but SpaceX scrubbed the launch until today due to a sensor malfunction on the first stage of the rocket. You can watch a livestream of the launch below, as well as a first stage landing attempt of the Falcon 9 rocket, but as this is a classified NRO satellite, it is likely that coverage of the ascent itself will be limited.

SpaceX will attempt to deliver a classified payload to orbit and liftoff is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET from Kennedy Space Center. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)More Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. launched a sensitive mission for the U.S. military and landed the rocket’s booster on land, marking the company’s fifth successful mission of 2017. A Falcon 9 rocket carrying NROL-76, a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, rumbled aloft about 7:15 a.m. Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a livestream of the mission on SpaceX’s website showed. The launch, originally planned for Sunday, was delayed 24 hours due to a sensor issue. Roughly nine minutes after lifting off, the rocket’s first stage returned to Earth, a feat that SpaceX first accomplished in December 2015. Landing, refurbishing and reusing rockets is key to the company’s vision of making space travel increasingly affordable. More from Bloomberg.com: The Global Growth Hotspots of the Future Are Here “Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good,” CEO Musk said on Twitter. “Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit.” Minutes before the launch, Musk had warned that “winds aloft are unusually high,” calling the conditions “worrying, but not a showstopper.” Security Missions SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket won U.S. Air Force certification for national security space missions in May 2015, breaking a lock long-held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Contracts for military launches include satellites that let troops communicate on battlefields and are estimated to be valued at about $70 billion through 2030. Though SpaceX sees rapid, reusable rockets as the key to driving down launch costs and opening up access to space, the Air Force is still exploring how the certification process will need to be adapted to use pre-flown hardware. SpaceX reflew a previously used rocket booster for the first time in March for commercial satellite customer SES SA. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump Touts Achievements, Savages Media in 100-Day Rally “Unlike commercial satellites, these satellites are not privately insured -- a launch failure means the nation and its warfighters are without capability until a replacement is launched,” James Spellman Jr. of the Air Force Space Command’s Space and Missile Systems Center said in an email. “The certification process needs to properly account for previously flown hardware to launch our national security space systems safely and securely.” SpaceX plans to fly 20 to 24 missions in 2017 for customers that include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and commercial satellite operators.

Southeast Asia’s biggest carrier is expected to turn to a net-debt position as early as 2018 -- for the first time in 13 years -- as the company borrows money and sells bonds to meet capital expenditure needs, analysts say. Singapore Air, which has traditionally limited its debt load, would benefit from raising funds more cheaply through borrowings to improve return ratios and valuations, equity research firms including OCBC Investment Research and Crucial Perspective say. The airline, which has $53 billion of aircraft on order, expanded a medium-term note program by two thirds to $5 billion in April and said it intends to “proactively” take on more debt in future. “I think it’s good for shareholders,” said Desmond Soon, Asia head of investment management at Western Asset Management Co. A company that can borrow cheaply can have higher leverage, leading to an improved return on equity and thus better prospects for stockholders, Singapore-based Soon said. The carrier’s five-year average return on equity -- an indication of how efficient a company is at generating profits -- is below that of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Singapore Air’s net debt may reach about S$660 million ($472 million) by the end of March 2018, according to a report by Eugene Chua at OCBC Investment Research on Feb. 9. That compares with net cash of about S$3.3 billion for the 12 months through March 2016, Bloomberg-compiled data show. A net-debt position occurs when a company’s debt exceeds its cash and equivalents. Shares of the carrier rose 1.1 percent to S$10.36 as of 9:05 a.m. in Singapore, extending this year’s gains to about 7 percent. Cathay’s stock has advanced 9.8 percent in 2017. “Historically there has been lot of criticism Singapore Airlines’ balance sheet is lazy” because of its cash pile, said Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Crucial Perspective, a research firm focused on Asian transport equities. A “more efficient” capital structure will help its return on equity, which has been depressed because of the large cash balance, she said. Singapore Air has the smallest debt-to-equity ratio among 11 major airlines on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index at 10.3 percent, compared with 126 percent for Cathay Pacific, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Capital expenditure at Singapore Air will average $4.3 billion annually for the five years through March 2022, based on company figures in an investor presentation in November. The spending will peak in the 12 months beginning April 2018, the year Singapore Air intends to restart the world’s longest nonstop flight using an ultralong-range version of Airbus SE’s A350-900. “Our capital expenditure will be rising as we take advantage of new growth opportunities to better position the SIA Group for the future,” Nick Ionides, a spokesman, said in an email. “These investments will be financed by cash flows generated from operations, as well as by proactively taking on more debt in the coming years.” Singapore Air has 214 planes on order, including 39 long-range aircraft from Boeing Co. with a list price of $13.8 billion. Discounts are customary in the industry for large orders. The Singapore carrier is trading at 3.1 times of enterprise value to trailing 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and rent costs, compared with 8 times for Cathay Pacific, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A lower figure means investors value Singapore Air less than Cathay Pacific. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Singapore Airlines’ cost of equity is 6.2 percent, while its cost of debt is 2.6 percent, based on the latest available data compiled by Bloomberg. That debt cost is low among Singapore-based corporations, whose average is about 10 percentage points higher, making it “prudent” for Singapore Air to acquire more debt, said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a director at Religare Capital Markets in the city-state. “Debt is cheaper than equity,” Joshua Crabb, head of Asian equities at a unit of Old Mutual Plc, said from Hong Kong. Therefore “optimal gearing structures can add value,” benefiting shareholders, he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

A company that can borrow cheaply can have higher leverage, leading to an improved return on equity and thus better prospects for stockholders, Singapore-based Soon said. The carrier's five-year average return on equity - an indication of how efficient a company is at generating profits - is below that of Cathay Pacific Airways, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SIA's net debt may reach about S$660 million by the end of March 2018, according to a report by Eugene Chua at OCBC Investment Research on Feb. 9. That compares with net cash of about S$3.3 billion for the 12 months through March 2016, Bloomberg-compiled data show. "Historically there has been lot of criticism Singapore Airlines' balance sheet is lazy" because of its cash pile, said Corrine Png, chief executive officer of Crucial Perspective, a research firm focused on Asian transport equities. A "more efficient" capital structure will help its return on equity, which has been depressed because of the large cash balance, she said. SIA has the smallest debt-to-equity ratio among 11 major airlines on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index at 10.3 per cent, compared with 126 per cent for Cathay Pacific, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Capital expenditure at SIA will average US$4.3 billion annually for the five years through March 2022, based on company figures in an investor presentation in November. The spending will peak in the 12 months beginning April 2018, the year SIA intends to restart the world's longest nonstop flight using an ultralong-range version of Airbus SE's A350-900. "Our capital expenditure will be rising as we take advantage of new growth opportunities to better position the SIA Group for the future," Nick Ionides, a spokesman, said in an email. "These investments will be financed by cash flows generated from operations, as well as by proactively taking on more debt in the coming years." SIA has 214 planes on order, including 39 long-range aircraft from Boeing with a list price of US$13.8 billion. Discounts are customary in the industry for large orders. The Singapore carrier is trading at 3.1 times of enterprise value to trailing 12-month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and rent costs, compared with 8 times for Cathay Pacific, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A lower figure means investors value SIA less than Cathay Pacific. SIA's cost of equity is 6.2 per cent, while its cost of debt is 2.6 per cent, based on the latest available data compiled by Bloomberg. That debt cost is low among Singapore-based corporations, whose average is about 10 percentage points higher, making it "prudent" for SIA to acquire more debt, said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a director at Religare Capital Markets in the city-state. "Debt is cheaper than equity," Joshua Crabb, head of Asian equities at a unit of Old Mutual Plc, said from Hong Kong. Therefore "optimal gearing structures can add value," benefiting shareholders, he said.

Southeast Asia’s biggest carrier is expected to turn to a net-debt position as early as 2018 — for the first time in 13 years — as the company borrows money and sells bonds to meet capital expenditure needs, analysts say. Singapore Air, which has traditionally limited its debt load, would benefit from raising funds more cheaply through borrowings to improve return ratios and valuations,equity research firms including OCBC Investment Research and Crucial Perspective say. The airline, which has US$53 billion (S$73.9 billion) of aircraft on order, expanded a medium-term note program by two thirds to US$5 billion in April and said it intends to “proactively” take on more debt in future. “I think it’s good for shareholders,” said Mr Desmond Soon, Asia head of investment management at Western Asset Management Co.

Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. Technology companies and banks have stood out in the first quarter, said David Schiegoleit, the head of investments at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. He said many different types of technology companies are doing well, especially ones that cater to consumers. A key reason is that after years of trouble, economies outside the U.S. are improving. "Emerging market economies are starting to get better momentum and we're also starting to see some pretty decent activity out of Europe," he said. "All the different major components of the technology sector are posting double-digit (earnings) gains." The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41.

Print Story X Print Story National WAWaqar Ahmed May 1, 2017 Share Advertisement No halt to massive Indian weapon purchases There appears to be no end to the Indian defence purchases, especially since Narendra Modi came to power. Now there are reports that India is secretly purchasing weapons of billions of dollars on an emergency basis. The weapons that Indians are purchasing include anti-tank missiles, tank engines, rocket launchers, bullets of various calibers and different kinds of ammunition to be used in the battlefield. The secretive weapons shopping spree is more or less now in the open and would have strategic importance in the current scenario. Reports say that Russia is delivering several thousand anti-tank guided missiles, hundreds of T-90 main battle tank engines and other tank components. On the other hand, the Israelis are delivering unmanned aerial vehicles and several thousand missiles mainly for the Indian Navy. The Indian Ministry of Defence (MoD) has mapped out that India needs $233 billion to meet its arms and equipment requirements in 11 years. This has been calculated according to the Long Term Integrated Perspective Plan (LTIPP) for 2012-2027.  The Indian Chief of Army Staff, General Bipin Rawat, has talked about the level of "hollowness" in the Indian Army "in case of a two-front war." Hollowness is a military term that describes both lack of stocks of critical items and obsolescence in weapon platforms. The army wants to equip all of its 382 infantry battalions and 44 mechanized infantry units with a fourth-generation shoulder-fired fire and forget anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) system. India is procuring 321 ‘Spike’ systems, along with 8,356 missiles, from Israel and one medium-range surface-to-air missile (MRSAM) regiment, composed of 18 firing units.  The US defense contractor Boeing alone has won bids to supply the Indian military with 10 C-17 Globemaster-III strategic airlift aircraft (worth $4.1 billion), eight P-8I maritime patrol aircraft (worth $2.1. billion), 22 AH-64E Apache and 15 CH-47F Chinook helicopters (both helicopter deals have a combined worth of $2.5 billion).  Not to be left behind is the Indian Navy. Six Scorpene class are being built at the Mazagaon Docks expected to join the Navy by 2020. Purchase of six more was cleared in 2015. Also there is license production for Kamov 226 helicopters in India, purchase of 145 ultralight howitzer artillery guns from the US, purchase of 100 155mm tracked artillery guns, purchase of 280 aero engines from Honeywell for Jaguar aircraft and purchase of five units of Russian-made S-400 advanced air defense systems. The list goes on and on. One wonders with such massive military purchases, what kind of future India, where millions are still living below the poverty line and lack basic amenities including no proper shelters and toilets, would have. What message is the Indian prime minister giving to his neighbours? Would India not be better off today had these billions of dollars spent on the welfare of the Indian people?

Commercial and Military Aircraft MRO Market - Top Market Trends and Forecasts by Technavio Technavio has published a new report on the global commercial and military aircraft MRO market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has published a new report on the global commercial and military aircraft MRO market from 2017-2021. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail May 01, 2017 05:43 PM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Technavio’s latest report on the global commercial and military aircraft MRO market provides an analysis of the most important trends expected to impact the market outlook from 2017-2021. Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. Moutushi Saha, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) sector, says, “MRO-specific companies, as well as OEMs, perform regular inspections, repairs, routine checks, and overhaul to extend the life of aircraft. The global commercial and military aircraft MRO market is highly regulated by factors such as aircraft use, global fleet size, and air traffic volumes.” The increasing use of advanced materials in the production of new-generation aircraft has led MRO vendors to enhance their service offerings. As the newer aircraft are designed to be more efficient and cost-effective, the expenditure on their MRO is also expected to see a rise over the next couple of years. With an objective to optimize and share the high MRO costs, several countries are establishing strategic alliances and technology transfer agreements. Looking for more information on this market? Request a free sample report Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The top three emerging trends driving the global commercial and military aircraft MRO market according to Technavio aerospace and defense research analysts are: Integration of advanced weapons into aircraft In 2011, a consortium comprising European countries such as the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and Sweden developed high-speed air-to-air missiles to be installed in a combat aircraft. These missiles have a greater strike range and are guided by radar systems to chase and destroy a moving target. The missile uses a throttleable ducted rocket propulsion system that enables longer range and a higher average speed. “India has developed hypersonic cruise missiles with aerial fast-strike capability with a speed of over 3,700 miles per hour. The missile was developed like the existing BrahMos supersonic cruise missile with technical support from Russia,” according to Moutushi. Employment of cold repair technologies Cold metal transfer (CMT), an NDT technique, is a technology that can replace conventional tungsten inert gas and metal inert gas welding for joining light-gauge sheet metal. Unlike CMT, metal inert gas and tungsten inert gas create excessive amounts of heat and often lead to the undesired phenomena of melt back and warping, which can damage the workpiece. As new aircraft are fabricated largely with composites and super metal alloys, the maintenance procedures also change accordingly. To address this, MRO service providers are emphasizing on NDT techniques. Growing focus on development of eco-friendly aircraft The development of eco-friendly aircraft continues to grow from large wide-body aircraft, twin-aisle VIP aircraft completions to the refurbishment of smaller VIP single-aisle jets. The growing focus on environment-safety has led many airlines to opt for eco-friendly systems. Most of the US and European Airlines such as Virgin America, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, Air Canada, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, and many more, are using green design technologies, employing waste-reduction programs, and providing carbon-offset options to air travelers.

The 23-storey tall rocket took off from its seaside launch pad at Kennedy Space Center at 7.15am local time. It will put into orbit a classified satellite for the US National Reconnaissance Office, an agency within the Defense Department that operates the nation's spy satellites. Nine minutes after takeoff, the rocket's main section touched down on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, just south of NASA's spaceport. Last month, Space Exploration Technologies Corp flew its first recovered booster on a second mission, a key step in company founder Elon Musk's quest to cut launch costs. The National Reconnaissance Office bought SpaceX's launch services via a contract with Ball Aerospace, a Colorado-based satellite and instrument builder. The terms of the contract were not disclosed. Today's launch breaks a ten-year monopoly. Mr Musk battled for years to break the monopoly on the military's launch business held by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. SpaceX sued the US Air Force in 2014 over its exclusive multi-billion-dollar contract with United Launch Alliance. The company later dropped the suit after the military agreed to open more launch contacts to competitive bidding. SpaceX has since won two launch contracts from the Air Force to send up Global Positioning System satellites in 2018 and 2019. This morning's launch was the 34th mission for SpaceX and the fifth of more than 20 flights planned for this year. The privately owned firm, based in Hawthorne, California, has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth about $10 billion.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Omni-Lite Announces Increasing 2016 Cash from Operations, Significant Shareholder Returns and Achieves Technical Breakthrough in Aerospace Industry /EINPresswire.com/ — LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA–(Marketwired – May 1, 2017) – Omni-Lite Industries Canada Inc. (TSX VENTURE:OML)(OTCQX:OLNCF) (the „Company”) is pleased to announce audited annual revenue of US $7,179,808 for the year ending December 31, 2016. In 2016, cash generated from operations increased to US $1,965,273 versus US $1,497,654 in 2015, a gain of 31%. EBITDA increased from US $1,959,409 in 2015 to US $2,056,566 in 2016, representing an increase of 5% and an EBITDA margin expansion of 245 basis points. In 2016, the Company successfully negotiated two three-year contracts with major tier one aero-space customers. The initial total value of these contracts was approximately US $7.9 mm. These contracts allow additional components to be added at any time during their lifespan. „Sales with one of these customers is up 18% over last year and 32% from two years ago,” stated Allen Maxin, President. „The Company still sees significant growth in the aerospace division over the next several years.” In addition, the Company received a number of military contracts in 2016 that continue the important U.S. Department of Defense programs that began in 2014. These are the third set of contiguous orders in this program. These aerospace and military contracts represent a tremendous vote of confidence in Omni-Lite’s state-of-the-art engineering and manufacturing facility and point to continued growth in 2017 and beyond as the Company becomes more strategic to its customers. „To take the Company to the next level of technical achievement, while providing a major catalyst for growth, in 2015 Omni-Lite initiated a program to review the potential of converting an existing cold forming system to operate at elevated temperatures. The US $900,000 test bed developed in this program was intended to evaluate the potential for hot forging aircraft titanium and other super alloys. In April 2017, the Company successfully produced the first complete Ti 6Al-4V fully tubular component using this system. While the use of titanium is attractive due to its light weight and high strength, historically it has been challenging to create precision complex aerospace fasteners without expensive multi-stage operations. Omni-Lite’s hot forming system could eliminate many of these secondary operations, significantly reducing the cost and increasing the availability of these critical products. This technical breakthrough may lead to significant revenue opportunities within the aerospace, marine, medical, and sports and recreational markets,” stated Michael Walker, VP of R&D. „The Company has begun to interview Business Development candidates to develop and execute a worldwide sales and marketing strategy for this significant new and expanding marketplace.” Financial Highlights Revenue: For the year ended December 31, 2016, Omni-Lite reported revenue of US $7,179,808. Sales by division are summarized below: Division Aerospace Military Specialty Automotive Sport & Recreation 2016 40% 15% 34% 11% 2015 34% 30% 23% 13% It is important to note that Omni-Lite is increasingly becoming a significant supplier to the aerospace industry in a period when the industry is forecasting significant growth over several years. Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share were US $0.07 compared to US $0.08 in 2015. During the year, pursuant to a normal course issuer bid, the Company acquired 1,145,200 of its issued and outstanding common shares at a cost of US $1,450,745. The diluted earnings per share were US $0.07 compared to US $0.07 in 2015. At the end of 2016 the book value per share was approximately US $1.73 or CDN $2.32. This compares to the closing price on April 28, 2017 of CDN $1.77. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (US $) All figures in US dollars unless noted. For the year ended December 31, 2016 For the year ended December 31, 2015 % Increase (Decrease) Revenue $7,179,808 $7,479,958 (4%) Cash flow from operations (1) 2,174,333 2,136,228 1% EBITDA (1) 2,056,566 1,959,409 5% Net income 762,595 884,975 (14%) EPS (US) 0.07 0.08 (8%) Please see 2016 Management Discussion and Analysis for detailed notes and definition.

By Dana Hull. Added by Agency Staff on 1 May 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Elon Musk, Nasa, SpaceX Tweet Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched a sensitive mission for the US military and landed the rocket’s booster on land, marking the company’s fifth successful mission of 2017. A Falcon 9 rocket carrying NROL-76, a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, rumbled aloft about 7.15am Monday from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, a livestream of the mission on SpaceX’s website showed (watch the launch below). The launch, originally planned for Sunday, was delayed for 24 hours due to a sensor issue. Roughly nine minutes after lifting off, the rocket’s first stage returned to Earth, a feat that SpaceX first accomplished in December 2015. Landing, refurbishing and reusing rockets is key to the company’s vision of making space travel increasingly affordable. “Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good,” CEO Musk said on Twitter. “Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98,6% of the theoretical load limit.” Minutes before the launch, Musk had warned that “winds aloft are unusually high”, calling the conditions “worrying, but not a showstopper”. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket won US Air Force certification for national security space missions in May 2015, breaking a lock long held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Contracts for military launches include satellites that let troops communicate on battlefields and are estimated to be valued at about US$70bn (about R940bn) through to 2030. Though SpaceX sees rapid, reusable rockets as the key to driving down launch costs and opening up access to space, the Air Force is still exploring how the certification process will need to be adapted to use pre-flown hardware. SpaceX reflew a previously used rocket booster for the first time in March for commercial satellite customer SES. “Unlike commercial satellites, these satellites are not privately insured — a launch failure means the nation and its warfighters are without capability until a replacement is launched,” James Spellman Jr of the Air Force Space Command’s Space and Missile Systems Centre said in an e-mail. “The certification process needs to properly account for previously flown hardware to launch our national security space systems safely and securely.” SpaceX plans to fly 20 to 24 missions in 2017 for customers that include Nasa and commercial satellite operators. The Hawthorne, California-based company has contracts with Nasa valued at $4,2bn to resupply the International Space Station using an unmanned Dragon spacecraft and to ferry astronauts there with a version of Dragon that is capable of carrying crews.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Joe Black Future generations might think its nothing much, but I don’t think I’ll ever get used to seeing a huge machine like that, a rocket no less, making a controlled re-entry and landing smack dab in the centre of a landing site. Not for as long as I live probably. It really feels like the future came early. Patrick Frickel Totally agree. Love watching the launches.

Apple shares jumped as much as 2.1 percent to a record high of $146.68, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. Apple is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index was up 0.66 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Including the tech sector, five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. The other sectors were kept in check by weak construction spending and manufacturing data that came on the heels of weak first-quarter GDP data on Friday and ahead of the monthly jobs data at the end of this week. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said it could take up to two years to have economic growth reach three percent and that tax cuts and regulatory relief would help get there. Construction spending unexpectedly fell in March amid a pause in private construction investment after five straight months of increases. Other data showed the ISM manufacturing activity index fell to its lowest level since December, while consumer spending was unchanged for a second straight month in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. The industrials and materials indexes were little changed. “The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,” said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. “While we’re starting the week off on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong.” At 12:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.35 points, or 0.07 percent, at 20,954.86, dragged down by a one percent fall in Boeing. The S&P 500 was up 6.5 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,390.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 37.71 points, or 0.62 percent, at 6,085.32. Trading volume is expected to be light, with many markets in Asia and Europe closed for Labor Day, but will pick up through the week as major earnings reports and economic data pour in. Overall, profit at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tribune Media jumped 5.2 percent to $38.40 after Reuters reported Twenty-First Century Fox is in talks with Blackstone to buy the television station operator. Fox shares were down 0.7 percent at $30.33. Diamond Offshore Drilling fell 2.9 percent to $14 after reporting a lower quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,535 to 1,255. On the Nasdaq, 1,545 issues rose and 1,204 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 38 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 110 new highs and 43 new lows Filed under: Markets, Stocks Print Email Gmail Related Stocks Flat as Tech Gains Offset Weakness in Banks Stocks Slightly Lower as Weak GDP Data Weighs Economic Data on US, China Boost Stocks Stocks Post Mild Gains Following Economic Data Asian Stocks Gain After Wall Street Rally on Economic Data More in Business Business Briefs – May 1, 2017 Technology Companies and Banks Take Stocks Higher Twitter Shares Rise After Report on Deal With Bloomberg U.S. Maple Syrup Producers Contend With Weather Fluctuations Fed Likely to Leave Rates Alone But Signal More Hikes Coming OP-ED A Nationwide Chessed The Past 100 Days Have Been a Disaster — for Democrats The Risks of Businesses Learning How Consumers Think A Persistent Insanity Infects a Local Election The Good Tidings Let ‘So-Called Judges’ Work in Peace Trump Is Skillfully Navigating Washington’s Budget Realities Salted Bagels With Lox and Cream Cheese The Real Zachor The Shabbos Crisis Homicide Prevention Reestablishing Religious Liberty With North Korea, We do Have Cards to Play A Wall Too High Features This Day In History 6 Iyar/May 2 The Odd Side – May 2, 2017 Artsy World of Wonder – May 2, 2017 Sudoku – May 2, 2017 Editorial Cartoon – May 2, 2017 Nichum Aveilim 6 Iyar/May 2 This Day In History 5 Iyar/May 1 Nichum Aveilim 5 Iyar/May 1 Don’t Do Me Favors!

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 01 May 2017 09:40PM (Updated: 02 May 2017 03:10AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail REUTERS: Wall Street rose on Monday, boosted by gains in Apple and other big tech stocks that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq to another record high. Apple shares jumped 2.1 percent and set a record high, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index , the best performing major group this year, climbed 0.9 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Investors braced for another heavy week of first-quarter corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advertisement Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "One of the stories that really hit me was the way that earnings growth has improved over the course of the last week or so," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. "With that earnings growth picking up, I think there's a sense that that will help not only bring down valuation a little bit, but give us a little bit more fuel for the rally as we continue through the remainder of the year." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,948.17, the S&P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,392.31. The Nasdaq Composite added 48.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,095.84, and hit an intraday record high. Financials rose 0.8 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors were bracing for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 48 new lows.

The launch of the National Reconnaissance Office satellite from Cape Canaveral in Florida was scheduled for 4 a.m. California time. If any difficulties developed, a secondary launch window for the NROL-76 mission was to open at 4 a.m. Monday California time, according to SpaceX. The mission marks the first time SpaceX has been contracted to launch an NRO satellite into orbit. The U.S. Defense Department has traditionally relied on United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, for its spy satellite launches. SpaceX has done some government work in the past, primarily involving GPS satellites. SpaceX officials have not released many details of the clandestine mission, but the company confirmed it will again attempt to recover the first- stage of the Falcon 9 rocket that will carry the satellite into orbit. SpaceX will attempt to land the rocket’s first stage on a landing pad back at Cape Canaveral. The company has successfully landed rockets at the cape three times previously, and six times on a drone ship at sea. Recovering the rockets is seen as a major cost-saving step for future space missions by eliminating the need for new, multimillion-dollar rockets for each launch. government satellite SpaceX Spy US 2017-05-01 Staff Report SpaceX Makes First Launch of US Spy Satellite Reviewed by Staff Report on May 01.

The mission - for the US military's National Reconnaissance Office - blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 7.15am local time. Sonic booms rattled the area as the 23-storey rocket blasted off. The Falcon 9 rocket returned to the base to cheers from mission control, landing upright in the fourth successful solid ground landing for the company. Video: SpaceX rocket lands itself minutes after launch SpaceX has already successfully landed multiple rockets on sea platforms and aims to reuse them to cut launch costs. Its first recycled rocket flew last month. Details of what the government satellite will be used for are classified. The launch was put back a day after a problem with a sensor saw the first attempt abandoned seconds before liftoff. Image: SpaceX has muscled onto the patch of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin High altitude wind shear was also near the limit for Monday's launch, with Musk tweeting it was "98.6% of the theoretical load limit" but "not a showstopper". Billionaire Musk managed to win the contract instead of the United Launch Alliance - a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin that previously had a monopoly. Space X has also won two more contracts from the US Air Force to send up GPS satellites in 2018 an 2019. Video: Rocket blasts off then lands itself at sea The launch was the fifth of more than 20 the firm has in the pipeline this year. Its total backlog is more than 70 missions, worth about $10bn. The company is also working on a capsule that could put humans into orbit as early as next year.

The unmanned Falcon 9 rocket lifted off Monday morning from its NASA-leased pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. It hoisted a classified satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office. Several minutes into the flight, the first stage booster — its job done — aimed for a touchdown at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX strives to return most of its first-stage boosters for reuse.

Sonic booms, as usual, rattled the area around the launch site. “Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good,” CEO Musk said on Twitter. “Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit.” Minutes before the launch, Musk had warned that “winds aloft are unusually high,” calling the conditions “worrying, but not a showstopper.” The company’s first recycled rocket flew last month. Sunday’s launch attempt was foiled at the last minute by a bad sensor. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket won U.S. air force certification for national security space missions in May 2015, breaking a lock long-held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Contracts for military launches include satellites that let troops communicate on battlefields and are estimated to be valued at about $70 billion through 2030. SpaceX plans to fly 20 to 24 missions in 2017 for customers that include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and commercial satellite operators. The Hawthorne, California-based company has contracts with NASA valued at $4.2 billion to resupply the International Space Station using an unmanned Dragon spacecraft and to ferry astronauts there with a version of Dragon that is capable of carrying crews. — With files from Bloomberg Read more about: Spacex, Elon Musk, United States Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, soared into the sky atop a Falcon 9 rocket this morning, local time. About 10 minutes after launch, the scorched first stage of the rocket came back to Earth and landed upright at Cape Canaveral, marking the fourth successful solid ground landing for SpaceX. “And we have touchdown,” a SpaceX commentator said on the live webcast of the event as cheers broke out at mission control. The first stage has landed back at Landing Zone 1. Another good day for us at SpaceX. A beautiful sight to see. Live video of the launch showed the first and second stages of the rocket separating about two and a half minutes into the flight. Source: Tech Insider/YouTube The larger, first stage, made a gentle arc and powered its nitrogen thrusters to guide it back to Earth. The rocket then set itself down, gently and steadily, in the center of the 300-foot (91-meter) circular landing zone. Musk is leading an effort in the rocket industry to re-use costly parts rather than jettison them into the ocean after each launch. SpaceX has already made multiple successful landings, some on floating platforms — known as drone ships — in the ocean. Secretive payload The launch was initially planned for yesterday, but was postponed in the last seconds before liftoff due to a sensor issue with the rocket, SpaceX said. The sensor in question was replaced ahead of today’s attempt. Little was known about the payload due to its classified nature. “As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts,” a spokeswoman said. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force’s practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX to was selected to launch NROL-76 “after a competition”, said the NRO spokeswoman. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. The contract was first announced last year. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station, and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year.

EBITDA increased from US $1,959,409 in 2015 to US $2,056,566 in 2016, representing an increase of 5% and an EBITDA margin expansion of 245 basis points. In 2016, the Company successfully negotiated two three-year contracts with major tier one aero-space customers. The initial total value of these contracts was approximately US $7.9 mm. These contracts allow additional components to be added at any time during their lifespan. „Sales with one of these customers is up 18% over last year and 32% from two years ago,” stated Allen Maxin, President. „The Company still sees significant growth in the aerospace division over the next several years.” In addition, the Company received a number of military contracts in 2016 that continue the important U.S. Department of Defense programs that began in 2014. These are the third set of contiguous orders in this program. These aerospace and military contracts represent a tremendous vote of confidence in Omni-Lite’s state-of-the-art engineering and manufacturing facility and point to continued growth in 2017 and beyond as the Company becomes more strategic to its customers. „To take the Company to the next level of technical achievement, while providing a major catalyst for growth, in 2015 Omni-Lite initiated a program to review the potential of converting an existing cold forming system to operate at elevated temperatures. The US $900,000 test bed developed in this program was intended to evaluate the potential for hot forging aircraft titanium and other super alloys. In April 2017, the Company successfully produced the first complete Ti 6Al-4V fully tubular component using this system. While the use of titanium is attractive due to its light weight and high strength, historically it has been challenging to create precision complex aerospace fasteners without expensive multi-stage operations. Omni-Lite’s hot forming system could eliminate many of these secondary operations, significantly reducing the cost and increasing the availability of these critical products. This technical breakthrough may lead to significant revenue opportunities within the aerospace, marine, medical, and sports and recreational markets,” stated Michael Walker, VP of R&D. „The Company has begun to interview Business Development candidates to develop and execute a worldwide sales and marketing strategy for this significant new and expanding marketplace.” Financial Highlights Revenue: For the year ended December 31, 2016, Omni-Lite reported revenue of US $7,179,808. Sales by division are summarized below: Division Aerospace Military Specialty Automotive Sport & Recreation 2016 40% 15% 34% 11% 2015 34% 30% 23% 13% It is important to note that Omni-Lite is increasingly becoming a significant supplier to the aerospace industry in a period when the industry is forecasting significant growth over several years. Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share were US $0.07 compared to US $0.08 in 2015. During the year, pursuant to a normal course issuer bid, the Company acquired 1,145,200 of its issued and outstanding common shares at a cost of US $1,450,745. The diluted earnings per share were US $0.07 compared to US $0.07 in 2015. At the end of 2016 the book value per share was approximately US $1.73 or CDN $2.32. This compares to the closing price on April 28, 2017 of CDN $1.77. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (US $) All figures in US dollars unless noted.

Caption: Navmar Applied Sciences Corporation Skip Article Header. Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Sophia Chen. Sophia Chen Science Date of Publication: 05.01.17. 05.01.17 Time of Publication: 10:30 am. 10:30 am This Drone Once Fought Wars. Now It’s Fighting Climate Change Navmar Applied Sciences Corporation This March, a truck pulled onto a runway in Oregon, towing a miniature plane for a test flight. At 650 pounds, the plane was too large to be a toy, but too small to fit a pilot. That’s because the ArcticShark isn’t a toy, and it doesn’t need a pilot. It’s a drone. Department of Energy scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory commissioned its design in order to fly over the Alaska North Slope to take data in the Arctic atmosphere. As it flies through the air at a modest 75 miles per hour, the drone will measure the size of atmospheric particles, levels of infrared radiation, humidity, wind direction, and more—measurements that will help scientists understand basic atmospheric processes like how clouds form, which they could eventually apply to climate models. “We still don’t have a good understanding of how these processes really take place,” says atmospheric scientist Beat Schmid, who leads the project at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. But the ArcticShark’s story didn’t begin with these atmospheric scientists in Oregon. It began with America’s wars in the Middle East. The drone is the handiwork of Navmar Applied Sciences Corporation, a defense contractor founded in 1977 that originally focused on anti-submarine technology. About fifteen years ago, Navmar started making drones because the Department of Defense wanted them. The US military began using drones as early as 2000, first for surveillance—and later for targeted strikes. The DOD began calling for companies to develop more drones: faster ones, slower ones, ones that could carry heavier loads. Navmar answered one of their calls for a drone that could carry specific camera equipment. They built their first model in 2003, known as the Mako. “It kind of just grew from there,” says TJ Fenerty, Navmar’s Director of Business Development. Related Stories Alex Davies Nifty MIT Software Lets You Design and Test Your Very Own Drone Paul Sarconi The Next Great Frontier for Drones Lies in the Ocean Depths Jack Stewart Flight Lab: NASA’s Global Hawk Drones Make Science, Not War Two years later, they upgraded the Mako into a model known as the TigerShark. The US military used TigerSharks in Iraq and Afghanistan to locate roadside bombs known as improvised explosive devices—the number one cause of civilian deaths in Afghanistan in 2013. Because Navmar built the aircraft and not any of the equipment on it, they won’t comment on how the TigerShark found the bombs. In defense-speak: “The payload that we flew neutralized that threat,” says Ken Lewko, Navmar’s Director of Financial Operations. But the military’s appetite for new drones hasn’t kept up. After Obama began pulling troops out of Afghanistan in 2011, Navmar’s military contracts started to dwindle. “Defense contracts ebb and flow with what’s happening in the world,” Lewko says. So Navmar decided to expand its clients beyond the military. The company set its sights on atmospheric scientists, who have been using drones for some 20 years to take measurements essential to building accurate climate models and forecasts. They still work on defense contracts, but in the last year and a half, Fenerty has steered Navmar toward more diverse clientele, such as collaborating with the Georgia Tech Research Institute. “I’m trying to keep us balanced,” Fenerty says. A little over a year ago, they bid on a contract from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to build a drone capable of carrying 70 pounds of scientific instruments and enough electrical power to operate them. “The electrical power [capacity] really set the TigerShark apart,” Schmid says. That, and an affordable price point of $800,000 for the drone, won Navmar the contract. Related Video This NASA Drone Flies Over Hurricanes For Better Weather Forecasts The ArcticShark is basically the same aircraft as the TigerShark, but with some key modifications. Because Alaska is not Afghanistan, Navmar engineers had to re-design parts of the drone. At Alaska temperatures, ArcticShark mechanical components need special grease that freeze at lower temperatures. Also, the aircraft uses a heater to prevent ice from condensing onto the drone, which could potentially cause it to fall and crash. When the drone takes off for real next May in Alaska, trained operators will pre-program its trajectory and monitor its flight from the ground. It’ll carry about 70 pounds of equipment and enough fuel for eight hours of flight. Navmar isn’t the only defense contractor that makes drones for scientists. One popular drone for taking atmospheric measurements is the Boeing-owned Insitu ScanEagle. The military used the ScanEagle in the aughts to surveil the battlefield in the Iraq War. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association lab used the Manta, a small military-born drone, to measure atmospheric soot in Norway in 2015. “We complain about the amount of money spent on the Department of Defense, and we think it’s spent on bullets and bombs,” says Fenerty. “But a lot of that money is spent on technology that has dual use.” For example: GPS, the first internet protocols, walkie-talkies, super glue. But it’s happenstance that the military tech ends up useful for science. “Science is really an afterthought,” says Chris Meinig, the director of engineering at the NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, who worked on the scientific drone deployed in Norway. Think back to the ’60s, when the US launched the first satellite forerunners of GPS to track their nuclear submarines. It took geoscientists two decades to realize they could use them to detect earthquakes. Still, Navmar’s main concern is staying in business. Because of the ups and downs of defense contracts, Fenerty wants the company to net more scientist clients and branch out further into commercial markets. “We’d like to get into agriculture and emergency management. There’s many, many areas that could benefit from [drones],” he says. “It can’t always be about war.” Like computer hacking, fire, and words, it seems that drones—in spite of their violent reputation—have capacity for good after all.

A Falcon 9 rocket carrying NROL-76, a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, rumbled aloft about 7:15 a.m. Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a livestream of the mission on SpaceX’s website showed. The launch, originally planned for Sunday, was delayed 24 hours due to a sensor issue. A SpaceX rocket sits on launch pad 39A as it is prepared for the NROL-76 launch on April 29. Photographer: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Roughly nine minutes after lifting off, the rocket’s first stage returned to Earth, a feat that SpaceX first accomplished in December 2015. Landing, refurbishing and reusing rockets is key to the company’s vision of making space travel increasingly affordable. “Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good,” CEO Musk said on Twitter. “Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit.” Minutes before the launch, Musk had warned that “winds aloft are unusually high,” calling the conditions “worrying, but not a showstopper.” Security Missions SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket won U.S. Air Force certification for national security space missions in May 2015, breaking a lock long-held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. Contracts for military launches include satellites that let troops communicate on battlefields and are estimated to be valued at about $70 billion through 2030. Though SpaceX sees rapid, reusable rockets as the key to driving down launch costs and opening up access to space, the Air Force is still exploring how the certification process will need to be adapted to use pre-flown hardware.

Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up “Unlike commercial satellites, these satellites are not privately insured -- a launch failure means the nation and its warfighters are without capability until a replacement is launched,” James Spellman Jr. of the Air Force Space Command’s Space and Missile Systems Center said in an email. “The certification process needs to properly account for previously flown hardware to launch our national security space systems safely and securely.” SpaceX plans to fly 20 to 24 missions in 2017 for customers that include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and commercial satellite operators. The Hawthorne, California-based company has contracts with NASA valued at $4.2 billion to resupply the International Space Station using an unmanned Dragon spacecraft and to ferry astronauts there with a version of Dragon that is capable of carrying crews.

More parking made available at the International Space Station SpaceX to send first paying tourists around moon next year Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket company has launched a spy satellite – its first such mission for the US military – and landed the spacecraft’s booster on land. It is the fifth time the firm has achieved that feat this year. A 23-storey Falcon 9 rocket carrying the NROL-76 for the national reconnaissance office left the launchpad at 7:15am local time today from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The launch, originally planned for Sunday, was delayed 24 hours because of a problem with a sensor. About nine minutes after lifting off, the rocket’s first stage returned to Earth and landed safely "Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good," Mr Musk said on Twitter. "Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6 per cent of the theoretical load limit." Today’s launch is the 34th mission for SpaceX and the fifth of more than 20 flights planned for this year. The privately owned firm, based in Hawthorne, California, has a backlog of more than 70 missions, worth about US$10 billion. The Falcon 9 rocket was awarded US air force certification in May 2015, breaking a monopoly held by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket designed from the ground up by SpaceX for the reliable and cost-efficient transport of satellites and SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft and " was designed from the beginning for maximum reliability", the company said. "Falcon 9’s simple two-stage configuration minimises the number of separation events – and with nine first-stage engines, it can safely complete its mission even in the event of an engine shutdown," it added. The spacecraft lifted off from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A), which dates back to the early 1960s. The facility supported the first Saturn V launch (Apollo 4), and many subsequent Apollo Moon missions, including Apollo 11 in July 1969. Beginning in the late 1970s, LC-39A was then modified to support Space Shuttle launches, hosting the first and last shuttle missions to orbit in 1981 and 2011, respectively. In 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease with Nasa for the use of historic LC-39A. Since then, extensive modifications to LC-39A have been made to support launches of both commercial and crew missions on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles. chnelson@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Technology Mystery shopper picks up JadoPado UAE banks set up cyber-security sharing platform Huawei P10 smartphone review: just a little underwhelming Computer literacy is vital for children MOST VIEWED Business | All Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures Boardroom upheaval at Union Properties First Abu Dhabi Bank reveals new brand identity Tales of the unexpected boost Moby Mystery shopper picks up JadoPado IMF says GCC countries should accelerate economic reforms even as non-oil growth picks up Online laundry service attends to UAE’s pressing needs UAE banks set up cyber-security sharing platform DIFC firms can obtain onshore licences Marka to offload loss-making Cheeky Monkeys stake More Most Viewed Beauty blogger Huda Kattan cancels Dubai Mall appearance over security concerns Happiness Cafe opens for government employees in Abu Dhabi Dubai Font: Sheikh Hamdan unveils Microsoft’s first font to be created for a city German chancellor Merkel arrives in Abu Dhabi Newborn girl abandoned by woman on steps of Sharjah Children Protection Department Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q1 2017 – in pictures Boardroom upheaval at Union Properties Bollywood ‘megamovie’ starring Salman Khan to shoot in Abu Dhabi First Abu Dhabi Bank reveals new brand identity Abu Dhabi taxi fares increase for first time in five years More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Push to promote Abu Dhabi as medical tourism destination First look at Warner Bros World Abu Dhabi theme park attractions – in pictures Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed meets Angela Merkel in Abu Dhabi - in pictures Marka to offload loss-making Cheeky Monkeys stake Switch to Mobile Site About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

A sensor issue delays the launch of NROL-76. Photo from SpaceX MIAMI, United States – SpaceX on Sunday, April 30, postponed for 24 hours the launch of a secretive US government payload, known only as NROL-76, due to a "sensor issue" with the rocket, a spokesman said. "Out of an abundance of caution we have decided to scrub today's launch," a SpaceX spokesman said, describing the issue as relating to the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. Another opportunity for launch opens Monday, May 1, at 7:00 am (1100 GMT). The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, will be the first military launch for the California-based aerospace company headed by billionaire tycoon Elon Musk. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," a spokeswoman told Agence France-Presse. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force's practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX was selected to launch NROL-76 "after a competition," said the NRO spokeswoman. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. It was first announced last year. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station, and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year. – Rappler.com Filed under:Falcon 9•SpaceX•NROL-76 HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Copyright Win McNamee, Getty Images Advertisement U.S. House and Senate negotiators reached a bipartisan deal on a $1.1 trillion spending bill that largely tracks with Democratic priorities and rejects most of President Donald Trump’s wish list, including money to begin building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. The compromise measure, released early Monday morning, would keep the government open through the end of September. Under House procedures, a vote could be held as early as Wednesday.  GOP leaders eager to focus on health-care and tax overhauls bowed to Democratic demands to eliminate hundreds of policy restrictions aimed at curbing regulations, leaving the Trump administration with few victories. The White House sought funding to begin building the border wall, as well as $18 billion in cuts to domestic agencies, and both demands were rebuffed. The spending deal includes money for Planned Parenthood, despite Republican demands to defund the group over its provision of abortions. Popular Now Tool and Dying: Auto Leaders, From Ford to FCA, Brainstorm on Saving the Shops that Sustain Them Achieving Competitive Advantage Through Supply Chain Management How to Build More Impactful Centers of Excellence Trump will be able to point to a $15 billion boost for the Pentagon, although $2.5 billion of that money is contingent on the administration delivering a new plan to fight Islamic State. It also falls well short of the $30 billion he had originally requested. Border Security Trump will get $1.5 billion for border security, but it can’t be used for the border wall or additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to one congressional aide. There are also no new restrictions on money going to so-called sanctuary cities that don’t fully enforce federal immigration laws. “Reports that the package makes a major down payment towards the president’s security priorities are encouraging,” John Czwartacki, a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement. Republicans failed to get a number of conservative provisions in the bill, including one that would have blocked the Labor Department’s fiduciary rule limiting financial advice to retirees. Congressional Republicans say spending riders have become a less important tool for the party because the Trump administration is already intent on rolling back regulations they dislike and can take many actions on its own. Overall, the compromise resembles more of an Obama administration-era budget than a Trump one. The National Institutes of Health, for example, would see a $2 billion boost, reflecting the popularity of medical research among lawmakers. The deal includes $990 million for famine aid, along with a $1.1 billion boost for disaster recovery funds. “It is a solid bill that reflects our common values and that will help move our nation forward, and I urge its quick approval by the Congress and the White House,” House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey said in a statement early Monday. Defense Increase He said the measure represents a $25 billion increase in national defense funding over current levels, when extra money former President Barack Obama secured in December is included. In addition, he noted provisions including an extension of miners’ health benefits and increases in health research and opioid addiction treatment and prevention. The Environmental Protection Agency, which Trump has sought to shrink dramatically, would receive a 1% reduction of $81 million in funding and no staff cuts. The deal also includes steady or slight increases in funding for agencies within the Department of Energy, such the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which would get a $17 million increase, and the Office of Science, which would get a boost of $42 million compared to fiscal 2016 funding levels, the aide said. The Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, which aims to fund experimental energy research and has been targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, would get a $15 million increase. H-2B Visas, Truckers The omnibus also includes measures of interest to the business community. One provision allows the secretary of Homeland Security to temporarily increase the cap in H-2B visas for temporary labor through the end of September -- a provision sought by senators in both parties. The provision frees up space by the maximum amount previously allowed for temporary workers returning to the U.S. from other countries. The budget also includes a rider on trucker hours and increases for the NASA Space Launch System and Orion important to Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. It does not, however, change the quorum for the Export-Import Bank needed to approve deals over $10 million, so a major backlog will continue until Trump’s nominees are confirmed. Of interest to home-builders and the insurance industry, the bill contains provisions clarifying flood mapping under the National Flood Insurance Program. There’s also a new $100 million fund to counter Russian influence in Europe. Notably, agencies Trump has sought to eliminate, like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Appalachian Regional Commission, would get modest increases in funding instead. National Parks The deal also includes a 2% increase for national parks, including nearly $40 million in new funding to address deferred maintenance and construction needs, according to the aide. The legislation would classify power produced by biomass, such as wood, as a carbon-neutral renewable energy source, a change backed by groups such as the American Forest & Paper Association, a trade group that represents companies such as Deltic Timber Corp. and Resolute Forest Products, according to a senior congressional aide. Environmentalists have been opposed to the change. More than 70 anti-environmental policy riders in the bill were defeated, the aide said. The deal would provide a permanent, $1.3 billion extension of health-care benefits for coal miners. It would be offset by a boost in customs fees. The provision was backed by coal-state lawmakers in both chambers. The bill contains language that would prevent the Justice Department from restricting the dispensing of medical marijuana in states where it has been legalized. It also contains $323 million for the construction of a new headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The package would provide $68 million extra in local law enforcement funds to reimburse New York City and other localities for protecting Trump. Democrats’ Praise “This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday night in a statement. “The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren’t used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle-class relies on, like medical research, education, and infrastructure.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi also praised the deal, saying that Democrats won the removal of about 160 partisan riders. “The bill also increases funding for wildfire and federal highway emergency relief, and for Puerto Rico’s underfunded Medicaid program," she said in a statement. Under the tentative deal, the island would get some relief with $295 million in unspent money for territories for a limited time, said a congressional aide. Democrats were pushing for an infusion of at least $600 million, so there could be more fights ahead. Vote This Week The bipartisan deal -- reached by appropriators in both chambers in coordination with party leaders -- would avert a government shutdown when a one-week stop-gap funding bill expires Friday. It would fund the government through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. The House Rules Committee has scheduled a hearing for 3 p.m. Tuesday to consider advancing bill, including setting procedures for a floor vote. Agreement on the omnibus bill has been delayed by fights over a number of policy areas; Trump’s dropping of his demand last week for inclusion of money to begin work on wall along the U.S.-Mexico border was the most important breakthrough. While Republicans control the House, Senate and the White House, congressional Democrats held some leverage in the talks because their votes will be needed in the Senate, and likely the House, for passage of the bill. The Senate needs 60 votes to advance legislation, meaning the 52 Republicans will need help from at least eight Democrats. In the House, passing a spending bill for the remainder of fiscal 2017 was always going to be a challenge. A solid bloc of fiscal conservatives regularly oppose big spending bills, and House Republicans have had to rely on some Democratic votes consistently since taking over the majority in 2011. Sixteen House Republicans on Friday voted against the one-week extension of current spending that kept government open. Delayed Action The spending bill package would finish the job of appropriating agency spending seven months after the fiscal year began. The drawn-out fight could have been avoided in December had the incoming administration not instructed Congress to hold off on passing a bipartisan spending measure in order to give it a chance to weigh in. Beyond the border wall, obstacles to an agreement included White House resistance to demands from Democrats to guarantee the payment of billions in cost-sharing payments used under Obamacare to offset health-care premiums for low-income people. A stronger chance for a government shutdown could come in October. Trump has sought $54 billion in defense increases paired with $54 billion in domestic cuts. Republican leaders may be less willing to bow to Democrats without the excuse of being more than halfway through the fiscal year. Congress and the president will also need to agree on a debt ceiling increase in the fall, and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney has said he wants to use the debt ceiling to impose new spending restraints.

Copyright Joe Raedle, Getty Images Advertisement Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. launched a sensitive mission for the U.S. military and landed the rocket’s booster on land, marking the company’s fifth successful mission of 2017. A Falcon 9 rocket carrying NROL-76, a classified payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, rumbled aloft about 7:15 a.m. Monday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a livestream of the mission on SpaceX’s website showed. The launch, originally planned for Sunday, was delayed 24 hours due to a sensor issue. Roughly nine minutes after lifting off, the rocket’s first stage returned to Earth, a feat that SpaceX first accomplished in December 2015. Landing, refurbishing and reusing rockets is key to the company’s vision of making space travel increasingly affordable.

Contracts for military launches include satellites that let troops communicate on battlefields and are estimated to be valued at about $70 billion through 2030. Though SpaceX sees rapid, reusable rockets as the key to driving down launch costs and opening up access to space, the Air Force is still exploring how the certification process will need to be adapted to use pre-flown hardware. SpaceX reflew a previously used rocket booster for the first time in March for commercial satellite customer SES SA. “Unlike commercial satellites, these satellites are not privately insured -- a launch failure means the nation and its warfighters are without capability until a replacement is launched,” James Spellman Jr. of the Air Force Space Command’s Space and Missile Systems Center said in an email. “The certification process needs to properly account for previously flown hardware to launch our national security space systems safely and securely.” SpaceX plans to fly 20 to 24 missions in 2017 for customers that include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and commercial satellite operators. The Hawthorne, Calif.-based company has contracts with NASA valued at $4.2 billion to resupply the International Space Station using an unmanned Dragon spacecraft and to ferry astronauts there with a version of Dragon that is capable of carrying crews.

The two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the classified NROL-76 satellite, lifted off at 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT) from historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the same pad that supported numerous Apollo and space shuttle launches, the company's live webcast showed. About 10 minutes later, the rocket's first stage landed at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1, just south of the launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX previously landed a first stage booster at Landing Zone 1 three times. It also successfully recovered Falcon 9 first stages from six missions at sea using the company's drone ships. Few details have been released about NROL-76, a satellite designed, built and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office, a member of the U.S. intelligence community of an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. This launch has great symbolic significance for SpaceX, since it's the 15-year-old company's first mission for the Pentagon. For years, the market for launching U.S. military payloads was dominated by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. But SpaceX broke the monopoly in 2015, when the U.S. Air Force certified its Falcon 9 rocket to launch national security space missions. Since then, the California-based company has also won two contracts to launch Global Positioning System satellites for the U.S. Air Force.

SpaceX on Monday blasted off a secretive US government payload, known only as NROL-76, marking the first military launch for the California-based aerospace company headed by billionaire tycoon Elon Musk. The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, soared into the sky atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 7:15 am (1115 GMT). About 10 minutes after launch, the scorched first stage of the rocket came back to Earth and landed upright at Cape Canaveral, marking the fourth successful solid ground landing for SpaceX. "And we have touchdown," a SpaceX commentator said on the live webcast of the event as cheers broke out at mission control. "The first stage has landed back at Landing Zone 1. Another good day for us at SpaceX. A beautiful sight to see." Live video of the launch showed the first and second stages of the rocket separating about two and a half minutes into the flight. The larger, first stage, made a gentle arc and powered its nitrogen thrusters to guide it back to Earth. The rocket then set itself down, gently and steadily, in the center of the 300-foot (91-meter) circular landing zone. Musk is leading an effort in the rocket industry to re-use costly parts rather than jettison them into the ocean after each launch. SpaceX has already made multiple successful landings, some on floating platforms -- known as drone ships -- in the ocean. Secretive payload The launch was initially planned for Sunday, but was postponed in the last seconds before liftoff due to a sensor issue with the rocket, SpaceX said. The sensor in question was replaced ahead of Monday's attempt. Little was known about the payload due to its classified nature. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," a spokeswoman told AFP. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force's practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX to was selected to launch NROL-76 "after a competition," said the NRO spokeswoman. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. The contract was first announced last year. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station, and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year.

The two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the classified NROL-76 satellite, lifted off at 7.15 a.m. from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, the same pad that supported numerous Apollo and space shuttle launches, the company's live webcast showed. About 10 minutes later, the rocket's first stage landed at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1, just south of the launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Xinhua news agency reported. SpaceX previously landed a first stage booster at Landing Zone 1 three times. It also successfully recovered Falcon 9 first stages from six missions at sea using the company's drone ships. Few details have been released about NROL-76, a satellite designed, built and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office under the Department of Defence. This launch marks the 15-year-old company's first mission for the Pentagon. For years, the market for launching US military payloads was dominated by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. But SpaceX broke the monopoly in 2015, when the US Air Force certified its Falcon 9 rocket to launch national security space missions. Since then, the California-based company has also won two contracts to launch Global Positioning System satellites for the US Air Force. --IANS ksk/vt (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Knowing how to read a financial report is the first step in investigating a business’s health. (“Magnifying Glass” by John Lester via Flickr, CC BY 2.0) The first stop for a reporter looking at a public company’s financial health is its financial statement, easily found in its annual report. The three main components of a financial statement are the balance sheet (aka the Statement of Financial Position), the income statement (aka the Statement of Operations or Statement of Comprehensive Income) and the Statement of Cash Flow. The balance sheet This is a summary of the financial balances of a company. It measures the company’s assets (such as cash, inventory, equipment), liabilities (such as salaries, short-term debt, taxes owed) and shareholder’s or owners’ equity (the amount they have invested in the company) at a specific point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year. The equation on a balance sheet always balances: Assets are equal to liabilities plus shareholders’ equity. A = L + SE. Think of it as a snapshot of a moment in time. It doesn’t tell you much about how that moment measures up against other moments. The income statement The income statement, also called the profit-and-loss statement (P&L), is a financial statement that reports a company’s  revenue generation and general health over a period of time. Unlike the balance sheet, the income statement covers a range of time. The income statement provides an overview of revenues, expenses, net income and earnings per share. It usually provides two to three years of data for comparison. You can use income statements to compare similar firms in the same industry or to compare industries. The statement of cash flow This measures the flow of cash in and out of a business. It merges the balance sheet and the income statement. Keep in mind that the income statement doesn’t have to occur during the same accounting period as the cash flow statement. For example, Boeing may receive cash from a customer this year (the current accounting period) as a deposit to build an airplane, then build and deliver the airplane next year (which is when it creates wealth for itself). The customer may then pay cash to Boeing for the purchase price, less the initial deposit, and will likely do so over several years. Wealth flow on Boeing’s income statement will differ from cash flow in its statement of cash flows for the current year and future years.

The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, soared into the sky atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 7.15 am (7.15pm Singapore time). About 10 minutes after launch, the scorched first stage of the rocket came back to Earth and landed upright at Cape Canaveral, marking the fourth successful solid ground landing for SpaceX. "And we have touchdown," a SpaceX commentator said on the live webcast of the event as cheers broke out at mission control. "The first stage has landed back at Landing Zone 1. Another good day for us at SpaceX. A beautiful sight to see." Live video of the launch showed the first and second stages of the rocket separating about two and a half minutes into the flight. The larger, first stage, made a gentle arc and powered its nitrogen thrusters to guide it back to Earth. The rocket then set itself down, gently and steadily, in the centre of the 300-foot (91-meter) circular landing zone. Musk is leading an effort in the rocket industry to re-use costly parts rather than jettison them into the ocean after each launch. SpaceX has already made multiple successful landings, some on floating platforms - known as drone ships - in the ocean. SECRETIVE PAYLOAD The launch was initially planned for Sunday, but was postponed in the last seconds before liftoff due to a sensor issue with the rocket, SpaceX said. The sensor in question was replaced ahead of Monday's attempt. Little was known about the payload due to its classified nature. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," a spokesman told AFP. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force's practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX to was selected to launch NROL-76 "after a competition", said the NRO spokesman. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. The contract was first announced last year. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station, and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year.

Robin Seemangal for Observer KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fl—On the heels of SpaceX’s historic reflight of a recovered rocket, the Elon Musk-led spaceflight company has now crossed another milestone with its first national security launch for the military. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off early this morning at 7:15 AM ET from Launch Pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center with a secret payload for the National Reconnaissance Office. And that’s pretty much all we know. No spacecraft or destination was specified due to the clandestine nature of the NRO and the mission wasn’t even listed on SpaceX’s online customer manifest. A public relations team from the NRO was on-site for the launch and explained that they “can’t talk about the satellite.” So at the very least, we know it’s a satellite. On the official National Reconnaissance Office website, they describe themselves as “the U.S. Government agency in charge of designing, building, launching, and maintaining America’s intelligence satellites.” Those intelligence satellites are used by the Navy, Air force, CIA and NSA. Recently, images gathered by an NRO-facilitated satellite were used to track Syrian troop movements in the early days of the nation’s civil war. The NRO, which is based in Fairfax, Virginia, was officially made public by a 1985 New York Times article. James Bamford, a National Security reporter, explained that “since its establishment on Aug. 25, 1960, the NRO has been an entirely ‘black’ organization. The Federal Government has never admitted that it exists, and its name is officially secret.” “We are very excited about this launch,” said NRO spokesperson Karen Ferguson to the Observer. “Every NRO launch adds technical capabilities to America’s national security toolbox to keep us all safer, and protect the freedoms we enjoy.” #NROL76 will carry a classified payload designed, built and operated by @NatReconOfc. @SpaceX @45thSpaceWing pic.twitter.com/DWB7ECtejM — NRO (@NatReconOfc) April 28, 2017 SpaceX’s usual live broadcast was reformatted to guard the payload’s destination. Minutes after liftoff and after the secretive payload was jettison, the Falcon 9 booster separated from the second stage (which houses the NRO payload) and came roaring back to Florida’s coast for a ground landing at Cape Canaveral Landing Zone 1. This is now the fourth time SpaceX has successfully recovered a Falcon 9 booster on land. While SpaceX’s recovery of their rockets are becoming routine, they’ve only refurbished and re-flown one of them. According to CEO Elon Musk, the ultimate goal is to reach a 24-hour turnaround from launch to relaunch. SpaceX’s vision is to drastically reduce the costs of spaceflight by way of reusable rockets to help open up humanity’s access to space and help us migrate to other planets. SpaceX has preliminary plans to begin transporting humans to Mars by 2030 and the architecture rests almost entirely on spacecraft reusability. But before they can realize that vision, they need the cash to finance it. This is why this morning’s mission is crucial to SpaceX. It breaks the years-long monopoly on national security launches that have been facilitated by their competitor United Launch Alliance–a Boeing/Lockheed Martin joint venture. After two years of reviews by the Air Force and a settlement following a lawsuit that charged ULA with a monopoly, SpaceX was able to bid and win two launch contracts in 2015. The battle was ugly and pitted ULA and SpaceX against each other in front of Congress and the Armed Services Committee. ULA argued rocket reliability and boasted a 100% success rate from their history of launches. SpaceX hit back with taxpayer savings and claimed that their Falcon 9 launches are just far more cost-effective. The difference in costs between the two companies is staggering. According to SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell, an average Falcon 9 launch cost around 60 million. Shotwell also ensured a House of Representatives subcommittee that they can launch military payloads for less than 100 million. A United Launch Alliance lift to space costs American taxpayers over 160 million a pop according to their President Tory Bruno. If that wasn’t reason enough for SpaceX to bid fairly for these contracts, they also argued that ULA engines are manufactured in Russia. SpaceX rockets are built end-to-end in the United States. So how lucrative can winning these government contracts be? The U.S Government Accountability Office estimates that through 2030, it will spend around 70 billion to access space. That includes flying astronauts to orbit, resupply missions to the space station, and like this morning’s secret mission, national security launches that deliver spy satellites. Robin Seemangal has been reporting from the newsroom at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center for the last two years for the Observer with by-lines also in Popular Science and Wired Magazine. He does in-depth coverage of SpaceX launches as well as Elon Musk’s mission to send humans to Mars. Robin has appeared on BBC, Russia Today, NPR‘s ‘Are We There Yet’ Podcast, and radio stations around the world to discuss space exploration.

TSX VENTURE : OML OTCQX : OLNCF May 01, 2017 08:30 ET Omni-Lite Announces Increasing 2016 Cash from Operations, Significant Shareholder Returns and Achieves Technical Breakthrough in Aerospace Industry - Cash generated from operations up 31% over 2015 - Significant breakthrough in forming titanium for aerospace applications - Signs two long-term aerospace contracts - Continuation of multi-year program for US military LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA--(Marketwired - May 1, 2017) - Omni-Lite Industries Canada Inc. (TSX VENTURE:OML)(OTCQX:OLNCF) (the "Company") is pleased to announce audited annual revenue of US $7,179,808 for the year ending December 31, 2016. In 2016, cash generated from operations increased to US $1,965,273 versus US $1,497,654 in 2015, a gain of 31%. EBITDA increased from US $1,959,409 in 2015 to US $2,056,566 in 2016, representing an increase of 5% and an EBITDA margin expansion of 245 basis points. In 2016, the Company successfully negotiated two three-year contracts with major tier one aero-space customers. The initial total value of these contracts was approximately US $7.9 mm. These contracts allow additional components to be added at any time during their lifespan. "Sales with one of these customers is up 18% over last year and 32% from two years ago," stated Allen Maxin, President. "The Company still sees significant growth in the aerospace division over the next several years." In addition, the Company received a number of military contracts in 2016 that continue the important U.S. Department of Defense programs that began in 2014. These are the third set of contiguous orders in this program. These aerospace and military contracts represent a tremendous vote of confidence in Omni-Lite's state-of-the-art engineering and manufacturing facility and point to continued growth in 2017 and beyond as the Company becomes more strategic to its customers. "To take the Company to the next level of technical achievement, while providing a major catalyst for growth, in 2015 Omni-Lite initiated a program to review the potential of converting an existing cold forming system to operate at elevated temperatures. The US $900,000 test bed developed in this program was intended to evaluate the potential for hot forging aircraft titanium and other super alloys. In April 2017, the Company successfully produced the first complete Ti 6Al-4V fully tubular component using this system. While the use of titanium is attractive due to its light weight and high strength, historically it has been challenging to create precision complex aerospace fasteners without expensive multi-stage operations. Omni-Lite's hot forming system could eliminate many of these secondary operations, significantly reducing the cost and increasing the availability of these critical products. This technical breakthrough may lead to significant revenue opportunities within the aerospace, marine, medical, and sports and recreational markets," stated Michael Walker, VP of R&D. "The Company has begun to interview Business Development candidates to develop and execute a worldwide sales and marketing strategy for this significant new and expanding marketplace." Financial Highlights Revenue: For the year ended December 31, 2016, Omni-Lite reported revenue of US $7,179,808. Sales by division are summarized below: Division Aerospace Military Specialty Automotive Sport & Recreation 2016 40% 15% 34% 11% 2015 34% 30% 23% 13% It is important to note that Omni-Lite is increasingly becoming a significant supplier to the aerospace industry in a period when the industry is forecasting significant growth over several years. Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share were US $0.07 compared to US $0.08 in 2015. During the year, pursuant to a normal course issuer bid, the Company acquired 1,145,200 of its issued and outstanding common shares at a cost of US $1,450,745. The diluted earnings per share were US $0.07 compared to US $0.07 in 2015. At the end of 2016 the book value per share was approximately US $1.73 or CDN $2.32. This compares to the closing price on April 28, 2017 of CDN $1.77. SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (US $) All figures in US dollars unless noted.

Photo Courtesy of ABA Communications. Tweet If ABA president-elect candidate Robert M. Carlson looks familiar to House of Delegates members, there’s a good reason for that: He’s been there before. Carlson, a partner at Corette Black Carlson & Mickelson in Butte, Montana, is seeking the president-elect position three years after ending his stint as chair of the House of Delegates. His ABA involvement goes deep: He’s been part of the House since 1999 and has been involved in many committees. Currently, he serves on the council of the Section of International Law and co-chairs the Section of Litigation’s ABA Resource Committee. Carlson has practiced law for more than 35 years with the same eight-lawyer firm in Butte, which also is his hometown. He says he’s seen the value that the ABA provides to lawyers concerned about “the nuts and bolts of law practices”—law practice management, practice area updates and legal news. Through his ABA involvement, he says, he’s also seen how “the ABA and our profession make a difference” in wider ways. “Our message is more relevant than ever,” he says. “Who in our profession does not believe in the work we are doing for our veterans, the work we do to advocate for the rule of law, our tangible support for legal services and access to justice, and the work we do to support human rights?” Carlson will stand for election as president-elect unopposed at the ABA Annual Meeting in New York City in August. After confirmation, he will become president in August 2018. He would succeed current president-elect Hilarie Bass, who is co-president and a shareholder at Greenberg Traurig in Miami. Also up for consideration in August are 12 uncontested candidates for members of the Board of Governors. They are running for seats that represent geographic districts, ABA sections or divisions. Each will serve a three-year term. Robert M. Carlson, President-elect Robert M. Carlson Partner at Corette Black Carlson & Mickelson in Butte, Montana, where he’s worked since 1981.

Dubbed NROL-76, the secretive payload is scheduled to go up on the company’s Falcon 9 rocket early Monday morning from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. After launch, SpaceX will attempt to land the Falcon 9’s first stage — the 14-story high core of the rocket that contains the main engines and most of the fuel — on solid ground back at the Cape. Just like with other NRO launches, we don’t really know much about this satellite’s final destination or what the probe will do when it gets there. And typically, broadcasts of NRO missions are cut a bit short to hide the true purpose of the satellite and where it’s going. That means we probably won’t get as many shots of the rocket and satellite in space as we normally do when SpaceX does commercial launches. However, we should still get plenty of images of the first stage as it makes its descent to Earth. This will be the fourth time that SpaceX tries to land a Falcon 9 on the company’s Florida landing site. We don’t really know much about this satellite’s final destination or what the probe will do This launch comes off the heels of SpaceX’s historic launch a few weeks ago, in which the company flew one of its landed Falcon 9 boosters for the first time. That launch successfully put a satellite into orbit for the Luxembourg-based company SES. SpaceX was also able to retrieve the first stage by landing it on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. The Falcon 9 launching the NROL-76 mission will be using a brand new first stage, however, and it’s not clear when SpaceX will by flying a used booster again. But this launch is still unique since it marks one of the few NRO missions in the last decade that hasn’t been done by the United Launch Alliance. ULA, a partnership between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, has basically had a monopoly on military launches for the last decade. However, SpaceX received certification in 2015 to launch military satellites after going through two years of reviews with the US Air Force. The idea was to create competition between military launch providers — a move that could potentially lower the costs of government missions. And since receiving its certification, SpaceX has won two contracts from the Air Force that have been publicly put up for bid. However, the NRO seems to have set up this launch with SpaceX at some unknown time in the past couple years. The NRO announced in May 2016 that it had tapped SpaceX to launch NROL-76 and that it’s possible that more NRO missions could be launched by SpaceX in the future, according to Space News. The NROL-76 mission patch. NRO While we don’t know a lot about the purpose of Monday’s launch, we do have the signature NRO patch that goes along with the mission. NRO launches have always been accompanied by a wild mission patch, typically depicting some massive animal conquering the Earth or a mystical being like a sorceress or dark knight. The NROL-76 patch deviates from that theme a bit, showcasing Lewis and Clark, both looking very stern, as they prepare to embark on their expedition westward. Specifically, the NRO says the two explorers on the patch are about “to discover and explore the newly purchased Louisiana Territory and report back to the National Command Authority (President Jefferson).” Perhaps that’s some kind of hint about the mission. Monday’s launch is scheduled to get off the ground at 7:15AM ET, though the rocket can takeoff up until 9AM ET. The launch was originally scheduled for Sunday at the same time, but the mission was scrubbed due to an issue with one of the sensors on the Falcon 9 first stage. But weather is looking mostly good for a launch tomorrow; there’s a 70 percent chance that conditions will be favorable, according to Patrick Military Air Force. SpaceX’s coverage of the launch begins 20 minutes before liftoff, so check back then to watch the mission live.

WIRE: SMALL BUSINESS WEEK EDITION How an Old Baltimore Steel Factory Pivoted From Bagel Baskets to Airplane Parts Factories in the city are seeing promising results from a clever mix of decades-old processes and cutting-edge technology. By Leigh Buchanan Leigh Buchanan is an editor-at-large for Inc. magazine. A former editor at Harvard Business Review and founding editor of Webmaster magazine, she writes regular columns on leadership and workplace culture. @LeighEBuchanan Editor-at-large, Inc. magazine@LeighEBuchanan WRITE A COMMENT Marlin Steel CEO Drew Greenblatt (left) leads a tour of the Marlin Steel factory in Baltimore. CREDIT: Courtesy Company Advertisement In honor of Small Business Week, Inc. reporters deployed to several cities, where they spent one day talking to owners and entrepreneurs in a particular sector about their challenges. Hurtling around his American flag-bedecked factory, Drew Greenblatt erects--machine by machine, worker by worker--his case for the virtuous coexistence of jobs and automation. Here, two robots choreograph the creation of electric panels that prevent wires from tangling. This is James, who did time on a drug charge, then worked at Popeye's, and recently put his daughter through college. See that laser cutting steel for telecom antennas? It's accurate within 4/1000ths of an inch. Meet Hector, who after years of financial instability now has two cars, a home, and the same health insurance as his employer. A steel worker at Marlin Steel. CREDIT: Courtesy Company The argument that machines steal human jobs is "a false one. "Manufacturers that don't automate go extinct," says Greenblatt, the owner of Marlin Steel, a maker of industrial baskets in southwest Baltimore. "Technology lets you save jobs and make your employees more viable." (U.S. manufacturing jobs pay, on average, $85,000 a year. The multiplier effect on the economy is between 1.8 and 3, depending on whom you ask.) Marlin Steel is among 225,000 U.S. manufacturers--out of 227,000 total--defined by the Small Business Administration as small, meaning it has 500 or fewer workers. Many employ just 10 or 15 people. "When we talk about American manufacturing, people mean GE and Caterpillar and Honeywell," says Greenblatt. "They are important, but they rely on the little guys for their supply chains. And this swath is going to do very well in the future." The Baltimore area makes a fine petri dish for studying small manufacturers. The city's advantages include a busy deep-water port, an abundance of nearby universities, and its location: You can drive to New York, Philadelphia, or Washington without having to break for coffee. Under Armour was born here; founder Kevin Plank is an energetic booster of local light manufacturing. And Baltimore is home base for Greenblatt, who chairs the National Association of Manufacturers' board for small and midsize companies and has become the public face of factories before Congress and the media. Yet manufacturing here accounts for less than 4 percent of the workforce--a faint shadow of its heyday in the 1950s, when companies like Bethlehem Steel and Martin Marietta thrived. Factory owners blame overseas competition, regulations, the recent recession, and a struggling public school system. It's the same story you hear everywhere--the story at the center of the current national debate about how to revitalize America. Greenblatt argues that revitalization is already happening, in the small, 25-, 50- and 100-year-old manufacturers hanging on in Baltimore and places like it. Over the past decade these companies have emerged from hard times by ramping up technology, rethinking how to use labor, and reinventing what they make and for whom. Recently, Greenblatt led a reporter on a tour of several family-owned factories, all with local roots stretching deep into the last century. Neither high-tech clean rooms nor dark Satanic mills, these businesses suggest the direction America's small manufacturers are heading. New technology: Danko Arlington. John Danko has worked more than three decades in the factory built by his grandfather from cream-colored Patapsco quartzite. "It is the state stone of Maryland," says Danko. "My grandfather was very pro-Maryland." John Dankoof Danko Arlington. CREDIT: Courtesy Company Founded in 1920, Danko Arlington long employed skilled tool-and-die makers to build castings for everything from train components for the B&O Railroad to seat brackets for Memorial Stadium, where the Orioles and Colts once played. During an age of master craftsmen, Danko in 1940 launched Maryland's first apprenticeship program, requiring 10,000 hours of training. But today, in the neighborhood of boarded storefronts and weed-choked lots where Danko occupies three buildings, "most applicants might not even stay five weeks," says Danko. "We have a lot of no-shows for interviews." As the craftspeople retired or died, Danko bolstered his labor force with nontraditional hires, including Afghan and Syrian refugees. A third of his employees are ex-offenders. In the mid-2000s the last residual of Danko's apprenticeship program--a company veteran of 58 years--retired. "I thought, He will never be replaced by another human," says Danko. "He will be replaced by a 3-D printer." Danko isn't printing the products, chiefly aluminum and bronze parts for military equipment, that walk out his factory doors. Rather, it uses the technology to form molds and casts into which molten metal is poured to create those products. The company is a remarkable amalgam of the latest technologies--representing an aggregate investment of more than $1 million--and processes that look almost medieval. For most of the company's existence, skilled workers would manually shape each product in wood. The form was then packed in a mixture of sand and glue. Once the glue cured, the wood was removed and molten metal poured into the cavity. "The aluminum ingots come from Russia," says Danko. "It becomes American metal when we melt it." Today, by contrast, employees design the part in CAD. One of two printers produces a plastic version, and the old process picks up from there. But Danko is poised to buy a German machine--still in R&D--that will print the molds themselves from sand. The combination of cutting-edge and older techniques is typical of small manufacturers, which can't afford to replace everything at once. The new technologies enable production of shorter runs, ranging from one piece to 100, says Danko. That keeps companies like these competitive with much smaller orders. And, yes, the technology allows the company to operate with fewer people. But those people make more. Average starting pay at Danko is between $20 and $30 an hour. Even with the technology boost, Danko's workforce is still leaner than he'd like. The company struggles to attract young people to what at first glance looks like a legacy smokestack company. "We have been hosting tours from high school robotics leagues," says Danko. "Middle schools. Scouts. Colleges. We make parts for the Johns Hopkins University Baja team. Kids come over here and make castings for their transmissions." "We'll do anything to get the word out that manufacturing is cool," says Danko. "Manufacturing is fun." New model: Lion Brothers. For decades, Lion Brothers, an embroidery company founded in 1899 in a Baltimore carriage house, made badges for uniforms worn by federal border patrol officers. Then in 2013 the government, in a decision whose irony was lost on no one, moved uniform production to Mexico. That contract "was the glue that had people here 20 years, 30 years, 40 years," says Lion's owner and CEO Suzy Ganz. "They put it on the other side because of cost." It was both insult and injury to a business whose products have adorned the sashes of Girl Scouts since the 1920s, the uniforms of soldiers in World War II, and the space suits of Apollo- and Shuttle-era astronauts. Ganz's father acquired the company in 1978, and she took over after his unexpected death. Lion had already been outsourcing to China to survive the shifting economics of the textile industry at that point. Ganz mulled shutting down U.S. operations entirely. But loyalty to long-time employees spurred her to try something else. The company's oldest customers were the Girl Scouts, whose badges Lion manufactured in Asia. Ganz proposed re-shoring the products to a new, much-smaller facility in Owings Mill, a suburb of Baltimore. There, Lion--like Danko--would deploy new technology, including textile lasers and digital stitching machines, to economically produce very low-volume orders. The Scouts' Web-based make-your-own-badge program, which allows girls to choose from such esoteric subjects as "heirloom seed saver" and "karaoke queen," is one result of that arrangement. In a large bright room about 25 of Lion's veteran workers operate the new machines that turn rainbow spools into cheerful emblems of accomplishment. "We call this a micro-facility purposefully because it is the smallest," says Ganz. The Scouts are Lion's largest customer by revenue but account for just 5 percent of its volume. The rest--including insignia for many sports teams and universities--is produced in China, home to the bulk of its 500 employees. But the micro-facility houses another department that Ganz hopes will one day allow her to bring more production stateside. "The R&D aspect of Lion is first and foremost today," says Ganz. Lion's young R&D team, led by a PhD in materials science, works in a lab that adjoins the factory floor. Using equipment like a spectrophotometer, which measures light absorption by chemicals, engineers push the edge on textile digital printing, which makes up 40 percent of Lion's business. The company's innovations include extremely lightweight numbers for use on athletic jerseys and special inks that allow the company to embed messages within insignia that are only visible under ultraviolet light. "If our legacy competency was about embroidering, our competency today is about lasers," says Ganz. "We have a slew of patents." Ganz hopes the introduction of more high-tech goods will allow the company to begin repatriating production, ideally to additional micro-facilities--which she calls "pods"-- located close to large customers. "Things are developed here and prototyped here," says Ganz. "For now they are made offshore. Tomorrow they may be here." New markets: Tulkoff Food Products. Phil Tulkoff cannot state definitively that the cavernous room stacked with two million pounds of horseradish trussed in blue plastic bales is the country's largest repository of the odiferous roots. But it's gotta be in contention. Phil Tulkoff, third-generation owner of Tulkoff Food Products. CREDIT: Courtesy Company Starting in the 1930s, Tulfkoff Food Products made its name with horseradish. Today the company also makes an assortment of aiolis, sauces, garlic and ginger products. Still, "product variety is probably our weak point," says Tulkoff, third-generation owner of the business, which occupies a modern industrial space on a repurposed army base close to Baltimore's port. Instead the company focuses for growth on new markets--specifically co-packing. Tulkoff knew he had to diversify from the moment he joined the family business in 2005, taking over for a pair of professional managers. Back then the company was 95 percent food service, selling to distributors who in turn sold to restaurants. "The downside is that distributors control that chain," says Tulkoff. "It was becoming difficult. Pricing was getting a lot more squeezed." Another downside became evident in 2008, when the economic downturn emptied restaurants. Profits dropped substantially, and the business was forced to reduce benefits. Fortunately, Tulkoff had already begun the surge into co-packing, which now accounts for 35 percent of revenues and is the company's fastest growing segment. Like the other manufacturers, he switched to lean production methods and invested heavily in technology. Tulkoff Foods facilities. CREDIT: Courtesy Company Tulkoff's most impressive feat of automation is a mammoth one-of-a-kind root-washing machine that the company designed itself. It takes up an entire room. Horseradish roots--ghostly white and misshapen, like artifacts from The Blair Witch Project--travel from a vast rotating washer along a conveyor belt through several inspection points, into a grinder and, finally, to a ribbon blender where they're combined with vinegar, salt, and other ingredients. The machine reduces by two-thirds the number of people needed to clean and grind roots. A robot now moves product to pallets, a job that once required two workers. Tulkoff says automation has cut about 10 jobs from the 76-person workforce. (More efficient processes knocked off a couple more.) But he has also created new jobs, for example by bringing equipment sanitization in-house rather than hiring a contractor to do it. Other new positions are a response to regulations, which Tulkoff--like most of the other manufacturers--rail against. For example, the company now employs six quality inspectors where it used to employ one. "That is driven by the new food safety regulations that came out after 9/11 and the new quality standards that everybody is requiring," says Tulkoff. "I'm not saying there is anything wrong with them. But it really has ramped up the cost." New optimism: Marlin Steel. New technology, a new business model, and new markets all contributed to Marlin Steel's dramatic turnaround in the early 2000s. Greenblatt has told this story many times in many forums. He acquired Marlin, which originally manufactured baskets for bagel-makers, in 1998. Five years later China started selling in U.S. markets a comparable product for less than Greenblatt spent on steel. "Extinction was our obvious path," he says. Then one day Boeing called with an order for 20 built-to-spec baskets meant to hold airplane parts. "I said, 'Yes, but we will have to charge you 25 bucks instead of our normal 12,'" says Greenblatt. "He said 'OK.' That was the epiphany." Marlin pivoted from the "hellish commodity market" to custom designing and manufacturing highly engineered products for industrial clients on tight deadlines. Greenblatt trademarked the slogan: "Quality, Engineered, Quick." Today Marlin ships eight times more than in its bagel-basket days. But with a workforce of 30, it employs just 12 additional people. Employees, who write software, manage robots, and monitor quality, make 4.5 times as much as their predecessors, who bent wire basket rims by hand. Moreover, "When I first bought the company there were three guys without fingers and two guys without an eye. I bought a Dickens novel," says Greenblatt. Now Marlin has gone more than 3,000 days without an accident. A banner on one wall celebrates an OSHA award to the company for its safety record: a designation that exempts it from surprise inspections. In Marlin's unfussy lobby a "Welcome Governor Hogan" sign is still up from a visit the day before. Larry Hogan, Maryland's Republican governor since 2015, is refreshingly responsive to the needs of the industry, says Greenblatt. The jobs bill that Hogan presented to Marlin's staff and 40 small manufacturing CEOs gathered for the event featured a state-supported apprenticeship program, tax breaks for manufacturers creating jobs in high-unemployment zones, and a 10-year exemption from state taxes for new manufacturers creating jobs in those areas. The legislation also raises the cap on accelerated depreciation from $25,000 to $500,000--in line with that of surrounding states. "I have been working with Maryland to try to get that enacted for years," says Greenblatt, with evident satisfaction. "What we have now is woefully inadequate. You can't even get electricals for $25,000." (Trump has proposed letting manufacturers immediately expense capital investments, which also makes Greenblatt beam.) And Greenblatt is buoyed what he calls the "stunning outcome" to Baltimore's recent attempt to raise the minimum wage to $15, a proposal that caused a furor in manufacturing circles here. City council passed it, but the Democratic mayor vetoed it. (The council may still override.) Marlin Steel employees work in the Baltimore area. CREDIT: Courtesy Company Like many small-factory owners around the country, Greenblatt applauds much of the Trump administration's manufacturing agenda. High on that list is the promise of regulatory relief. Citing a National Association of Manufacturers study, Greenblatt says compliance costs small manufacturers $34,000 per employee per year. "For guys like me that is terrible," he says. Until recently, Greenblatt was more ambivalent about trade. "I was a big proponent for TPP. I think NAFTA is good for our country," he says. But in a recent meeting with Mike Pence, the vice president assured Greenblatt the administration still wants trade deals. The difference is they'll be bilateral instead of multilateral. "Their thrust is that is when America sits down with Peru or Vietnam or New Zealand, we are going to dictate the trade deal in a much more powerful setting," says Greenblatt. "When we negotiate with 14 countries at a time, it waters down our impact. I had not thought of it from that perspective." Such policy shifts, as well as what he sees on factory floors in Baltimore and at small manufacturers across the country, make Greenblatt very bullish about the future. So bullish, in fact, that he recently embarked with two partners on his very first startup: a maker of industrial robots called Ready Robotics. "Automation and robots are going to make U.S. manufacturers more competitive," says Greenblatt. "There are new innovations coming out all the time. Policies are changing. There's more appreciation for intellectual property rights." "I see a confluence of positive developments," says Greenblatt. "American manufacturing is going to have a renaissance."

A Falcon 9 rocket was less than 60 seconds away from liftoff on Sunday when the issue triggered a hold. Liftoff is now targeted on Monday between 7 and 9 a.m. EDT (1100 and 1300 GMT) from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida. Following stage separation, the first-stage booster will attempt to land at SpaceX’s Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. The mission, which is being referred to as NROL-76, will carry a classified payload designed, built and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office. This comes after reports that Nasa is working closely with Boeing and SpaceX for getting their spacecraft ready to use as lifeboats for the ISS. Currently, the Russian Soyuz spacecraft does double duty as an escape vehicle.

ARLINGTON — Jennifer Domanowski remembers her high school astronomy teacher suggesting she work at NASA. She laughed. That’s never going to happen, she thought. Now, the 23-year-old has a job lined up at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She’ll perform chemical and thermal analysis of the materials used for spacecraft and equipment. Her work is expected to help the Europa mission, which would send instruments into space to investigate whether Jupiter’s icy moon harbors conditions suitable for life. Domanowski graduated from Arlington High School in 2012. She’s set to finish a bachelors degree in materials science and engineering and a certificate in Korean from Boise State University on May 6. “Everything is made up of something,” she said. “I really love materials science because you can go into any field. It combines physics, chemistry and math into one thing, and you can apply it to everyday life.” She recently was recognized by Aviation Week and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics as one of the top 20 young aerospace leaders in the world. She attended the Laureate Awards, which she describes as the Academy Awards of aerospace, March 2 in Washington, D.C. Domanowski interned at NASA the last four summers and one spring term. She worked at the Glenn Research Center in Ohio, the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama and the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. In one project, she experimented with aerogels, extremely light gels that are heat resistant. She tested different composites by combining them with other substances. “I was trying to figure out what materials would be best to keep it flexible and strong while still maintaining those insulator properties,” she said. Her work is meant to create a protective coating for spacecraft reentering the atmosphere, and could be used to make wildland firefighting shelters. She’s also studied a lubricant for telescope parts, a thin carbon material that could be used to reduce friction in rocket engines, and outgassing of materials that can be damaging to spacecraft. The outgassing project could help at the Smithsonian, as well, where some artifacts emit gases that cloud display cases. “I love NASA,” Domanowski said. “We develop all this technology for exploring deep space, and it’s this unknown out there. But then we can turn around and apply it in our daily lives.” Jennifer Domanowski is one of three daughters. Her dad, Michael, works at Boeing. Her mom, Chong, runs the household. Chong immigrated from South Korea and Jennifer decided to study Korean as a way to connect with her heritage. Jennifer’s twin sister, Michelle, also has been a stand-out student, though her passion veers toward art rather than science. She graduated last spring from Cornish College of the Arts. She’s now applying to graduate schools, where she hopes to pursue screenwriting. People note that the twins seem so different, one an engineer and the other a writer and artist. “Art and science probably seem different at first, but I think they’re more similar than people realize,” Michelle Domanowski said. “They’re both creative fields and they both require experimenting with new ideas.” She’s proud of her twin. The sisters knew what directions they were headed in college, but not the exact paths they would take, she said. She’s glad Jennifer has done so well. The youngest Domanowski sister, Christina, is ready to graduate from Arlington High School in June. The 18-year-old is bound for the U.S. Naval Academy. She wants to study mechanical engineering. “Just to make some advances in the field could be very inspiring not only to the community, but to young girls,” she said. Christina Domanowski said her family has been her inspiration. Seeing Jennifer push herself as an engineer has set high standards for Christina to aspire to, she said. “She is always able to learn from whatever she does,” she said. Jennifer Domanowski was recruited to Boise State as a swimmer. It was exciting, but she didn’t know where to go from there. For a long time, she wanted a career in the medical field. Then she realized she doesn’t like blood. NASA was something she’d never dreamed of, and the opportunity to work there still amazes her. While her family is proud of Jennifer for the international engineering award and the new gig at NASA, she’s just as proud of her sisters. There’s a lot of excitement in the Domanowski household. “We’re a handful,” she said.

Clive Irving 05.01.17 1:00 AM ET Since we have an administration with a proclivity to drop bombs, very big bombs, this seems like a good time to talk about bombs, and how they are dropped. The United States Air Force has a lot of bombs, of many kinds. On the face of it, they are a modern force, conveying fearsome power. Look behind that impression, however, and there is an astonishing story of aging airplanes and a very expensive effort to keep them flying for as long as 100 years—in fact, the first ever warplanes to be in service for a whole century. This only-in-America story really begins in a suite at the Van Cleve Hotel in Dayton, Ohio, on a weekend in October 1948. The Boeing company faced a crisis. For two years they had been trying unsuccessfully to meet a demand from the U.S. Air Force for a new strategic bomber. It was a dangerous time in the Cold War. The Soviet Union was a year away from detonating its first atomic bomb. In order to checkmate the Soviet threat America needed a deterrent to demonstrate that it could deliver its own nuclear bombs anywhere and at any time from a fleet of bombers. Curiously, the Air Force was insisting that the new bomber should not be a jet but propeller-powered—even though the new Strategic Air Command was already flying a revolutionary Boeing jet, the B-47. To carry a new generation of nuclear weapons they wanted an airplane twice the size of the B-47, and no jet of such a size had yet been attempted. Then, suddenly, in meetings at an air base near Dayton, the Air Force told Boeing that the new bomber should be a jet. Holed up in the Dayton hotel suite were two engineers who had transformed Boeing from a pre-war minor player to a wartime and post-war behemoth in military aviation: Ed Wells, the chief designer, and George Schairer, a visionary who in 1945 had discovered some of Nazi Germany’s most advanced aerodynamic research and put it to use in the B-47, which was twice as fast as any other bomber in the world. Wells and Schairer called four other Boeing engineers to the suite. Schairer took one of these out to a hobby store to buy balsa wood, glue, and model paint. Back in the hotel, as Wells drew the outlines of a new bomber, he called out its dimensions and Schairer carved and assembled it from the balsa as a 120th scale model—the scale was chosen because Wells was using a 12-inch ruler and 1 inch of the model represented 10 feet of the actual airplane. The model was boxed up and sent to the Pentagon together with a dossier drawn up by Wells and Schairer that predicted the bomber’s capabilities. In April 1952, that airplane made its first flight from a Boeing plant in Seattle. It was called the B-52 and its performance came within a whisker of the numbers calculated in the Van Cleve Hotel—in some respects better. Astoundingly, the B-52 is still the backbone of the Air Force’s strategic bombing fleet. Even though there are far more advanced bombers, the B-1 and a small unit of B-2 stealth bombers, it is the B-52 that flies most frequently and acts as a kind of airborne artillery barrage, capable of carpet-bombing on a terrifying scale (though, apparently, not of dropping the Mother of All Bombs deployed this month in Afghanistan). The Air Force plans to keep its B-52 fleet flying for another 30 years. And that is not all. To keep those bombers operational they also need to maintain another venerable jet, the KC-135 tanker that allows the bombers to stay aloft on long missions by refueling them in flight. General Carlton Everhart, commander of Air Mobility Command that operates the KC-135 fleet, told an air warfare conference in March that the tankers could be 100 years old before they are retired. No other military airplane anywhere in the world is going to be anything like that old and still flying. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason. Guess who designed the K-135? The B-52 guys. Six days after the B-52’s first flight, Wells and Schairer presented Boeing’s board with a breathtaking idea: a passenger jet that would fly twice as fast as any existing propeller-driven airliner. But first they would get the government to pay for the development of the jet by producing it as a new generation of tanker to service the B-52s. At its own expense, Boeing produced a single prototype (it cost $16 million but by writing off the cost against taxes the actual cost was only $5 million). The Air Force bought the proposal and the KC-135 emerged from the prototype, which then later morphed into the legendary 707 airliner. It was a very smart two-for-one deal based on a relatively small investment, maybe the smartest deal the company ever made. As a result, the 707 established Boeing’s supremacy in passenger jets and the KC-135 became a perennial milk cow. The last KC-135 was delivered to the Air Force in 1965. The Air Force only began seriously looking for a replacement in 2001. What followed for more than a decade demonstrated everything that is wrong about the military procurement process: conflicting pressures from politicians with vested local interests in production plants; international free traders versus protectionists; ever-shifting Air Force requirements; and over-optimistic estimates of the cost. In 2008 the Air Force awarded the contract to the European Airbus consortium for a military version of its A-330 passenger jet. According to an Air Force source, Airbus beat a rival bid from Boeing “by a mile.” Boeing cried foul. The Government Accounting Office intervened and found corruption in the Pentagon, concluding that procurement officers had misled Boeing on the criteria that their airplane had to meet. When the contest was resumed in 2011 Boeing won, with a version of its venerable 767 jetliner. At that point the Air Force ordered 179 new tankers at a total price of $35 billion. That has now risen to $52 billion, and Boeing is so behind in delivering the first batch of 18 airplanes that it has incurred $1.75 billion in overrun costs. (The Airbus tanker has been operational for several years and has been adopted by the Air Forces of 10 nations, including the United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, France, and Spain.) In fact, Boeing’s poor performance on this contract is widely believed to have cost them the contract for the Air Force’s next major investment, the B-21 long-range strike bomber. Northrup Grumman beat out Boeing on a deal that could eventually be worth $80 billion. The Cold War ideas of strategic bombing that gave birth to the B-52 are obsolete (Strategic Air Command has become Global Strike Command). Technically the B-52 remains part of the nuclear triad (along with the B-2), able to carry and drop nuclear weapons, but it is impossible to see how or where they could still be used in that role. The B-52 can be used only against adversaries that don’t have sophisticated air defense systems, like ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban, and nuking them is unthinkable. (That is, to any sane person.) For sure, the B-52’s weapons bay has been upgraded so that it can deploy laser-guided conventional smart bombs, but the bomber’s most effective use is probably psychological: that it can still serve as it did during the Vietnam War as that bluntest of blunt instruments—the carpet bomber—or, in the vernacular of Trump, to bomb the crap out of adversaries. The opportunity for that is very limited if you have to worry about collateral damage, i.e., killing lots of innocent bystanders. However, age does bring one benefit. Despite other upgrades the B-52’s underlying structure remains as it was designed in the 1950s. As a result it is far simpler to maintain than the B-1 and B-2. Seventy-two percent of the 76-strong force is mission ready at all times. In contrast the B-2 stealth bomber is so complex to maintain and so tricky to operate that its mission readiness is the lowest in the Air Force, only 46 percent of the 20-strong force. (It is the only bomber equipped to deliver the Massive Ordinance Penetrator, otherwise known as the “bunker buster” that would be required to strike underground nuclear facilities, such as in North Korea or Iran.) Now, to give the B-52s yet another lease on life the Air Force is on the verge of spending up to $4 billion on re-equipping them with new engines. The existing engines are “dirty burners” with appalling emissions impact, expensive to service, and so old that at least one has actually fallen off the airplane. But the idea that these bombers will still have any purpose by 2050 seems bizarre. The only other powers committed to future bomber fleets are Russia and China. Northrop Grumman’s B-21 is intended to surpass anything those nations can produce, but warfare technology moves ahead far more nimbly than traditional Pentagon procurement programs. It’s not even certain that the B-21 will need a crew on board. It could be operated remotely from Kansas like a drone. And it’s more than likely that a whole array of unmanned aircraft, small and relatively cheap to produce, will end the age of the big bomber for good. READ THIS LIST 1.

The one-page plan, unveiled on Wednesday, proposed deep tax cuts for many businesses, but offered no detail on how it would be paid for without increasing the deficit. U.S. stocks snapped a two-day rally to end lower on Wednesday after the plan was unveiled. The prospects of hefty tax cuts have been a major driver of the post-election rally since November. "Yesterday, you saw some selling but it didn't develop into an outright heavy pressure day," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.43 points, or 0.05 percent, at 20,986.52, the S&P 500 was up 0.14 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,387.59 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 6.55 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,031.78. Six of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, lead by a 0.35 percent gain in the technology index. PayPal jumped to an all-time high of $47.50 after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast. However, a more than 2 percent drop in oil prices weighed on the energy sector, which fell 0.8 percent. Investors are keeping a close watch on the first-quarter earnings season to gauge fundamental performance in the face of lofty valuations. Of the 181 S&P 500 companies that have released results so far, nearly 77 percent have reported earnings above analysts' expectations. In a typical quarter, about 64 percent of the companies top earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Comcast was the top stock on the S&P, with a 3 percent increase after the company's profit beat analysts' estimates on strong subscriber growth. Under Armour jumped 7.7 percent after the sportswear maker posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Bristol-Myers was up 2.4 percent after the drugmaker reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and a jump in revenue. American Airlines tumbled 8.1 percent after the company said it had deferred the delivery of several Boeing and Airbus jets, in the latest sign of oversupply in the market for long-distance airliners. The news dragged down shares of other U.S. carriers, including Delta and United Continental . Microsoft, Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet are scheduled to report results after the bell. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,274 to 1,236. On the Nasdaq, 1,207 issues rose and 1,009 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 39 52-week highs and no lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 72 highs and 11 lows.

SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force's practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches.  SpaceX was selected to launch NROL-76 "after a competition," said the NRO spokeswoman. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. It was first announced last year. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station, and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year.

Carscoops Your daily scoop in automotive news About Contact RSS Mobile Social Media HOME NEW CARS SPIED CONCEPTS FUTURE CARS VIDEO GAMES OFFBEAT BRANDS TUNING REVIEWS NYIAS Shanghai Auto Show Carscoops.com GM Chief Mary Barra Rules Out Joining Trump Administration | By Carscoops Staff | ShareRedditPinTweetPlus Already one of the most powerful individuals in America, General Motors CEO Mary Barra has been observed cozying up to the Trump Administration since it took over the White House a little over 100 days ago. But despite rumors to the contrary, she says she has no intention of leaving one for the other. “I am 150 percent committed to General Motors,” said Barra on a conference call announcing the company's first-quarter earnings, according to Motor Trend, when asked about the rumors of her departure. Barra sits on the President's Strategic and Policy Forum – an economic advisory council made up of some of America's top executives, past and present. Other members of the panel have included the heads of GE, IBM, Pepsi, Disney, and Boeing, as well as Elon Musk (Tesla) and Travis Kalanick (Uber). But as MT points out, it's often Barra that's positioned closest to the President in photos. Barra's participation and proximity have prompted some to speculate that she could leave for a senior position in the executive branch of the US federal government. Those could include chief administrator of the National Highway Traffic Administration, or (should the positions open up) even Secretary of Transportation, or of Commerce. However Barra, for the time being at least, remains fixated on her present job.

The passage of the bill requiring local police to help enforce federal immigration policy was a slam dunk for Republicans like Straus. But, in committee, the House had moved to soften a stricter measure approved previously by the state Senate that mandated that police only inquire about someone's immigration status after an arrest rather than after being just detained, which can include routine interactions like traffic stops. During 16 tense, sometimes tearful hours of floor debate last week, though, a key modification was approved moving the House version closer to what came out of the Senate. Authored by Rep. Matt Schaefer of Tyler, a leading conservative voice, the change was approved despite the bill's sponsor, Rep. Charlie Geren, and another top Straus lieutenant, Rep. Byron Cook, urging fellow Republicans to reject it. "Speaker Straus has always believed it is up to each member to decide how to vote in the best interest of his or her district," said Straus spokesman Jason Embry. Backing what opponents call the "show your papers" provision may say more about GOP lawmaker fears of appearing soft on immigration and facing 2018 Republican primary challenges than rebuking Straus. But it was his second setback of sorts in as many weeks. The other came when tea party House Republicans attached language to a bill on statewide regulation of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft that could supersede local ordinances in Austin and elsewhere. The change in the ride-hailing bill now defines "sex" as the "physical condition of being male or female." That's an indirect reference to the Legislature's hotly debated transgender "bathroom bill" — a separate piece of legislation which Straus has repeatedly opposed. Straus is far from facing a House mutiny like the one that felled his predecessor, Speaker Tom Craddick in 2007. He's crushed past, conservative activist-backed primary opponents in his San Antonio district and was re-elected unanimously to a record-tying fifth term as speaker to start the session. The House, meanwhile, has yet to pass the "bathroom bill," meaning Straus still has leverage over one of Texas' most closely watched issues. Still, it's a hint that Straus' traditional role as a moderate hand keeping the Legislature from drifting harder right may be facing more dissention than usual. Here are some other issues to watch this week in the Texas Legislature: ___ GUNS IN SCHOOL PARKING LOTS A bill allowing concealed carry permit holders to have guns in their locked cars parked outside schools could be approved for a House floor vote soon. The bipartisan proposal is aimed at teachers who want to keep guns in their cars. State law bans guns on school grounds, at least for now. The House Public Education Committee has heard the bill and a vote sending it to the full chamber could come this week. ___ IMMIGRANT DETENTION CHILD CARE A Senate bill that would classify immigration detention centers as child care facilities may have new life. The proposal had stalled in committee but was approved last week after a change that makes it expire after two years. It's now eligible for a floor vote, though the timing is uncertain. The bill would allow immigration lockups to hold parents and their children together for longer periods, something the Trump administration has committed to doing. Its most vocal proponent is GEO Group, the nation's second-largest private prison company, which operates a major family immigration detention center in Texas. ___ OPEN RECORDS BILLS Two bills approved by the Senate and designed to rollback Texas Supreme Court rulings that advocates say weakened open record laws have yet to hit the House floor — and the clock is ticking. One proposal mandates that governmental entities disclose contracts and other bidding process agreements. That would effectively undo the "Boeing decision" in 2016, when the court ruled that such records didn't have to be made public. A second softens a 2015 ruling which allowed fully or partially publicly funded entities to keep secret how they spend public money. Both remain stuck in the House Government Transparency and Operation Committee. Supporters worry they may not pass the committee, and the full House, with the May 29 end of the legislative session now looming. What to watch: Was 'sanctuary cities' vote a Straus rebuke?

The two-stage Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the classified NROL-76 satellite, lifted off at 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT) from historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the same pad that supported numerous Apollo and space shuttle launches, the company's live webcast showed. About 10 minutes later, the rocket's first stage landed at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1, just south of the launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SpaceX previously landed a first stage booster at Landing Zone 1 three times. It also successfully recovered Falcon 9 first stages from six missions at sea using the company's drone ships. Few details have been released about NROL-76, a satellite designed, built and operated by the National Reconnaissance Office, a member of the U.S. intelligence community of an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. This launch has great symbolic significance for SpaceX, since it's the 15-year-old company's first mission for the Pentagon. For years, the market for launching U.S. military payloads was dominated by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. But SpaceX broke the monopoly in 2015, when the U.S. Air Force certified its Falcon 9 rocket to launch national security space missions. Since then, the California-based company has also won two contracts to launch Global Positioning System satellites for the U.S. Air Force.

Print Story X Print Story World May 2, 2017 Share Advertisement SpaceX makes US mly launch MIAMI: SpaceX on Monday blasted off a secretive US government payload, known only as NROL-76, marking the first military launch for the California-based aerospace company headed by billionaire tycoon Elon Musk. The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, soared into the sky atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 7:15 am (1115 GMT). About 10 minutes after launch, the scorched first stage of the rocket came back to Earth and landed upright at Cape Canaveral, marking the fourth successful solid ground landing for SpaceX. "And we have touchdown," a SpaceX commentator said on the live webcast of the event as cheers broke out at mission control. "The first stage has landed back at Landing Zone 1. Another good day for us at SpaceX. A beautiful sight to see." Live video of the launch showed the first and second stages of the rocket separating about two and a half minutes into the flight. The larger, first stage, made a gentle arc and powered its nitrogen thrusters to guide it back to Earth. The rocket then set itself down, gently and steadily, in the centre of the 300-foot circular landing zone. Musk is leading an effort in the rocket industry to re-use costly parts rather than jettison them into the ocean after each launch. SpaceX has already made multiple successful landings, some on floating platforms -- known as drone ships -- in the ocean. The launch was initially planned for Sunday, but was postponed in the last seconds before liftoff due to a sensor issue with the rocket, SpaceX said. The sensor in question was replaced ahead of Monday’s attempt. Little was known about the payload due to its classified nature. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," a spokeswoman told AFP. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force’s practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches.

See Epic Views of SpaceX's 1st Spysat Launch and Rocket Landing By Mike Wall, Space.com Senior Writer | May 1, 2017 06:26pm ET MORE SpaceX launched its first-ever mission for the U.S. Department of Defense today (May 1), and a set of videos and photos document the historic flight in spectacular detail.  SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT) today with the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office's NROL-76 satellite aboard.  Less than 3 minutes into flight, the booster's two stages separated. While the second stage continued carrying NROL-76 toward its classified destination in low-Earth orbit, the first stage performed engine burns to prep for a touchdown at SpaceX's "Landing Zone 1," a facility at the Cape.  Tracking cameras stayed on the first stage the entire time, capturing its various maneuvers and its pinpoint landing, which occurred 9 minutes after liftoff. The successful landing was the 10th overall for a Falcon 9 first stage, and the fourth at Landing Zone 1. The other six landings have occurred on robotic ships at sea; such ocean touchdowns are necessary on missions that burn up so much fuel that the booster can't make it all the way back to the launch site, SpaceX officials have said. These landings are part of SpaceX's effort to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets, technology that company founder and CEO Elon Musk has said could revolutionize spaceflight by slashing its cost. SpaceX took a big step toward achieving this overall vision on March 30, when a Falcon 9 with a "pre-flown" first stage launched the SES-10 communications satellite.  That pre-flown Falcon 9 booster had first launched in April 2016. Eventually, SpaceX aims to launch, land and re-launch boosters within 24 hours, the company has said. Each Falcon 9 first stage is designed to fly 10 times with no hardware changes and 100 times with only moderate refurbishment, Musk said after the SES-10 mission. Today's NROL-76 launch broke a 10-year monopoly on U.S. national-security missions enjoyed by United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint effort of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. SpaceX also holds contracts with the U.S. Air Force to launch global positioning satellites in 2018 and 2019.   Liftoff of NROL-76 from historic Launch Complex 39A. A post shared by SpaceX (@spacex) on May 1, 2017 at 5:21am PDT The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) operates the United States' fleet of spy satellites. NRO missions tend to be classified, and NROL-76 is no exception; it's unclear what observations the spacecraft will be making from its perch above Earth.  Follow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Congress reaches overnight budget deal By Gregory Hellman 05/01/17 10:00 AM EDT With Zach Montellaro, Connor O’Brien and Jacqueline Klimas BREAKING OVERNIGHT — BUDGET DEAL UPS DEFENSE SPENDING BY $15 BILLION, report POLITICO’s Burgess Everett, John Bresnahan and Sarah Ferris: “Congressional leaders have reached a deal on a more than $1 trillion spending bill that would fund the government at updated levels through the end of September. Story Continued Below “The bipartisan deal agreement struck Sunday night would increase defense spending and provide $1.5 billion in new border security spending aimed at repairing existing infrastructure and increasing technology, though it would not allocate any new money to a Southern border wall with Mexico despite the president's insistence. "Congress will provide $15 billion in supplemental funding requested by President Donald Trump to fight terrorism, though $2.5 billion of that is contingent on the White House presenting Congress with a plan to fight the Islamic State. “The bill clocks in at more than 1,600 pages and Congress must pass it before Friday evening to avert a shutdown, though the bill is likely to pass easily because it contains key boosts to defense and domestic programs viewed by leaders in both parties as vastly preferable to another stopgap solution. "House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-N.J.) said it is "the result of over a year’s worth of careful and dedicated efforts to closely examine federal programs to make the best possible use of every tax dollar." “’This agreement is a good agreement for the American people, and takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table. The bill ensures taxpayer dollars aren’t used to fund an ineffective border wall, excludes poison pill riders, and increases investments in programs that the middle-class relies on, like medical research, education, and infrastructure,’" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).” More defense details are here, via our colleague Connor O'Brien. The full bill text is here. A summary of Pentagon spending is here. And other summaries are here. TRUMP WON’T RULE OUT A MILITARY STRIKE ON NORTH KOREA, he says in an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation,” via The Washington Post: “President Trump did not appear to be ruling out military action against North Korea if the communist country pushes forward with its nuclear weapons program. “In an interview with CBS News’s John Dickerson that aired Sunday on ‘Face the Nation,’ Trump said he would not be pleased if North Korea takes that step. “‘He’s going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we’re not going to be very happy,’ Trump said of the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un. “Pressed by Dickerson on whether he means there could be military action, Trump did not confirm, but he also did not deny. “‘I don’t know,’ he said. ‘I mean, we’ll see.’” Trump added that North Korea’s missiles will only improve and that the U.S. “can’t allow it to happen,” writes The Associated Press. And Sen. John McCain says a pre-emptive strike should remain under consideration, via our colleague Connor O’Brien. — WARNINGS FOLLOW LATEST MISSILE TEST, reports The Washington Post: “North Korea fired another ballistic missile early Saturday morning, but it exploded within seconds of being launched, American and South Korean defense officials said. “Coinciding with renewed diplomatic and military pressure on North Korea from the Trump administration, this latest launch underscores both Kim Jong Un’s determination to make technical progress on his weapons programs and his defiance amid international pressure.” The test is a defiant signal to Trump that Kim isn’t ready to back down in the face of U.S. pressure, writes POLITICO’s Michael Crowley. And it comes amid new calls for sanctions from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at the U.N. Friday, reports The Washington Post. — MCMASTER: U.S. WILL PAY FOR KOREAN MISSILE DEFENSE, FOR NOW, Connor adds: “National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster on Sunday said the United States would adhere to its agreement with South Korea for a new missile defense system, but indicated paying for the system could be renegotiated. “In an interview with ‘Fox News Sunday,’ McMaster also downplayed his telephone call with South Korea's national security chief, Kim Kwan-jin, on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, also known as THAAD. "’The last thing I would ever do is contradict the president of the United States,’ the three-star Army general said. ‘And that's not what it was.’" And South Korea confirms the U.S. will pay for THAAD, reports The New York Times. The confusion is one example of mixed-messages that have come to define Trump’s foreign policy doctrine, writes POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi.

Curtis Scaparrotti updates the Senate Appropriations Military Construction, Veterans and Related Agencies Subcommittee Tuesday on the European Reassurance Initiative. — AND PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT VISITS THE WHITE HOUSE: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas meets with the president at the White House Wednesday to discuss rebooting the Middle East peace process, among other pressing issues. The meeting comes as Abbas up pressure on Hamas to give up its control of the Gaza Strip, writes The Wall Street Journal. FOR YOUR RADAR — TRUMP INVITES PHILIPPINES’ DUTERTE TO WHITE HOUSE, reports the NYT: “President Trump on Saturday invited the president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, to the White House, embracing an authoritarian leader who is accused of ordering extrajudicial killings of drug suspects and who crudely disparaged Mr. Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. “Mr. Trump had a ‘very friendly conversation with Mr. Duterte,’ according to a statement issued by the White House late Saturday. It said that the two leaders discussed the fact that the Philippines is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs.’ MORNING D TRIVIA: Alas, no Morning D reader correctly pointed out that Navy Secretary William Whitney personally ordered Alfred Mahan from the Naval War College to Puget Sound in November 1888 to study possible locations for a new naval base in the Pacific Northwest. Whitney sought to silence Mahan’s advocacy for the war college and close the school. Tune in Friday for this week’s question. And better luck this time. ** A message from Huntington Ingalls Industries: As the largest military shipbuilder in America, Huntington Ingalls Industries provides our nation with six classes of military ships.

Learn more at HuntingtonIngalls.com ** WAR REPORT — PENTAGON CONSIDERS SENDING ANOTHER 5,000 TROOPS TO AFGHANISTAN, reports The Military Times: “The Trump administration is evaluating plans to send as many as 5,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan, where America's longest war has hit a stalemate and local security forces have become overwhelmed by rising violence. “The Pentagon is considering options that include between 3,000 and 5,000 conventional military personnel to advise Afghan military and police units, those focused on fighting the Taliban, plus an unspecified number of additional special operations forces to escalate counter-terror operations against the al-Qaida and Islamic State loyalists entrenched along the Pakistan border. “A U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed those plans to Military Times on Saturday. The 3,000 to 5,000 figures have been reported previously, by the Reuters news agency and The Washington Post.” The report comes as the military investigates if friendly fire killed two Army Rangers during a raid in Afghanistan, reports our colleague Jacqueline Klimas. — U.S. WATCHDOG: AFGHAN FORCES FACE ‘SHOCKINGLY HIGH’ CASUALTIES, via The Washington Post: “Afghanistan’s security forces are experiencing ‘shockingly high’ casualties and conflict has displaced record numbers of civilians, a U.S. government watchdog said in a report Sunday on the grim challenge facing the country as it confronts the Taliban and other insurgencies with drastically reduced support from the United States and other NATO partners. “In its quarterly report to Congress, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) urged the Trump administration — which is reviewing U.S. policy toward Afghanistan at a time of sustained Taliban aggression and diminished American assistance — to take a hard look at its programs and priorities and to focus aid more narrowly.” And a fugitive Afghan warlord returns to public view for the first time in nearly two decades, The Washington Post adds. — U.S. REPORTS 352 CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN ISIS CAMPAIGN SINCE 2014, via Reuters: “At least 352 civilians have been killed in U.S.-led strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria since the operation began in 2014, the U.S. military said in a statement on Sunday. “The Combined Joint Task Force, in its monthly assessment of civilian casualties from the U.S. coalition's operations against the militant group, said it was still assessing 42 reports of civilian deaths. “It added that 45 civilians were killed between November 2016 and March 2017. It reported 80 civilian deaths from August 2014 to the present that had not previously been announced. The report included 26 deaths from three separate strikes in March.” — IRAQI COMMANDER EXPECTS MOSUL CAPTURE TO BE COMPLETED IN MAY, reports Reuters: “An Iraqi commander expects to dislodge Islamic State from Mosul in May despite resistance from militants in the densely populated Old City district. “The battle should be completed ‘in a maximum of three weeks,’ the Iraqi army's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Othman al-Ghanmi, was quoted as saying by state-run newspaper al-Sabah on Sunday.” The prediction comes as an American service member dies in an explosion outside of Mosul, adds the NYT. — TURKEY THREATENS U.S.-BACKED KURDS, reports the AP: “Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday his country may take further action against Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria, as U.S.-backed forces in Syria closed in on the last neighborhoods of a former stronghold of the Islamic State group…” “In Istanbul, Erdogan insisted that U.S. support for such groups ‘must come to an end,’ and said he would bring up the matter at a meeting with President Donald Trump next month.” And the U.S. begins patrolling the Syrian-Turkish border to prevent new clashes between Turkish and Kurdish forces, the WSJ adds. MARINES CONFIRM HAZING COMPLAINTS AT PARIS ISLAND, writes The Beaufort Gazette: “All four training battalions at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island have been investigated for hazing during the past three years, according to documents obtained through an open-records request by The Island Packet and The Beaufort Gazette. “Since Jan. 1, 2014, there have been 24 hazing investigations at the depot, half of which were substantiated, according to depot officials, though they didn’t identify them. “The newspapers have, so far, been provided with heavily redacted copies of 15 inquiries totaling more than 1,000 pages. They detail allegations of drill instructor-to-recruit misconduct ranging from name-calling to serious physical assaults.” NSA HALTS CONTROVERSIAL DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM, reports our colleague Eric Geller: “The NSA will stop its controversial practice of collecting digital communications that merely mention foreign surveillance targets, the agency confirmed on Friday. “In a rare public statement, the NSA said it made the change because of "technical constraints" and privacy concerns about Americans whose data was being collected. “The decision comes as Congress is locked in a heated debate over whether to revise and reauthorize the portion of the law that authorizes such collection — Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The provision expires at the end of the year unless Congress acts.” INDUSTRY INTEL — WHITE HOUSE APPARENTLY LOWERS BAR FOR AIR FORCE ONE SAVINGS, writes Defense News: “The White House webpage extolling U.S. President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office celebrates the president’s success in reducing the cost of the Air Force One replacement by millions of dollars. “But there’s a couple problems with that claim: The military still hasn’t finalized how much the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization will cost. This is also a significant change from Trump's initial claims of trimming $1 billion from the program’s expected price tag through discussions with prime contractor Boeing.” TOP DOC — NUKE WARHEAD MODERNIZATION NEEDS MORE FUNDING, GAO SAYS, via Defense News: “The National Nuclear Security Administration is underestimating how much funding it needs to update and maintain America’s nuclear warheads, a government watchdog has concluded. “A new U.S. Government Accountability Office report on the NNSA, a quasi-independent branch of the Department of Energy that manages the nuclear stockpile, warns that the agency has five major modernization programs that will be underfunded in the coming years — which in turn could lead to program delays.” SPEED READ — CIA Director Mike Pompeo visits South Korea amid heightened tensions with North Korea: AP — Sea power underpins the U.S. response to threats from North Korea: Defense News — As its economy grows, the North Korean regime’s grip on its society loosens: NYT — Residents living near U.S. military bases in Japan accept the threat from North Korea as unavoidable: AP — U.S. Marines return to Afghanistan’s Helmand province for a job they thought was done: NYT — Suspected U.S. airstrikes kill four Al-Qaeda operatives in Yemen: AP — Fifty years after the Vietnam War’s bloodiest battles, the “lucky ones” are gathering for what could be a final reunion: The Washington Post —Turkey purges nearly another 4,000 government employees and blocks Wikipedia: NYT — The EU doubles down on its support for the Iran nuclear deal: WSJ — Former National Security Adviser Susan Rice denies the president’s claim that she tried unmask intelligence officials in an attempt to implicate Trump campaign officials: POLITICO — Sen.

The payload for the National Reconnaissance Office, which makes and operates spy satellites for the United States, soared into the sky atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 7:15am (4:45pm IST). About 10 minutes after launch, the scorched first stage of the rocket came back to Earth and landed upright at Cape Canaveral, marking the fourth successful solid ground landing for SpaceX. "And we have touchdown," a SpaceX commentator said on the live webcast of the event as cheers broke out at mission control. "The first stage has landed back at Landing Zone 1. Another good day for us at SpaceX. A beautiful sight to see." Live video of the launch showed the first and second stages of the rocket separating about two and a half minutes into the flight. The larger, first stage, made a gentle arc and powered its nitrogen thrusters to guide it back to Earth. The rocket then set itself down, gently and steadily, in the center of the 300-foot (91-meter) circular landing zone. Musk is leading an effort in the rocket industry to re-use costly parts rather than jettison them into the ocean after each launch. SpaceX has already made multiple successful landings, some on floating platforms - known as drone ships - in the ocean. Secretive payload The launch was initially planned for Sunday, but was postponed in the last seconds before liftoff due to a sensor issue with the rocket, SpaceX said. The sensor in question was replaced ahead of Monday's attempt. Little was known about the payload due to its classified nature. "As a matter of policy and because of classification, NRO does not provide information about our contracts," a spokeswoman told AFP. Until now, the US military has spent billions per year exclusively with United Launch Alliance, a joint operation of aerospace giants Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to launch government satellites. SpaceX in 2014 protested the US Air Force's practice of using only ULA, saying it unfairly awarded billions of dollars to a single company for national security launches. SpaceX to was selected to launch NROL-76 "after a competition," said the NRO spokeswoman. She said she did not know when the contract was awarded. The contract was first announced last year. SpaceX regularly launches unmanned cargo ships to the International Space Station, and is working on a crew capsule that could carry humans into orbit as early as next year.

Eric Gay The Associated Press State Politics April 30, 2017 7:50 PM Was ‘sanctuary cities’ vote a Straus rebuke? By Will Weissert The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story AUSTIN Was the Texas House “sanctuary cities” debate a defeat for Speaker Joe Straus? The passage of the bill requiring local police to help enforce federal immigration policy was a slam dunk for Republicans like Straus. But, in committee, the House had moved to soften a stricter measure approved previously by the state Senate that mandated that police only inquire about someone’s immigration status after an arrest rather than after being just detained, which can include routine interactions like traffic stops. During 16 tense, sometimes tearful hours of floor debate last week, though, a key modification was approved, moving the House version closer to what came out of the Senate. Authored by Rep. Matt Schaefer of Tyler, a leading conservative voice, the change was approved despite the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Charlie Geren of Fort Worth, and another top Straus lieutenant, Rep. Byron Cook, urging fellow Republicans to reject it. “Speaker Straus has always believed it is up to each member to decide how to vote in the best interest of his or her district,” said Straus spokesman Jason Embry. Backing what opponents call the “show your papers” provision may say more about GOP lawmaker fears of appearing soft on immigration and facing 2018 Republican primary challenges than rebuking Straus. But it was his second setback of sorts in as many weeks. The other came when Tea Party House Republicans attached language to a bill on statewide regulation of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft that could supersede local ordinances in Austin and elsewhere. The change in the ride-hailing bill now defines “sex” as the “physical condition of being male or female.” That’s an indirect reference to the Legislature’s hotly debated transgender “bathroom bill” — a separate piece of legislation that Straus has repeatedly opposed. Straus is far from facing a House mutiny like the one that felled his predecessor, Tom Craddick, in 2007. He has crushed past conservative-activist-backed primary opponents in his San Antonio district and was re-elected unanimously to a record-tying fifth term as speaker to start the session. The House, meanwhile, has yet to pass the “bathroom bill,” meaning Straus still has leverage over one of Texas’ most closely watched issues. Still, it’s a hint that Straus’ traditional role as a moderate hand keeping the Legislature from drifting harder right may be facing more dissension than usual. Here are some other issues to watch this week in the Texas Legislature. Guns in school parking lots A bill allowing concealed-carry permit holders to have guns in their locked cars parked outside schools could be approved for a House floor vote soon. The bipartisan proposal is aimed at teachers who want to keep guns in their cars. State law bans guns on school grounds, at least for now. The House Public Education Committee has heard the bill and a vote sending it to the full chamber could come this week. Immigrant detention childcare A Senate bill that would classify immigration detention centers as childcare facilities may have new life. The proposal had stalled in committee but was approved last week after a change that makes it expire after two years. It’s now eligible for a floor vote, though the timing is uncertain. The bill would allow immigration lockups to hold parents and their children together for longer periods, something the Trump administration has committed to doing. Its most vocal proponent is GEO Group, the nation’s second-largest private prison company, which operates a major family immigration detention center in Texas. Open-records bills Two bills approved by the Senate and designed to roll back Texas Supreme Court rulings that advocates say weakened open-record laws have yet to hit the House floor — and the clock is ticking. One proposal mandates that governmental entities disclose contracts and other bidding process agreements. That would effectively undo the “Boeing decision” in 2016, when the court ruled that such records didn’t have to be made public. A second softens a 2015 ruling that allowed fully or partially publicly funded entities to keep secret how they spend public money. Both remain stuck in the House Government Transparency and Operation Committee. Supporters worry they may not pass the committee with the May 29 end of the legislative session now looming.
