The changes will be “bad” for passengers, says the airline’s cabin crew union under plans that will see an extra row of economy seats installed on its Boeing aircraft and the width of each seat reduced by up to 1.5 inches (3.8cm). Chief executive Ivan Chu Kwok-leung said in an exclusive interview: “If you look at the Boeing 777s, which everybody uses from the Gulf to the US to European carriers and ourselves, the standard is 3-4-3. I think we are moving towards that stage, it’s very clear.” The big squeeze: Cathay Pacific considers cramming more seats into economy class long-haul flights A shortage of take-off and landing slots at Hong Kong International Airport means Cathay and local rivals like HK Express, are unable to expand the number of flights with the two runways operating at almost 100 per cent capacity every day. “Slots are very scarce,” Chu said. “We want to generate more seats per slot, that’s the key thing. That’s why we are doing it. It’s very important we do it.” An additional row of seats could add up to 35 more economy seats on regional aircraft and at least 17 more on long-haul flights, adding nearly 1.1 million extra seats per year to the 70 Boeings in the Cathay fleet. The move amounts to 4 per cent more seats a year. On the Hong Kong-Vancouver route, Cathay’s Boeing 777 can carry up to 275 passengers, but Air Canada fits 458 passengers into the same model. Chu explained he wanted to offer the best in economy seats to ensure customers felt comfortable in the smaller seats. Cathay said it was committed to maintaining 32 inches of legroom as standard but the seat width would narrow – estimated to come down from 18.5 inches to around 17 inches per seat, based on changes made by rival airlines. The industry has looked at 10-abreast holdouts like Cathay and Singapore Airlines and wondered if they are delusional Analyst Will Horton The Cathay chief said he was confident he could maximise the cabin real estate to ease the “pain” associated with travelling in a full long-haul economy-class flight through the latest seat and cushion technology. “We will maximise every single centimetre; every single millimetre counts,” Chu pledged. Cathay Pacific has not set out a clear timeline for the changes to economy class seating but it is understood to happen around 2018. Flight attendant Silvia But, vice-chairwoman of the airline’s Flight Attendants Union, said: “If there is one more seat per row, I cannot imagine how narrow it will be. For passengers it’s definitely bad news.” The union member called for the airline to increase the number of cabin crew to serve a higher number of passengers. Will Horton, a Hong Kong-based analyst for CAPA Centre for Aviation, said: “Cathay has been disadvantaged by not doing [10-abreast]. The industry has looked at 10-abreast holdouts like Cathay and Singapore Airlines and wondered if they are delusional. “There are not enough passengers willing to pay a premium for Cathay. The passengers willing to pay more for nine-abreast either aren’t willing to pay enough or are not numerous enough,” he said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 2 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 3 Beijing interpretation on Legislative Council oath taking rattles Hong Kong 4 Hong Kong’s Legco descends into chaos as Beijing intervention looms 5 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 3 Finance, wealth and ... slavery?

BUCHANAN: Outsourcing America’s future 5:08 a.m. EDT October 1, 2016 A Boeing 737 MAX airplane takes off on its first test flight on Jan. 29 in Renton, Wash. Illegal subsidies of the Airbus 320 cost Boeing the sale of nearly 400 commercial jets. (Photo: AP) Is America still a serious nation? Consider. While U.S. elites were denouncing Donald Trump as unfit to serve for having compared Miss Universe 1996 to “Miss Piggy” of “The Muppets,” the World Trade Organization was validating the principal plank of his platform. America’s allies are cheating and robbing her blind on trade. According to the WTO, Britain, France, Spain, Germany and the EU pumped $22 billion in illegal subsidies into Airbus to swindle Boeing out of the sale of 375 commercial jets. Subsidies to the A320 caused lost sales of 271 Boeing 737s, writes journalist Alan Boyle. Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s. These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense. Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, “without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed ... and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market.” In “The Great Betrayal” in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie “sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit.” Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: “Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream.” And another executive said, “If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it.” When Europe’s taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive, “We don’t care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers.” This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours? After this latest WTO ruling validating Boeing’s claims against Airbus, the Financial Times is babbling of the need for “free and fair” trade, warning against a trade war. But is “trade war” not a fair description of what our NATO allies have been doing to us by subsidizing the cartel that helped bring down Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas and now seeks to bring down Boeing? Our companies built the planes that saved Europe in World War II and sheltered her in the Cold War. And Europe has been trying to kill those American companies. Yet even as Europeans collude and cheat to capture America’s markets in passenger jets, Boeing itself, wrote Eamonn Fingleton in 2014, has been “consciously cooperating in its own demise.” By Boeing’s own figures, writes Fingleton, in the building of its 787 Dreamliner, the world’s most advanced commercial jet, the “Japanese account for a stunning 35 percent of the 787’s overall manufacture, and that may be an underestimate.” “Much of the rest of the plane is also made abroad ... in Italy, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom.” The Dreamliner “flies on Mitsubishi wings. These are no ordinary wings: they constitute the first extensive use of carbon fiber in the wings of a full-size passenger plane. In the view of many experts, by outsourcing the wings Boeing has crossed a red line.” Mitsubishi, recall, built the Zero, the premier fighter plane in the Pacific in the early years of World War II. In a related matter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July and August approached $60 billion each month, heading for a trade deficit in goods in 2016 of another $700 billion. For an advanced economy like the United States, such deficits are milestones of national decline. We have been running them now for 40 years. But in the era of U.S. economic supremacy from 1870 to 1970, we always ran an annual trade surplus, selling far more abroad than Americans bought from abroad. In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft. But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America’s elites do not care. As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high. By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America’s future. After Munich in 1938, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax visited Italy to wean Mussolini away from Hitler. The Italian dictator observed his guests closely and remarked to his foreign minister: “These men are not made of the same stuff as the Francis Drakes and the other magnificent adventurers who created the empire. These, after all, are the tired sons of a long line of rich men, and they will lose their empire.” If the present regime is not replaced, something like that will be said of this generation of Americans.

We know students learn effectively from simulations but in order to optimize learning efficiency in simulations, students’ performance should be assessed, and instruction should adapt to what they need to know. ARL researchers are investigating methods to monitor the emotions a trainee might experience during training; for example: boredom, frustration, anger, confusion, delight, stress. The ability to reliably monitor a trainee’s emotional response to training provides focused coaching when needed and managing the challenge level to maximize the benefit of the training session. PRINT  |  E-MAIL  |  CONTACT AUTHOR WASHINGTON, Sept. 30, 2016 — World-class scientists and engineers have been creating cutting-edge technologies for warfighters at military laboratories for nearly 100 years, and a Sept. 28 hearing on Capitol Hill focused on technologies being developed today for future wars. Laboratory directors from all three services addressed innovation through science and engineering in support of military operations during a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee’s emerging threats and capabilities subcommittee. Testifying before the panel were Air Force Maj. Gen. Robert D. McMurry, commander of the Air Force Research Laboratory; Dr. Philip Perconti, acting director of the Army Research Laboratory, Dr. Jeffery P. Holland, director of the Army Engineer Research and Development Center of the Army Corps of Engineers; and Dr. Edward R. Franchi, acting director of research at the Naval Research Laboratory. Air Force Research Lab In his comments before the panel, McMurry said 99 years of technology breakthroughs have contributed to or supported every major operational Air Force platform. “Just as the laboratory provided key innovations in support of the first and second offset strategies, I'm pleased to confirm that our game-changing technologies are already providing foundation and support for realizing a third offset strategy,” he said. The president’s fiscal year 2017 budget request for Air Force science and technology is about $2.5 billion, a 4.5-percent increase over the fiscal 2016 request, the general said.

The Air Force Research Laboratory is investing heavily in basic, applied and advanced research, he added, and is continuing to focus on “game-changers” such as autonomous systems, unmanned systems, nanotechnology, hypersonics and directed energy. Air Force Materiel Command recently established a strategic development planning and experimentation office to reinvigorate development planning at the Air Force enterprise level, McMurry told the panel. “The new effort will shift the Air Force from platform-centric to strategy-based multidomain solutions spanning air, space and cyberspace … [and] will support enterprise capability collaboration teams by providing modeling and simulation, war gaming and data to facilitate development planning for the highest-priority Air Force mission areas,” he said. Army Research Lab ARL is part of the Army’s Research, Development and Engineering Command, Perconti said, the Army's lead agency for technology integration and the enabling command in the development and delivery of unprecedented capabilities for the warfighter. “The uncertainty and complexity of future warfare necessitates innovation across a broad range of science and technology, which requires a research culture that is agile and effective, with an emphasis on collaboration that enables the continuous flow of people and ideas among government, academia [and] the private sector,” he added. Perconti said ARL is piloting a new business model to create a science and technology ecosystem that emphasizes mutual reliance and interdependent collaborative research as a critical element of national security. “This new business model we call ‘Open Campus’ focuses on three major initiatives: modern workforce management and policies, shared facilities with our partners, and fostering an entrepreneurial and innovative culture,” he told the panel. Through the Open Campus, ARL scientists and engineers work side by side with colleagues from academia, government and industry at ARL and at partner facilities, he added. Over the last year alone, Perconti said, the number of Open Campus agreements with academia and industry has grown from 60 to more than 180, with 170 more in negotiation, and the agreements have leveraged more than $23 million from ARL’s Army partners. “Early in 2016, we opened ARL west in Playa Vista, California. As part of the Open Campus initiative, ARL is hiring scientists and engineers on the West Coast to gain access to subject matter experts, technical centers and universities not well represented east of the Mississippi,” he said. By the end of this year, he added, ARL will have similar hubs established in Chicago and in Austin, Texas. The Army Research, Development and Engineering Command now is developing capabilities for the Army of the future, and its scientists and engineers were intimately involved in developing concepts for the DoD's third offset strategy, Perconti said. “The third offset strategy places major emphasis on technologies incorporating unprecedented levels of automation and integration, and ARL is concentrating on research areas that are essential to enabling this third offset,” he added. Army ERDC The Army Engineer Research and Development Center, or ERDC, is the science and technology arm of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Holland said. Researchers from the Army Engineer Research and Development Center Geospatial Research Laboratory’s Geospatial Sensing and Photonics Lab recently developed four Water Diagnostics Operations Gear, or WaterDOG, systems and two water assessment and purification systems as part of a series of demonstrations for the water treatment and handling team. The Army is assessing WaterDOG use with a field-portable water-treatment system. The WaterDOG provides physical water-quality parameter assessment results more rapidly than the current analog water-quality analysis system.

Army Corps of Engineers photo Download Image Image details page “We conduct research and development in support of the warfighter, military installations and the core civil works mission,” he told the panel. “We also manage the Department of Defense’s high-performance computing modernization program that provides supercomputing capabilities for DoD research, development, testing and evaluation communities throughout the department.” In fiscal year 2016, ERDC is executing a $1 billion program, $500 million of which is associated with reimbursable projects from every military service, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and most federal agencies, he said. “Innovation requires a talented workforce, and I'm proud to represent ERDC's 2,100 engineers, scientists and support personnel. ERDC’s human capital goal for this fiscal year and the next five years is to hire more than 800 new scientists and engineers to our organization,” Holland said. “Service laboratories play a key role in national security,” Holland said,” “and ERDC has a long history of providing innovative solutions to keep our warfighters and civilians safe.” ERDC force-protection technologies are installed in the combat theater to protect troop installations from rocket and mortar attacks. The State Department also uses the technology to protect critical facilities and personnel worldwide, Holland said, and many buildings in the national capital region, including the Pentagon, are safer because of ERDC protection technologies. “Our airborne counter [improvised explosive device] systems currently provide U.S. Central Command with unique capabilities,” he said. “ERDC tunnel-detection technologies have been applied in Iraq, along the Egypt-Gaza border and along the U.S.-Mexico border in support of DoD and the Department of Homeland Security.” ERDC delivers environmentally sustainable solutions for energy, water and waste, and installations, and it is the Army's leader in energy research and development in support of contingency basing, Holland added. Naval Research Lab NRL was born from an idea conceived in 1915 by inventor Thomas Edison, and that became a reality in 1923, Franchi told the panel. NRL, working with industry and academia and knowledgeable about Navy needs, would help to build U.S. sea power through long-term mission-related research and development. The electromagnetic railgun launcher is a long-range weapon that fires projectiles using electricity instead of chemical propellants. Magnetic fields created by high electrical currents accelerate a sliding metal conductor, or armature, between two rails to launch projectiles from ships at 4,500 mph. Electricity generated by the ship is stored over several seconds in the pulsed power system. Next, an electric pulse is sent to the railgun, creating an electromagnetic force accelerating the projectile up to Mach 6. Using its extreme speed on impact, the kinetic energy warhead eliminates the hazards of high explosives in the ship and unexploded ordnance on the battlefield.

The laboratory, for example, is making important contributions to laser weapons and railguns. NRL scientists were first to prepare and simulate the use of incoherently combined high-power fiber lasers as the architecture for the Navy's new laser weapon system, he added. “NRL's railgun program began in 2003, and has since become a critical element in the efforts to develop hypervelocity electric weapons,” Franchi said. Rapid prototyping and experimentation is an important process used at NRL to transition science and technology to demonstrations of operational capabilities, he said. Franchi said the biggest reason for NRL's success in providing science at the cutting edge is a world-class workforce of about 1,600 scientists and engineers, more than 870 with Ph.D. degrees. NRL's most serious challenge is the need to modernize its aging infrastructure, he told the panel, noting that the average age of buildings at the NRL main campus is 59 years.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Is America still a serious nation?  Consider. While U.S. elites were denouncing Donald Trump as unfit to serve for having compared Miss Universe 1996 to "Miss Piggy" of "The Muppets," the World Trade Organization was validating the principal plank of his platform. America's allies are cheating and robbing her blind on trade. According to the WTO, Britain, France, Spain, Germany, and the EU pumped $22 billion in illegal subsidies into Airbus to swindle Boeing out of the sale of 375 commercial jets. Subsidies to the A320 caused lost sales of 271 Boeing 737s, writes journalist Alan Boyle. Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s. These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense. Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, "without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed ... and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market." In "The Great Betrayal" in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie "sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit." Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: "Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream." And another executive said, "If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it." When Europe's taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive, "We don't care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers." This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours? After this latest WTO ruling validating Boeing's claims against Airbus, the Financial Times is babbling of the need for "free and fair" trade, warning against a trade war. But is "trade war" not a fair description of what our NATO allies have been doing to us by subsidizing the cartel that helped bring down Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas and now seeks to bring down Boeing? Our companies built the planes that saved Europe in World War II and sheltered her in the Cold War. And Europe has been trying to kill those American companies. Yet even as Europeans collude and cheat to capture America's markets in passenger jets, Boeing itself, wrote Eamonn Fingleton in 2014, has been "consciously cooperating in its own demise." By Boeing's own figures, writes Fingleton, in the building of its 787 Dreamliner, the world's most advanced commercial jet, the "Japanese account for a stunning 35 percent of the 787's overall manufacture, and that may be an underestimate." "Much of the rest of the plane is also made abroad . . . in Italy, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom." The Dreamliner "flies on Mitsubishi wings. These are no ordinary wings: they constitute the first extensive use of carbon fiber in the wings of a full-size passenger plane. In the view of many experts, by outsourcing the wings Boeing has crossed a red line." Mitsubishi, recall, built the Zero, the premier fighter plane in the Pacific in the early years of World War II. In a related matter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July and August approached $60 billion each month, heading for a trade deficit in goods in 2016 of another $700 billion. For an advanced economy like the United States, such deficits are milestones of national decline. We have been running them now for 40 years. But in the era of U.S. economic supremacy from 1870 to 1970, we always ran an annual trade surplus, selling far more abroad than Americans bought from abroad. In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft. But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America's elites do not care. As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high. By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America's future. After Munich in 1938, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax visited Italy to wean Mussolini away from Hitler. The Italian dictator observed his guests closely and remarked to his foreign minister: "These men are not made of the same stuff as the Francis Drakes and the other magnificent adventurers who created the empire. These, after all, are the tired sons of a long line of rich men, and they will lose their empire." If the present regime is not replaced, something like that will be said of this generation of Americans.

Boeing has been awarded a contract to provide Harpoon missiles for the Indian Navy's Shishumar-class submarines (IHS/Harry M Steele) The overall package is worth USD200 million and includes 12 UGM-84L Harpoon Block II Encapsulated missiles and 10 UTM-84L Harpoon Encapsulated training missiles. Also included are two Encapsulated Harpoon certification training vehicles, containers, spares, as well as all-inclusive logistics support and instruction for IN personnel on the missile system. The missile systems will be delivered by 2018, the DoD notification stated. The awarding of the contract on 23 September finalises a deal struck in July 2014 to fit the missiles as part of the midlife upgrade of the IN's two Shishumar-class (Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft Type 209/1500) diesel electric submarines. This upgrade work is being undertaken by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai. India previously purchased 21 AGM-84L Block II Harpoons at a cost of USD200 million (in October 2012) for its eight Boeing P-8I Neptune maritime patrol aircraft, and in 2010 the Indian Air Force bought 24 Harpoons for its SEPECAT Jaguar IM attack aircraft fleet.

On Wednesday, U.S. officials started to tell lawmakers about the deal. Boeing will send 36 F-15s to Qatar for $4 billion and another 28 F/A-18E Super Hornets will be sent to Kuwait for $3 billion with the option to purchase 12 more. Lockheed will ship 17 F-16 jets to Bahrain and upgrades for potentially 20 other planes, according to Reuters. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., confirmed the sale to Defense News. He said a Boeing plant in St. Louis, Missouri, could have shut down had the deals collapsed. "In my opinion our national interest is being served by pursuing these sales; That always comes first, but a by-product of that is we are keeping production lines functioning in case we need to utilize those in the future," Corker told Defense News. Related Stories US, Israel Sign $38B Military Aid Package Kuwait Detains Suspected ISIS Militants, Foils Attacks He added: "These countries are buying equipment that is interoperable with our equipment which gives us the opportunity to deal with crises as they occur." The diplomatic reasons and mechanisms involved in the deal are complex and far-reaching when it comes to U.S. policies in the Middle East. Israel has a deal with the U.S. that requires it maintain its “qualitative military edge” over other Middle Eastern nations. Israel was also concerned over Sunni extremist groups in Qatar. The U.S. also had to appease Sunni countries like Kuwait, which was worried over the U.S.’s recent nuclear non-proliferation deal with Shi’ite controlled Iran. Israel likely curbed any of its concerns after reaching a record-setting $38 billion military aid package extension with the U.S. earlier this month. That deal required Israel to phase out a program that funneled 26 percent of the previous funding to Israeli defense contractors. Instead, the money will go to American companies.

The renewed Japan Airlines agreement for Boeing’s GoldCare Expendables, formerly Integrated Materials Management (IMM), is an expendable parts service solution that builds on more than a decade of success. The partnership reduces the airline’s operating costs by having Boeing manage a majority of its spare parts inventory, providing items to the airline mechanic as needed. Under the agreement, Boeing will provide the service through 2026. According to Japan Airlines, Boeing’s exceptional customer support and parts solutions were key factors in the decision to extend the contract. “Boeing is pleased to continue our long-standing partnership with Japan Airlines, helping to improve operating efficiencies through our parts service,” said Rick Anderson, vice president of sales and marketing, Boeing Commercial Aviation Services. “Our focus is on providing our customers what they need, before they know they need it. This approach, along with our world-class customer support, is what continues to make Boeing a preferred parts provider across the globe.” The Japan Airlines order demonstrates the increased flexibility of Boeing’s parts business, which continues to evolve and improve based on customer needs and requirements. In 2015, Boeing increased inventory by 35,000 parts and lowered prices on 24,000 parts. In addition, Boeing has nearly doubled stocked parts for out-of-production airplanes and is offering emergent-build capabilities for customers who need to find parts for out-of-production fleet types. Boeing is a leader in providing 24/7 support and service to the global aviation industry. In addition to its expanded parts business, Boeing offers the industry’s largest portfolio of services, including retrofits and modifications, subscription-based maintenance programs, engineering support, crew training, route planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data analytics and software to enhance airlines and leasing company operations.

How a showdown in the skies could trigger a transatlantic trade war The battle between Airbus and Boeing may set the stage for a full-on feud between Europe and the US. Sep 30th 2016, 11:59 AM 11,257 Views 5 Comments Share14 Tweet Email1 Image: AP/Press Association Images ARE WE ON the brink of a US-EU trade war? Some pundits with an eye on the sky seem to think so. A 12-year dog fight between the world’s two leading aircraft manufacturers came to a head last week when the World Trade Organisation (WTO) accused European plane maker Airbus of failing to comply with a 2011 ruling to stop accepting illegal state aid from the European Union. Even more significantly, the WTO ruled in its 574-page report that some EU member states had given Airbus so-called ‘launch-aid loans’ to fast track the building of wide-body aircraft, which it said created “genuine and substantial” loss of sales for its US rival, Boeing. The WTO said Airbus couldn’t have developed its A350XWB aircraft, a direct competitor to Boeing’s successful 787 Dreamliner jet, without unlawful EU subsidies estimated to be worth around $5 billion. This was a fresh accusation as the trade body had already ruled that Airbus received unlawful funding to develop its A380 aircraft. Unsurprisingly, Airbus has said it will appeal the WTO’s accusations, while the EU has suggested it will do the same, dubbing the findings in the report as “unsatisfactory”. On the other side of the pond, US trade representative Michael Froman said the WTO’s findings signaled “a sweeping victory for the US and its aerospace workers”. “We have long maintained that EU aircraft subsidies have cost American companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, which this report clearly proves,” he said. An Airbus A350XWB Source: Kamran Jebreili/AP/Press Association Images Boeing’s chief executive and president Dennis Muilenburg echoed Froman’s claims and said the “historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules”. The “winning” side may want to can the celebrations though – the WTO is in turn investigating whether Boeing has complied with rules on accepting a leg-up from the US. Tariffs With increased political turbulence on both sides of the Atlantic, it is not that difficult to imagine how the ongoing battle between Airbus and Boeing could set the stage for a full-blown trade war. If the EU loses its appeal, the US could impose import duties on goods coming from the region as punishment for breaching civil aviation rules. Boeing fueled this potential outcome by suggesting that Washington could receive up to $10 billion in annual tariffs if it decides to sanction the EU, a figure based on previous statements made by US authorities. Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg Source: Ted S. Warren/AP/Press Association Images Meanwhile the WTO is to deliver a separate ruling on how Boeing handled a $5.3 billion leg-up it received in state funding, about half of what Airbus received. The Toulouse-based manufacturer could use that ruling as ammunition against its American competitor. The EU has also filed a complaint against an $8.7 billion payment Boeing received from the state of Washington in exchange for manufacturing new 777X jets at its Seattle facilities. Dominance The Boeing-Airbus duopoly has dominated the global aircraft making industry since the late 1990s when both firms absorbed several smaller manufacturers. The current battle dates back to 2005 when the US and EU both filed lawsuits over how they both funded their respected aircraft manufacturers. Since then, the two sides have repeatedly accused each other of accepting unlawful payments: Boeing through military contracts and tax breaks, Airbus through launch-aid loans. The WTO ruled in 2010 and 2011 that both sides had been unfairly financed and ruled that they should eliminate illegal payments. The two manufacturers have claimed victory several times and accused their enemy of non-compliance. This is a seemingly never-ending slagging match between two corporate giants that dominate in a fiercely competitive industry. Global air passenger traffic roughly doubles every 15 years. That means there will be around 7 billion air passengers per year by 2034, according to predictions from the International Air Transport Association, so both companies will be looking to meet deadlines for aircraft deliveries.

China, the US, India, Indonesia and Brazil are predicted to be the fastest growing markets, so both plane makers will be elbowing each other to win orders from airlines that operate in those regions. It is an expensive gamble for companies to invest in new aircraft. They cost millions and take years to build, yet by the time an aircraft is delivered a proposed route may not be economically viable any more. Indigenous manufacturers in some of those emerging markets are keen to get their own slice of the pie in the sky, but right now they don’t have the muscle of the big two to meet growing demands and adhere to strict regulations. China's competitor, the C919 Source: AP/Press Association Images The tit-for-tat mudslinging between Airbus and Boeing has been typical carry on in a dispute that has lasted more than a decade. Pundits have for years warned that it could lead to an imminent trade dispute on the back of this rivalry – only to later dismiss the petty bickering as a phoney war. But the latest warning comes at a time when protectionist policies are gaining significant ground in Europe and the US, which gives it a bit more edge.

Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... Is America still a serious nation? Consider. While U.S. elites were denouncing Donald Trump as unfit to serve for having compared Miss Universe 1996 to "Miss Piggy" of "The Muppets," the World Trade Organization was validating the principal plank of his platform. America's allies are cheating and robbing her blind on trade. According to the WTO, Britain, France, Spain, Germany and the EU pumped $22 billion in illegal subsidies into Airbus to swindle Boeing out of the sale of 375 commercial jets. Subsidies to the A320 caused lost sales of 271 Boeing 737s, writes journalist Alan Boyle. Subsidies for planes in the twin-aisle market cost the sale of 50 Boeing 767s, 777s and 787s. And subsidies to the A380 cost Boeing the sale of 54 747s. These represent crippling losses for Boeing, a crown jewel of U.S. manufacturing and a critical component of our national defense. Earlier, writes Boyle, the WTO ruled that, "without the subsidies, Airbus would not have existed ... and there would be no Airbus aircraft on the market." In "The Great Betrayal" in 1998, I noted that in its first 25 years the socialist cartel called Airbus Industrie "sold 770 planes to 102 airlines but did not make a penny of profit." Richard Evans of British Aerospace explained: "Airbus is going to attack the Americans, including Boeing, until they bleed and scream." And another executive said, "If Airbus has to give away planes, we will do it." When Europe's taxpayers objected to the $26 billion in subsidies Airbus had gotten by 1990, German aerospace coordinator Erich Riedl was dismissive, "We don't care about criticism from small-minded pencil-pushers." This is the voice of economic nationalism. Where is ours? After this latest WTO ruling validating Boeing's claims against Airbus, the Financial Times is babbling of the need for "free and fair" trade, warning against a trade war. But is "trade war" not a fair description of what our NATO allies have been doing to us by subsidizing the cartel that helped bring down Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas and now seeks to bring down Boeing? Our companies built the planes that saved Europe in World War II and sheltered her in the Cold War. And Europe has been trying to kill those American companies. Yet even as Europeans collude and cheat to capture America's markets in passenger jets, Boeing itself, wrote Eamonn Fingleton in 2014, has been "consciously cooperating in its own demise." By Boeing's own figures, writes Fingleton, in the building of its 787 Dreamliner, the world's most advanced commercial jet, the "Japanese account for a stunning 35 percent of the 787's overall manufacture, and that may be an underestimate." "Much of the rest of the plane is also made abroad ... in Italy, Germany, South Korea, France, and the United Kingdom." The Dreamliner "flies on Mitsubishi wings. These are no ordinary wings: they constitute the first extensive use of carbon fiber in the wings of a full-size passenger plane. In the view of many experts, by outsourcing the wings Boeing has crossed a red line." Mitsubishi, recall, built the Zero, the premier fighter plane in the Pacific in the early years of World War II. In a related matter, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit in July and August approached $60 billion each month, heading for a trade deficit in goods in 2016 of another $700 billion. For an advanced economy like the United States, such deficits are milestones of national decline. We have been running them now for 40 years. But in the era of U.S. economic supremacy from 1870 to 1970, we always ran an annual trade surplus, selling far more abroad than Americans bought from abroad. In the U.S. trade picture, even in the darkest of times, the brightest of categories has been commercial aircraft. But to watch how we allow NATO allies we defend and protect getting away with decades of colluding and cheating, and then to watch Boeing transfer technology and outsource critical manufacturing to rivals like Japan, one must conclude that not only is the industrial decline of the United States inevitable, but America's elites do not care. As for our corporate chieftains, they seem accepting of what is coming when they are gone, so long as the salary increases, stock prices and options, severance packages, and profits remain high. By increasingly relying upon foreign nations for our national needs, and by outsourcing production, we are outsourcing America's future. After Munich in 1938, Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax visited Italy to wean Mussolini away from Hitler. The Italian dictator observed his guests closely and remarked to his foreign minister: "These men are not made of the same stuff as the Francis Drakes and the other magnificent adventurers who created the empire. These, after all, are the tired sons of a long line of rich men, and they will lose their empire." If the present regime is not replaced, something like that will be said of this generation of Americans.

The upgrade from a single-aisle Airbus A321 aircraft will cater to strong demand to and from the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, offering guests the more enjoyable comfort of a wide-body aircraft. Together with the other daily Boeing 777 Riyadh service, Etihad Airways will have more than 8,700 weekly seats on the route. Flight EY317 will be operated with a B787 Dreamliner, departing Abu Dhabi at 10:15, arriving into Riyadh at 11:15. The return flight EY318 will depart Riyadh at 16:25, arriving into Abu Dhabi at 19:10. Etihad's 299-seat B787 Dreamliner aircraft has a two-class configuration with 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats. Business Studio provides all passengers with direct aisle access and is equipped with an in-seat massage and air cushion control system to adjust the seat cushion for added comfort. Business Class guests can choose from an a la carte and Dine Anytime menu. Specialised hospitality services are also offered on board, including a Food & Beverage Manager in the Business Class cabin, multi-national cabin crew and a Flying Nanny, who is able to offer a helping hand to parents travelling with young children. Economy Class features the airline’s Economy Smart Seat which has a ‘fixed wing’ headrest, extra seat width and individual TV monitors. Etihad Airways currently operates the latest Panasonic eX3 IFE equipment for its B787 inflight entertainment system. Mobile connectivity with access to onboard Wi-Fi and seven satellite channels of live TV are also available.  “The Boeing 787 is playing a key role in Etihad Airways’ fleet expansion with routes carefully selected on which to deploy this unique aircraft. We are delighted that Riyadh will soon join our 787 cities giving guests a different experience to and from Abu Dhabi, and with convenient connections to destinations across our diverse worldwide network,” said Kevin Knight, Etihad Airways Chief Strategy and Planning Officer. “The aircraft also provides significantly more cargo capacity to facilitate the movement of a greater number of goods to and from the Saudi capital. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a very important market for Etihad Airways, supporting our global expansion since the launch of services 13 years ago. Our commitment to the Saudi market has grown since we began flying to Riyadh in 2004, steadily increasing our presence to the current 63 flights each week to and from four Saudi cities.” On the Riyadh route alone, Etihad Airways has flown more than 2.5 million passengers since 2004.  See other recent news regarding: Etihad Airways, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh Subscribe to our Latest Travel News Daily Email Free of Charge by simply entering your email address to the right.

Monarch’s backers have moved quickly since it was plunged into crisis last week amid speculation that the airline was on the brink of bankruptcy. The funds, expected to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, will be the second round of financing Monarch has raised in a matter of days, and should end doubts about its financial health. It received a separate cash injection from shareholders this weekend, which helped secure a temporary extension to its licence to fly with only hours to go before Friday’s midnight deadline.  The Mantegazza family started Monarch Airlines with just two aircraft in Luton in 1968 The plane order and additional funds should mean that Monarch receives a full Air Travel Organiser’s Licence (Atol) from the Civil Aviation Authority, removing concerns that its fleet could be grounded and thousands of holidaymakers left stranded abroad.  An order for 45 Boeing 737 airliners would be worth around $2bn (£1.54bn) with each plane costing about $50m. The new fleet will be staggered over several years with the first delivery in 2018.  Monarch is in the second year of an intense turnaround plan under new owners Greybull. The investment firm rescued the airline in 2014 as it teetered on the brink of collapse. Greybull pumped in £125m. It has also slashed costs, pulled out of long-haul flights and grounded many of the airline’s older planes.  But like many other airlines, Monarch has faced one of the most difficult travel markets in decades, following a series of terror attacks, Brexit uncertainty and the falling pound. Despite the tough backdrop, it is expected to post pre-tax earnings of £40m this year Concerns grow for Monarch - but are you protected if your airline goes bust?

That ecosystem has to be built in India.”Trade ties The USIBC is a business advocacy organisation working to boost India-US ties. The U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum (TPF) is slated to meet next week. The TPF is the main bilateral forum for ‘discussion and resolution of India-US trade and investment issues.’ Mr. Aghi said with the government’s objective to bring in more efficiency in the defence sector through private companies, the Tata group, the Reliance groups and other Indian firms were forming ventures with foreign partners in the sector to boost investments and manufacturing in India. In June, the Centre had liberalised the defence sector by allowing foreign investment beyond 49 per cent through government approval in cases where the country gets access to modern technology. In the last two years, the defence sector attracted FDI worth only a little over Rs one crore. Besides, out of the $288.5 billion worth FDI into India during April 2000-March 2016, FDI into defence was a mere $5.12 million (or Rs.25.48 crore), with a rank of 61 of the 63 sectors under which FDI inflow was tabulated. Mr. Aghi said defence minister Manohar Parrikar had lauded a USIBC report on suggestions to improve ease of doing defence business in India, including proposals to maintain transparency, eliminate corruption and expediting government’s decisions on big defence purchases. He warned that a lingering ‘Bofors Syndrome’ - or a near freeze by officials in procurement due to fear of a corruption tag - could harm the Centre at a time of escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. Mr. Aghi said U.S. firms across sectors did not perceive any risk to their Indian operations due to the India-Pakistan stand-off as “they see maturity on the part of Indian and U.S. leaderships as well as due to talks with China and Pakistan to ensure the situation doesn’t go out of control.” Keywords: US defence firms, India-Pakistan LoC tensions, foreign direct investment More In: Industry | Business Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading...

If it is completed, the Qatar Airways purchase would be Boeing’s largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into its plans for the 777, Boeing’s largest twin-engined plane, as well as the Dreamliner. Published: 16:01 September 30, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Chicago/Toulouse/London: Boeing Co is nearing an agreement with Qatar’s flagship airline for a multibillion-dollar commercial jet order, following US approval of a long-stalled sale of F-15 fighter jets to the Arabian Gulf nation. Qatar Airways is in late-stage talks to acquire at least 30 Boeing wide-body jets and would take 787 Dreamliner and 777 models, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. The order would be valued at upwards of $6.7 billion (Dh24.5 billion) at catalogue prices, although airlines typically negotiate discounts. Akbar Al Baker, chief executive officer of government-owned Qatar Airways, told reporters in late August that the carrier was poised to make a “large” aircraft purchase, adding to its backlog of orders for Boeing and Airbus Group SE planes. The US approved fighter-jet sales to Arabian Gulf allies including Qatar, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Boeing declined to comment on the discussions, as did a spokeswoman for Doha-based Qatar Airways. Double boost The two deals would provide boosts to Chicago-based Boeing as the world’s largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and second-largest defence contractor. The fighter-jet sale would help keep the company’s St Louis assembly lines busy through the early 2020s as US orders wane. That transaction could be valued at more than $7 billion for Boeing, Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note to clients. Boeing and Airbus have struggled to land sales of twin-aisle jetliners this year as a glut of second-hand 777 and Airbus A330 models curbed demand and the sold-out 787 was unavailable in the near term. Airlines in many parts of the world have reined in expansion plans as traffic has lagged behind projections, leading to overcapacity that drags down air fares. “From a producer standpoint, it’s badly needed,” Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said by phone. “From a customer’s, it doesn’t make sense unless it comes at the expense of another order,” he said, referring to Qatar’s bulging order backlog that includes an agreement to take Airbus A350 wide-bodies. Production plans If it is completed, the Qatar Airways purchase would be Boeing’s largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into its plans for the 777, Boeing’s largest twin-engined plane, as well as the Dreamliner, the company’s marquee carbon-fiber jet. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said earlier this month that sales campaigns underway could determine whether the plane maker boosts 787 output — and whether a dearth of orders will force it to again slow the assembly of the current-generation 777 models until an upgraded version of the plane debuts in 2020. While Boeing needs to sell 40 to 50 of the large jets annually to sustain current production plans, it has only netted eight 777 orders so far this year. “Obviously, pressure there, a number of campaigns under way. We need to be successful on some of those campaigns over the next two months to three months to hold that seven-a-month rate structure,” Muilenburg told a Morgan Stanley conference. Al Baker had said repeatedly that Qatar Airways intended to exercise the options it held to purchase 30 Dreamliners, a move that would double its Boeing 787 fleet. The carrier, which has global ambitions to match those of Dubai-based Emirates and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, also holds orders for another six Boeing 777 and 60 of the upgraded 777X, according to the planemaker’s website. Very strained The Qatar Airways CEO has signalled his growing frustration with Airbus in recent months, threatening to switch an order for 48 Airbus A320neo family planes to Boeing 737 Max jets after declining to take delivery of the first Airbus narrowbodies because of an engine cooling issue. Airbus has also drawn Al Baker’s ire for its struggles to meet delivery deadlines of the A350, the European company’s most advanced jetliner, which competes with the 787 and 777. The airline was the first buyer of the new Airbus wide-body. “Our relationship is very strained,” he told reporters last month. “What’s happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth.” More from Aviation Emirates faces issues with new A380 engines 05:29 pm US House stops sale of Boeing jets to Iran 04:57 pm Emirates faces issues with new A380 engines 04:57 pm Boeing to cut 500 jobs in defence and space unit EasyJet profit falls as currency woes take toll Berkshire bet on the biggest US airlines Etihad starts hiring additional crew Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac tags from this storyDubai follow this tag on MGNAbu Dhabi follow this tag on MGNQatar Airways follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGNAbu Dhabi follow this tag on MGN+ MGNQatar Airways follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In AviationEmirates faces issues with new A380 engines Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Emirates faces issues with new A380 engines 02Emirates faces issues with new A380 engines 03US House stops sale of Boeing jets to Iran 04Etihad starts hiring additional crew 05Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News UAE announces public, private sector holidays Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces Jailed, abused, and homeless Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Data of 34 million Keralites leaked Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Close Recommended For You Mohammad issues decree setting up MBR LibraryPUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Smart bus stops register 25,000 transactionsPUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Woman marries boyfriend in husband’s presencePUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

transport UPDATE 2-Boeing nears wide-body jet sale to Qatar Airways -sources 29 September, 2016 The Boeing logo is seen at their headquarters in Chicago, in this April 24, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo Reuters/Jim Young/File Photo (Rewrites with confirmation from sources) Sept 29 (Reuters) - Boeing Co is close to clinching a large sale of widebody jetliners to Qatar Airways, a deal that moved closer with the recent U.S. approval of Boeing fighter jet sales to the Gulf nation, according to two people familiar with the situation. Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. Advertisement If the deal is finalized, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the United States had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion. The United States also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has canceled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August. "What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth."

Virtually every poll.’ Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images Alan Yuhas @alanyuhas Friday 30 September 2016 06.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 18 November 2016 10.06 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Polls “Wow, did great in the debate polls (except for @CNN – which I don’t watch). Thank you!” – 27 September, Twitter “We won every poll. Virtually every poll.” – 27 September, Melbourne, Florida The lies Trump told this week: drugs are a 'big factor' in North Carolina protests Read more Trump did not win the post-debate polls. Trump seized on 11 online surveys, many of which allow people to vote many times, none of which vet respondents, and none of which weigh results according to actual voting demographics. Two of the online surveys Trump cited on Tuesday came from the Drudge Report, which excoriated his main primary rival almost daily this spring, and Breitbart News, whose executive chairman is Trump’s campaign chief executive. None of the 11 polls screened respondents or were predictive or representative of voters. It is therefore impossible to have any idea where those respondents are coming from, who they are, or whether they might be bots. On Fox & Friends on Tuesday morning, Trump also said: “I won CBS.” There was no post-debate CBS poll. Pollsters with more scruples heard Americans say that Trump lost the debate. A quick CNN poll – although imperfect – showed 62% of voters thought Clinton won versus 27% for Trump. A Politico/Morning Consult poll showed 49% for Clinton versus 26% for Trump. An Echelon Insights poll showed 48% of registered voters thought Clinton won and 22% believed Trump had won. The closest result was a survey by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning pollster: 51% for Clinton to 40% for Trump. Although these polls are hardly flawless, social media surveys do not compare. Trump did perform well in one poll, by LA Times/USC, which gave him a four-point lead. As a tracking poll, it did not ask about the debate. And although Trump claims not to watch CNN, this month alone he has tweeted commentary about its programming nine times, including three embedded videos (each of himself). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Presidential debate highlights: Clinton and Trump trade blows “A new post-debate poll that just came out, the Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by two points nationwide and that’s despite the fact that Google’s search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton. How about that?” – 28 September, interview with Fox News Trump is apparently referring to a poll by Independent Journal Review-Google Consumer Surveys poll – which said he lost the debate – and to a discredited conspiracy theory first propagated by the site SourceFed, which argued in June that Google’s autocomplete tool ought to turn up “Hillary Clinton criminal” when prompted by “Hillary Clinton cr”, because Google Trends shows an interest in this phrase and other search engines, Bing and Yahoo, do show “criminal”. As Rhea Drysdale, an executive at a search engine optimization firm, explained in June, SourceFed appears to have misunderstood Google’s algorithm. Autocomplete does not directly reflect what is popular on Google Trends, meaning it does not behave like Facebook’s trending news box, which promotes popular stories whether they are real, hoaxes, satire or conspiracy theories. SourceFed employees also appear not to have applied their random-letter-bias test to Trump. Typing “Donald Trump cr” turns up “crying”, “Crimea”, “crowds” and “crooked Hillary”. “Donald Trump in” turns up “India” and “Instagram”, with the same results for Clinton. In June, when the conspiracy theory first surfaced, a Google spokesman told CNN: “Our autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person’s name. “Google autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause. Claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how autocomplete works.” Donald Trump attacks 'biased' Lester Holt and accuses Google of conspiracy Read more Boeing and Ford “See that plane? That plane was built in America. Now that same company is going to start building these planes in China. I don’t like it.” – 27 September, Melbourne, Florida Boeing no longer makes 757 models like Trump’s private plane, an ageing aircraft he bought used. Boeing is building an assembly center, not technically a factory, in China. The company’s CEO, Ray Conner, has directly contradicted Trump’s accusation that it will outsource manufacturing. The deal “will also create more jobs here”, Conner told the Seattle Times. “It’s lopsided on what we get and give – we get more. It’s being portrayed as the opposite.” Conner also defended the plant last year, before Trump began criticizing it. Boeing 737s will be built in Washington state, he said, and then flown to China for interior assembly. The company also put out a statement saying it had opened a $1bn facility in Everett, Washington, and expanded its Seattle delivery center. “Ford is leaving, thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They are all leaving.” – 26 September, Hempstead, New York Like Connor, Ford chief executive Mark Fields took the unusual step for a businessman of dipping into politics to reject Trump’s claim. “It’s really sometimes disappointing when politics gets in the way of facts,” he told a Bloomberg Market summit on Wednesday. “What we announced is that we will be moving our small car out of our Michigan facility down to Mexico. But we’re going to be replacing that with two other vehicles. So the facts are zero jobs will be impacted here in the United States.” Referring to the union of autoworkers, Fielda added: “And this is an agreement that we have with the UAW.” He also said, correctly, that the car company ranks highest for vehicle factory jobs in the US, at least as of last year. Fields may have understated the initial impact of the Mexico plant, but he is correct that Ford has struck a deal to invest $9bn in US plants, creating 8,500 jobs in the UAW and building Mustangs, Lincolns and Tauruses in the midwest. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Biden attacks Trump for boasting about not paying taxes Catching up with Clinton “He’s paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody’s ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn’t pay any federal income tax.” – 26 September, Hempstead, New York None of the actual tax returns Clinton alluded to during Monday’s debate are public, but a 1981 report to New Jersey’s casino control commission, which reviewed Trump’s taxes from 1975 to 1979, shows that he paid federal income taxes for three of those five years. He did not pay taxes in two of those five years because he lost more money, $3.8m, than he made. “When I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.” – 26 September, Hempstead, New York The lies Trump told this week: from 'deplorables' to his interrupted speech Read more Clinton appears to be exaggerating how quickly Iran could have developed a bomb. During negotiations, intelligence officials and analysts said they believed Iran was two to three months away from bomb capabilities. The terms of the deal extend that “breakout” ability to a year, and have restrictions extending over 10, 15 and 25 years. “What I have proposed would not add a penny to the debt.” – 26 September, Hempstead, New York Clinton’s proposed tax plan would add $191bn to the debt over the long term, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative thinktank. The Tax Policy Center, however, estimates that she would add $1.1tn in revenue in a decade, though much of that would be offset by increased spending. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump’s plan would add $5.3tn to the debt.

Qatar Airways is in the process of firming up the order, which it was due to have placed at July's Farnborough airshow, but which was delayed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up US approval for the fighter contract, one of the sources said. Bloomberg reported that the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7 billion at list prices. Boeing declined to comment and Qatar Airways was not immediately available to comment. If the deal is finalised, it would give the Chicago-based planemaker a substantial sales boost amid a slump in widebody orders this year. It follows news on Wednesday that the US had begun notifying lawmakers informally that it had approved the sales of 36 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to Qatar, valued at around $4 billion. The US also approved the sale of fighters to Kuwait. The sales to both states had been pending for more than two years amid concerns raised by Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, that they could be used against it, and criticism of Qatar for alleged ties to armed Islamist groups. Qatar Airways chief executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in August that the airline planned to make a major aircraft order to enable its network expansion plans. In July the airline also said it was in advanced talks to purchase up to 30 of Boeing's 737 narrowbody planes. Earlier in the year, Qatar Airways refused to accept three Airbus A320neo narrowbody jets, because of engine cooling issues. The airline has cancelled its first A320neo delivery and said it must source alternate planes to meet demand. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney said in March it expected the cooling problem and other software issues to be fixed this year. Airbus is struggling to keep up with deliveries to Qatar Airways of the long-haul Airbus A350 planes. Those delays, combined with the A320neo problems, has put Qatar Airways at risk of posting a loss in the fiscal year that ends in March, Al Baker said in August. "Our relationship is very strained," Al Baker said in August. "What's happening at Airbus with the deliveries is seriously affecting our growth." - Reuters   Tags: | Qatar Airways | Boeing | Jet | Sale | More Industry, Logistics & Shipping Stories Adec, BAE throw key challenge to UAE students ADGB draws over 180 top UAE, international firms Hochtief ViCon completes Doha Metro work SR Technics opens training centre in Abu Dhabi Mideast power generation capacity to rise 66pc Topaz nine-month revenue falls 21pc G A I A to showcase at Jewellery Arabia Etihad Cargo expands freighter services in Europe Siemon launches new equipment rack series Novo Nordisk launches new basal insulin in Oman Drydocks World wins top Seatrade Maritime Award PDO deploys key Intergraph smart plant solution Qatar varsity, GIOC to boost industrial sector District cooling summit ends on high note Mena banks spending $12.5bn on hitech IT security Etihad, Airbus to develop A380 MRO services World Bank, Ithmar to set up green infrastructure fund Mena M&A deals fall 24 pc in Q3 $3bn UAE plant achieves key construction milestone Dubai coffee & tea festival sees 7,000 visitors Etihad Cargo boosts Europe freighter services Saudi diesel gensets market growth ‘set to decline’ Dubai group adopts Honeywell LBA technology First Avenue signs up Carrefour as anchor tenant UK asset manager sets up office in Abu Dhabi Saudi firm Taqnia gets key Microsoft certification Unigulf to unveil thermal, building insulation products Japanese companies grow by 19pc in Dafza Kuwait to start rail project bidding next year Bahrain origin goods export tops $342m Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

(Qantas) Qantas will carry Australia Post’s international parcels for the next five years under a new contract. The extension of the pair’s previous agreement was announced on Friday. Qantas Freight chief executive Gareth Evans said it was a “substantial contract to secure”. “We have transformed Qantas Freight to deliver flexible and efficient operations for the changing needs of our customers,” Evans said in a statement. “This partnership sees the Australia Post Group and Qantas Freight well-positioned to support the e-commerce industry, which relies on air freight for express delivery of its steadily increasing volumes of international packages and parcels.” Under the contract, the 1,500 international flights operated by the Qantas group of airlines will continue to carry Australia Post’s international letters and parcels. Further, Qantas Freight’s interline agreements with other carriers would “ensure the Australia Post Group has world-wide access” for the 12,000 tonnes of parcels. A file image of Australia Post chief executive Ahmed Fahour and Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce in front of a StarTrack-branded Boeing 737 freighter. (Qantas) The contract extension for international air freight followed the signing of a five-year agreement in 2015 for Qantas to carry Australia Post’s domestic mail, parcels and Express Post until the mid-2020s. And in May 2016, the airline established a dedicated sub-fleet of six freighter aircraft to deliver domestic mail, parcels and Express Post for Australia Post and its subsidiary StarTrack comprising two Boeing 737-300Fs and three BAe 146-300Fs from Qantas’s existing freighter fleet, as well as a new Boeing 737-400F branded with StarTrack livery. Meanwhile, Qantas Freight also operated one Boeing 767-300F and two Boeing 747-400F freighter aircraft on international routes. The 747 freighters were operated by Atlas on behalf of Qantas. Qantas, Australia Post and StarTrack have a long history of cooperation. Qantas and Australia Post formed domestic air freight operator Australian air Express in 1992 as a 50:50 joint venture, while in 2003, again as 50:50 partners, they acquired courier delivery company Star Track Express. In 2012 Qantas sold its share of StarTrack to Australia Post, and in turn acquired Australia Post’s 50 per cent share in Australian air Express. StarTrack chief executive and executive general manager Bob Black said the partnership with Qantas was “important for our customers”. “This strategic alliance – combined with our global reach through existing partnerships with key ecommerce platforms, postal and freight providers – will help Australian businesses and consumers buy and sell goods internationally with confidence, and complements our unrivalled domestic capability,” Black said. Qantas said at its 2016/17 results presentation in August its freight business suffered a 44 per cent drop in underlying earnings before interest and tax to $64 million, which the company said reflected flat cargo demand amid a six per cent increase in global cargo capacity. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia commenced its cargo operations with dedicated freighter aircraft ferrying parcels, food, documents and machinery for its major customer TNT and other clients in July 2016.

That chilly March morning in 2003 is forever etched in Smith’s memory, especially since a photo of the fire’s aftermath is framed on the wall in his office. “It was difficult to see something like that,” says Smith, who eventually rebuilt his shop with hard work and millions of dollars in investments. “It was all gone in just a few hours.” The remaining door frame served as a metaphor of sorts for Smith; given that when one door closed for him, another opened a few months later when he rebuilt, paving the way for a resurrection likely unseen by many in the finishing industry. Smith and his management team not only rebuilt the company, but they distinguished themselves amongst the most elite plating shops in the world, earning the distinction of being the Products Finishing Top Shops Benchmarking Survey’s No. 1 shop in 2016. It was an honor that almost brought Smith to tears, because it validated his struggles over the past decades not only to rebuild and survive in a tough economy, but also to carve out a niche for his employees. “To be recognized as the best shop in the U.S. is something that is a little hard to comprehend at first,” he says. “But I know how hard my employees and team have worked to get us to where we needed to be. It has been a struggle, but it has also been very rewarding. It was well worth it.” Precious Metal Plating Where Electro-Spec is thriving is in the fields of medical, automotive, aerospace, military and RF/microwave industries, often a tough challenge where high quality is demanded on an extremely repeatable basis. The company’s customer base includes the likes of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, Medtronic, Smiths Group, Energizer, Northrop Grumman, Honeywell and TRW. The shop specializes in precious and semi-precious materials such as gold, silver, nickel, copper, its proprietary Tri-M3 tri-alloy, electroless and electrolytic nickel in thicknesses 5 to 500 microinches. They plate over brass, copper, carbon steel, stainless steel, nickel, phosphorous and Kovar (nickel–cobalt ferrous alloy) among others in processes that include barrel, wire, selective and vibratory.   The SBE process is performed in a chamber with ultrasonic action, with a continuous flow of plating solution being pumped into and out of the chamber.   One of the processes that sets Electro-Spec apart from many shops is its specially designed spouted bed electrode (SBE) process for micro-sized active components that are less than 1 cm in size. The SBE process is performed in a chamber using ultrasonic action with a continuous flow of plating solution being pumped into and out of the chamber, which facilitates part movement and therefore provides fresh plating electrolyte during the process. This process is designed for gold, nickel, electroless nickel and copper plating, and is perfect for small parts with features such as flat surfaces, counter bores, tabs, nested parts or complex geometries. “It ensures that each part receives uniform plating coverage on all surface areas, no matter how complex the geometry,” Smith says. “This makes it the ideal process for parts where vibratory or conventional barrel plating is impossible, or even impractical.”   Technic patented the SBE process for plating small components such as electronic connectors, pins, chip capacitors and resistors.    Rapid Circulation of Parts Smith learned of the SBE process from Technic, which patented it for plating small components such as electronic connectors, pins, chip capacitors and resistors. The SBE system replaces a 4- by 6-inch barrel using a special chamber with a load size from 50 to 500 milliliters, and it uses significantly less conductive media. “The SBE plating chamber’s unique design provides for a rapid circulation of the parts over the cathode current feeder without the use of any mechanical movement,” says Dr. George Hradil, Technic’s research director. “Plating solution flow rates carrying the parts through the chamber are exceptionally high, up to 60 liters per minute, which ensures that the parts are always plated in ‘fresh solution,’ irrespective of the configuration and size.” Both of these attributes result in greatly improved part-to-part thickness distribution and a significant reduction in part-to-part coupling, he says, adding that the SBE’s narrower thickness distribution curve allows the SMT producer to target the average plating thickness of a given load much closer to customer minimum thickness requirements than can be done in standard barrel plating equipment. “Another advantage of the SBE plating chamber is the elimination of tin or nickel deposits in the screened area of the chamber,” Hradil says. “Unlike a barrel—where plating takes place when the parts are on the barrel screens—the SBE screens are located in a non-plating area. This greatly cuts down on the maintenance of the plating chamber.”   Used in the SBE process, these baskets are designed for small parts with flat surfaces, counter bores, tabs, nested parts or complex geometries.    Small parts are a specialty of Electro-Spec, shown by the 265 million parts it coated in 2015. But the challenge is not just plating the parts—some of which could be implanted into a human body through a heart device—but doing so in a high-quality, zero-reject environment. That was one of the reasons that Electro-Spec landed atop the Products Finishing Top Shops Benchmarking Survey list. It scored well in each of the four criteria used to determine the benchmarking standards: Current Finishing Technology, Finishing Practices and Performances, Business Strategies and Human Resources/Training. Benchmarking Standards “We used the benchmarking numbers from the Top Shops in 2015 to try to improve all of our processes,” Smith says. “It really is a great tool to be able to measure yourself against others in the industry.” It is also a tribute to the determination of Smith, who holds a bachelor’s degree in government and professional administration from the University of Notre Dame, and who first started working at Electro-Spec in 1994 after he graduated. In 1997, Smith purchased the company from owner David Yates and took the shop from eight people and $1 million in revenue to more than 40 people with a revenue of approximately $5 million, just five years later. But all that growth came to a fiery halt in 2003 when just after midnight a piece of faulty equipment sparked a fire that roared so violently that officials on the scene said it caused some tanks to explode and the surrounding neighborhood to be evacuated. All that remained standing was the metal door frame, but the tragedy didn’t deter Smith. While he was forced to lay off half his workers, he immediately began searching for a site to rebuild, and found it several days later just up the road, a 28,000-square-foot facility that was double what he had before. While the rebuilding took place, the company was essentially out of business for a year. “The big thing was to stay in contact with our customers as much as we could,” says Darren Habig, Electro-Spec’s director of business development. “We drove parts to another plater for our customers, and really anything we could do for them. We all had lists of our customers, and we would talk to them all regularly about our rebuilding efforts.” Company Reinvention Smith and his team chose to reinvent Electro-Spec, and borrowed and invested millions of dollars in new equipment and automation to build what they deemed the best state-of-the-art plating facility in the U.S. He and his management team targeted OEMs that demanded repeatable high-quality coatings, and then showed them what the company could do. “We sought companies that demanded a high level of control and automation to the plating process,” he says. “Our team really pulled together to make this work. It was because of them, not me, that we are here today.” Electro-Spec was given the Indiana Blue Chip Business Award in 2004 because of its determination to recover from the fire, and Smith was given the Businessman of the Year award by the City of Franklin that same year. Electro-Spec focuses on teamwork in every phase of the operation, including a commitment toward continual improvement by providing Six Sigma training (green and yellow belt) for all employees. “Whether they are a new hire or an employee with 25 years of service, every employee plays an integral part in the development and growth of the company,” Smith says. “As a group we inspire each other, and as a team we aspire to succeed.” The company also grew thanks to its success in four areas: Aerospace, where it is a supplier to several of the leading aerospace companies for years, and are involved in several cutting edge technologies Medical, specializing in micro-electronic medical components to implantable components and bio-hazard/germicidal components Automotive, as leading plating supplier to many Tier One and Two automotive companies, including successful conversions for many different methods and processes that have impacted Ford, GM and Chrysler on safety-critical components RF/Microwave, a continuation of over 40 years where it has worked with many of the world’s leading telecommunication companies   “We have done a very good job of not only staying in contact with our customers, but also working very closely with our suppliers to learn about the new chemistries they may have that could help our customers, or even go after new ones,” says Mary Gordon, Electro-Spec’s plant manager and director of operations. “But we spend a lot of time testing these new chemistries before we take them to our customers, just to make sure they can do what we want it to do.” Testing Processes Habig says Electro-Spec has built its entire strategic plan around working closely with customers to test new processes and see where improvements can be made, or where they might not work in full production. “We ask a lot of questions of our customers about what they are working on, or what they are working with,” Habig says. “It helps us better understand their need today, and in the future.” Things slowed when the recession of 2008 hit, but Electro-Spec quickly grew almost 70 percent in the ensuing years, going from approximately $6 million in sales to over $10 million. The growth was fueled in 2012 when Electro-Spec purchased the plating division of a company in Kansas and relocated its operations to a new, larger facility in Franklin, where it has nearly doubled its space to about 60,000 square feet and has 12 acres if it needs to expand again. Smith says the company is now doing business on an international basis and has 85 employees with sales over $12 million. A lot of that growth comes from several unique patented processes that Electro-Spec’s engineering team has come up with. When the team identified a need for a plating process that would enhance the performance of RF connectors, it developed Tri-M3 finish, which is 55 percent copper, 30 percent tin, and 15 percent zinc. “For years, electronic component manufacturers have essentially had two plating choices: nickel or silver,” he says. “Both of these options have their strengths and weaknesses, but government pressure to eliminate nickel plating—coupled with soaring silver costs—has made both of these choices less palatable.” He says Tri-M3 presents a superior substitute to nickel and silver plating, in nearly all applications, with a shelf life that far exceeds traditional silver plating. Smith says the process has a low surface friction, that is approximately 70 percent that of silver, with high conductivity, superior abrasion resistance, excellent solderability and low internal stress, which allows for forming of plating components. Antimicrobial Finishes for Medical Smith is also president and CEO of Steriplate, which he formed in 2013, focusing on the design, development and implementation of antimicrobial finishes for medical and commercial applications. Smith holds a provisional patent application for the Steriplate technology and has filed a utility patent application for the Steriplate technology. He also recently testified in front of the U.S. House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Research and Technology about technology for patient safety at Veterans Hospitals, especially that which is designed to stop hospital acquired infections (HAI) among veterans. “There is the ability of many types of metals to provide a continuous antimicrobial surface to help prevent the spread of HAIs,” Smith says. “There are infinite possibilities of utilizing metal as an antimicrobial finish in a variety of applications inside and outside the human body.”     For information on Electro-Spec, visit electro-spec.com, or call 317-738-9199.   Originally published in the October 2016 issue.        Comments are reviewed by moderators before they appear to ensure they meet Products Finishing’s submission guidelines.

"The investigation cannot abstract from whatever versions on the basis of a paradigm Russia is responsible," he said in an interview with the First Channel. "It is impossible to have an investigation based on the paradigm, where in several minutes after the tragedy certain countries claim at official levels Russia is responsible." "In that case, it is doomed to failure, lack of objectivity." Preliminary findings On Sept. 28, the Joint Investigation Team consisting of representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Australia, Malaysia and Belgium, presented its first preliminary results of the criminal investigation into the MH17 crash in Donbass. The JIT claims that the plane was shot down with a BUK missile brought from Russia’s territory. The investigators said the missile was launched from the Pervomayskoye village to the south of Snezhnoye, which was controlled by self-defense militias at that time. The JIT has not studied the data provided by Russia that rejected this version. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it doubts that the conclusions of the investigators are objective. "The data, which the investigation team presented at a briefing on Wednesday, had been taken from two main sources: the Internet and Ukraine’s security services. Therefore, the objectivity of that data and consequently the conclusions made on its basis cannot but be doubtful," the ministry’s official spokesman Igor Konashenkov stressed. He also assured that no Russian air defense systems have ever crossed the Ukrainian border. The Malaysia Airlines Boeing -777 flight MH17, which was on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in Donbass on July 17, 2014. All the 283 passengers and 15 crew members, nationals of ten countries, died in the crash.

(NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA United States) Abstract: In the 1980s NASA Aeronautics was actively involved in full-scale wind tunnel testing of promising VSTOL aircraft concepts. This presentation looks at two, a multi-role fighter and a subsonic tactical transport. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with some of the rationale that ultimately led to the selection of competing concepts for production, namely the V-22 Osprey and the F-35 Lightning. The E7-A STOVL multi-role fighter was the product of an aircraft development program in the late 1980s by NASA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Canadian Department of Industry Science and Technology (DIST), and industry partners General Dynamics and Boeing Dehavilland. The program was conducted an in response to increasing US-UK interest in supersonic STOVL fighters. The objective was to design an aircraft that could replace most existing close air support-air combat fighters with a single aircraft that had some of the qualities of an air superiority fighter and the deployment flexibility of a VSTOL aircraft. The resulting E7-A concept was a delta-wing supersonic fighter that used a fuselage-mounted thrust augmenting ejector and a ventral deflecting jet nozzle for vertical lift. The Grumman Aircraft Company, the Navy, and NASA developed the Design-698 (D-698) subsonic tactical transport in response to the Navy's Type A VSTOL utility aircraft requirement. The objective was to develop a subsonic utility transport with the operational flexibility of a helicopter, but with greater speed and range. The D-698 employs two high-bypass turbofan engines mounted on a dumbbell that rotates through ninety degrees for vertical takeoff and cruise flight. Movable vanes positioned in the exhaust flow provide control in hover with the need for reaction control jets. The presentations concluding comments suggest that technology advances in the last thirty-years may justify the value of revisiting some of these concepts.

Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle, commander of Air Force Air Combat Command (ACC), late last week declared the QF-16 Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) initially operationally capable. The QF-16 is an unmanned F-16 used, in this program, for providing threat-representative presentation for developmental and operational test and evaluation for weapons systems as mandated by law, Department of Defense documents said of the FSAT program. According to the main contractor, Boeing: “The QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target will provide the next generation of combat training and testing for U.S. warfighters. Retired F-16 aircraft are converted into QF-16 aerial targets for the purpose of testing newly developed weapons and tactics. The QF-16 will replace the existing QF-4 fleet, and provide a higher capability, fourth generation aerial target that is more representative of today’s targets and threats.” The decision by ACC certifies 15 QF-16s ready and available for target operations, according to an ACC release. They are assigned to Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and flown by the 82nd Aerial Target Squadron under the 53rd Wing. In this sense, initial operational capability (IOC) means that the squadron now has 15 aircraft “plus trained pilots and maintainers to provide unmanned QF-16 aerial targets in the Gulf Range from Tyndall AFB," Lt. Col. Matthew Garrison, 82nd Aerial Target Squadron commander at Tyndall, told C4ISRNET in an email. “This also required that we have the hardware, software and technicians to maintain and operate the target control system. There were several intermediate steps along the way including unmanned QF-16 target missions supporting JSF [joint strike fighter] testing that supported the recent F-35A IOC declaration.” The new QF-16 fleet replaces the QF-4 fleet that served the same purpose. ACC assured that QF-16 is the introduction of fourth-generation fighter capabilities in the aerial target mission maintaining all capabilities of the baseline F-16 including supersonic flight and 9 G maneuverability. Garrison added that “[w]e are already full steam ahead because we are supporting back-to-back QF-16 target missions tomorrow for [ Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile] AMRAAM involving USN F-18s and new software for USAF F-16s.” “This leap forward in airframe capabilities, combined with advanced electronic pods, will allow us to properly test and evaluate our 5th generation aircraft and weapons,” he said. The QF-16 has been thought of to contribute to the Air Force’s loyal wingmen program, which seeks to pair unmanned fourth-generation fighters with fifth-generation manned platforms. Within this construct, Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work has described it as a battle node network in line with the third offset strategy “where you take an F-16, make it totally unmanned — F-16 is a fourth-generation fighter – and pair it with an F-35 – a fifth-generation, what I would call battle network node — and those two operating together,” he said at a Washington Post event. This concept can help navigate around anti-access/area denial environments, which aim to extend the range of adversarial forces and capabilities, by serving as a missile truck for fifth-generation fighters that are limited in their payload capability and accompanying them at high rates of speed currently unique vis-à-vis other unmanned platforms. “We have not participated in any technology demonstrations with the Loyal Wingman program but have provided them with answers to specific questions when asked,” Garrison said. “Generally these have been centered on our target control system. We also discussed some general lessons learned about maintaining and operating large, unmanned aerial platforms.” Attribution of Russia in DNC hack has curtailed Kremlin's hacking, Clapper says by Mark Pomerleau The Director of National Intelligence told Congress Russian hacking activity in cyberspace has curta… Share Tweet DISA’s role in the third offset strategy by Mark Pomerleau How can DISA lend a hand in the third offset strategy?

Standing in a cluster near the runway at the Cape Girardeau Regional Airport is a small group of World War II veterans. While swapping old war stories from the good old days they were waiting. Eagerly waiting for the arrival of the iconic B-17 bomber.   “It's just a wonderful opportunity,” said Floyd Smith a World War II veteran. “I wish the whole city could turn out and watch this thing land. It's something that you just don't see. There it comes right there. And it's something you don't see everyday. You know? And I just wish so many kids could see that. Oh what a wonderful sight.” In its heyday, the B-17 bomber was a force to be reckoned with. During World War II, the flying fortress dropped more than 600,000 tons of bombs in Europe. Virtually helping to turn the tide of the war. But these days only a handful of those heavy bombers are flyable. One of them is Sentimental Journey. She’s one of the most authentically restored B-17’s out there today. Recently, the iconic warbird found its way to the airport as part of the Flying Legends Victory Tour.   Shelby Bolkey is the loadmaster of the Sentimental Journey. She’s a redhead with a fiery personality to match. And she’s passionate about are her heroes. “My dad was in the Navy,” Bolkey said. “My father-in-law was there when they took the bridge at Remagen. One of the bloodiest battles that was the first bridge across the Rhine river. And so they're both gone. And so to be able to honor their memory is this is part of it. This plane is a symbol of all of them, but you know how can you not? They gave us a free world. How can you not honor them?”   Larry Perkins is the pilot of Sentimental Journey, and he’s been flying her for nearly 26 years. “If it weren't for B-17's carrying out their missions, you and I'd be speaking German right now,” Perkins said. “It was very important to the war and they took some terrible losses. I believe there were about 4,000 of them shot down. And you know on each of those airplanes there's 10 people.” Perkins served in the Army during the Vietnam War. He said he’s honored to fly his fellow veterans a plane ride of a lifetime.   “I would have liked to have been young enough to join them,” Perkins said. “You couldn't fly or serve with better people. And the people who come out have such rich stories.” Unlike other B-17’s you see in old war photos or movies, this aluminum beauty is bare-metal.   “At the end of the war they didn't take time to paint the airplanes,” Perkins said. “The last P-51's built, the last B-17's built were all bare-metal.” While we’re talking about her look, her nose art is of the famous ‘40s pinup model with the Million Dollar Legs, Betty Grable. “You notice that she has her posterior toward the camera,” Perkins said.   At the time, it was rumored Grable was pregnant, but it was never confirmed. However, the plane’s namesake comes from the Doris Day and Les Brown ‘40s hit Sentimental Journey. But don’t let her age or beauty fool you. She’s a solid warbird. “It's about as safe an airplane as you can fly in,” Perkins said. “It has 4 engines. It'll fly real well on two-engines. And if you remember the battle damage that the airplanes flew home with, the airplane is literally built like a bridge.”   A Boeing design, Sentimental Journey was built in 1944 in Long Beach, California. Because of manufacturing she didn’t see any combat. Instead she was sent over to the Pacific theater for the rest of the war. Three years later she became an aerial mapping plane. “Her last military job she was the mothership to remotely control another B-17 through a nuclear blast,” said Bolkey.   For nearly two decades, Sentimental Journey was used to fight forest fires for a company in California. She was relieved from her duties of dropping slurry on those fires when they discovered that the slurry was corrosive to her aluminum exterior. So they moved her to a field. Birds made a home in her engine. Her tires were flat and her propellers were bent. The company eventually decided to auction her off. “At the auction two guys were bidding to get her,” Bolkey said. “One literally wanted to turn her into beer cans. The other one was our first leader and he had the dream that we could bring her back to life and we could fly her.” Airbase Arizona got her. They cleaned her up and flew her to her current home in Mesa, Arizona. It took 18 years to fully restore her back to her former glory. And now she serves as a flying museum for veterans and civilians. When you step onto the plane the first thing you’ll see our guns and ammunition. The seats are more like nets and the inside is pretty crammed. Bolkey who was our guide motions us to take a seat, buckle up and enjoy the view as we fly over Cape Girardeau. When the flight was over she gave us her flight attendant speech. “We know you have a choice when you fly,” Bolkey said. “So the next time you decide to go blasting through the air in an unpressurized aluminum tube, we hope you'll fly with Airbase Arizona.” After the flight, Smith said he left the plane with a different perspective. “I didn't realize how important it was to the overall victory that we had to have you know,” Smith said. “Now this is just one airplane of course. [But]  then I think about all of them doing the same thing and the guys on the ground dying. And I realize how important this bomber is.” While he enjoyed spending the day catching up with old comrades, there was one veteran that was on his mind--Clifford Heinrich. Heinrich was 18 at the time of the war. Serving as a tail gunner on B-17, his plane crashed coming back from a mission. “We went on a mission and we came back to England,” Heinrich said. “[We] made it back to England alright. And we crashed and we crashed when we get there.” By the time the plane hit the ground he made it to the plane’s radio room where a nearby nurse found him. “[The] nurse was there near where we crashed,” Heinrich said. “And she's the one that pulled me out.” Heinrich was the only one to make it out alive from his 10 man crew. He spent the next 14 months in a hospital. For more than six decades his efforts went unrecognized. Earlier this year that changed when he received a Purple Heart medal among others. To this day it’s still unknown as to what exactly caused the crash. But it’s stories like Heinrich’s that remind this crew what it’s really all about. Underneath the wide open bomb bay doors, Bolkey pointed out the scattered names of veterans and their comrades. “[The] people who have come out and flown with his us that have actually been veterans and flown in a B-17, we have them sign our doors,” Bolkey said. “This is our wall of honor.” This one was Earl’s. He was a pilot of a B-17. “We saw him on July 7, 2014,” Bolkey said. “He was the pilot. He listed all of his crew members including the three that were killed in action. So when they went down. He lost let's see his radio operator. His left waist gunner and the ball turret gunner.” All of this hits home for Bolkey. Her husband served 22 years in the military and her son served in Iraq. “I sent my son off to Iraq,” Bolkey said. “ And within four days he lost his best friend. And within two weeks he lost four of his troops. And he said ‘I grew up watching World War II movies where I had to you know watch the guy write the letter home.’ He said ‘[I] never knew how hard that was until I had to write four.’ You know luckily he came home.” For many of these veterans Sentimental Journey is more than just a piece of history. It’s a place to say goodbyes. “We had a gentleman that came and struggled to get his walker out of his car, and struggled his way all the way up to the plane, and he put his hand on the star in the back,” Bolkey said.  And I waited until he stood up and I said I would help get back to his old crew position if he wanted to, and he said ‘I came to say goodbye to ghosts.’ You know and you think about that.” Tags:  Going Public B-17 Bomber WWII Airbase Arizona Sentimental Journey TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2016 KRCU About KRCU Driving Directions Annual Reports Contact Us

(1:33) Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email comment Oct 1, 2016 Ivan MaiselESPN Senior Writer Close Senior college football writer Six-time FWAA award winner Graduate of Stanford University Follow on Twitter Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email print comment SEATTLE -- Washington honored the players who won the 1991 national championship team at halftime Friday night. They ambled out on the FieldTurf at Husky Stadium, 65 middle-aged men who looked nothing like a No. 1 team. The 10th-ranked guys in purple who embarrassed No. 7 Stanford, 44-6, however, might have something to say about the College Football Playoff. Do not refresh this page -- that score is correct, the largest margin of victory over a top-10 team in Washington history. It reflects the complete dominance that the Huskies exerted over the Cardinal on both sides of the line, in the kicking game, in time of possession and every other way you can measure two teams on the same field. "That was special," Washington head coach Chris Petersen said. "I'm really proud of how hard they played, how good they played. We're still a work in progress, but that was a good step forward." You could say that. Washington scored quick and scored slow. The Huskies gained two yards (424) for every one they allowed (213). They held Stanford junior Christian McCaffrey to 49 yards on 12 carries, and it might have been the best 49-yard game in the history of Heisman candidates. When the Stanford offensive line wasn't busy not opening holes for McCaffrey, they were giving up eight sacks of Ryan Burns (six) and Keller Chryst (two). Fans stormed the field after Washington routed Stanford. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren McCaffrey being McCaffrey, he still finished with 223 all-purpose yards. But if you keep returning kickoffs, that means the other team is scoring. McCaffrey returned a total of three kickoffs in Stanford's first three games. He returned five Friday night for 144 yards, including a 57-yarder. "Those kids were playing really inspired ball by the energy in that stadium," Petersen said of his team. "They were excited to play Stanford, but it hasn't been like that since I've been here (three seasons)." This was Husky Stadium from the glory years, the noise bouncing off the metal overhangs on each grandstand and sounding like the Boeing jets for which this area is known. "I mean, it's been loud," said Washington junior safety Budda Baker, who grew up in nearby Bellevue, "but that was some other type of loud. That was Seahawks-type loud." The crowd of 72,027, the biggest since Washington opened the renovated stadium three years ago, reveled in the Huskies' dominance, a callback to this program's glory days in the early 1990s. Hey, anyone can have a bad quarter-century. Washington did have that Rose Bowl season in 2000, when the Huskies finished No. 3. What followed was a steady slide into oblivion, bottoming out with an 0-12 record in 2008. Steve Sarkisian returned the Huskies to respectability before he bolted for USC after five seasons. And now, in his third season on Montlake, Petersen has built a team that looks a lot like his Boise State teams, the ones that went 92-12 (.885) and won two BCS bowls in eight seasons. "I think these guys, our team, has a lot to 'em," Petersen said. "Those are the flashes we've been seeing, feeling for a long time. It's nice when it all kind of comes together at home in this environment. I think it was really cool that the '91 team was here." Washington's Connor O'Brien and Azeem Victor tackle Stanford's Christian McCaffrey. Jennifer Buchanan/USA TODAY Sports Stanford endured a complete meltdown. The Cardinal made glaring physical and mental mistakes in all three phases of the game, and it didn't help that Stanford lost four starters to injury last week. "Well, that was about as poorly as we could play from start to finish," Stanford coach David Shaw said. Like having to call timeout on fourth down during two possessions in Huskies territory because Burns couldn't get the play off. Like Stanford left tackle A.T. Hall, perhaps not hearing the snap count, never coming out of his stance as defensive end Joe Mathis ran around him and smashed into Burns. Like Huskies wide receiver John Ross racing through the depleted Cardinal secondary unimpeded, except for the two plays on which Stanford interfered with him. Ross made four catches for 82 yards and caught one of Jake Browning's three touchdowns. Both Cardinal starting cornerbacks missed the game because of injury, and Ross, the junior with 4.3 speed, kept plenty of space between him and the guys who could play. Editor's Picks Hype, realized: Washington blows out Stanford for signature win The Washington hype is only going to intensify after the No. 10 Huskies rout seventh-ranked Stanford. Like finally forcing a Washington punt in the third quarter, which hit Stanford blocker Ben Edwards in the back, allowing the Huskies' Lavon Coleman to recover it at the Stanford 40. Washington scored five plays later to go ahead 30-0. Washington even won the coin toss. "Honestly, it's still kind of sinking in," said defensive tackle Elijah Qualls, who made five tackles. "I've definitely never been on the field when the crowd rushed it, so that was kind of interesting. I almost got run over." The fans tumbled onto the turf to celebrate knocking off the team that has won three of the past four Pac-12 titles. Washington has seven regular-season games left, beginning next week with a visit to historic rival Oregon. The Huskies leave this game in charge of the Pac-12 North, but Petersen doesn't want to hear anything about this performance announcing the arrival of an old power. He is leaving Saturday morning to recruit. It is back to business as usual. It has to be. "We're not there," Petersen said. "I'm not saying we're there. I know how this thing goes. You sleep on anybody, feeling like we got it, we got it figured out. I know what comes next." Not if the Huskies play as they did Friday night. They looked like the Huskies of old.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. HOUSTON COUNTY, Georgia (CNN) When vintage World War II bombers known as B-25 Mitchells thrill fans on the U.S. airshow circuit, they honor the legacy of one of the most daring military missions in American history. At Georgia's Perry-Houston County Airport on Friday a B-25 named Show Me sat at the end of Runway 36. Its powerful propeller twin engines shook the seats as the bomber waited to takeoff -- a little bit like Jimmy Doolittle and his raiders did in 1942 aboard the USS Hornet. Eighty men volunteered for that mission -- what turned out to be a one-way air attack -- vengeance for Japan's strike on Hawaii that crippled the U.S. Navy fleet and left 2,403 dead. For them, Pearl Harbor was their 9/11. After four months, it was time for payback. The mission -- depicted in the 2001 film "Pearl Harbor" -- called for 16 US B-25s to take off from an aircraft carrier near Japan. The planes would bomb five Japanese cities and fly on to China, where the men would connect with friendly forces who would help them get home. On April 18, 1942, Doolittle and co-pilot Richard E. "Dick" Cole sat in the cockpit of their B-25 going over a preflight check list with the engines running. "I was setting the engine cowl flaps and watching to make sure the engines didn't overheat," said Cole, now 101 years old and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel. "It was a bit hectic," he said, because crews were scrambling. The mission launch was moved up by 12 hours because of fears that Tokyo had been tipped off. As a result, the B-25s would have to take off hundreds of miles farther from Japan than planned. That meant the planes wouldn't have enough fuel to guarantee they'd land safely in China. "We were the first plane," Cole said. "I remember I was hoping that we had done everything that we needed to do to make the takeoff. " A versatile airplane Aboard our Friday B-25 flight in Georgia, Show Me's pilot, Craig O'Mara, kept his feet on the brakes while pushing the throttles forward --- revving up the ridiculously loud engines. "The noise is intense," said David Thompsen, another Show Me pilot, because engine exhaust pipes aim toward the cockpit and crew cabin. With a green light from air traffic controllers, O'Mara released the brake and unleashed the aircraft. The 72-year-old plane raced 2,000 to 2,500 feet down the runway, accelerating to about 120 mph before completely leaving the ground. Owned by the Commemorative Air Force, Show Me appears at airshows nationwide to promote the Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity which helps give a voice to disabled US vets returning from war. This weekend, the plane is one of the stars of the Thunder Over Georgia airshow at nearby Robins Air Force Base. During its heyday, the B-25 was a respectable warplane -- distinguished by its twin-tail and versatility. "It became the most heavily armed airplane in the world, was used for high- and low-level bombing, strafing, photoreconnaissance, submarine patrol, and even as a fighter," according to Boeing. Of nearly 10,000 B-25s built by North American Aviation, Show Me (which was not on the Doolittle Raid) is among fewer than 50 that can still fly. From our Georgia airport, it's about 300 miles to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where Doolittle's raiders trained in secret seven decades ago to learn cross-country navigation without radios or landmarks and how to execute short takeoffs from ships. "The highest risk for pilots during takeoff from a carrier would have been an engine failure at a slow speed," Thompsen said. Engine failure would force pilots to abort takeoff. They risked losing control of the plane which could allow it to veer into key structures on the ship. The mission begins A typical B-25 takeoff uses about 2,000 feet of runway, Thompsen said. But the Hornet's deck allowed the planes as little as 300 feet to get airborne --- otherwise they'd drop off the edge and crash into the ocean. Amazingly, the mission pilots had been trained to be able to take off as slowly as 75 mph with as little as 250 feet of runway. Have pilots ever tried that with Show Me? "No we haven't," Thompsen said. "That's a high-risk maneuver and we don't do that. We try to treat her gently." With the natural winds, combined with speed from the moving ship, the B-25s only needed to get up to about 23 mph to fly off the Hornet, Cole said. Japan was about 650 miles away. A flag on the deck green-lighted the takeoff. It was time. Both Cole and Doolittle kept their hands on the engine throttles to make sure the levers didn't accidentally slip downward and -- in case of engine failure -- to quickly bring the plane to a stop. With his engines revving hard, Doolittle released the brakes, sending the plane barreling toward the ship's edge. Seconds later, the first raiders were airborne. 'A little bit scary' They made one circle over the Hornet and then pointed the airplane toward Japan. Soon, all 15 remaining planes followed. The grueling mission had begun. "I remember thinking we had just separated ourselves from civilization," Cole said. "The range of our short-wave radio was only about 45 miles and we were going to be more than 45 miles away from civilization for eight or 10 hours." "In a way it was a little bit scary," he said. But they were fully committed. There was no turning back. To avoid detection, the raiders flew extremely close to the Pacific --- sometimes dangerously low. At speeds around 190 mph, Doolittle flew about 200 feet above the water. Incredibly, some pilots flew as low as 50 feet. One stiff wind or mistake in the cockpit could've sent the 14-ton bombers crashing into the ocean. 'Drop the bombs' At about noon, Doolittle and Cole's crew were the first of the raiders to reach Tokyo. Still flying low, they encountered no air attacks, Cole said. Apparently, the element of surprise was intact. Bombardier Fred Braemer found a target and "Col. Doolittle pulled up to 1,500 feet and said, 'Drop the bombs,'" Cole recalled. At one point over Tokyo, Cole spotted several Japanese aircraft high above. "Apparently they did not see us," he said. The B-25's bomb bay is pretty much completely enclosed: "The bomb bay doors are hydraulically operated and they move very fast," Thompsen said. "When they close, they're kind of like a guillotine." Overall, the raiders' 16 planes hit factory areas, oil-storage facilities and military installations. Despite plenty of anti-aircraft fire from the ground, all the planes reached their targets without being shot down. The raiders had accomplished their mission. They disproved Japan's claims that the mainland was impervious to enemy attack. They also had dealt America's first blow in response to Pearl Harbor -- raising morale back home. "I felt that we made a pretty good retaliatory strike," Cole said. Jumping out of a plane in the dark during a storm But the mission was far from over. They still had to get home -- via China. When Doolittle and Cole's plane reached the Chinese coast they were running low on fuel. Worse, it was dark and they were surrounded by a powerful storm. With no safe landing zone in sight, Doolittle ordered his crew to bail out at 9,000 feet, traveling about 166 mph. "All kinds of ideas go through your head" before you jump out of an airplane into the dark during a thunderstorm," Cole said. "Number one, you hoped that the 'chute would work and number two, you hoped you'd have a sense to know what you were going to hit in the terrain below you when you bailed out." "Fortunately for me, I didn't have to worry about hitting the ground," he said. "My 'chute opened fine and it caught on a small pine tree which made my landing very easy." Cole spent the night in his parachute, suspended about 10 feet off the ground. The next day he met up with friendly Chinese Nationalist troops who also found Doolittle and the rest of the crew. A few days later they all were escorted to a U.S. military aircraft, which flew them to safety. The legacy Overall, 11 crews bailed out of their bombers. Four planes crash-landed. One crew flew to the Soviet Union. Of the 80 raiders, three were killed in action. Eight were captured; one starved to death in a Japanese prison camp and three were executed. As if they hadn't done enough, after recovering from their mission, many raiders, including Cole, rejoined the war to fight again. After the war, the surviving raiders lived out the rest of their lives, pursuing careers, building families, enjoying their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The survivors would reunite to toast their victory and their comrades. Two weeks ago, the Air Force honored the mission's legacy by naming its new long-range B-21 bomber The Raider, which is expected fly as soon as the mid-20s. Last June, former B-25 gunner/engineer David Thatcher died at age 94, making Cole the last living raider. When you can look back on a life like Cole's, you've likely learned a few lessons along the way. The man who helped lead the Doolittle raiders offered some advice. "As you go through life," Cole said, "expect the unexpected." Copyright 2016 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved.

At speeds around 190 mph, Doolittle flew about 200 feet above the water. Incredibly, some pilots flew as low as 50 feet. One stiff wind or mistake in the cockpit could’ve sent the 14-ton bombers crashing into the ocean. ‘Drop the bombs’ At about noon, Doolittle and Cole’s crew were the first of the raiders to reach Tokyo. Still flying low, they encountered no air attacks, Cole said. Apparently, the element of surprise was intact. Bombardier Fred Braemer found a target and “Col. Doolittle pulled up to 1,500 feet and said, ‘Drop the bombs,'” Cole recalled. At one point over Tokyo Cole spotted several Japanese aircraft high above. “Apparently they did not see us,” he said. The B-25’s bomb bay is pretty much completely enclosed. “The bomb bay doors are hydraulically operated and they move very fast,” Thompsen said. “When they close, they’re kind of like a guillotine.” Overall, the raiders’ 16 planes hit factory areas, oil storage facilities and military installations. Despite plenty of anti-aircraft fire from the ground, all the planes reached their targets without being shot down. The raiders had accomplished their mission. They disproved Japan’s claims that the mainland was impervious to enemy attack. They also had dealt America’s first blow in response to Pearl Harbor — raising morale back home. “I felt that we made a pretty good retaliatory strike,” Cole said. Jumping out of a plane in the dark during a storm But the mission was far from over. They still had to get home — via China. When Doolittle and Cole’s plane reached the Chinese coast they were running low on fuel. Worse, it was dark and they were surrounded by a powerful storm. With no safe landing zone in sight, Doolittle ordered his crew to bail out at 9,000 feet, traveling about 166 mph. “All kinds of ideas go through your head” before you jump out of an airplane into the dark during a thunderstorm,” Cole said. “Number one, you hoped that the ‘chute would work and number two, you hoped you’d have a sense to know what you were going to hit in the terrain below you when you bailed out.” “Fortunately for me, I didn’t have to worry about hitting the ground,” he said. “My ‘chute opened fine and it caught on a small pine tree which made my landing very easy.” Cole spent the night in his parachute, suspended about 10 feet off the ground. The next day he met up with friendly Chinese Nationalist troops who also found Doolittle and the rest of the crew. A few days later they all were escorted to a US military aircraft, which flew them to safety. The legacy Overall, 11 crews bailed out of their bombers. Four planes crash-landed. One crew flew to the Soviet Union. Of the 80 raiders, three were killed in action. Eight were captured; one starved to death in a Japanese prison camp and three were executed. As if they hadn’t done enough, after recovering from their mission, many raiders, including Cole, rejoined the war to fight again. After the war, the surviving raiders lived out the rest of their lives, pursuing careers, building families, enjoying their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The survivors would reunite to toast their victory and their comrades. Two weeks ago the Air Force honored the mission’s legacy by naming its new long-range B-21 bomber The Raider, which is expected fly as soon as the mid-20s. Last June, former B-25 gunner/engineer David Thatcher died at age 94, making Cole the last living raider. When you can look back on a life like Cole’s, you’ve likely learned a few lessons along the way. The man who helped lead the Doolittle raiders offered some advice. “As you go through life,” Cole said, “expect the unexpected.” 'It was wild!'

"In a bid to explain the additional reasons for which Russia does not accept the methods used by the International Investigation Team, which, it believes, are taking the investigation in the wrong direction, the Russian Foreign Ministry will summon the Dutch ambassador to Moscow on October 3," Tass reported citing a statement. "The head of the Dutch diplomatic mission will hear the Russian side's arguments why it is impossible to ignore the vital objective data, which Russia has turned over to the Dutch side," the Russian Foreign Ministry said. "In the end, such an attitude is undermining the Russian experts' cooperation with the investigators and is discrediting all efforts aimed at getting the true picture of that tragedy and bringing the culprits to justice in compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2166," added the ministry . "The preliminary conclusions announced by the International Investigation Team have been obtrusively presented as the only faithful result, which brooks no doubt or contradiction. The Dutch side considers any criticism of the published interim results of the criminal investigation (into MH17 crash) to be totally unacceptable even if some substantiated arguments are presented," Zakharova said. The Dutch Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to the Netherlands on Friday to demand explanations on Russia's statements concerning the criminal investigation into the MH17 Boeing crash over Ukraine in July 2014. --IANS sku/ SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

Defense News reported that Kyd wants the Bell Boeing V22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft and US Marine Corps F-35B fighter jets deployed for extended periods of time once the Queen Elizabeth is fully up and running.  © Flickr/ Royal Navy Media Archive UK Woefully Unprepared for Future Wars - Former Royal Navy Chief "We’ll certainly see some footprint aboard the ship," he said. "The big question is do they deploy with us much longer term in the future, maybe for six, seven, eight, nine months from when we deploy. That’s what I would love to see." During a London meeting between US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and his British counterpart Michael Fallon in early September, it was confirmed that US fighters would deploy from Royal Navy aircraft carriers, and that British fighters would deploy from US carriers in the future. Construction is wrapping up on the 65,000-ton ship, which is slated to begin flight trials with British fighters in the summer of 2018. The Royal Navy has had problems with manpower and learning the new platform, but Kyd is confident that the challenges can be met.  © REUTERS/ US Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Scott Fenaroli/Handout US Navy Starts Accompanying British Ships Off Iranian Coast He told Forces TV, "Everyone understands the challenges we have across the country for engineers, particularly. But right now I've got 650 sailors on board the ship all beavering away… they're all very excited. We just want to get the ship out to sea, actually!" When Kyd first arrived on the Queen Elizabeth in May he called captaining the vessel is "without doubt the pinnacle of my career," according to the Royal Navy Website. Part of the decision to deploy American fighter jets from British warships is based on funding issues the Royal Navy has in acquiring the number of aircraft needed to mount a respectable strike force. Eight F-35Bs have been acquired so far, and another batch is in the process of being purchased. Kyd said, "We are constrained by the F-35 buy rate even though that was accelerated in Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) in 2015, so initial operating capability numbers in 2020 are going to be very modest indeed. We will flesh it out with helicopters, and a lot depends on how many USMC F-35s come on our first deployment in 2021. But by 2023 we are committed to 24 UK jets onboard and after that it’s too far away [to say]." ...

Courtesy photo Pictured above is Annelle Baum of the Hill with two â€œfur babyâ€ friends. Photo by Elizabeth Kane “What greater gift than the love of a cat?” wrote Charles Dickens over 150 years ago. Certainly this means that this week’s Neighbor to Know lives a truly gifted life.  Please meet Old Town Neighbor Annelle Baum. Seal Beach seems to attract an extraordinarily high proportion of native born Californians. This is most certainly true of Annelle, who was raised and still lives within the same six miles of where she was born in Belmont Shore.  The middle child of three, her mother was a nursery school teacher and for many years her father was the produce manager for John’s Food King market on Main Street.  She spent an abundance of time with her dad and remembers vividly driving to the produce farms not so far away at the time in Anaheim and Cypress to pick up for the store, not  at a warehouse, but at the farms which used to exist here back then. The family always had cats around and her mother told her that at 8 months old the first clear word she ever spoke was “kitty” from her high chair, and then did not utter another word for months.  Her first attachment was a kitten, Ziffy that came into the family and bonded with Annelle when she was just 3 years old and stayed with her until she was 21.  She attended Lowell Elementary and remembers one of the first times she recognized that she was an “animal person.” She won a pair of baby ducks at a school carnival; live ducks which would never happen today.  But a house in the city was no place for them so her father took them to a park that had a small lake,  where they set them free.  They would come back to check on their welfare, and she knew she was already on a path of caring and doing right by animals. When she graduated from Wilson High she was sure she was ready to test her wings by starting college at San Jose State.  But college was not her thing and she instead spent a few amazing youthful months bumming her way with friends through Europe, staying in youth hostels and traveling by Eurail.   She eventually found her way into a career in the travel industry, arranging trips and memories for others like she had experienced for herself.   She loved it and worked for both independent agencies as well as corporations such as Boeing, where she booked corporate travel.   She has been all around the world, seeing most of Europe, the South Pacific, Asia, Tahiti, and South America. Her most favorite place on earth, she says, is Fiji because “the people there are so amazing.” In 1973 she married first husband Mike and moved to what is now her forever home on 3rd Street.  The home was a typical beach bungalow then, with two units.  She and Mike lived in the back unit and rented out the front for many years until they built the home that stands there today. She and Mike were divorced in the 90’s but she has continued to live in and love Seal Beach for over 43 years. In 1989, Annelle was part of the startup that has now become the Seal Beach Animal Care Center, noting that Seal Beach actually had its own animal control officer back then.   She served as volunteer for years, walking dogs, caring for cats and on the board of directors, finding a clear connection and outlet for her love of animals.   But it was meeting Helen Sanders soon after coming to Seal Beach in the 70’s that would be a game changer for Annelle. Helen was our very own “Cat Whisperer.” Her life was devoted to the care and well-being of the feral cats that lived along the river jetty.  It was a common dumping ground for unwanted cats, and the population used to number well into the hundreds.  Helen would catch, spay-neuter and care for these cats.  When Helen passed away in 2005, Annelle and others knew they needed to pick up where Helen left off.  She and others tried for a few years on their own to continue the work, but it was financially draining. As a result, in 2010, Annelle founded CatPAWS, a 501(c) 3 organization whose charter is simple:  Providing education, support and resources to the community to help more cats lead full and cherished lives.  They do this by working toward three simple goals:  Promote  spay/neuter through education and providing vouchers 1)    Support Trap, Neuter and Return (TNR) efforts through providing medical care and food 2)    Save cats/kittens from public shelters where they would otherwise be killed At the time Helen passed away, there were over 180 feral cats at the jetty.  Today, due largely to the efforts of CatPaws the population now is less than 20 and declining each year.  In addition, CatPaws has built a strong relationship with the Long Beach Shelter, which is a euthanasia site, so they can pull cats and kittens and find foster homes and then permanent homes for them.   They provide the means for foster parents to care for babies and they have established amazing relationships with both Petco Seal Beach and PetSmart Long Beach to place adult cats in their adoption centers.  They also provide free spay and neuter vouchers for adoptive parents. The organization is always is need of donations to help with medical care, program costs and supplies. Annelle would meet her soul mate Kris Baum in 2003. Kris was a native born Seal Beach resident whose parents still reside here on the Hill.   They married on April 1st of 2004 at the Cottonwood Falls, Kansas courthouse where they were visiting an uncle who was turning 100. They took advantage of the simple and idyllic setting and with just a few family members with them, tied the knot.   They had 11 wonderful years together, before their time was cut short in December of last year with Kris’ unexpected passing.   She has found solace in the focus on her organization as she works through this devastating transition in her life, and if you visit her, her home is abundant with fur-baby love, from her dog to her cats and fosters who also give her focus and meaning each day.  Annelle exemplifies the day-to-day care that so many of you do each day to make our community better without fuss and fanfare.  She has gone about this so quietly you would never know, but we all should know and thank her and her volunteers for their efforts.  Make sure when you see her to say so.  If you would like to know more or would like to donate to CatPaws, please go to helensanderscatpaws.com.

Getty Images Advertisement The Obama administration has told Congress it won’t complete approval for Bahrain to buy as many as 19 F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin Corp. and upgrades for older ones for almost $4 billion until the Gulf ally demonstrates progress on human rights, according to people familiar with the issue. The declaration of concern, which doesn’t specify what steps Bahrain would have to take, was included in a draft notification of the pending sale that the administration sent to Congress on Wednesday, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing details of the message that wasn’t released publicly. The proposed sale to Bahrain is one of three involving fighter jets by Lockheed and Boeing Co. to Persian Gulf allies, according to people familiar with the decision. The initial, informal notifications to Congress say the potential sales include as many as 72 Boeing F-15 jets to Qatar and as many as 32 of the company’s F/A-18 E/F fighters to Kuwait, according to one of the people. Crackdown on Dissent While the long-delayed sales would deliver on President Barack Obama’s promise to bolster the defense of Gulf allies worried by U.S. participation in the nuclear deal with their arch-rival Iran, the strings attached to the Bahrain sale in the draft, which could still change, reflect concerns in the administration over that government’s crackdown on dissent and opposition. Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency What a President Trump Might Mean for the Internet of Things Without specifying how much Bahrain must do before the arms sale can move forward, the Obama administration is calling on its rulers to reverse its moves suppressing nonviolent opposition and dissolving the al-Wefaq political society, the main opposition group of the country’s Shiite majority, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The administration is also concerned by continuing legal actions against Sheikh Issa Qassim, al-Wefaq’s leader, and the detention of human-rights activist Nabeel Rajab, the official said. Secretary of State John Kerry has previously condemned the decision to dissolve al-Wefaq, saying the government’s efforts to suppress nonviolent opposition undermine Bahrain’s cohesion and security. The Arab nation hosts the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet in the Persian Gulf. Bahrain’s embassy in Washington said in a statement Friday hat the kingdom “has continuously taken extensive social, political, economic and judicial reform measures and is committed to continue its reform plans,” which it said are often downplayed. It said Bahrain “is highly concerned with the manner the Foreign Military Sales case has been politicized,” and “the government will not tolerate those exploiting sectarian rifts, either domestically or regionally.” An aide to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee said the conditions proposed for the Bahrain deal will be evaluated by the panel as part of its review of the planned sale. Review Timetable The arms sales notifications sent to lawmakers this week begin an informal review to take as long as 40 days. That would be followed by an official, public notification, after which the deals would go through unless Congress moves to stop them within 30 days. In addition to the 19 new F-16s valued at as much as $2.8 billion, the sale to Bahrain would include upgrades costing as much as $1 billion to Bahrain’s existing F-16 fleet, according to the informal notification. Unlike Bahrain, the planned sales for Qatar and Kuwait are being proposed without conditions. “Anytime there are strings attached, countries are less likely to complete a deal,” said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Arlington, Virginia-based Lexington Institute who also consults for Lockheed, said in an e-mail. Older Planes “If Bahrain goes elsewhere for its fighters, that would destroy U.S. jobs and undermine U.S. influence in the region,” said Thompson, who indicated he was aware in general terms of the administration’s conditions. Concerns on issues such as human rights are normally taken into account in deciding whether to sell arms to a country, not included as a condition in notifying Congress, said Joel Johnson, an analyst who follows foreign military sales for the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. The arms sales to the Gulf allies will help the U.S. contractors keep assembly lines running for their older fighters as U.S. purchases shift to Lockheed’s new F-35. “This order is very important to Lockheed Martin,” Michael Rein, a spokesman for the Bethesda, Maryland-based contractor, said in an e-mail. “We have been aggressively pursuing additional F-16 orders and without this sale to Bahrain we run the very real risk of the F-16 line shutting down. Bahrain is a valued customer and key partner.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Sponsored by the Automation Network Dresden (AND), the conference featured speakers from Boeing Spectrolab, SolarWorld, Texas Instruments, Intel, Cimetrix, Meyer Burger and Agilion GmbH, among others. The conference touched on a broad range of timely topics. Speakers from Texas Instruments and Fabmatics GmbH discussed successful automation efforts both in mature 200mm fabs and with automation-averse tools. Intel discussed their efforts to drive increased diversity among their manufacturing suppliers and how their RealSense hardware and depth-perception software can be leveraged into automation workflows. Efforts to drive big data analytics and IoT to the factory floor were presented by both Dresden University of Technology and Agilion GmbH. Other topics included the role of equipment data models in semiconductor production systems, SAP process automation in the manufacturing environment, and overviews from industry experts about the latest trends and the future of photovoltaic and IC manufacturing. Every year at the evening event, the Automation Network Dresden awards the “Innovation Award for Automation” to a leader in manufacturing automation. This year the award was presented to SolarWorld for their cutting-edge migration of a high-volume manufacturing execution system (MES) to a cloud platform. Travis Stevens, president of SYSTEMA USA Corporation, described this year’s event as "Successful – the feedback was positive. I know of no other event in the US that is specifically dedicated to bringing manufacturing experts together to discuss the latest innovations in the semiconductor automation solution space. We look forward to bringing this unique opportunity to the US again in the future." The Automation Network Dresden is a consortium of four Dresden-based companies - AIS Automation Dresden GmbH, Fabmatics GmbH (formerly HAP GmbH and Roth & Rau – Ortner GmbH), SYSTEMA GmbH and XENON GmbH - all of which are premier experts in automation through software and hardware. The next innovationsforum for automation will take place in Dresden on January 19-20, 2017.

Earlier this month a SpaceX employee visited the company's competitor United Launch Alliance (ULA) at its facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida, according to The Washington Post.  The SpaceX employee reportedly asked for access to the roof of one of ULA's buildings, which is a little more than a mile away from where SpaceX's rocket launched.   On September 1, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket (pictured) exploded as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.

SpaceX's founder and CEO, Elon Musk, called the failure 'the most difficult and complex' the company has ever had.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Riding the Heart of Gold to the red planet: Elon Musk to... Blue Origin to trial its in-flight escape space pod: New... Share this article Share It was reported last week that the explosion may have been caused by a large breach in the rocket's helium cooling system. A preliminary investigation by SpaceX has found the hole in the cryogenic system, which cools the upper oxygen tank of the rocket, occurred just moments before the explosion and appears to have triggered a catastrophic chain of events. Exactly what caused the breach is still a mystery, the company has said.  SpaceX's founder and CEO, Elon Musk (pictured), called the failure 'the most difficult and complex' the company has ever had There has been intense speculation that an object had hit the rocket during fueling. Now, it has been revealed that SpaceX had still images from video that appeared to show an odd shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building belonging to ULA, a joint project between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the Post reported.   A source familiar with the incident told the Post that the SpaceX employee told ULA officials that the company was trying to run down all possible leads and that they aren't trying to accuse ULA of anything.  ULA denied the access to the SpaceX employee and called Air Force investigators, who inspected the roof and didn't find anything connecting it to the rocket explosion, the Post reported.  Nearly a week after the explosion, Musk asked the public to send in any video or audio of the blast so that his company could continue to investigate.  SpaceX's launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was destroyed (pictured) by the explosion. It has been revealed that SpaceX had still images from video that appeared to show an odd shadow, then a white spot on the roof of a nearby building belonging to ULA ULA (file photo) denied the access to the SpaceX employee and called Air Force investigators, who inspected the roof and didn't find anything connecting it to the rocket explosion. But SpaceX has said they have not ruled out sabotage  The company also said they haven't ruled out sabotage.  Musk wrote on Twitter that he was 'particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off'. 'May come from rocket or something else,' he added.  Earlier this week, Musk said that finding out what went wrong is the company's 'absolute top priority'. 'We've eliminated all of the obvious possibilities for what occurred there,' he said. SpaceX is leading the investigation with help from the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration. Despite the investigation, SpaceX has said it intends to return to flight as soon as November.  Read more: Implication of sabotage adds intrigue to SpaceX investigation - The Washington Post Share or comment on this article e-mail 403 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Letter: NAFTA a success By Eric Samuelsen For the Deseret News Published: Oct. 1, 2016 12:05 a.m. Updated: Sept. 30, 2016 7:59 p.m. 13 Comments During Monday's debate, Donald Trump consistently interrupted Hillary Clinton, mostly to deny having said things he had, in fact, actually said. What I found more alarming were the factual errors in his policy proposals. Key to his entire message, for example, is his assertion that NAFTA had been a disaster, costing millions of American jobs. But this isn't true. Manufacturing has grown by 50 percent since NAFTA passed. NAFTA also improved Mexico's economy, which slowed illegal immigration to a trickle, thus making Trump's "big wall" proposal ludicrously unnecessary. He said that Mexico is building the largest manufacturing plant in the world. In fact, Tesla's building the largest plant, in California; second and third are a Boeing plant in Washington and a Mitsubishi plant in Illinois. He spoke of massive job losses in Ohio and Michigan, states with unemployment rates of 4.7 percent and 4.5 percent. He seems to think that China is a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It isn't, and one of the goals of the TPP is to force China to engage in fairer trade practices. He accuses China of devaluing its currency; in fact, the Chinese are doing the opposite. He said our energy policy was a disaster; energy prices have been falling for years. The entire focus of his campaign is trade policy, something he clearly knows nothing about. But we shouldn't be surprised. He doesn't seem to know anything about any area of policy. Why, again, would anyone vote for him? Eric Samuelsen Provo 13 Comments Like that? Read this.

Who is Richard Duncan and why is he on Ohio's presidential ballot? Jeff O'Rear, Enquirer contributor 4:18 p.m. EDT September 30, 2016 Buy Photo Richard Duncan campaigns outside Thursday night's Bengals game. (Photo: Dean Lowry for The Enquirer)Buy Photo Richard Duncan stands outside Paul Brown stadium with a six-foot-tall sign that extolls his qualifications to become the next president of the United States. As he hands out cards to the Bengals fans headed to Thursday night’s game against the Dolphins, he bellows out, “You have another choice!” “I’m running for president.” “Vote me for me, I’m on the ballot.” He is mostly ignored, garnering a few laughs, bewildered looks and sarcastic endorsements as the fans walk toward the stadium. Duncan is on the Ohio ballot for president as an independent candidate. This is his fourth candidacy. Because he appears only on the Ohio ballot - and not in any other states -  he knows his chances of winning are non-existent. But, he said, must get his message out. “The parties recently have not been helping out the people,” the 63-year-old Aurora, Ohio, resident said. “If I can at least accomplish that, I think we’re headed in the right direction.” He is a self-funded candidate, spending around $5,000 of his own money, crisscrossing Ohio, obtaining the 5,000 signatures required to appear on the ballot. On Sept. 1, he received a letter saying he made this year’s ballot. Ohio voters will see name alongside Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. Buy Photo Richard Duncan campaigns at Thursday night's Bengals game.  (Photo: Dean Lowry for The Enquirer) 'It's hard to come from nowhere in politics'  Duncan hatched the idea of running in 2004, helping his daughter, a then-senior at Aurora High School, with a government class project. He decided to run in that year’s election on his anti-two party platform. He received 800 write-in votes. The next year, he began collecting petition signatures for the 2008 ballot. He needed 5,000, and he got around 13,000 over a three-year span. He ended up receiving about 3,900 votes that election. In 2012, he did even better, getting 12,502 votes, good for fifth-place among the seven presidential candidates in the state. In August 2015, he made up his mind to run again, and he hit the trail to get his required signatures. He visited fairs and festivals during the warmer months and stores and shops during the winter. “I was going out three times a week instead of here and there,” Duncan said of the abbreviated petition window. “In a year’s time, the weather cooperated, and I collected my 13,000 signatures.” Someone like Duncan could make some noise nationally in a presidential race. But the odds are heavily against independent candidates winning, said David Niven, a University of Cincinnati assistant professor of political science. “They would have to start from a position of prominence,” Niven said. “That’s the biggest problem for candidates trying to bust their way in from the outside. Who is going to take the moment to give them the first bit of attention? “Done well, someone in this position can make a little bit of a stink and a tiny bit of noise,” Niven said. “It’s really hard to come from nowhere in politics.” Bill Clinton took his business card  Those odds haven’t deterred Duncan from driving all over Ohio and spreading his message. He campaigned and collected signatures at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this past July. And he plans to keep campaigning until Election Day. He’s planning to be at Saturday’s Ohio State-Rutgers game in Columbus. He is also taking advantage of the Cleveland Indians making the playoffs, campaigning as long as the team’s season keeps going. “I keep continuing on because I believe what I am saying,” Duncan said. “So I’m absolutely not going to stop. The two parties are starting to see that people are not happy with them, and they’re going to have to change because the people are supposed to be running this country.” He attended a Hillary Clinton rally recently where former President Bill Clinton spoke. He had the opportunity to shake the former president’s hand, giving him a business card, which he said Clinton put in his suit jacket pocket. “That was pretty rewarding for me to have a former president take my card,” Duncan said. “Maybe I’m doing something right.” Thursday night, after almost 30-straight minutes of no responses from Bengals and Dolphins fans at the stadium, Duncan finally engaged a passer-by. “I’ll take your card, and I will definitely check you out,” Jordan Boeing said. But Boeing is from Burlington, Ky., and is not registered to vote in Ohio. Duncan hadn’t gained a vote, but at least one more person had heard his message. “A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step,” he said. Jeff O'Rear and Dean Lowry are part of a University of Cincinnati partnership helping The Enquirer cover the election.

This “clean” stopgap package puts the focus on Congress’ post-election lame duck session to keep agencies running through FY 2017 and would seemingly give lawmakers another opportunity to move on a full-year or longer term government spending bill. Recent history of course has suggested any compromise will be hard to come by in this political environment but agencies and contractors always hold out hope for a deal and subsequent certainty. With that out of the way, we will use the remainder of this space to highlight two key news items from the GovCon arena this week with respect to financial/M&A and global defense. Technology investment group Vista Equity Partners has returned to M&A’s buyer side through its $153 million deal for public sector cloud company GovDelivery announced Monday. Vista owns one-fifth of cybersecurity company ForcePoint, which was formed out of the former Websense business that Raytheon bought majority control of last year. Also, reports surfaced Wednesday that the White House approved close to $7 billion in requests by Kuwait and Qatar to purchase Boeing-built fighter jets and a separate $1 billion sale of Lockheed Martin-made combat aircraft to Bahrain. The next morning, DSCA Director Joseph Rixey addressed the Potomac Officers Club’s “International Military Programs” event to update GovCon executive attendees on the state of America’s foreign military sales program and ways for industry to help in the effort. Rixey told Reuters in July the U.S. was on track at the time to close $40 billion in FMS transactions for FY 2016 and demand from allies is not slowing down in light of the world’s security environment. Deloitte forecasts worldwide defense spending to total $1.6 trillion through 2020 despite some reductions in the U.S. with Asia-Pacific countries’ expenditures predicted to go up and that gives large primes and others opportunities for both increased volume and diversified sales.

Maybe you never pondered the outcome of this seemingly nonsensical matchup, but someone from Australian airline Qautas did (more on that later). Presumably, it was to underscore the point that all electric vehicle drivers know: Electric cars are really quick, especially off the line. To understand why, we need a little science. Torque is the twisting motion that turns car wheels. Going from gasoline to tire twist is a multistep process involving parts like pistons, crank shafts, flywheels, and other under-the-hood stuff. Each step in the process drains a bit of energy – and hundredths of a second – from the time you pin the throttle to the time the tires squeal into action. In EVs, the path from batteries to tire-turning torque is a shorter and more efficient one. Thus, a typical EV motor can spin out 15,000 rpms compared with roughly 8,000 from an internal combustion gasoline engine. Hence, the drag-racing prowess of your Tesla. So perhaps it isn’t surprising that a little-known battery-powered beast is making waves in the speed-crazy supercar world. It’s called the Concept One from Croatian startup Rimac, and it is billed as the world’s first electric supercar. It debuted nearly five years ago, but the buzz surrounding actual production got a recent boost courtesy of footage of the all-EV Rimac roasting both a top spec Tesla Model S P90D and a $1.5 million Ferrari LaFerrari in a quarter-mile drag race.   As noted above, the Rimac’s off-the-line prowess isn’t surprising given the virtually instantaneous torque of EVs. More impressive is the Concept One’s sustained acceleration – especially against the V12-powered LaFerrari. That’s because electric cars tend to lose their edge – and potentially overheat – under sustained, hard acceleration. Rimac says it combats these performance liabilities with gobs of power and technology: 1,088 hp and 2,800 lb. - ft. of torque courtesy of four electric motors, each with its own gearbox, and an advanced torque vectoring system that constantly calculates the optimum amount of twist to send to each wheel. According to Rimac, all of this means the Concept One doesn’t require any special “launch mode” setting like gasoline-powered cars for insane off-the-line performance and a zero-to-62 sprint of 2.6 seconds. Just pin the throttle and hold on for dear life. It doesn’t hurt that the Rimac is also elegantly styled inside and out – including a richly appointed interior crafted by former employees of legendary Italian auto-styling firm Pininfarina. As for our EV vs. Boeing 737 showdown, as you might expect, the sedan (a Tesla Model S) beat the Boeing off the line before succumbing to the jet’s superior acceleration. However, Rimac has also unveiled a hopped-up version of the Concept One supercar, the 1,365-hp Concept S. Dubbed the “evil twin,” it can reportedly hit 62 mph from a standstill in 2.5 seconds on its way to a top speed of nearly 227 mph. Hey, Boeing, how about a rematch?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Oct 01, 2016 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp CAL to ply A350 on HK, Osaka routes Staff writer, with CNA A new Airbus SAS A350-900 XWB delivered yesterday to China Airlines Ltd (CAL, 中華航空) is to be first used on flights to Hong Kong and Osaka, Japan, CAL chairman Ho Nuan-hsuan (何煖軒) said. The carrier would start flying the aircraft to Amsterdam, Vienna and Rome from next year, Ho said during an aircraft delivery ceremony in Toulouse, France. Didier Evrard, head of programs at Airbus, was also in attendance. CAL is the first Taiwanese carrier to procure an A350, lauded as the world’s latest-generation airliner and the newest member of the Airbus family. The carrier is to have 13 more A350s delivered by the end of 2018. The new airplanes could improve CAL’s performance, especially in Europe, Ho said. Among the 1.22 million passengers traveling between Taiwan and Europe last year, CAL claimed a 21 percent market share, he added. While nearly 60 percent of those passengers were making transit stops during their trips, the long-haul, medium-capacity A350-900s could contribute to more flexible flight operations, Ho said. In addition, CAL flights to Amsterdam and Rome are to become nonstop next year at the earliest, thanks to the A350s, he said. According to CAL, the A350-900 XWB is built using the most advanced production technology, and its high-end production materials have resulted in a lighter and safer aircraft. In addition, the eco-friendly aircraft is expected to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent, which will help lower maintenance costs, the carrier said. The first A350-900s, which are to carry the airline’s plum blossom logo on their tails, have a seating capacity of 306 — 32 in business class, 31 in premium economy and 243 in economy, it said. Ho said CAL might team up with Airbus Group SE to establish an aircraft maintenance facility at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, tailored exclusively for the Airbus A350, making it the first A350 maintenance facility in Asia. CAL operates a similar service near the airport, CAL Engineering and Maintenance Organization (中華航空公司機務組織), which provides services that include component, airframe and engine maintenance for several Airbus, Boeing Co and Embraer SA aircraft. Services for the A350 are not available from the company. Ho said CAL is expected to receive a reply on the possible venture from Airbus by the end of this year, adding that the carrier also wants to get Taiwan-based Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (漢翔航空) involved in the deal, because the company is already part of the A350 supply chain. Ho declined to comment on the capital estimated for the joint venture or the shareholding ratio for the three potential stakeholders. Ho said the initiative has won the support of Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦), who promised to find CAL a proper space for the facility. This story has been viewed 1409 times.

Buckhead’s plan for park over a highway joins a national trend The proposed park that would snake atop Ga. 400 in Buckhead’s business district is part of a nationwide highway-capping trend that has created green spaces from Seattle to Boston and from Chicago to Dallas. The reason is simple: Highway-capping can be a relatively easy way for a city to gain green space. But the challenge is big: Costs can be high and piecing together the public-private partnerships typically involved is complicated. The East Lawn of Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. (Office of James Burnett) “The most important piece of advice I give a community like Atlanta that is considering [a cap park] like this is, find your champion,” said Tara Green, president of Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, which has become a model of highway-capping success. Klyde Warren Park’s champion was banker Jody Grant, “who didn’t take no for an answer” and put up $1 million of his own money to start leveraging public financing for the $110 million project, Green said. For the Buckhead Community Improvement District board, which has proposed the park, costs have been a concern. The current proposal is not a complete cap, but rather a large bridge paralleling Ga. 400, partly because that is easier to build. After a project gets a champion, keeping the price tag reasonable can be another challenge. Boston’s downtown has been reconnected with the 1.5-mile Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, built atop a formerly elevated highway now sunken in a tunnel. That project, nicknamed the Big Dig, became notoriously wasteful, with cost estimates running well over $15 billion. However, now that it’s complete, Boston’s Greenway is extremely popular, packed with public art and events, according to Janet Knott, the policy and media director for Boston City Councilor Sal LaMattina, whose district includes much of the park. Like Buckhead’s proposal, the Greenway has sub-parks in different sections. The North End Park section of Boston’s Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway. (Special) “It’s a set of parks defined by the neighborhoods along it,” Knott said. “It involves the neighborhoods by creating this network instead of creating this blanket open space.” “This [park over Ga. 400 idea] is exciting for your city because, as you know, parks are so popular all over the country,” Knott said. “Trying to find green space is a priority for many cities right now.” Just as carving highways through city centers was popular in the 1950s and ’60s, cap parks are a modern urban planning trend. An early example is Seattle’s Freeway Park, built in the 1970s. St. Louis has a cap park underway, part of a renovation of its Gateway Arch monument. And such major cities as Chicago and Los Angeles have highway-cap parks on their drawing boards. The Buckhead CID’s concept isn’t even the only one in Atlanta, as Central Atlanta Progress is proposing a Downtown Connector cap called the “Stitch,” which would include both park space and buildings. Earlier this year, various Atlanta leaders, including Buckhead CID Executive Director Jim Durrett, visited Dallas to hear about Klyde Warren Park, which opened in 2012 and now draws a million visitors a year—significantly more than expected. Green said that what Dallas’s plan had, besides a champion, was civic motivation. She said there is some evidence that “city leaders knew they were creating a moat” with the highway in the 1960s and had early ideas of bridging it somehow, making the city more receptive to the park idea. But the real “catalyst,” she said, came in 2001, when the giant aircraft corporation Boeing chose Chicago over Dallas for its new headquarters. A main reason Boeing cited for rejected Dallas was the lack of a “vibrant downtown,” she said. Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. (Office of James Burnett) Like Atlanta, Dallas is a city of infamous sprawl, endless highways and relatively little green space. Klyde Warren Park became a place to move away from car culture and provide a “back yard” to people increasingly living downtown, Green said, echoing concerns of Buckhead’s leaders. “We did not have that reason to walk in Dallas,” she said. “We’re so happy we have taught Dallas how to walk.” The park is city-owned, but privately run and managed, including private security. It is self-funded, using no city park funds, Green said. The Dallas park’s success comes with some wrinkles. According to media reports, most fundraising targeted the park rather than the less glamorous cap structure. The park is so popular the administration is already considering an addition, including a controversial parking garage. Still, Green has a simple message for Buckhead’s park planners: “It will be well worth the investment.” Major U.S. highway-cap parks Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Boston, Mass.; opened 2008 15-acre, 1.5-mile-long park atop a highway tunnel. Cost more than $15 billion, including all of the Big Dig. Klyde Warren Park Dallas; opened 2012 5-acre cap over a highway that was already built below-grade. Cost $110 million. In August, proposed a $90 million addition that would include restaurant, park offices, many amenities and a parking garage. Margaret T. Hance Park Phoenix, Az.; opened 1992 32-acre park built atop a highway tunnel at a cost reportedly over $100 million. Plans for a $118 million renovation/redevelopment are in the works. Freeway Park Seattle; opened 1976 5-acre cap over a highway.

(NASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH United States) Abstract: Wind-US is a computational platform which may be used to numerically solve various sets of equations governing physical phenomena. Currently, the code supports the solution of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations of fluid mechanics, along with supporting equation sets governing turbulent and chemically reacting flows. Wind-US is a product of the NPARC Alliance, a partnership between the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) and the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) dedicated to the establishment of a national, applications-oriented flow simulation capability. The Boeing Company has also been closely associated with the Alliance since its inception, and represents the interests of the NPARC User's Association. The "Wind-US User's Guide" describes the operation and use of Wind-US, including: a basic tutorial; the physical and numerical models that are used; the boundary conditions; monitoring convergence; the files that are read and/or written; parallel execution; and a complete list of input keywords and test options.

Or Address Climate Change and Human Needs? Published on Friday, September 30, 2016 by Common Dreams US at the Crossroads: Start a New Nuclear Arms Race? Or Address Climate Change and Human Needs? by Kevin Martin 0 Comments The banner reads, 'Don't Nuke The Climate.' (Photo: Wise International) What if I have little time left? How should I spend my time? Most people face these questions in terms of their own lifespans. But what if the subject of these sentences changes from “I” to “we?” What if the subject is not an individual, but humanity? What if climate change is shortening our human lifespan (and that of many species) to just a few decades? According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), August was the 16th consecutive month of record temperatures for the planet. July was the hottest month on record worldwide, until it was tied by August. Persistent drought conditions already threaten water supplies and agricultural breadbaskets in the U.S. and elsewhere Arctic and Antarctic ice are melting at unprecedented rates, as are glaciers in many countries, promising global sea level rise that will threaten cities and countries everywhere. Glacier National Park in Montana may have to change its name before too long, as the glaciers are melting rapidly. The U.K.-based Global Challenges Foundation calculates Americans are five times more likely to die in a “human extinction event” such as nuclear war, climate change-driven catastrophe or pandemic, than to die in a car crash. One prominent climate scientist, Guy McPherson of the University of Arizona, thinks humanity may not survive past 2030, fourteen years from now, from climate change and the resulting breakdown in our food and water supply, and in the social order. We are already seeing wars driven by climate change, the calamity in Syria perhaps the most prominent example. The CIA and Pentagon clearly state climate change is helping drive armed conflict in many regions, and expect it to get worse. Nobody can know with any certainty at this point how much time humanity has left on Earth. However, the question of whether we have 14 years left, or 50 or 250, or much longer, doesn’t matter all that much. The amount of money we’re about to squander on a New Nuclear Arms Race, projected at $1 trillion over thirty years, is indefensible. Our tax dollars and focus need to be on protecting life on Earth, not threatening its extinction. A New Nuclear Arms Race? Who Wants That? Under the benign or even positive heading of “nuclear modernization,” the United States plans to spend an estimated $1 trillion (it will surely be more than that – when was the last time an exorbitant military project came in under budget?) to overhaul every part of our nuclear weapons enterprise over the next three decades. Weapons laboratories, warheads, missiles, planes and submarines are all slated to be upgraded. Predictably, every other nuclear weapons state (Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea) is following suit and planning similar Dr. Strangelovian upgrades to their arsenals. So our folly not only makes the world more dangerous in terms of nuclear proliferation, it provides “leadership” down the dark path of fear and destruction for countries that can afford this investment even less than we can. Besides  the opportunity cost of investing in new nukes – money that won’t go to cancer research, affordable housing, health care for all, infrastructure repair and building the green economy – what baffles is the lack of democracy and accountability. Did anybody vote for this? Did any politicians run on this platform? Certainly not President Obama, who ran on reducing and eventually eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide, yet agreed to The New Nuclear Arms Race proposal in exchange for ratification of the modest New START agreement with Russia, a very poor trade-off. Regardless of that, the politicians and government employees who have hatched this mad scheme work for us. We pay their salaries, and our tax dollars fund the weapons and the research, and the contracts that go to Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and the other merchants of death. When they say there is no money for addressing climate change and human needs, that’s a lie. It’s going to the endless war machine. An interesting data point – the UN Environment Program estimates it will take about $300 billion to adapt to climate change worldwide by 2030. That’s about half the Pentagon’s annual budget. Harvard Professor Elaine Scarry, in her recent book Thermonuclear Anarchy, makes the crucial argument that our nominal democracy is completely undercut when it comes to human survival, because one person (the president, in the case of the U.S.) can make the decision to start a nuclear war which could end life on Earth. In the last few weeks, this issue has gotten significant attention, as many are mortified at the prospect of Donald Trump having control of the nuclear “button.” This has had a positive effect in terms of raising this issue, as President Obama is reportedly considering changing U.S. nuclear doctrine to a No First Use policy. Some Members of Congress are also pushing for that, with U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Senator Edward Markey (D-MA) introducing a bill to prohibit a U.S. nuclear first strike absent a Congressional declaration of war. Sen. Markey has also introduced the SANE Act to significantly cut investment in the New Nuclear Arms Race, and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) has a companion bill in the House of Representatives. This outbreak of democracy regarding U.S. nuclear weapons is healthy, but much more will be needed to stop the colossal squandering of resources on the New Nuclear Arms Race in order to  restore sanity to our budgetary priorities. It’s up to us to determine our future, however long that is. Can we say the future looks brighter, or longer, if we stay on the current course?

But it was her part-ownership of Canica, one of Norway’s largest private investment companies, that gave her the means. As the number of successful female executives and business owners increases, the number of women in philanthropy is set to rise. The trend is beginning to show up in the growth of female philanthropic networks. Women Moving Millions, a global community of mainly women donors, has more than doubled in size since launching, from 102 members in 2007 to 250 in 14 countries today. Donors each give or pledge $1m or more to initiatives focused on advancing women and girls. Elsewhere, Impact Austin, a US giving circle — in which donors pool their funds — started in 2003 with six women, each donating $1,000 a year. It now has about 500 female members, who in 2015 gave a total of $5m to charities. The way businesswomen distribute their wealth differs from the approaches taken by their male counterparts. Women tend to spread their giving across several organisations, while men typically concentrate on a narrower range of charities, according to the Women’s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University. Women are more likely to volunteer — and volunteer more hours — than men. “Women and men have very different motivations for engaging in philanthropy,” says Debra Mesch, the institute’s director. “Women come with a very empathetic, altruistic point of view, while men tend to focus more on giving for what it could do for them.” Gender empathy often plays a role in the causes women choose to support. Many focus on giving to organisations that help women and girls. Research from Indiana University shows a higher proportion of women than men — 50 per cent compared to 40 per cent — reported giving to at least one cause that affected mainly women and girls. Women’s approaches to philanthropy also reflect the way they do business, says Prof Mesch. “The way they network and mentor other women — we see that in philanthropy as well,” she says. For example, members of the Maverick Collective, a network of female philanthropists — which also invests in projects that benefit girls and women — support each other when testing ideas for tackling social problems. “We’re in the business of high-risk pilots of new approaches in improving the lot of women and girls, and that can be a pretty lonely business,” says Martha Darling, a Maverick Collective member. “So there’s a lot of reinforcement and support when things are successful, and working it through in the rough patches.” Ms Darling sees a more collaborative spirit at work among female philanthropists than among male donors. “There’s a lot less ego on the table,” she says. “And the emphasis is on the outcomes, on doing the work collectively and on being more deeply engaged.” Female philanthropists who made their own money also differ in their approach from those who inherited it. “For those of us with business experience, we tend to be more demanding about the nature of our involvement because of the focus on metrics and wanting to invest wisely,” says Ms Darling, a former Boeing executive. Related article Natalia Oberti Noguera of women’s investor group Pipeline Angels Founder of network that pairs women venture capitalists with female-led social businesses on the need for ‘women sharks’ “A lot of people join different things, do a couple of hours of volunteering or give money here and there,” says Ms Darling, who takes an approach more similar to businessmen. “I have a narrower funnel and I want to see where the money is going.” Ms Hagen Sørli has used what she has learnt in business in her philanthropy. She says running a company that invests in retail and fast-moving consumer goods companies has given her insights into how to increase access to clean toilets in developing countries. “It’s not just that people can’t afford to buy one. It’s because they don’t prioritise buying one,” she says. “So it’s also about behaviour change, and I know something about that from working with retail every day.” Yet despite the rise of female philanthropists, lists of the world’s biggest givers are still populated largely by men. For example, among the businesspeople who have taken the Giving Pledge — the initiative launched by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett to encourage the wealthy to leave their money to charity — only a handful are women. The reason may not be entirely due to their smaller numbers, however. It can be harder to find the names of prominent female philanthropists in business in part because of another characteristic found in many women who give: modesty. “They’re more reluctant to splash their names on buildings,” says Prof Mesch. “That’s not something that resonates with women.” Nevertheless, she believes women are becoming a powerful force in charitable giving. “They’re taking charge of their own philanthropy as well as taking charge of their own careers,” she says. Given their tendency to support women’s advancement in their giving, this could create a ripple effect, by helping other women succeed in the global economy — and thus building the next wave of female donors.

Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation (RSC) Energia will devise within five years a new carrier rocket for the Sea Launch (Morskoi Start) floating space pad project, the corporation's director said Friday. "This symbiosis, I am sure, will allow us to to create a new launch vehicle in absolutely short deadlines. I myself see a reference point of five years," General Director Vladimir Solntsev told reporters. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator – the best possible location for launch – which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-percent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia. ...

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors Inc. (AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu) WASHINGTON – A group of 10 Republican members of Congress wrote Thursday that they are increasingly concerned about SpaceX’s ability to safely fly NASA astronauts and national security satellites after the company recently suffered its second rocket explosion in just over a year. In it a letter to the Air Force, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration, the group said SpaceX should not be leading the investigation into its most recent failure, and that authority should be turned over to the federal government “to ensure that proper investigative engineering rigor is applied.” Last year, an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket exploded a couple minutes after it launched a resupply mission to the International Space Station, destroying $118 million worth of cargo. Then, earlier this month, another Falcon 9 rocket blew up as it was being fueled ahead of an engine test. A $195 million commercial satellite sitting on top of the rocket, was lost in the fireball. Advertisement Continue reading “These failures could have spelled disaster, even loss of life, had critical national security payloads or NASA crew been aboard those rockets,” wrote the members, many of whom represent states where SpaceX’s chief competitor, the United Launch Alliance, has a strong presence. SpaceX declined to comment. After the Sept. 1 explosion, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said on Twitter that the Dragon capsule would have been able to abort in time, ferrying the astronauts on board to safety. The company has said it is narrowing down on the cause of the explosion, pinpointing a breach in a second-stage helium system. Earlier this week, Musk said the investigation was “vexing and difficult.” He stressed that finding out what went wrong is the company’s “absolute top priority” but said what actually caused the explosion was still unknown. “We’ve eliminated all of the obvious possibilities for what occurred there,” he said. “So what remains are the less probable answers.” He didn’t say what those might be. In the wake of the explosion, NASA has said it stands by SpaceX and the Air Force has said it shouldn’t affect the company’s certification. SpaceX, which relies heavily on the federal government for revenue, currently holds lucrative contracts with NASA to fly cargo and eventually astronauts to the space station. It also holds a certification from the Air Force that allows it to compete for contracts to launch national security satellites against the United Launch Alliance, the Colorado-based joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The members of Congress, led by U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, questioned whether the Air Force should reconsider SpaceX’s certification. And they asked NASA whether it still plans to allow SpaceX to use the Falcon 9 for its cargo and crew missions. Since there was no loss of life or injury, and no outside property was extensively damaged federal regulations call for the launch providers to conduct the investigations with oversight from the FAA. NASA and the Air Force are also helping with the investigation. NASA, the Air Force and the FAA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The new regulation brings Australia into alignment with the European Military Airworthiness Requirements, providing a common baseline with more than 30 other countries. Air Marshal Leo Davies, the Chief of Air Force, said the DASR will replace the current system which has evolved over twenty years and is unique to Australia. “The current regulations have served us well, but it is no longer efficient or desirable to maintain an independent system,” AIRMSHL Davies said. “The European Military Airworthiness Requirements are quickly becoming a global safety standard and are recognised as global best practice. This will bring benefits and enhance military aviation safety into the future.” Air Commodore James Hood from the Defence Aviation Safety Authority said the decision to migrate to the European convention was made after careful consideration. “We have been working with Defence and Industry organisations for three years to make sure we’ve got the DASR right. I am thrilled that major Australian industry will be involved in phase one tomorrow, including Boeing, Airbus Group, QinetiQ, Raytheon Australia, BAE Systems Australia, Pilatus, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman,” he said. “The new DASR are less prescriptive than the current regulation, offering higher levels of safety assurance at lower cost.” “Benefits of the transition will include increased efficiencies of global supply chains and maintenance options; employing ‘blended workforces’ on Defence and civilian aircraft and improve recognition of the approvals and certifications provided by other military and civilian airworthiness authorities. The common convention also allows commercial organisations to pursue innovation across the Defence and civil aviation sectors, which ultimately strengthens the aviation industry in Australia. The new DASR regulation will also improve the freedom of decision for Commanders, required for military operations,” AIRCDRE Hood said. Implementation is occurring in two phases, with some organisations migrating tomorrow, with minimal impact to existing management plans, contracts and organisational structures. Having locked in the current level of safety under phase one, organisations can then decide when to exploit the flexibility and efficiencies that DASR offer, depending on particular circumstances.

One must ask, is Trump correct or do we continue to occupy the apex of the first world? Is there evidence to support Mr. Trump's claim? Let me offer exhibit A.   According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Two years after the University of Missouri closed the state’s lone hospital for treating tuberculosis and other infectious diseases, state health officials are looking at opening a new facility. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is seeking bids for a study that could provide officials with a roadmap for opening a new treatment center to replace the current process of sending patients to other states. It comes amid a nationwide increase in the number of people contracting the airborne bacterial disease that attacks the lungs. According to the request, Missouri has averaged 90 active tuberculosis cases in each of the past three years Missouri has been more fortunate than many other states in this regard. Why?  Because Missouri a series of strict laws against illegal alien encroachment, going back to 2007.  As a result Missouri has avoided many of the pitfalls -- including third-world diseases -- that are plaguing other states. But the power of the central government has grown to the point where it has managed to circumvent many of the laws put in place by the states and so the problems plaguing other states are starting to dribble in. Let's face it; tuberculosis is now a Third World disease. In the U.S. the number of cases of TB were cut in half between 1953 and 1968 due to better antibiotics and better medical care. (It is interesting to note that Operation Wetback repatriated up to 2 million trespassing aliens starting in 1954, thus helping to reduce the number of such cases.) The reduction in TB rates turned around in the mid '80s as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (which was not handled like any other infectious epidemics where authorities follow the chain of contagion and restrict the activities of the infected; AIDS was allowed to burn through the populace out of fears of stigmatizing homosexuals.) Still, rates remained low. Only now we see them rising -- and HIV is fairly under control, so that is not the cause. According to the CDC 88% of all antibiotic-resistant TB in the U.S. comes from immigrants. And that is just one infectious disease. Consider that last year we had 15 cases of bubonic plague in the U.S. Bubonic plague is clearly a third-world disease, one long absent in America. Another facet of Third Worldism is the export of raw materials rather than manufactured goods. America is now almost completely an exporter of coal, because the Federal government has used regulatory power to strangle the industry. In 2008 then President Obama famously stated: “If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that’s being emitted.” He has since gone on to crush an entire industry. Peabody Energy and Arch Coal -- the largest and second largest coal companies on Earth -- both went into bankruptcy recently. We now export raw coal because we can't use it for anything. And Lead. The Doe Run smelter -- the last in America -- closed a couple of years ago as a result of pressure from the Federal government. America now cannot smelt lead, but rather is forced to sell the raw materials to others who process it. That is third world. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump scolded Ford for moving all its small car manufacturing to foreign countries. Well, that is what they are doing. It's what happens when you are providing an unfriendly environment to manufacturing businesses. Then there is language. One of the characteristics of a third-world country is the preponderance of languages; multiple languages exemplify disunity, thus dividing the nation. Well, the U.S. is at least the fifth largest Spanish speaking country on Earth and may well be second only to Mexico with between 35 and 50 million speakers.  In fact, one in five households do not speak English at home. While this is not solely the fault of Barack Obama, the problem (and it is a problem) has clearly metastasized under Il Duce. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is calling for more spending on infrastructure, despite Obama’s trillion-dollar stimulus which supposedly funded "shovel ready jobs" and rebuilt these ailing roads and whatnot. If we can't make basic repairs to infrastructure with a trillion dollars, how do we differ from a third-world country? And violence. As I have noted, East St. Louis has levels of violence comparable to Honduras and other hellholes. We all know how many murders are occurring in Chicago, for instance, and we know of the rioting in Baltimore, in Charlotte, and in Ferguson. How does this differ from the war-torn, strife-filled third world? Well, partly there is the rule of law. Unfortunately, Mr. Obama simply ignores the rule of law when it inconveniences him, granting an amnesty to illegals despite laws duly passed by Congress, for instance. He has simply gone ahead with many things he wanted, such as military action in Libya without Congressional approval, or forcing Boeing to shut down a factory for being non-union in 2011, or giving Mexican criminals thousands of illegal weapons in Fast and Furious. What about the drone strikes killing American citizens without due process? What about his use of executive orders to release people duly imprisoned by courts of law? How about his circumventing Congress to seize land? And under Mr. Obama wealth has concentrated to just a few crony fat cats while everyone else lives hand to mouth due to underemployment. Even the liberal Huffington Post had to admit this fact. Rich oligarchs are another example of third worldism. No Third World country is complete without vote fraud to keep the ruling junta in power. Consider the fact that fraud may well be the reason Obama won re-election last time.  A nation without the rule of law is a banana republic. Banana republics are inherently third world. So Hillary and the Left may dismiss Mr. Trump's argument that America is becoming third world, but the facts belie their claims.  In the presidential debate last Monday Donald Trump warned America that she's "become a third-world country" to the guffaws and disdain of the liberals, the media (but I repeat myself) and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who later accused Trump of talking smack about the country she wants to loot, er, lead.

(Photo courtesy E. Johnson/flickr) By Cole Lauterbach SPRINGFIELD – They’re from Texas — and they’re coming for your job. A delegation of business advocates and corporate executives took to the streets of Chicago and the surrounding suburbs last week to lure Illinois businesses to the Lone Star State. They’re looking to capitalize on Illinois’ stagnant job growth and reputedly unfriendly business environment to convince the state’s job creators to pack up and move to Texas. Texas Economic Development Corporation President Tracye McDaniel led the charge. McDaniel said that in addition to low workers’ compensation insurance costs for businesses and no state income tax, Texas’ worker-freedom laws have a special appeal to Illinois businesses. “Texas stands top on the list as a right-to-work state,” McDaniel said. “It’s a major consideration for site selectors, C-level executives and decision makers from across the country.” McDaniel said the biggest key to luring businesses from all over the world to Texas is to listen to the voices of their own job creators and create policies that will let them prosper. “Our main advantage is for our corporate executives at the table with us designing our business-development strategies,” McDaniel said. If the latest IRS data says anything, it’s that McDaniel is succeeding. Recent IRS records showed that more than 10,000 people recently moved from Illinois to Texas, with net migration gains from 46 other states as well.

"The last thing we need are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear armed," Clinton said at a fundraiser in February, as quoted by The Hill newspaper. She added that new nuclear arms race was a very threatening scenario, according to the political daily. The United States is modernizing its nuclear Triad with particular emphasis on US Air Force needs. In October 2015, Northrop Grumman, a US global aerospace and defense technology company, was awarded a development contract to build the next generation B-21 strategic bomber, while Lockheed Martin and Boeing said they planned to submit proposals to develop the new Intercontinental Ballistic Missile System (ICBM), now called the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). ...

This only means the Clinton campaign knows she will lose if something doesn't change. She really is a terrifying woman. They are trying to soften her image and lie about Trump being more of a risk. There's no question that Hillary Clinton is a hostile person and her staff knows it better than anyone. the wording of the headline is interesting. Candidate Clinton as opposed to what she would do as POTUS Clinton.

CP is the real deal. Everyone needs to remember who was behind these ruthless war crimes. This was more or less the introduction to endless wars of NATO's plans for the 21st century. The 20 year anniversary will be in about 2 1/2 years. The article in the link is by people who lived it and have to endure the effects. They're the people that Hillary Clinton sees as expendable. If the anti-war movement that exists is looking for an anti-war candidate, Clinton surely is not the right choice. Reply jas 16:22 01.10.2016 | 1 | Edit | Delete Clinton likes to mention her experience. Major parts of that experience are the Yugoslavia destruction (war crime), NAFTA (big business destroying smaller business), Iraq, Libya and Syria (chaos and terror in the Middle East). Also, there's Benghazi, where one of the men in the world who really knew the truth about Libya was killed. Like most psychopaths, she's progressing in the intensity of her participation. I have no doubt that she will start a nuclear war if elected. It's about the only line she hasn't crossed yet.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Aerospace & Defense | Fri Sep 30, 2016 | 3:39pm EDT Indonesia's Garuda's U.S. return to generate 5 percent of 2017 revenue: CEO Workers clean the body of a Garuda Indonesia Airbus A320 aircraft inside Hangar 4 of PT Garuda Maintenance Facility (GMF) Aero Asia at Soekarno-Hatta airport in Jakarta, September 28, 2015. By Allison Lampert | MONTREAL MONTREAL Garuda Indonesia's (GIAA.JK), the country's national carrier, expects its return to the United States next year with three flights a week to generate about 5 percent of the airline's top-line passenger revenue for 2017, its chief executive said. The airline is now negotiating rights to start service from Jakarta to Los Angeles via Japan, Chief Executive Officer Arif Wibowo said in an interview. He said the new flights would be a "milestone" for Garuda, which reported $3.81 billion in total operating revenues in 2015. Garuda's plans follow an August announcement by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that Indonesia's aviation safety performance now meets international standards, allowing its carriers to fly to the United States. The FAA removed the ability of the country's carriers to fly to the United States in 2007. The southeast Asian nation has struggled with a patchy aviation record. Garuda is also considering a route to New York via Europe, where it flies to Amsterdam and London. "What we are aiming is to ... grab market between Indonesia and the U.S.," Wibowo told Reuters late Thursday on the sidelines of a United Nations aviation assembly in Montreal. "We can start from three flights per week. Eventually we are also aiming to become a daily flight." Traffic between the United States and Indonesia is about 400,000 passengers a year, he said. Garuda is publicly traded but the Indonesian government is its largest shareholder with a 60 percent stake. The fast-growing carrier is in negotiations with planemaker Boeing Co (BA.N) and rival Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) for at least 22 widebody planes to replace A330s that the carrier has on an operating lease, Wibowo said.

(AP) Aircraft engineers in Germany have successfully tested the world’s first four-seater plane that uses emission-free hybrid fuel cells to fly. The 10-minute test flight Thursday at Stuttgart Airport in southwestern Germany involved two pilots and two dummy passengers. The twin-cabin plane, known as HY4, was developed by aircraft maker Pipistrel, fuel cell specialist Hydrogenics, the University of Ulm and the German Aerospace Center DLR. It uses hydrogen to generate electricity in-flight, giving it a cruising speed of 165 kilometers per hour (102.5 mph) and a range of up to 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), while relying on batteries for take-off and landing. Boeing and Airbus have also tested smaller fuel cell planes in recent years as the aircraft industry searches for ways to reduce emissions.
