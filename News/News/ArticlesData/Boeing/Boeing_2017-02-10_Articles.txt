Fiji Time: 9:50 PM on Saturday 11 February Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business $28 billion order Reuters Saturday, February 11, 2017 SINGAPORE Airlines announced a provisional order worth $US13.8 billion ($F28b) at list prices to buy 39 Boeing wide-body planes on Thursday as it battles Gulf carriers, dealing a blow to Airbus in the key market for big twinjets. SIA signed a letter of intent with Boeing for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s to tap additional passenger growth and to modernise its fleet over the next decade. Additional options for the two aircraft types could take the deal to as many as 51 aircraft. The preliminary order is a boost for Boeing as it seeks to restore momentum for the newest version of its long-haul 777, which after a strong debut has not had a firm order in 20 months. It is also expected to shore up export-related US jobs at a time when domestic manufacturing employment is a sensitive political issue under US President Donald Trump. "The carrier is a demanding customer, and its fleet decisions usually define market trends in the intermediate term," said Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel in a note. Airlines typically get discounts on jet orders and Rubel estimated the deal's net value closer to $US6.5b ($F13b) or about a tenth of the US planemaker's annual volume. "While the deal may have been highly competitive, it is business in part of the market that strengthens Boeing's positioning," he said. The agreement, however, leaves a question mark over Airbus proposals to develop a larger 400-seat version of its A350 passenger jet to compete with the 406-seat Boeing 777-9. Singapore's flagship carrier had been seen as a key potential launch customer for the proposed jet, but the European planemaker last year postponed a decision on whether to launch the new project amid pressure on demand for wide-body jets. The fact Airbus was not yet ready to make a definitive offer to supply the new plane, relying instead on the 366-seat A350-1000, may have been a handicap in the contest for Singapore's business, an industry source said. "Our priority is to certify and assure entry to service of the A350-1000," an Airbus spokesman said, adding the two main existing models represented a "good platform" for airline needs.

Falcon Heavy? New Glenn? Fly, then debate. Eric Berger - Feb 10, 2017 9:17 pm UTC Why did a commercial organization endorse the SLS rocket? NASA reader comments 55 Share this story This week, the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, which counts rocket builders SpaceX and Blue Origin among its executive members, made news by declaring its support for NASA’s Space Launch System rocket. The organization’s new chairman, Alan Stern, announced during a conference that “we see many benefits in the development of NASA’s SLS.” This caused a stir in the commercial space community. Later, during an interview with Ars, Stern explained that the commercial space organization has, in the past, engaged in a “bruising battle” over the government’s massive rocket and its influential prime contractor Boeing. The commercial space industry group (of which Boeing is not a member) contended the private sector could deliver the same capability as the SLS for far less than the $2 billion NASA has spent annually this decade to develop the rocket. The SLS will initially be able to heft 70 metric tons to low Earth orbit, but that could grow to 130 metric tons by the late 2020s. Further ReadingHow I learned to stop worrying and love the big $60B NASA rocket But now, Stern said the organization believes the SLS will enable the aims of commercial companies to develop businesses on the Moon, as well as support asteroid mining and other ventures his members are interested in. “We are taking a long view,” Stern said. “This is clearly to the advantage of the expansion of commercial spaceflight. Now, with a new administration and a new Congress, we wanted to put our stake down on the side of SLS.” Don’t forget Sessions At the same time this week, a Politico article noted the efforts of former NASA consultant and SLS critic Charles Miller to push the Trump space program toward an aggressive campaign to begin lunar landings by the end of 2020. Miller is a former member of Trump’s NASA transition team, and he envisions lunar landings becoming possible by leveraging commercial capabilities. The Politico article says Miller is pushing the concept of an “internal competition” within NASA for launch and spacecraft contracts. The competition would be between NASA’s traditional contractors, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and new space firms such as SpaceX and Blue Origin. For launches, a fair competition would almost certainly favor SpaceX and Blue Origin, both of whom are developing heavy lift rockets that are roughly in the same class as the 70-metric ton variant of the SLS. This is because both companies are essentially developing their rockets out of their existing funds—at no direct cost to taxpayers—and their per-launch costs would be a fraction of those forecast for the SLS. Further ReadingWhy Bezos’ rocket is unprecedented—and worth taking seriously The Politico piece likely overplays the influence of Miller, who is but one voice in the battle over NASA’s future. It’s worth remembering that a number of staffers from Jeff Sessions’ Senate office have moved over to positions in the White House, and they will have considerable say in NASA policy. Sessions is from Alabama, where the SLS rocket is being designed and developed at Marshall Space Flight Center. Settled on the pad So what does all this mean for the rocket wars? Instead of an “us vs. them” attitude, many aerospace insiders are taking an “all of the above” approach during the next few years when it comes to rocket capabilities. Given the politics, NASA will probably continue to devote about $2 billion of its $18 billion annual budget to the SLS rocket. At the same time, Congress can continue to pass legislation that does not hinder private efforts to develop heavy-lift rockets. Ultimately, this issue will probably be decided on the launchpad—where it should be. After all, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy has not yet flown, although it may finally do so this year. NASA’s SLS rocket is nominally slated for a November 2018 launch, although Ars understands this launch date will probably slip into early 2019. And while not much is known about Blue Origin’s New Glenn orbital rocket, company founder Jeff Bezos has said it will fly by the end of this decade. Further ReadingFalcon Heavy? New Glenn? NASA chief says he’s not a “big fan” Theoretically, then, the United States could have three heavy lift rockets at its disposal in 2020. If the reusable Falcon Heavy costs $200 million per flight, and the reusable New Glenn costs $200 million, while an expendable SLS rocket costs $1.5 billion, the agency—and by extension Congress and the White House—will have an easy choice to make. One could argue at that time that NASA should never have spent in excess of $10 billion developing the SLS. But the bottom line is that, six years ago, Congress did not believe in the capacity of SpaceX to build a heavy lift rocket, and Blue Origin’s intentions were not known at that time. So Congress bet on NASA and its traditional contractor Boeing, and the agency kept its large base of employees intact. The Commercial Spaceflight Federation likely recognizes that raising its voice now, publicly at least, against the SLS has limited political upside with a Congress predisposed to favor NASA’s big rocket. Instead of poking NASA or Congress in the eye with a stick, better to stay relevant. Ultimately, when SpaceX, Blue Origin, or both have a launch capability that costs far less than the public alternative, the commercial space organization will have a much more potent argument to make.

"Today´s major order for widebody aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position," SIA´s chief executive officer Goh Choon Phong said in a statement.  Airlines typically get discounts on list prices when placing large orders. SIA´s significant orders and recent moves to extend some of its fuel-hedging contracts to as long as five years show that it is positioning itself for the next phase of growth, said Shukor Yusof, analyst at Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "What´s working for them is that they have very deep pockets and they are putting some of that money to replace fleet and also looking at new destinations," Yusof said.  SIA has been under pressure as demand weakens for long-haul travel amid tough competition from Middle East network carriers. SIA said this would be the airline´s first order for the newest 777 variant that is currently under development, the 777-9.  0 0 Singapore Airlines orders $13.8bln Boeings was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on February 10, 2017 and was last updated on February 10, 2017.

GulliverFeb 10th 2017 by M.R. twitter icon facebook icon linkedin icon mail icon ONE statistic that never fails to amaze is the claim by Boeing that one of its 737-model planes lands or takes off somewhere in the world every two seconds. Airbus, the American planemaker’s bitter European rival, makes a similar assertion about its A320 series (although fewer have been built). So ubiquitous are these mid-sized, short-haul aircraft that if you are sat on a modern plane with 120-200 seats you are all but guaranteed to be on an A320 or a 737. That duopoly is nice for Boeing and Airbus, which have collectively delivered 16,800 of the two models. But, in Europe at least, passengers are getting a taste of what else might be. Last July, Swiss International Air Lines became the first carrier in the world to fly the Bombardier CSeries on scheduled commercial operations. It currently deploys five CS100s (pictured) from Zurich to two dozen European cities. The 125-seat jets are borrowed from parent company Lufthansa, Germany’s flag-carrier, which has ordered 30 CSeries and expects to receive another 12 of the planes this year. More recently, Air Baltic, the flag-carrier of Latvia, became the first to fly the CS300, a larger variant which it has configured with 145 seats. Two of the 20 CS300s that the airline has ordered have so far arrived in Riga, to be deployed on routes to 11 European cities. Another six are expected by this summer. Other future CSeries operators include Delta Air Lines and Air Canada, which together account for one-third of the aircraft’s 360 global sales. After struggling with production delays and budget overruns, the CSeries is now enjoying a smooth entry into service. Airlines like the plane for its reliability and fuel efficiency, which Bombardier claims is up to 20% better than competing current-generation aircraft (other manufacturers dispute this). Passengers seem to like the on-board experience, praising its large cabin windows, high humidity and low noise levels (the engines on the CSeries are up to 20 decibels quieter than on comparable planes). The 3-2 seat layout means that only one in every five passengers must endure a middle seat, compared with a third on most 737s and A320s. Plus, Air Baltic and Swiss are compensating those sandwiched between two passengers by adding half an inch (1cm) to the already-ample standard seat width (lifting it from 18.5 inches to 19 inches). Many operators of Boeing and Airbus jets are going in the opposite direction, squeezing their passengers into 17-inch-wide seats. Nor is the CSeries the only new pretender in the skies. Last year, CityJet, a European regional carrier, received the first three of 15 Sukhoi Superjets, which are manufactured by a Russian company better known for building fighter jets. As well as deploying the aircraft in its own colours from London, CityJet will operate three Superjets on behalf of Brussels Airlines this summer. Again, passengers appear impressed with the plane, particularly its roomy cabins. Still, sales are weak compared with the CSeries. Most other Superjet orders have been placed by airlines based in Russia or the former Soviet republics. (The suspicion is that the Russian government has encouraged the sales.) The 98-seat Superjet is also too small to compete directly with the 737 and A320, although Sukhoi has talked about launching a 130-seat version around the end of the decade. Plane enthusiasts will have to wait a similar amount of time before experiencing the other mid-sized, short-haul aircraft currently under development. The Brazilian-made Embraer E2 family of jets—including the E195, which seats up to 144 flyers—will not enter service until at least 2018. The Chinese-made Comac C919, a 150-seater, should follow soon after, though it may be a rare bird in Western skies given that almost all of its buyers are Chinese leasing companies. It is a similar story for the Russian-made Irkut MC-21, another 150-seater, which has even fewer orders that the Superjet. Boeing and Airbus have little reason to panic just yet. But they ought to keep a close eye on Swiss and Air Baltic. If their finance departments enjoy the CSeries as much as their passengers, orders could quickly take off.  twitter icon facebook icon linkedin icon mail icon Be the first to comment Reuse this content Editors’ picks Russia and AmericaDonald Trump seeks a grand bargain with Vladimir Putin It is a terrible idea Leaders ObituaryHans Rosling, statistician and sword-swallower, has diedScience and technology Dying to defend the planetWhy Latin America is the deadliest place for environmentalistsAmericas Broken time“Django” is jazzy but lacks a political beatProspero Latest Updates Making the Fed great againA resignation opens up yet another vacancy at the Fed Democracy in America Podcast: The week aheadBibi in DC International Daily chartMigration and labour shortages in Asian countries Graphic detail Broken time“Django” is jazzy but lacks a political beat Prospero Trump’s cabinetThe wonkless White House Democracy in America The comfort of strangersPassengers like flying on planes not made by Boeing or Airbus Gulliver Mixed signalsStockmarkets are confident, banks not so much Buttonwood's notebook The Economist explainsWhy the election in Uttar Pradesh is a big deal The Economist explains See you in courtJudges uphold the suspension of Donald Trump’s travel ban Democracy in America Injured reserveShould America want a strong dollar?

Nationwide, about 366 flights were canceled as of 2:50 p.m. ET on Friday, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. That’s a relatively small number on a national basis and marked a dramatic improvement from Thursday’s tally of 3,704 cancellations. FLIGHT TRACKER: Is your flight on time? USA TODAY Deadly snowstorm pounds Northeast, snarling flights and shuttering schools Unsurprisingly, Friday's cancellations were most widespread at airports in the Northeast that were hit hard from Thursday’s weather. Thursday’s flight woes came as a major winter storm walloped parts of the Northeast, dropping heavy snow across an area stretching from eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey north into New York state and southern New England. The airports serving Boston, New York suffered some of the greatest flight disruptions. Nearly 70% of the entire day's schedule was grounded at both Boston Logan and New York LaGuardia. About half the day’s flights were scrapped at Newark Liberty and New York JFK.

Problems were widespread, though less severe -- relatively speaking -- at other airports. Philadelphia and Washington Reagan National fared better than airports to the north, but still saw cancellations ground about one out of every five of flights Thursday. Other airports – including Portland, Maine; Manchester, N.H.; and Westchester County, N.Y. – all suffered cancellation rates of great than 20%, according to FlightAware. Delays and cancellations resulting from the Northeast storm rippled out even farther, affecting across the U.S. Orlando counted nearly 150 cancellations on Thursday – largely the fallout from the snowy weather in the North. While most of those came on flights to places like New York and Boston, the ripple effect of such disruptions can snare fliers headed to other destinations. An Orlando-to-Houston flight, for example, could become delayed or canceled if the plane or crew scheduled to operate that flight was originally scheduled to come from New York or Boston. For fliers dealing with itineraries disrupted by the storm, flexible rebooking policies remained in effect at most big airlines serving the region -- though the fine print varied significantly from carrier to carrier. Customers affected by the storm were advised to check the airline’s website for information about flight changes and weather waviers.

A Company That's Never Made a Plane Wants to Build the Air Force’s New Jets The Minnesota-based Stavatti has shown off some impressively futuristic designs over the past decade. But so far it's been the aerial equivalent of vaporware—all hype. A Minnesota-based aviation upstart just jumped into a $16-billion contest to build training jets for the US Air Force. The odds are long that Stavatti Aerospace will win, but perhaps not as long as the last time Stavatti tried to disrupt America's military aircraft industry. When Stavatti first made headlines nearly a decade ago, the privately-held company was the industrial equivalent of an internet troll—spreading titillating graphics depicting futuristic airplanes it stood little chance of ever producing. So far, Stavatti's airplanes are all the aerial equivalent of vaporware. All hype. But the warplane market has changed since 2009. Small companies building clever planes stand a better chance today than they did then—and that could boost Stavatti's prospects from impossible to merely highly unlikely. The Air Force wants to buy 350 training planes to replace its 1960s-vintage T-38s. On Dec. 30, 2016, the flying branch formally asked the US aerospace industry for proposals. The goal: To acquire trainers that can better prepare pilots for the latest F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. "T-X is a program we've got to get right," Air Force chief of staff Gen. Dave Goldfein said in a statement.  All the major aerospace firms worked on prototypes. Several dropped out, leaving America's top two defense contractors—Lockheed Martin and Boeing—to duke it out. Lockheed, based in Maryland, is offering the T-50, a nimble, single-tail jet it co-developed with a South Korean firm. Chicago-based Boeing teamed up with Swedish company Saab to devise a twin-tail plane. Both the Lockheed and Boeing jets are supersonic and have two seats and one engine. Boeing and Lockheed have been working on their trainers under intensive media scrutiny for years. So it came as a surprise to many observers when, on Feb. 1, Stavatti announced it, too, would compete—with not one, but two different planes. CEO Chris Beskar told Motherboard he would submit the Javelin design it bought from a bankrupt aerospace firm in addition its own, homemade Machete design. Both planes are subsonic and come with unusual pedigrees. The 1990s-vintage Javelin once belonged to Colorado-based Aviation Technology Group, which hoped to produce hundreds of the twin-seat, twin-tail planes in conjunction with an Israeli company. It wasn't to be. ATG went bankrupt in 2008, and Stavatti scooped up the rights to the Javelin. "It's a nice airplane," Beskar said. "It's sad when you look at the history of aviation that the project didn't get farther along. We're trying to pick up the pieces." Stavatti is submitting the Javelin in an Air Force design competition. Image: Stavatti. Javelin is older than the Lockheed and Boeing planes are, but Beskar said that shouldn't matter. "We know a lot of people in the Air Force liked Javelin," he said. The prototype Javelin flew briefly in 2005. The Machete, on the other hand, exists only on paper. In 2009, Stavatti pushed the futuristic-looking Machete concept as a gun-armed attack plane to partially replace the Air Force's rugged, heavily-armed A-10 tank-killers, which critics claimed were overkill for fighting insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Air Force decided to stick with the A-10. The Machete never got off the ground, so to speak. But Beskar said there's no reason the concept couldn't also be a good fit for the T-X competition.  Capt. Michael Hertzog, an Air Force spokesman, said the flying branch is willing to consider all options, including actually flyable prototypes and "developmental" planes that haven't gotten past the blueprint stage. "This program is not stovepiped either way." But realistically, either Boeing or Lockheed is likely to win. Between them, the two companies produce hundreds of airplanes a year for private and military buyers all over the world. The two companies employ thousands of the world's top designers and engineers. Stavatti doesn't currently produce any planes, to say nothing of warplanes. Of course, with computer-aided design, 3D printing and rapid prototyping, today it's theoretically possible for a reasonably competent company to develop a functional combat aircraft in just a few years and at low cost. In fact, Rhode Island-based Textron designed its two-seat Scorpion attack jet in just two years, starting in January 2012.  The Scorpion flew for the first time in December 2013. Simple and flexible, the Scorpion costs just $3,000 per hour to fly—a tenth as much as some heavier, supersonic fighters. Several air forces are reportedly considering purchasing the plane. Even the US Air Force is interested. Anticipating bigger budgets under President Donald Trump, the flying branch has said it could buy potentially hundreds of new attack planes to finally begin replacing those old A-10s.  Beskar said Textron's gamble with the Scorpion has encouraged him to keep pushing his own plane designs. The deadline for Stavatti and the other competition entrants to formally submit their proposals for the T-X contest is March 30. Despite starting work on his planes much later than Boeing and Lockheed did—and with far fewer resources—Beskar said he's optimistic. "We're not behind the curve."

The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. 'MADE IN INDIA' DILEMMA Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe's Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say U.S. manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing's Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump's administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India.

The US group said in a statement on 8 February that BDI will be led by Pratyush Kumar, president of Boeing India, and will focus on expanding Boeing's existing engagement with military customers and local industry. Underscoring the importance of the market to Boeing, India becomes only the fourth country outside the United States where the corporation has established a dedicated defence division. Others are in Australia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom. "As a key market for Boeing, we are making the changes necessary to position ourselves for future growth, drive decision-making closer to the customer, strengthen partnerships with local companies in India, and accelerate our efforts to achieve the country's 'Make in India' vision," said Leanne Caret, president and chief executive officer of Boeing Defense, Space, and Security.

The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said that the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. Boeing, as well as rivals like Airbus and Lockheed Martin, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said that new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Lockheed Martin said this week it wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump's administration may want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes.

Southeast Asia’s biggest long-distance carrier is considering buying 20 of Boeing’s long-range 777-9 jets, which are set to debut at decade’s end, after studying a rival bid for Airbus Group SE’s A350 aircraft, one of the people said. The carrier is also poised to take at least 19 of the Boeing 787-10, the longest Dreamliner model, the person said. Those aircraft would be valued at $13.8 billion based on list prices, before the discounts that are customary in the industry. The order could be unveiled this week, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Singapore Airlines, under pressure to cut costs after two consecutive quarters of declining profit, has been seeking more fuel-efficient aircraft as crude oil prices show signs of a rebound. Representatives of Singapore Airlines and Boeing declined to comment. “The global trend is to replace inefficient planes with efficient ones,” said K. Ajith, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Pte in Singapore. “This move is to bring down their cost.” Singapore Airlines also has ordered 67 of Airbus’s A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with non-stop services to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family, after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. –China Daily Do you have more to share about this story - photos or video etc - you can send them to: (newsghana101@gmail.com) TAGS Boeing close Order Singapore SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleFirms urged to sign up to Initiative Next articleArgentina stay top of FIFA rankings News Ghana RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR British Airways Suggests Val’s Getaway Destinations Four Ways Social Media Influences Your Traveling Experience Tanzania saves over US$400 million from foreign travel ban LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Please enter your comment!

By: Reuters | New Delhi | Published:February 10, 2017 12:41 pm Boeing will hire mostly local staff as it expands in India. (File Photo) Boeing Company’s new Indian unit will help it win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the US defence firm’s Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Watch What Else Is Making News Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. “This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the life cycle for our customers in India,” he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said that the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. “In order to support US exports, we need to better support our Indian customers,” he said. Boeing, as well as rivals like Airbus and Lockheed Martin, are looking to India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said that new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Lockheed Martin said this week it wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump’s administration may want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States.

ACORN FILE PHOTO A recent announcement that the cleanup of the Santa Susana Field Lab will miss a 2017 completion deadline has activists fuming. Denise Duffield, who is lobbying for complete cleanup of the 2,850-acre site to background standards, said she was angered by a January statement from the Department of Toxic Substances Control indicating cleanup will not begin until this year or next. DTSC is overseeing cleanup efforts of the entire field lab in the hills of Simi Valley, while NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy and Boeing Co. handle remediation for specific portions. “I’ve known that they haven’t started cleanup for some time (but) what’s new is hearing the really quite absurd excuse they’ve given about not realizing the extent of contamination,” Duffield told the Simi Valley Acorn. “They know how contaminated SSFL is . . . and they’ve known for years. STILL STANDING—The Alfa rocket test stand located in Area II of the Santa Susana Field Lab, pictured in 2014. ACORN FILE PHOTO “If the contamination is worse than it thought, DTSC should be demanding the cleanup agreements are upheld and doing whatever it can to speed up the process. But it’s not.” Under agreements signed by all the stakeholders in 2007 and 2010, all detectable soil contamination was supposed to be cleaned up this year, and plans to remediate the groundwater were to be in place. Russ Edmondson, a DTSC spokesperson, told the Acorn in an email that before remediation can begin, the agency must prepare a draft environmental impact report outlining the proposed cleanup activities for the entire site. “Investigation activities for both soil and groundwater are substantially complete and the results are being incorporated into reports that will be used to make cleanup decisions,” he wrote. “There are still contaminated soils and groundwater on the SSFL property that require cleanup activities. Those site-wide cleanup activities will be addressed in the draft EIR and subsequent cleanup decision documents.” The draft EIR was expected to be released in late 2016, but DTSC officials now say the document will be ready this year. Edmonson declined to comment further on the agency’s cleanup plans. Remediation terms The field lab had been used for decades as a nuclear test site and for research in the development of ballistic missiles, rockets and space shuttle equipment. Boeing owns 80 percent of the property, including Area IV, where a partial nuclear meltdown occurred in 1959. The federal government owns the remaining 20 percent. According to the 2007 cleanup agreement with DTSC signed by NASA, DOE and Boeing, the agencies are required to restore Boeing’s portion of the lab to suburban residential standards, meaning people could safely live on the land without getting sick from contamination. In 2010, NASA and DOE signed a separate agreement with the California Environmental Protection Agency to clean up part of Area I and all of Areas II and IV of the field lab to background standards, which calls for the removal of all materials that are unnatural to the site. Dan Hirsch, president of environmental group Committee to Bridge the Gap, one of many advocates in favor of full SSFL cleanup said “people were dancing in the streets” when the cleanup agreements were signed a decade ago. “I am deeply troubled that a cleanup that was supposed to be over hasn’t even started,” Hirsch said. “DTSC and the parties responsible for the pollution have dragged their feet, apparently in the hopes of avoiding their cleanup responsibilities.” Duffield said the delay is “disingenuous” and “outrageous.” “(DTSC) has been falling down on the job at many toxic sites throughout the state for years, and despite new leadership and several legislative initiatives . . . not much has changed. Communities are still being exposed, and DTSC is not protecting them as it should,” she said. Duffield asserts that not cleaning up the field lab only allows harmful nuclear and chemical contamination to continue migrating off-site. Broken promise Asked if the 2017 deadline set a decade ago was premature, Hirsch said “absolutely not.” “The cleanup would be over by now if they had begun when they were supposed to. Instead, it hasn’t even begun,” he said, adding it would realistically take only a few years to complete. “(Cleanup) is technologically simple (in that) contaminated soil is scooped up and taken to a licensed radioactive waste or hazardous waste disposal site.” When it comes to remediation at SSFL, Hirsch questioned whether the agencies “will live up to their repeated promises to enforce the cleanup agreement.” “The site was contaminated 70 years ago. It is astonishing that the parties responsible . . . have gotten away with not cleaning it up for (so long),” he said. “The agreements promising a 2017 cleanup are enforceable only by the parties that signed them and they are the ones breaking them,” he continued. “If the state doesn’t enforce the agreements, there will be no cleanup and people living nearby will risk dying from migrating pollution.” Return to top Copyright © 2004-2017 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

(AAPL) Stock Bulls Boeing Co (BA) Stock Gives Savvy Investors a Good Payout View All Posts Don’t let a faulty altimeter lead you to believe Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) is in need of repair. Any stray measurements in Boeing stock’s share price on Wednesday were tied to a pending dividend payment — and one that has already paid nice dividends to some options traders. Let me explain. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr Shares of Boeing have been flying high in 2017 after hitting record highs following the aircraft manufacturer’s earnings beat late last month. But in Wednesday’s session, BA stock may have appeared to have had a slight crack in its fuselage; pardon the pun. Houston, Boeing Has a Problem? At a share price of $164.08 and depending on your trading vendor, BA stock was off either $1 or 0.61% or a more eyebrow raising -$2.42 or -1.45%. The $1.42 difference between the two readings in Boeing shares is tied to the stock going ex-dividend Wednesday, with a cash payment of $1.42 scheduled for March 3. Bearing this in mind, trade vendors who recognize the ex-date will show BA stock as trading lower by the less-significant 0.61%. Any chart or quote platforms that erroneously fail to account for the ex-date will indicate Boeing has declined by a larger 1.45%. For BA stock investors who were long or purchased shares by Tuesday’s close, Wednesday’s minor damage is reflected by the more modest 0.61% dip, as $1.42 will be paid back to shareholders next month to dampen the otherwise larger 1.45% decline in Boeing. What’s the point? Dividends aren’t a free lunch, as the money distributed is taken out of the share price of the stock. If Wednesday wasn’t an ex-date in Boeing, BA stock would be trading $1.42 higher at $165.50 vs. $164.08 — bottom-line. For the proverbial free lunch, you’d have to look at Tuesday’s heavy volume options trading in BA stock tied to ‘dividend play’ activity, which looks to arbitrage the future payout with an immediate overnight payoff. BA Stock Dividend Play Strategy To illustrate how this might be accomplished, we can look at the BA stock Feb $155 call, as roughly $14,200 in profits was distributed to one or more options traders today due to the ex-dividend.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose about 100 points, with Caterpillar contributing the most gains. "Investors were worried that the tax plan was pushed to the backburner. Now, investors are celebrating that it's not," said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. The S&P 500 gained 0.36 percent, with energy, materials and industrials leading advancers. Lifting the energy sector were oil prices, as U.S. crude futures for March delivery popped 1.6 percent to settle at $53.86 per barrel after the International Energy Agency reported that OPEC members' cuts in January equated to 90 percent of the agreed volumes. The market "continues to feed on itself. I think that part of the impetus is the S&P has confirmed a new all-time high, along with the Dow and Nasdaq," said Daniel Deming, managing director at KKM Financial. He added that Trump's initiatives "keep being received as positive." The Nasdaq composite gained about 0.33 percent. The three major indexes also posted weekly gains. Major indexes this week Source: FactSet "When he said the words 'phenomenal tax plan,' that gave hope to the market that we were going to get a tax plan sooner," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "He basically spurred the market, saying he hasn't forgotten about tax reform. That issue was at the core of the market's embrace of Trump's agenda, along with deregulation." Trump said Thursday in a meeting with airline executives that "lowering the overall tax burden on American business is big league ... that's coming along very well," adding that an announcement would come over the next two or three weeks. Stocks climbed to record highs following those remarks. "But who was in the market yesterday? Trading volume was low, and it was algorithms that were triggered immediately, lifting the market," said Krosby, noting that trading desks were not as active in the northeast Thursday because of a snowstorm that hit the region. Nevertheless, other asset classes also reacted to Trump's remarks. Treasury yields and the dollar gained ground. On Friday, the benchmark U.S. 10 yield rose to trade at 2.409 percent, while the short-term two-year yield hovered around 1.2 percent. Getty Images A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. dollar held around 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.064 and the yen around 113.34. Gold futures for April delivery, meanwhile, fell 90 cents to settle at $1,235.90 per ounce. "It should be kept in mind that the ongoing Trump developments have heavily eroded investor risk appetite while political risks continue to weigh on global sentiment. Although the yellow metal remains slightly pressured on the daily charts, bulls could reclaim control if the $1220 regions defend," Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, said in a note. Equities, along with the dollar and Treasury yields, have skyrocketed since Trump's election on the prospects of more business friendly and reflationary policies. "The rally yesterday in stocks after Trump said he will unveil a 'phenomenal' tax plan made sense because we wanted to see him focus on what was most important and not get distracted by other noise and tweets. There remains though the issue of what will be unveiled," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, in a note. In economic news, import prices rose 0.4 percent in January, more than the expected 0.2 percent increase. Export prices rose 0.1 percent last month, in line with estimates. preliminary consumer sentiment for February came in at 95.7, below the expected 98.5.

(AFP) Boeing’s Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. — AP (Brad Nettles MBI) Entity is fourth separate country-specific business established after those in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia Boeing's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the US defence firm's Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India president Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support US exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said.   'Made in India' dilemma Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe's Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say US manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with US President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing's Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump's administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. Share More > Vote ERROR: Macro /ads/dfp-ads is missing!

(NYSE: BA) filed its 2016 Form 10-K annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. Like nearly all required filings for every company, the Boeing 10-K contains a range of detailed information that is often not included in quarterly press announcements or even quarterly SEC filings. We’ve read through the Boeing 10-K with an eye to finding some of those details that investors might not find in other documents. We paid special attention to the section of the 10-K related to risk factors. Here are some things we found that may not be on investors’ radar. Italic text indicates a direct quote from the filing. We enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Boeing’s defense systems segment generated approximately 71% of 2016 revenues from fixed-price contracts. Cost-overruns (what Boeing calls reach-forward losses) totaled $1.13 billion last year on the KC-46A tanker fixed-price contract. In 2016, 23% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. In 2016, non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our airplane financing commitments totaled $14,847 million and $16,283 million. Boeing finances these commitments, in part, with debt. Rising interest rates will affect the company’s interest payments. Boeing paid $306 million in interest expense last year, an increase of more than 10% from 2015. Approximately 57,000 employees, which constitute 38% of our total workforce, were union represented as of December 31, 2016. Boeing currently has relationships with 11 U.S. unions and seven non-U.S. labor organizations. Union labor at the company’s suppliers may also affect the company’s ability to meet its commitments. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. This is the company’s book-to-bill ratio expressed in dollars. Since the banner year of 2014, backlogs have been shrinking as new orders slow. Commercial contractual backlog at the end of 2016 is $416.2 billion, down from $440.12 billion in 2014 and $431.41 billion in 2015. Including the defense segment’s backlog, total contractual backlog for 2016 is $458.28 billion, down from $487.1 billion in 2014 and $476.6 billion in 2015. Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. Boeing may find itself in the position of having to fund additional commitments or entering into new financial arrangements with customers if the Ex-Im Bank doesn’t attain a quorum. This diverts liquidity from other places the company might prefer to use it.

(NYSE: BA) filed its 2016 Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC form is pretty plain-looking, compared with what the printed version of annual report will look like: lots of big pictures and stylized pull-quotes. But the stuff that Boeing (and every other company) has to reveal is in the SEC filing, and while reading these often 100 or so page reports can at times be mind-numbing, there can be a big payoff. Warren Buffett has said on more than one occasion that he loves to curl up with companies’ annual reports. The way to get smarter, Buffett once said while holding up a stack of papers, is to “read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge builds up, like compound interest.” But most people don’t have time to read 500 pages a day of financial reporting documents (or they don’t think they do), so we went through the Boeing 10-K filing looking for some hidden gems of data. We found 10 and have presented them here. Here are a couple, with Boeing’s original text in italic type, along with our comments. In 2016, 23% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks. In 2016, non-U.S. customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues.

AFP PHOTO   In Summary Conway said the Trump team was "aware" of the lawmakers' letter and was "reviewing that internally." Since his election in November, Trump has targeted a series of American multinationals by name (General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed and others) for moving production overseas or for allegedly overcharging the government. Advertisement By AGENCIES A key aide to Donald Trump was facing possible investigation Thursday after pitching the clothing line of the president's daughter Ivanka on television, with top lawmakers from both camps denouncing a major ethics breach and urging "disciplinary action." Speaking with the White House seal clearly visible over her shoulder, Kellyanne Conway gave Ivanka Trump's clothing a rave review during a Fox interview early Thursday, urging shoppers to "go buy Ivanka's stuff." "This is just a wonderful line," she said. "I own some of it. I fully -- I'm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online." Conway was clearly channelling the anger expressed a day earlier by the president himself, when he tweeted that Ivanka had been "treated so unfairly" by Nordstrom, an upscale department store chain that dropped her fashion brand. But to Washington traditionalists, Conway's direct pitch from the White House for a product line sold by the president's child seemed a jaw-dropping -- and possibly illegal -- misuse of presidential prestige. Democrat Elijah Cummings and Republican Jason Chaffetz -- both lawmakers on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which Chaffetz chairs -- led calls for Conway to face rebuke. "Conway's statements clearly violate the ethical principles for federal employees and are unacceptable," the congressmen said in a letter to the federal ethics chief, Walter Shaub, requesting that he recommend "appropriate disciplinary action" against her. "What she did was wrong, wrong, wrong," said Chaffetz on Twitter. The Office of Government Ethics, which Shaub heads, separately said it had been "receiving an extraordinary volume of contacts from citizens about recent events." Without mentioning Conway by name, it said it was reaching out to the appropriate government agencies who would decide whether to pursue the matter -- the established protocol when the OGE learns of "possible ethics violations." 'The law is clear' Conway said the Trump team was "aware" of the lawmakers' letter and was "reviewing that internally." She also told Fox News she had spoken with the president about the incident and that he "supports me 100 percent." "All I can say, at some point in your life, you ought to have a boss who treated me the way that the president is treating me today." White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump's aide had been "counseled" over the issue, without providing more detail. "Kellyanne Conway's White House Infomercial," as it was dubbed in a scathing New York Times editorial, again fanned debate over the unprecedented level to which the new president -- despite his protestations to the contrary -- has mixed politics, business and family, raising questions about conflicts of interest. For Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group which filed a separate complaint, "the law is clear" on such matters. "This is just another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president's family and supporters." Boycott calls Since his election in November, Trump has targeted a series of American multinationals by name (General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed and others) for moving production overseas or for allegedly overcharging the government. But his tweet targeting Nordstrom marked the first time he had complained directly about the business interests of one of his adult children. The tweet appeared both on Trump's personal account and on that of the presidency, @POTUS. The Nordstrom group, with 350 stores in the United States and Canada, has repeatedly denied any political motive to its dropping of Ivanka Trump's clothing line, saying it was motivated purely by "performance" considerations. Sales had fallen, particularly in last year's second half. But products carrying a Trump brand, including Ivanka's, have been boycotted by critics of the new president, leading to his complaint of a political motivation behind Nordstrom's move. TJX Companies, which operates the clothing store chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls, told AFP on Thursday it had instructed store employees no longer to display Ivanka Trump products separately. "The communication we sent to TJ Maxx and Marshalls in the US instructed stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor," a spokesperson said. advertisement In the Headlines Besigye warns country on diversionary campaign Dr Besigye says there are serious political, economic and social issues that should be occupying Makerere staff oppose Shs300m payment to probe committee The academic staff association has greeted the payment with dismay considering that the National AG faults oil companies on sharing information   National 46 accounting officers face arrest over Shs46b   National World Day of the Sick - gov’t asked to focus on palliative care   1  hour ago National Uganda receives Shs500m Tuberculosis machines   41 minutes ago Advertisement National Religious leaders, parents oppose govt policy on contraceptives National Public holds mock plenary, tips on climate change National FDC’s Alaso trounced in court World 500 West African troops get three-month Gambia extension World MPs, guards fight in S.African parliament as president Zuma addresses nation Advertisement Latest News National Uganda receives Shs500m Tuberculosis machines   National World Day of the Sick - gov’t asked to focus on palliative care   Jobs and Career Ask your life insurance adviser   Jobs and Career Workplace: Be loyal to your job   Jobs and Career Mistakes job seekers should avoid   Full Woman Mystery man at the office   Dining & Recipes Chili con carne   Advertisement From The East African Business Layoff fears as East African economies slow down   Magazine Luxury firm eyes East Africa's ultra wealthy   Business Sub-Saharan Africa fast becoming hotbed of unemployment   Business Agriculture remains East Africa’s greatest source of jobs   News Angolan president orders stadium stampede probe   Business Rwanda's January inflation at 7.4pc   Business Fraud hits Tanzania’s mobile money transfer   Advertisement Web Mail e-Paper 93.3 KFM Business Directory Sqoop Dembefm NTV Uganda Africa Review The East African Daily Nation The Citizen Business Daily About us Contact us Advertise with Us Terms of Use Nation Media Group
Home Industry Boeing eyes more Indian orders with new business unit Boeing eyes more Indian orders with new business unit Boeing's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defence firm's Indian business said on Friday. By: Reuters | New Delhi | Published: February 10, 2017 7:00 PM The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. (Reuters) Boeing’s new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defence firm’s Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. “This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India,” he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. Watch This Also: “In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers,” he said. ‘MADE IN INDIA’ DILEMMA Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe’s Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say U.S. manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the “Made in India” policy with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing’s Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump’s administration might want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Boeing eyes more Indian orders with new business unit By Tommy Wilkes Reuters 22 hrs ago (…) Courtesy Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, in a photo provided by Boeing. NEW DELHI  • Boeing's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defense firm's Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support U.S. exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. 'Made in India' dilemma   Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe's Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defense budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernize its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defense industry. Industry sources say U.S. manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticized U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid How do they stack up?

Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump's administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Paul Waldman Gary Waters / Alamy Stock Photo February 10, 2017 ADVERTISEMENT Sign Up for Our free email newsletters 10 things you need to know today Today's best articles Today's top cartoons The good news newsletter The week's best photojournalism Daily business briefing Corporate CEOs are said to live in fear of President Trump's Twitter account. Woe unto those whose decision to outsource jobs or automate a factory should draw that 140-character Eye of Sauron. Companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Toyota have been the target of a Trump tweet and seen a quick drop in their stock prices. But maybe Trump's ability to punish corporations that grow wicked in his sight is overblown. Maybe they don't actually have much to fear from him. Maybe they can even stand up to him, and come out perfectly fine. That certainly seems to be the case with Nordstrom, the department store that made the fateful decision to stop carrying Ivanka Trump's clothing line — not for any political reason, they said, simply because sales were weak. Once their move became public, the administration swung into action. On Wednesday, the president tweeted, "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" Then Kellyanne Conway went on Fox & Friends the next morning to do her part. "It's a wonderful line. I own some of it," she told the viewers. "I'm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody." Sure, endorsing products like that is a violation of government ethics rules, but they're shaking up the old Washington system! Then the inimitable Sean Spicer brought his special brand of indignation to poor suffering Ivanka's cause. "This is a direct attack on his policies and her name," he said. "She is being maligned because they have a problem with his policies." The only appropriate thing to do, it would seem, is to stock those clothes in your store whether anyone's buying them or not. Spicer may have been right, just not for the reason he thought: Sales of Ivanka-wear may well have declined because of her father's repellent run for president, even if Nordstrom was just making a pure business decision. Either way, Nordstrom is suffering the terrible consequences, right? Well...not exactly. Nordstrom's stock price actually rose immediately after Trump's tweet, and so far seems to be suffering no ill effects. And while there are probably some die-hard Ivanka fans out there who will refuse to cross the threshold of a Nordstrom ever again, there are also probably an equal number of liberals who will patronize the store more often now, for the same reason. Action, reaction. Consumer choices have been getting more and more politically charged in recent years, a trend that will only intensify in Trump's America. You probably haven't forgotten how Chick-fil-A incurred the wrath of liberals, and efforts to shut it out of major cities, when the ultra-conservative social views of its owners became widely known. So what happened? Visiting a Chick-fil-A became a handy way for Republican politicians to signal cultural affiliation with religious right voters, and plenty of conservative voters became even more bonded with the company, which continues to grow. That's just one case, and of course there are plenty of examples of successful boycotts. The most effective ones, however, are usually those that have a particular thing they're asking the company to do (or stop doing). Lately liberals have been pressuring companies to stop advertising on Breitbart, the white nationalist website that used to be run by Stephen Bannon, Trump's senior adviser — with considerable success. That's an easy step for a company to take to rid itself of a headache; it's much harder for a boycott to get consumers to abandon a brand for good. Just look at what happened around the Super Bowl. A number of the ads contained subtle or not-so-subtle digs at the president's policies, including one that portrayed a mother and daughter's journey north to America (from a lumber company) and another for Budweiser that told the immigrant story of the founder of parent company Anheuser-Busch. After it was unveiled, some conservatives tried to organize a Bud boycott, which went precisely nowhere, just as previous similar efforts had. Remember when religious right activists vowed to bring Starbucks to its knees because their Christmas cups were just red, without an appropriately Christmas-y image, like perhaps Jesus on the cross? Starbucks, too, is still standing — and it recently announced, in response to Trump's refugee ban, that it would hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years. I'm pretty sure that when a huge company like Anheuser-Busch considers airing a potentially controversial ad at the Super Bowl, they do some very careful thinking — and polling and focus-grouping — before going ahead. Which tells us that an implied dig at a president elected with a minority of the vote isn't necessarily such a risky move. And if Trump were to hit back, would it make any difference in the long term? Probably not. To be clear, I don't mean to suggest that it isn't spectacularly inappropriate for the president of the United States to single out an American company for scorn based on little more than something he saw on Morning Joe. But these days, being on Donald Trump's bad side may not necessarily be bad for business. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT More Perspectives W.

REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser Thursday, Feb 09, 2017 DUBAI: The Gulf will continue to be a key market for defence suppliers in 2017, according to several senior industry figures. This activity will be spurred by a “security environment that is as challenging as we have ever known,” with countries around the region facing “unprecedented challenges,” according to Robert S. Harward, Chief Executive of Lockheed Martin United Arab Emirates. With rising global tensions, international demand for defence and military products is increasing across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, according to a report released by Deloitte in January. As a result of this increasing insecurity, many countries have hiked their spending on next generation military equipment, with the UAE and Saudi Arabia leading the field in the GCC. Advertisement “International sales currently represent roughly 30 per cent of Boeing Defence, Space & Security’s business, and we see continued opportunities for growth, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions,” said Scott Day, Boeing Defence, Space & Security Communications, in an email to Gulf News. According to Theodore Karasik, a senior adviser to Gulf State Analytics, a geo-strategic consultancy based in Dubai, current industry trends show an increase in multiple markets, including not only aerospace but also cybersecurity, communications and riot control equipment. That being said, Karasik also noted that “America’s ITAR restrictions (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) still hurt Washington’s sales in the MENA region, especially to the GCC.” It is unclear what president Donald Trump intends to do with the existing regulations governing the export of arms, although analysts expect him to loosen restrictions in favour of a home build approach. One of the key challenges facing defence suppliers in 2017 is the reduction in spending by governments in the region, hurt by low oil prices. “Our focus remains on delivering the most affordable advanced technology solutions to provide our partners with critical full spectrum capabilities to help solve some of the most difficult security challenges,” noted Harward. Karasik also cited budgetary constraints as one of the key issues in defence this year. “The MENA countries, particularly the GCC, are undergoing transformations of their economies and thus are seeking to procure the best possible deals,” Karasik said, adding that the UAE’s domestic industry has helped “offset suppliers from outside of the region.” Matthew Cochran, Chairman of Defence Services Marketing Council, agrees with this sentiment about home-grown defence suppliers. “Having more “Made in the UAE” type defence and security companies that have capabilities with export potential, like Tawazun Dynamics and NIMR, will provide for a suitable future for regional GCC allied militaries,” said Cochran. For Karasik, in 2017 the opportunities for suppliers lie in “areas of technological issues.” “While there is increasing specialisation by arms sellers, there are requirements for unmanned systems, cyber tools, and communications that continue to be in the MENA region’s highest interest,” he added. “Today, we are working together with the UAE to support everything from aerospace to outer space,” noted Harward. According to Deloitte’s report, several Middle Eastern countries spend a significant percentage of their GDP on defence costs, with Oman and Saudi Arabia being two of the top three. With $85.4 billion in military expenditure in 2015, Saudi Arabia was also the fourth largest defence spender globally. by Ed Clowes Staff Reporter Gulf News 2017. All rights reserved. © Copyright Zawya.

For several months now, Air India’s board has been taking decisions without any independent directors - apart from functional directors, the two government nominees seem to be the only voices of sanity in the board meetings since last summer, when the five independent directors retired. Whether there are corporate governance issues at Air India a la Infosys is something the experts need to ponder over. We are bringing up this point to show how Air India’s owner, the government, is going around in circles, clueless about which leaking tap to fix in its rush to keep the airline under its fold. Someone needs to tell the Modi government to stop protecting Air India from possible privatisation, stop preening about its maiden operating profit (which was a first after the merger of the two erstwhile airlines in 2015-16), control the urge to pump in yet more of taxpayers’ money into this black hole – and address the basic issues plaguing the national carrier first. If after months of back-and-forth the government is still undecided about who to nominate as independent directors on the airline’s board, is it all serious about making Air India self-sustainable? Perhaps the attempt should be to shutter the airline now, when it has shown at least one year of operational profit, instead of waiting endlessly for the bleeding behemoth to shudder and pass out. Representational imgae Here’s another grandiose plan of this government: get 19 public sector banks to convert their loan of about Rs 20,000 crore to the ailing Air India into equity. The airline has been in negotiations with these banks to take equity in lieu of their exposure. The total interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore each year for AI could be reduced by a fourth if this ambitious proposal works. The total loan on Air India’s books is Rs 46,570.35 crore so a little less than half is sought to be restructured through the Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A) scheme where banks are being asked to take equity. The only question is, should the government be forcing PSU banks – who are already over burdened with NPAs – to take on more through this S4A scheme? Why should the banks suffer for historical mismanagement of Air India? Not only this. Believe it or not, Air India also needs more fresh loans since it still has to take deliveries of six Dreamliners (Boeing 787s) and three Boeing 777 aircraft till 2017-18, orders for which were placed during the earlier mega aircraft order of 68 Boeing and 33 Airbus aircraft. Here again, the government is nudging state insurer LIC to advance fresh loans. Loans to cover existing loans, equity in lieu of loans – the entire financial restructuring plan of the airline should be scrapped. Because in case the banks oblige and take equity in this loss making airline which looks an unlikely candidate for a turnaround, they will be left with worthless paper. Ditto for LIC. Last week, Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Jayant Sinha, said at an event that the carrier’s debt needs to be reduced and its balance sheet restructured for it to turn around. He also noted for good measures that there was a need to improve customer service, strengthen corporate governance practices and put in a professional management. So when is the basic minimum corporate governance to be infused into Air India? When will it get a set of eminent men and women as independent directors? In the same speech, newspapers quoted Sinha as saying that Air India’s non-core assets needs to be put to best use, the airline needs to work on route optimisation while adding that the overall transformation of Air India, being done with a combination of steps, has started yielding results. The minister obviously knows of a miracle Air India will perform in just three months to March to show such confidence in Air India’s improved financial performance. Because till now in the nine months this fiscal, there is little indication of Air India being on the road to operational profit. The target Air India had set itself for FY17 is Rs 1,086 crore operating profit. This would require the airline to make Rs 11 crore daily operating profit in this quarter alone. When in the first nine months of the fiscal year, it made no operating profit but an operating loss of Rs 161 crore – or a daily operating loss of about Rs 58 lakh. Now, a look at some operational parameters. As per DGCA data, Air India’s combined OTP (on time performance) at four metro airports has been the worst among all major domestic airlines in each month of calendar 2016 except in October when GoAir was worse. In November, the OTP of Air India across these airports was 67.7 percent which means every third flight from these airports was delayed. Another metric – bums on seats or passenger load factor – also does not favour Air India. This denotes the number of passengers as a percentage of total number of seats on an aircraft. In five of the 11 months of 2016, Air India was the second lowest (Vistara had the least PLF among national airlines). In the remaining six months, AI was ahead of Vistara and the Jet Group by a small margin. This means competition was able to entice flyers far more than AI in most instances. This, despite AI having a hub and spoke model which ensures better domestic connectivity than other airlines which follow a point-to-point connectivity model and also the fact that on most occasions, AI was matching fares with competition. The only consolation in the 11 months of 2016 under review is that the load factor for AI did not fall below 70 percent, which means it was flying at least 7 in 10 seats full at any given time. Even in market share, the airline has had a mixed year. DGCA data show its share of the domestic market fell from 16 percent in January to 12.9 percent in November. If even after these insipid details about Air India’s financial performance, its operational bumbling and service standards fail to warn banks and they are actually forced to succumb to the S4A scheme, there will likely be more red ink on their balance sheets. The colour red already defines Air India’s balance sheet. #Air india#Corporate governance issues#Jayant sinha#Minister of state for civil aviation#Modi government#Npas#Privatisation#Public sector banks#Sustainable structuring of stressed assets Also See Bank of India posts Rs 101.72 cr profit for Q3 vs loss last year on lower provisions Budget 2017: Govt to infuse Rs 10,000 cr in PSU banks in FY18 Budget 2017-18 highlights: Arun Jaitley offers good blueprint for Bharat, not much for India Infosys backs Vishal Sikka, downplays governance concerns, rift between founders and board Top Stories Uttar Pradesh Election 2017 LIVE: Western UP records 39.43% voter turnout till 1 pm; Mayawati claims BSP will win 1st phase K Pandiarajan: Minister Who Jumped Ship to Rattle Chinnamma's Camp MSG Lion Heart 2 'review': Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh launches another surgical strike on cinema Women scientists in India: What we learnt from a year of lab-hopping across the country Meeting a financial planner for first time?

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here NEW DELHI: Boeing's new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the US defence firm's Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. "This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India," he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. "In order to support US exports, we need to better support our Indian customers," he said. 'MADE IN INDIA' DILEMMA Boeing, as well as rivals such as Europe's Airbus and Lockheed Martin of the United States, are looking to India, one of the world's largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Industry sources say US manufacturers are still uncertain how to square the "Made in India" policy with US President Donald Trump's "America First" rhetoric against locating jobs abroad. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing's Indian unit is expected to be scaled in such a way that it reflects the amount of business Boeing wins there. Lockheed Martin said this week it wanted to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understood Trump's administration might want to take a "fresh look" at the proposal. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years, including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes. Industry sources say any deal would most likely depend on Boeing agreeing to build at least part of the jets in India. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

By: Reuters | New Delhi | Published: February 10, 2017 12:36 PM “This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India,” he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. (Reuters) Boeing Co’s new Indian unit will help the company win more business from local customers and mean more employment in the South Asian country, the head of the U.S. defence firm’s Indian business said on Friday. The new legal entity, announced this week, is the fourth separate country-specific business Boeing has established after setting up similar structures in Britain, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Boeing will hire more staff, most of them locals, but also bring in specialists from overseas as it looks to win new deals and grow the $500 million a year worth of products it currently sources from India, Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar told Reuters. He declined to say how many new jobs would be created. “This is to really create the full ecosystem throughout the lifecycle for our customers in India,” he said ahead of an Indian airshow in Bengaluru next week. Kumar said that the new entity, which Boeing hopes will also grow its manufacturing presence in the country, was designed for its Indian clients rather than those overseas. “In order to support US exports, we need to better support our Indian customers,” he said. Boeing, as well as rivals like Airbus and Lockheed Martin, are looking to India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, as a future source of growth as Western countries trim defence budgets. India is expected to spend $250 billion over the next decade to modernise its armed forces, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also said that new deals must involve a share of local production to help the country grow its nascent defence industry. Lockheed Martin said this week it wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump’s administration may want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. You may also like to watch this Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the United States. Boeing has won several deals with India in recent years including a roughly $2.5 billion contract to supply its Chinook and Apache helicopters, as well as an order for its P-8I maritime spy planes. It also has a joint venture with Tata Advanced Systems in aerospace. Kumar said Boeing was studying a recent request for information issued last month by the Indian Navy for 57 multi-role fighter jets for its aircraft carriers, and analysts expect it to pitch its F/A-18 Super Hornet planes.

The technology, which improves the ability of planes to share location information, would allow for decreased spacing and improved efficiency at major airports with high traffic. (Ian Terry / The Herald) Aerospace blog NASA is testing technology to help airlines fly more efficiently Dan Catchpole Thu Feb 9th, 2017 10:00pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. MOSES LAKE — The airplane dropped down low over Central Washington. Snow-covered farming towns peeked through holes in the clouds hugging the ground. Many of them are too small to have a traffic signal. The streets are not crowded around Moses Lake. However, flight paths used by commercial jets are becoming increasingly congested — a problem expected to grow as more and more Americans travel by air. Addressing that problem is what brought researchers from NASA and Honeywell over Moses Lake and the adjacent Grant County International Airport. They are about halfway through a month of test flights for technology that promises to cut down on congestion over busy airports. “No passenger likes holding in the air. Airlines don’t like spending extra fuel waiting to land,” said Leighton Quon, a NASA researcher with the Air Traffic Management Technology Demonstration-1, which includes the software being tested over Moses Lake. The new software is part of the Federal Aviation Administration’s ambitious NextGen initiative to modernize how flights are managed in America’s skies. The test flights involve three airplanes — a business jet, Honeywell’s Boeing 757 research plane and a United Airlines 737 — making repeated practice approaches at the Grant County airport. The nimble business jet — a Dassault Falcon — leads the way, broadcasting its speed and position to the 757 and 737. Tablets in the cockpits of the two Boeing jets tell the pilots exactly how fast they should be flying and how much space to keep between the plane ahead. That allows them to fly far closer than the current system, which relies on air traffic controllers on the ground telling pilots the speeds and distances to maintain. Controllers “are on their own, eyeballs on the screen,” Quon said. They put safety ahead of efficiency. That means accidents are prevented but sometimes passengers are stuck overnight at the airport. The Air Traffic Management Technology Demonstration-1 includes the flight deck software and tools for controllers on the ground. NASA finished developing those ground-based technologies, which the FAA plans to test in the real world in 2019. NASA hopes to hand over the flight deck tool to the FAA for certification in the fall of this year. The benefit is not only for fliers in and out of New York, Los Angeles and other high-traffic areas. Congestion in those hubs ripples through airlines’ networks across the country. So, a plane stuck in a holding pattern due to bad weather around New York could cause delays and missed connections across the country. The project is expected to cost $100 million over five years. That is a drop compared to the roughly $1 billion the FAA is spending each year on NextGen. Critics have attacked the program as costing too much and delivering too little. During a meeting Thursday with airline executives, President Donald Trump said the initiative is “totally out of whack” and overpriced, according to news reports. Proponents say that bringing air traffic control into the 21st century cannot be done on the cheap, and the benefits will outweigh the costs. “Today’s flight tests demonstrate the success of NextGen technologies, which are contributing to a safer and more efficient air traffic control system,” said U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, the senior Democrat on the House’s Aviation Subcommittee. “I will continue working to ensure NextGen moves forward in a way that supports safer, faster flying throughout America’s airspace system.” The current system is still rooted in the very first way-finding aids deployed nearly a century ago, when bonfires on the ground directed mail pilots from one airfield to the next. The fires were replaced by electric lights and later became radar beacons, which pilots still use today to find their way between airports. Radar and radio made for safer and more efficient landings and takeoffs at airports. However, they still rely on air traffic controllers manually sorting and scheduling flights coming and going. Air traffic management tools and other NextGen innovations promise a more efficient system, “but that future is still far off,” said Rui Neiva, a policy analyst at the Eno Center for Transportation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. A report issued last November by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Inspector General raised concerns about the program’s ability to deliver on its promises.

The order from high-profile customer Singapore Airlines is a strong endorsement of both planes, and could lift sales in a sluggish market if other carriers follow Singapore Air's lead, analysts said. But the win over rival Airbus did not lessen two big risks Boeing faces, Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said yesterday at a conference in New York hosted by Cowen and Co. Sales of Boeing's highly profitable 777s have slowed so much that Boeing is cutting production 40 per cent this year to cope as it begins switching to the successor 777X model that Singapore Airlines ordered. “When I take a look at risk areas, filling out the 777 bridge is the area that we're focused on,” Muilenburg said, referring to the production spanning the two models. Boeing also must sell more 787s so it can proceed with plans to lift output to 14 planes a month from 12 in the next few years, Muilenburg said. That increase has looked iffy and some investors have worried Boeing would abandon it. Muilenburg said Boeing still plans to lift 787 output and currently does not envision a scenario that would require cutting 787 output below 12 a month. Boeing shares were up 0.4 per cent at US$164.42 in afternoon trading. The Singapore Airlines order is a boost for the 787 assembly line, but it does not help with slow 777 sales, since the order is for the newer 777X model. Muilenburg said the airplane market is still "very healthy" with passenger traffic growing five per cent to six per cent a year, well ahead of GDP rates. But airlines have deferred delivery of about two per cent of Boeing's backlog, double the figure Muilenburg cited in July, though well below historical averages. Boeing has already cut 777 output to seven planes a month from 8.3, and will trim it to five a month in August. Deliveries — which generate the bulk of airline payments — will actually fall to about 3.5 a month as Boeing builds 777X test planes in the next few years, he said. Even with those reductions, Boeing has to sell a few more 777s to fill out production this year and has 10 per cent of production unsold in 2018 and 2019. Those figures include the planned sale of 80 planes to Iran, including 15 Boeing 777s, Muilenburg said. Muilenburg voiced confidence that the Iran sale would go through despite the potential political and bureaucratic hurdles. “These are airplanes that support American manufacturing jobs,” he said. “The economic value to the US is real.” He also saw prospects for more US defence sales, noting “re-emerging strength” in the defense budget. And, he said Boeing's KC-46 aerial tanker for the US Air Force, which has incurred about US$2.4 billion in cost overruns, is expected to begin generating positive cash flow next year. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Boeing front-runner for Singapore Airlines’ order Trump calls on Boeing to offer quote for F-35 rival Boeing promises Trump to control costs on Air Force One Trump says Boeing’s Air Force One order should be canned Boeing names GE’s McAllister CEO of commercial airplanes unit Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Boeing was nearing an order for at least 35 wide-body aircraft from Singapore Air, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Deliveries of the jets will start as early as in the financial year ending March 2021, the carrier said, adding it also has options to buy six more of each of the two models. The new deal would provide a critical boost to two high-profile Boeing products amid a tough market for twin-aisle jets. The Chicago-based company has been working hard to land sales of its upgraded 777X family after twice announcing it would cut output of current models. The new aircraft will replace some of Singapore Air’s aging Boeing planes such as the 777-300ER, while giving the carrier’s low-cost units rights to jets not yet on the market. “Singapore is a deeply respected long-haul carrier, both in terms of brand quality and technical proficiency,” said  Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group. “It would be a fantastic endorsement.” Shares of the airline rose 1.4 percent to SGD9.94 yesterday in Singapore trading before the announcement. Singapore Air has ordered 67 of the A350-900 jets, including an ultra-long range version, as it courts business travelers with non-stop service to markets such as New York and Los Angeles. The Asian carrier’s current fleet includes 10 A350s, which Airbus says consume 25 percent less fuel than Boeing’s 777 aircraft, with 57 more on order. The airline already has 30 787-10s on order, according to Boeing’s website. Singapore Air has also reviewed a proposed, longer version of the twin-engine 777 that would carry as many as 450 passengers, a load previously handled only by four-engine jumbo jets, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Buffeted by marquee Middle Eastern peers such as Emirates and regional budget operators, the only Asian carrier to have flown the Concorde has said it will maintain vigilance over its costs. Singapore Air, following two consecutive quarters of decline in profits, said Tuesday that 2017 will be another challenging year amid “tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns.” The carrier is the launch customer for the 787-10, the first Boeing jetliner to be manufactured solely at its new North Charleston, South Carolina, campus. Deliveries are slated to begin next year. Singapore Air’s unit Scoot currently flies the carbon-composite 787-800 and 787-900 variants of the Dreamliners.

Yet the B-52 bomber could soon get a radical overhaul, making it one of America's first military planes to have a laser weapon system. Air Force bosses are experimenting with fitting external laser pods to the giant plane, allowing it to blast incoming missiles out of the sky or jam their navigation systems.  Scroll down for video  The Boeing-manufactured bomber (pictured) has been in use since 1952 and is expected to remain operating until 2040, when it'll be replaced by the Northrop Grumman's B-21. Air Force bosses are experimenting with fitting external laser pods to the giant plane, allowing it to blast incoming missiles out of the sky or jam their navigation systems. LASER WEAPONS 'COMING SOON'  Air Force bosses have boasted combat lasers will be fitted to fighters planes 'very soon' and have revealed a full scale prototype is being built. 'I believe we'll have a directed energy pod we can put on a fighter plane very soon,' Air Force General Hawk Carlisle claimed at the Air Force Association Air & Space conference last year in a presentation on what he called Fifth-Generation Warfare, according to Ars Technica. 'That day is a lot closer than I think a lot of people think it is.'    The project is part of the Air Force Research Lab's five-year plan to create power, optics and lasers to help defend large bombers such as the B-52. Air Force Chief Scientist Greg Zacharias told Scout Warrior: 'You can take out the target if you put the laser on the attacking weapon for a long enough period of time.'  The researchers say the older, larger plane cold be perfect for laser weapons, and attaching an external pod would not affect its capabilities.  Zacharias said the laser system would not be expected to work on stealthy aircraft such as F-15's or F-35's.  Lasers use extreme heat and light to burn targets without creating a large explosion. They work at very high speeds so they have an almost instant ability to destroy rapid targets and defend against enemies.  Zacharias also said that if for some reason a pilot doesn't want to destroy an incoming missile but throw it off course, lasers could jam them.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next US Army reveals smart sight that could give EVERY soldier...

The Air Force Research Laboratory has said that they aim to have a plan in place for a laser weapon program by 2023 Ground level testing for a weapon called the High Energy Laser has been taking place for the last few years at White Sand Missile Range in New Mexico, with the first airborne tests set to take place by 2021.  Air Force leaders told Scout Warrior that they plan to also integrate the lasers in large platforms such as C-17s and C-130s, and eventually on smaller jets such as the F-15.  But these laser weapons may not stick solely to aircraft platforms.  The US Navy has plans to incorporate these lasers on US naval ships to help defend ships from drones and missiles.  The lasers could also play a crucial role in defending against ballistic missiles. According to Air Force experts, one of the clearest advantages of this laser technology is that instead of carrying a limited number of missiles on an aircraft, an energy based weapon such as a laser could fire thousand of shots using one gallon of jet fuel.  BOEING B-52 FACTS AND FIGURES  First flight: 1952 Length: 159 feet, 4 inches Wingspan: 185 feet Speed: 650 mph Range: 8,800 miles without refueling Armaments: 31,500 kilograms of ordnance, which can include bombs, mines and missiles Crew: Five Inventory: 58 active, 18 reserve Cost: US$84 million Source: US Air Force  Read more: Air Force Laser Weapons to Defend B-52 Bomber - Warrior - Scout Share or comment on this article e-mail 32 shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

Business Nation & World Politics Technology AT&T tries to connect in capital where Trump has changed the game Originally published February 10, 2017 at 1:30 pm Updated February 10, 2017 at 3:36 pm AT&T has morphed from a telephone company to a media powerhouse with $164 billion in revenue and a plan to grow bigger by buying Time Warner. But Donald Trump has sharply criticized the deal, not to mention Time Warner cable channel CNN, leaving the merger’s future in doubt. Share story By Todd Shields Bloomberg News AT&T would normally expect good things when a Republican administration arrives in Washington, D.C., where the company needs permission to buy Time Warner — except the new president has already lambasted the deal. So the search goes on for friends in high places. At an evening reception near the U.S. Capitol, AT&T bathed lobbyists, lawyers, executives and lawmakers in cool blue light. To pulsing music in new studio space, partygoers sipped drinks, nibbled avocado tartare with melon carpaccio, and posed with a blonde in a slinky white gown who was promoting “Ice,” a drama available on AT&T’s DirecTV. The event, which AT&T called a “Stars & Stripes Reception,” showcased the company’s transformation from a telephone company to a media powerhouse with $164 billion in revenue. The descendant of the stodgy Ma Bell monopoly wants to accelerate its metamorphosis with one of its biggest deals ever, an $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, owner of HBO, CNN and the “Harry Potter” movies.

Just one problem: As a candidate, President Trump cited the deal as “an example of the power structure I’m fighting.” Since taking office, he’s said to have privately told people he still opposes it. Publicly he excoriates CNN for its coverage of him, and brags that he never watches. Trump will appoint officials who will vet the deal at the Justice Department. Still, AT&T presses ahead. It has mobilized its army of roughly 100 lobbyists, one of the biggest and savviest corps in D.C. where it has spent more than $213 million making its case since 1998, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a D.C.-based group that tracks money in politics. The company spent $16.4 million lobbying in 2016, second only to Boeing among U.S. companies, according to the center. Time Warner spent $2.9 million on lobbying over the same period. Then there is the avocado tartare. “All of this outreach, all of this cultivation, is ensuring you have allies,” said Meredith McGehee, strategic adviser to the Campaign Legal Center, explaining how lobbying powerhouses like AT&T get their way in D.C. “You get to know people. You invite them. You do the receptions.” Six days before the party, Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson and AT&T’s top D.C. executive, Bob Quinn, participated in one of the most coveted receptions of all. They dropped in on Trump at his New York tower. But the deal didn’t come up, the company insists. Instead they steered the conversation to something they knew their host wanted to hear about: the jobs the company provides. The theme was the same on Inauguration Day. “We employ more than 250,000 people,” the company said in a full-page ad in The Washington Post on Jan. 20. “As we testified recently before Congress, the merger will create more competition for cable TV providers, giving consumers more options and accelerating next generation wireless broadband,” said Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for the Dallas-based AT&T. Mobile HBO The soft-shoe approach comes with high stakes. Acquiring Time Warner’s content would allow AT&T to move away from dependence on slow wireless subscriber growth. It would allow it to ride a surge in demand Stephenson is sure is coming for mobile video. So far Wall Street isn’t sure he’ll succeed: Traders still are paying less for Time Warner shares than AT&T promises, even though the price has risen since the deal was announced Oct. 22. Stephenson, the CEO, said he’s confident the deal will go through because it joins companies in different businesses and leaves market shares the same in telecommunications. AT&T isn’t just ingratiating itself with the president whose appointees will decide if the deal lives or dies. It is building goodwill among lawmakers on Capitol Hill, constructing an insurance policy that may help prove Wall Street’s bears wrong. “You start to cultivate champions on the Hill, so if an antitrust action comes about you can turn to those champions and say, ‘Hey I need you to push back. I need you to write letters,’” said McGehee, of the Campaign Legal Center. Republican tilt The company’s organized giving has tilted toward Republicans, the traditional party of business interests. In the recent U.S. elections, Republican candidates got 62 percent of $2.7 million in donations to federal candidates from AT&T’s political-action committee that pools contributions from employees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the company’s lobbyist corps, Republicans outnumber Democrats roughly two-to-one among those whose partisan background could be determined, according to a Bloomberg analysis of Senate records. Firepower hasn’t always brought success for AT&T under Democratic regulation from 2009 to this January. Officials forced AT&T to abandon a $39 billion bid for smaller T-Mobile US in 2011. The FCC in 2015 proposed a $100 million fine over data speeds for wireless customers, another agency levied a $105 million penalty for faulty billing, and AT&T couldn’t stave off limits on how it uses subscribers’ data. AT&T won permission to buy satellite TV company DirecTV in 2015 after promising broadband to more homes and businesses. ‘Drain the swamp’ Even with a change to Republicans, it’s not clear all the lobbying and contributions will help with the unconventional administration of Trump, who won the White House with a populist message and a promise his personal wealth would mean he wouldn’t be beholden to lobbyists and special interests. Trump as a candidate said his administration would block the Time Warner deal because it made for “too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” The deal review is to be performed by antitrust regulators at the Justice Department, who concentrate on competition. Telecommunications deals traditionally face a parallel review by the Federal Communications Commission, which can be tougher. But AT&T and Time Warner have said they can avoid that by not transferring any of the airwaves licenses that the FCC oversees. Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes on Wednesday told investors the company is “confident the deal will be approved later this year.” Share programming? It’s possible Justice Department antitrust officials will find the combined company has significant market power to favor its own products, said Gene Kimmelman, a former antitrust official in a Democratic Justice Department. One way to resolve that is to require behavioral remedies — such as a requirement to share programming with rivals. “But the real question is, does the Justice Department even want to apply those conditions?” Kimmelman said. If not, regulators would have a choice to approve a deal they see as harmful, or simply ask a judge to block it. AT&T’s Stephenson has said the company would fight the Justice Department in court if necessary. “You may find an environment in which it’s an up-or-down, all-or-nothing, antitrust review,” Kimmelman said. That’s where a relationship with Trump can pay off. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said he’ll keep politics out of merger reviews. The administration hasn’t announced its choice for assistant attorney general for antitrust, a post that also needs Senate confirmation. The Trump team is said to be considering Joshua Wright, a law professor who promotes a laissez-faire approach to antitrust enforcement. “It comes down to the antitrust analysis,” said Matthew Cantor, a partner at Constantine Cannon LLP in New York. “If one was to judge this deal on the merits, I think it gets through.” Todd Shields Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

BENGALURU: A host of foreign companies will be wooing Indian government agencies and firms at Aero India 2017, keen to get a large piece of the marketshare in the blooming defence and aerospace sectors. From electronic warfare systems for Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas to sub-systems for the weaponised Advanced Light Helicopter, from air ambulance to precision weapon systems, companies from across the globe have booked slots in the 11th edition of Aero India. The participation of a large international contingent indicates that the hopes of the organisers to see a marked increase in business this edition compared to the previous ones, are not unfounded. Dassault, Boeing, Airbus, Saab, Lockheed Martin and Thales are among some of the international companies that will be seen at what is being touted as Asia's premier air show. United Kingdom's BAE Systems, which was recently awarded a contract by the US Department of Defence to provide 145 ultra-lightweight howitzers to the Indian Army through a foreign military sale between the Indian and US governments, said that it foresaw many other opportunities in India. BAE will bring its Eurofighter Typhoon and its Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) among other systems to Aero India 2017. India director of BAE Systems Alistair Castle said, "The Make-in-India initiative is the cornerstone of our strategy, and Aero India is an excellent platform for us to engage all our customers, and explore new partnerships, in addition to strengthening our ties with firms such as HAL and Mahindra." Dassault's Falcon 8X, which was recently certified, will debut at Aero India, while Swedish firm Saab, which has expressed interest in multiple projects including two aircraft procurement programmes, is bringing in as many as 11 products. Thales, another French firm, will offer its expertise to help expand the India's industrial defence base. "Our association with India dates back to 1953. Besides giving a boost to the Make-in-India initiative, we will also look to export from India. Events like Aero India help us further our objectives by giving us a platform to engage with all the key stakeholders, and allowing us to bring cutting-edge solutions to the Indian market," said Pascale Sourisse, Thales' senior executive vice-president for international development. Rocket systems, sonars, surveillance and fire control radars are among the technologies that Thales will showcase in Bengaluru. Airbus, which has several tie-ups with Indian firms, besides having a large presence in the country's commercial aviation sector, will have its dedicated helicopter ambulance on static display at the event. Airbus India president and managing director Pierre de Bausset said that the firm's business in India results in procurement worth $500 million (approximately Rs 3,400 crore) annually from India. The firm also provides employment to 6,000 people in the country. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Share Written by Tim Fernholz Obsession "America First" February 10, 2017 As Donald Trump lunches with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, reportedly to talk about the future of global trade, it’s worth assessing whether or not the new US president will really attempt to renegotiate an important trade pact closer to home: the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada, and Mexico. NAFTA, since it already governs a significant share of economic activity, matters much more than Trump’s decision to officially pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a not-yet-sealed deal that looked unlikely to come into force regardless of who won the US election. But shaking up NAFTA would have real effects on existing business—which is why Trump will likely prefer cosmetic changes to it over doing anything meaningful. Trump has talked tough, against Mexico specifically, about renegotiating NAFTA. But there’s plenty of reason to believe that Trump will bow to special-interest concerns supporting the pact as is. After all, when his populist priorities meet a corporation’s bottom line, the company has a tendency to win out. Exhibit A: The change of heart on subsidizing exporters Most recently, there is the example of the Export-Import Bank, a US agency that subsidizes American companies that sell abroad, largely Boeing and General Electric. Libertarians hate the bank, saying it is just corporate welfare, and were convinced that the populist president would oppose its activities. “[Trump] essentially said that he was against it,” Andy Koenig, who lobbies against the bank on behalf of a Koch Industries-funded nonprofit, told the Washington Times in December. Koenig was hopeful that Trump, once in office, would shut down the bank. But Trump has apparently found a new position. A group of lawmakers who met with the president on Feb. 9 say he’s embracing the plan to use government money to back American exporters. “Ex-Im Bank was big news, he wants to get that done,” senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, told Politico after the meeting. “He said, ‘I’ve changed my mind completely on that. I’ve seen how it functions and what it can do and we can’t compete if we don’t have a functioning Ex-Im Bank.’ Before, he thought it was different. So he’s changed and he’s 100 percent. He said, ‘You can tell everyone I said that.'” Hmm. Exhibit B: The about-face on Medicare Then consider Trump’s bluster on drug prices. Advocates for health care access have often called on Medicare, the US public health insurer, to use its market clout more aggressively to secure price cuts on medicine. On the campaign trail, Trump promised his deal-making presidency would adopt this policy to save $300 billion. “We don’t do it. Why? Because of the drug companies,” he said. But after meeting with pharmaceutical industry lobbyists at the White House during the second week of his presidency, Trump emerged to tell reporters that “I’ll oppose anything that makes it harder for smaller, younger companies to take the risk of bringing their product to a vibrantly competitive market. That includes price-fixing by the biggest dog in the market, Medicare, which is what’s happening.” At that point, the writing already had been on the wall: Trump had tapped Congressman Tom Price, a foe of using Medicare’s market power to lower prices, to run the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Medicare program. Exhibit C: Jamie Dimon’s expert advice In one of Trump’s most infamous campaign speeches, he attacked his Democratic opponent’s connection to the financial sector. “Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors,” Trump claimed. After he won the election, Trump met with a group of bankers, including Jamie Dimon, the CEO of international megabank JPMorgan Chase, and discussed the future of Dodd-Frank, the package of laws enacted in 2010 to prevent a future financial crisis. “We have some of the bankers here,” Trump told reporters afterward. “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so you’re going to tell me about it. We expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd Frank, because frankly I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can’t borrow money…they just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.” When Trump is on the campaign trail, there’s a conspiracy of international banks undermining the US. In the White House, he’s found these same bankers offer the best advice on how to tailor the laws so his friends’ businesses can get loans. The same day, Trump signed an executive order directing his Treasury secretary overhaul Dodd-Frank, with his economic advisor Gary Cohn, formerly president of Goldman Sachs, saying banks had too much capital and followed too many rules. So, when it comes to NAFTA, will Trump force America’s multinational companies to undergo costly rebuilds of their supply chains? Or will he meet with their lobbyists and CEOs and soon be singing a different tune? One clue: The White House still hasn’t notified Congress that Trump is planning to renegotiate, which would start a 90-day countdown for a new deal to receive express consideration by lawmakers. That means his promise to overhaul NAFTA in the first 100 days is as good as broken.

Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon (teamed with Kongsberg) are all expected to bid on the OTH-WS requirement, which will provide USN Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) variants and Future Frigate (FF) vessels with a responsive stand-off surface-to-surface capability to counter potential surface threats. Intended to increase the lethality and enhance the survivability of LCS/FF ships, the OTH-WS acquisition - being managed by the Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems 3.0 (PEO IWS 3.0) in NAVSEA - is firmly aligned to the surface navy's new operating concept of 'distributed lethality'.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website nine  ×   =  eighteen Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter When President Donald Trump tweets negatively about a company, the company's stock price can quickly drop. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) shareholders know this all too well, as the BA stock price dropped by 1.5% after President Trump tweeted on Dec. 6, 2016, that the company's costs were out of control. And these volatile price swings are why it's so important for investors to own Trump-proof stocks in 2017. Money Morning Director of Tech and Venture Capital Research Michael A. Robinson expects this to be a continuing trend throughout the Trump presidency. "The truth is, it's likely we can look forward to this kind of 'volatility' from here on out," Robinson said on Dec. 15. But Robinson has one stock that provides high-growth, low-stress protection from President Trump's tweets. And there's a lot to like about this stock: Over the last 12 months, this stock has climbed 43%. In comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 23.73%. This company pays its shareholders a dividend of $0.62 per share, which is a yield of 1.56%. The stock price has a one-year price target of $181.86, which is a potential profit of over 13% from where it's trading today. This stock has an average rating of "Buy," according to FactSet. "I can't imagine any mere 140 characters are going to ding it," Robinson said. But he also said it's only a matter of time before Wall Street and everyone else starts to notice this stock. Fortunately for Money Morning readers, you'll be getting ahead of the crowd on owning this top Trump-proof stock. Here's everything you need to know about the stock Robinson said will provide "stress-free upside potential." Own One of the Top Trump-Proof Stocks Now Join the conversation.

Offbeat2 Courts & Crime Education Life & Style News Pictures Sport 1 Business Sport Opinion Leisure Life&Style Culture Guides Multimedia Your Say In Focus Supersonic passenger jets set for a comeback A handful of firms working to develop economically viable jets Published: 19:22 February 10, 2017 By Samantha Masunaga   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Los Angeles: Supersonic passenger jets might make a comeback, more than a decade after the last Concorde flight. The beak-nosed, supersonic Concorde was once described by a British ambassador as the “flower of the aerospace industry.” But while the sleek plane could cut travel times in half, it was ultimately doomed by a combination of high maintenance expenses, a slower market for air travel after the September 11 attacks and high ticket prices. A round-trip flight from London to New York could cost as much as $18,260 in today’s dollars. Now, almost 14 years after the Concorde’s last flight, a handful of companies and entrepreneurs are betting that technological advances in materials and computing, as well as the boom in global business travel, could power a resurgence in economically viable supersonic passenger jets. “We’re benefiting from 50 years of progress in fundamental aerospace technology,” said Blake Scholl, chief executive of Boom Technology Inc., a Centennial, Colorado. start-up that’s aiming to build a supersonic airliner called the Boom. “Since the Concorde was developed, the amount of international business and international travel has skyrocketed. You can find a huge market.” New supersonic planes, if they get off the ground, will still be comparatively pricey. Analysts predict the technology would be best suited, at least initially, to business jets. That’s the market companies like Aerion Corp. are aiming for. The Reno, Nevada, firm, along with European aviation giant Airbus Group, has been developing the AS2, a supersonic business jet that could shoot through the air at a maximum speed of Mach 1.5, or one and a half times the speed of sound. A flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo would take about five hours, compared with almost 12 hours today. “I think its main customers would be very wealthy individuals who would look at it as the ultimate prestige aircraft,” said Ray Jaworowski, senior aerospace analyst at market research firm Forecast International, discussing supersonic jets in general. “It very much would have its own specific niche.” But breaking into the business market would require clearing other hurdles. For one, business jet operators are less concerned with speed than they are with range, cabin size and operating costs, Jaworowski said. The Boom is aiming at the larger airline market. Scholl says his company aims to build a 45-seat aircraft and says the cost to fly supersonic could eventually be the same as a business class seat on a conventional airliner. The company, which has just more than 20 employees, has received help with manufacturing and flight testing from Virgin Galactic’s Spaceship Co. Scholl has staked his claim on several advances, including a primary aircraft structure built with carbon fibre composites — like those in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s frame — which should be stronger and lighter than the aluminium exterior of the Concorde. The engines for the supersonic planes, though, won’t be all that different from those of conventional airliners. The Boom will have “medium-sized” turbo fan jet engines that have been adapted from a current commercial aircraft and will be modified by “major” engine companies that Scholl would not yet disclose. This decision, contrasting with the Concorde’s famous afterburners, will make the Boom quieter and more fuel efficient, he said. “The reason why (Concorde) prices were so high is fuel economy was poor, and there was no economy of scale,” Scholl said. “We have the technology for that today.” Scholl said he chose a modified commercial engine rather than a military-grade supersonic propulsion system because of the high emissions standards and efficiency offered by the conventional engines. And from a logistics standpoint, it would be more difficult for military-grade technology to clear export control, he said. Advances in computing power and speed are also key to developing more efficient supersonic jets. Engineers can now test prototypes through computer models and make tweaks immediately based on those results. Previously, they had to build a plane, test it in a wind tunnel and then tweak the design. “We’re now able to bottle physical features in a computer that a short decade ago were unheard of,” said Jim Ladesic, associate dean of industry relations and outreach at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s college of engineering in Florida. The idea of building faster, economic passenger planes has intrigued aerospace companies for years. In 2001, Boeing unveiled a concept called the Sonic Cruiser, which was to fly almost as fast as the speed of sound, 750 miles per hour. The company said at the time it was working with airlines to determine economic, performance and environmental needs for the concept. But oil prices were rising, and those plans were shelved just a year later as airlines ended up prioritising fuel efficiency over speed. Research on the plane’s interior was later incorporated into Boeing’s more efficient 787. Both Boeing and Airbus have since expressed interest in developing high-speed aircraft. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has noted several times that the Chicago-based company wants to advance research of hypersonic — Mach 5 or faster — technology. Boom is currently building a one-third scale model test aircraft that it says will fly for the first time by the end of this year. The actual production aircraft, which will be 60 feet long and weigh 150,000 pounds, could fly its first passengers as early as 2020, Scholl said. The company has 25 aircraft orders to date. The first 10 will go to British billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Group, and the other 15 are on hold for a European carrier that Scholl declined to name. One obstacle that may be out of plane makers’ control is the Federal Aviation Administration’s long-standing ban on supersonic flight by commercial aircraft over land, due to noise concerns about sonic booms. Boom is planning to fly only transoceanic routes to avoid the issue. But a group of industry leaders as well as Nasa and universities have helped devise new technologies over the years that could mitigate sonic booms. One of these efforts is Nasa’s Quiet Supersonic Technology X-plane project. Last year, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Co. in Palmdale, California, won a contract to complete the aircraft’s preliminary design. — Los Angeles Times   Last Concorde finds its final resting place The last Concorde to take to the skies made its first journey in more than 10 years last week — when it was towed into a new hangar at a leisurely pace on a British runway. Concorde 216 has been parked on a runway in Filton, Bristol, since its farewell flight over the city in 2003. But after 13 years languishing at the side of an airfield in Bristol, the iconic supersonic plane was towed across the airfield to an indoor hangar in preparation for it becoming the centrepiece of a new aerospace museum. The Bristol Aviation Centre, which will celebrate the city’s aviation history, is due to open this summer. A small crowd gathered to watch the jet make its latest journey — although the sound barrier remained unbroken during its 800 metre trip. It took about 20 minutes to complete the move to its new home, according to the BBC. The plane made her maiden flight on April 20, 1979 and touched down on her last flight to Filton on November 26, 2003. The new museum — built around a listed First World War hangar — will also document the city’s central role in the development of the modern aviation industry.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Infinite Horace II, the first five missions Home Featured Articles The Flare Path: Sings The Unsung By Tim Stone on February 10th, 2017 at 1:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Once I’ve typed up this sortie summary, Infinite Horace II, my latest B-17: Queen of the Skies hope chalice, will be setting off on his sixth combat mission. Unlike the original Infinite Horace, a B-17 Flying Fortress based in England and crewed by RPS writers, Infinite Horace II is a B-24 Liberator based in Southern Italy and crewed – with one exception – by foolhardy fearless Flare Path readers. The steed change was partially motivated by curiosity (I was keen to try Preston McMurray’s rigorously researched B-24 rules variant) and partially by a desire to sing the unsung. Despite being more numerous than their Boeing-designed brothers-in-arms and in many ways (range, ceiling, speed, bomb load…) more capable, Flying Boxcars have always played second fiddle to Flying Fortresses in the popular imagination. Key differences between the two types are reflected in a clutch of carefully thought-out B17QotS rule changes. The Liberator’s retracting rolltop desk-style bomb bay doors bestow benefits during bombing runs but make ditching and wheels-up landings more perilous. Weaker wings and higher stick forces mean wing root hits are more dangerous and autopilot damage is potentially more serious. The USAAF’s tendency to overburden the bomber translates into dicier take-offs. Thanks to our higher cruise speed, Shiloh, our tail-end Charlie, has an increased chance of hitting tailgaters, and because of our exceptional range, fuel leaks are slightly less worrying. The ten souls cocooned within B-24J Infinite Horace II as he droned towards the oil refineries of Fiume (Rijeka) on his maiden op were… JFS – nose turret gunner Eightball – bombardier phuzz – navigator Yours Truly – pilot JB – co-pilot bsplines – engineer unacom – radio operator/waist gunner* Lord Byte – ball gunner Rorschach617 – waist gunner Shiloh – tail gunner (Gothnak, Leafy Twigs, and Rituro are on stand-by) *Though the B-24J had two waist gun positions, only one of these was manned full-time. In the event of an attack the radio operator was expected to hurry aft and occupy the vacant position. It was a four-zone mission and trouble arrived early in the form of a determined Fw 190 attack in zone 2. Three bandits managed to slip through both our fighter picket and the fiery ticker tape parade organised by Horace’s Browning brandishers. Fortunately, apart from a nibbled port rudder and a fuel tank hit that instantly self-sealed, the Focke-Wulfs only managed to cause superficial damage. The escorts performed better when another schwarm of Fw 190s tried their luck in zone 3, but they couldn’t stop a climbing Me 109 from drilling Horace’s belly as we neared the target. Though the Axis ascender only scored one significant hit, that hit was to our bomb bay door mechanism. When Eightball attempted to open the doors at the start of the bomb run, he found they wouldn’t budge. I think it would be fair to describe the journey back to Foggia as ‘tense’. Harassed by Me 109s over the Adriatic (Shiloh came very close to opening his account. Ball gunner Lord Byte escaped death by inches when his turret was trashed) the collective sigh of relief that was let out when Infinite Horace II, still heavy with HE, touched down safely at Cerignola could have been heard in Rome. Compared to the Rijeka run, Mission 2 was a cakewalk. We watched several blazing Liberators dash themselves against the Apennines during the five-zone trip to Verona, but nestled in the middle of the formation, had a quiet time ourselves. Part of the high group, even the flak batteries ringing the cratered marshalling yard that was our target posed little danger. In the circumstances, the fact that only 20% of our payload fell where it was meant to fall, was more than a little disappointing. The bright spot of the mission occurred as we turned for home. A Zerstörer approaching from 10.30 low, danced through the twining tracer streams of JFS, Lord Byte, and Rorschach617, missed us with its own emissions, then fell to Shiloh’s Ma Deuces moments after streaking past Horace’s tail. We’d only been back a few minutes when Technical Sergeant Someoldguy set up his stepladder and began painting a small black Me 110 outline on the side of the cockpit. The Infinite Horace II story almost ended a couple of minutes into Mission 3. A post-modifier ‘1’ on table G8 sent heavily-laden Horace careering off the end of the runway at Cerignola, the lucky – bearing in mind all that fuel and HE aboard – survivor of a potentially catastrophic take-off accident. Unexpected loss of engine power? Elevator malfunction? Forgotten four-leaf clover? Flight deck wasp? The tables refused to say. Repairs were completed in time for us to join the air armada heading Rome-ward on May 3. In theory a relatively easy two-zone outing, the sky above The Eternal City was alive with Augsburg eagles by the time we turned up. Four Me 109s decided to have a shy at Horace and one attacking from 6 high had the satisfaction of seeing his shells strike aluminium. Controls cables in the tail were chafed and radio operator unacom arrived in the waist to find it pierced by unfamiliar shafts of sunlight. The excitement passed as quickly as it had come and an uneventful return leg gave Eightball and me plenty of time to reflect on another mediocre bombing display (Only 40% of our bombs were on target). Mission 5. Belgrade. Infinite Horace II is eastbound midway between Mostar and the Yugoslavian capital. His fuselage is bullet-gouged in numerous places but his crew are quietly jubilant. The reason for the high morale and the majority of the holes is the pair of crooked smoke pillars behind us. The pillars mark the terminal trajectories of two Fw 190s that underestimated the prowess of nose gunner JFS and ball gunner Lord Byte. I let the mood percolate for a few minutes before announcing over the intercom that we will be descending to 10,000 feet in order to prevent Rorschach617 from losing his extremities to frostbite (the waist heater was shot out during the attack). Everyone knows what the altitude change means. We’ll be in the flak zone come Belgrade. Cantering Mustangs do their best to keep the bandits away on the approach to the target. I’m dimly aware of discouraged Me 109s and thickening flak as we line up for the run. For a horrible moment the insanity of what we’re doing tunnels my vision and stops my breath then something, training perhaps or a sense of responsibility, kicks in and I recover. Press on. Follow Eightball’s instructions. It can’t be long now. The next few minutes are a blur. Did the flak burst hit us a split-second before Eightball released our earth shakers or a split-second after? When the unburdened Horace began rising like an elevator was Engine 3 already riddled with shrapnel and screaming? I can see JB shutting down the runaway and feathering the prop while engineer bsplines calmly assists. I can hear myself asking every member of the crew in turn for injury and damage reports. I can remember listening to the string of ‘OKs’ with mingled relief and disbelief (Shiloh doesn’t admit to his lacerated shoulder until we are halfway home). Apart from that trashed engine all of Horace’s injuries are relatively minor. Flying slivers of steel have bodkinned the nacelles of Engines 2 and 4 here and there, but bsplines can see no signs of deeper issues. Shiloh traces a new tail turret draft to a small jagged hole in the tailplane root, and Rorschach doesn’t like the look of one of the control cable conduits in the waist, but, fingers-crossed, none of these flesh wounds will prevent us getting home. Concerned P-51s watch over us as we flee Serbia. They drive off a series of bandits drawn like vultures to the straggling, slowed Horace. In zone 4 one of the predators, an Me 110, sees an opportunity and commences a curving, climbing head-on attack. Our nose guns begin to chatter as I initiate a turn (Thank goodness Horace is a B-24J rather than one of the earlier front turret-less Liberator variants).

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Once I’ve typed up this sortie summary, Infinite Horace II, my latest B-17: Queen of the Skies hope chalice, will be setting off on his sixth combat mission. Unlike the original Infinite Horace, a B-17 Flying Fortress based in England and crewed by RPS writers, Infinite Horace II is a B-24 Liberator based in Southern Italy and crewed – with one exception – by foolhardy fearless Flare Path readers. The steed change was partially motivated by curiosity (I was keen to try Preston McMurray’s rigorously researched B-24 rules variant) and partially by a desire to sing the unsung. Despite being more numerous than their Boeing-designed brothers-in-arms and in many ways (range, ceiling, speed, bomb load…) more capable, Flying Boxcars have always played second fiddle to Flying Fortresses in the popular imagination. Key differences between the two types are reflected in a clutch of carefully thought-out B17QotS rule changes. The Liberator’s retracting rolltop desk-style bomb bay doors bestow benefits during bombing runs but make ditching and wheels-up landings more perilous. Weaker wings and higher stick forces mean wing root hits are more dangerous and autopilot damage is potentially more serious. The USAAF’s tendency to overburden the bomber translates into dicier take-offs. Thanks to our higher cruise speed, Shiloh, our tail-end Charlie, has an increased chance of hitting tailgaters, and because of our exceptional range, fuel leaks are slightly less worrying. The ten souls cocooned within B-24J Infinite Horace II as he droned towards the oil refineries of Fiume (Rijeka) on his maiden op were… JFS – nose turret gunner Eightball – bombardier phuzz – navigator Yours Truly – pilot JB – co-pilot bsplines – engineer unacom – radio operator/waist gunner* Lord Byte – ball gunner Rorschach617 – waist gunner Shiloh – tail gunner (Gothnak, Leafy Twigs, and Rituro are on stand-by) *Though the B-24J had two waist gun positions, only one of these was manned full-time. In the event of an attack the radio operator was expected to hurry aft and occupy the vacant position. It was a four-zone mission and trouble arrived early in the form of a determined Fw 190 attack in zone 2. Three bandits managed to slip through both our fighter picket and the fiery ticker tape parade organised by Horace’s Browning brandishers. Fortunately, apart from a nibbled port rudder and a fuel tank hit that instantly self-sealed, the Focke-Wulfs only managed to cause superficial damage. The escorts performed better when another schwarm of Fw 190s tried their luck in zone 3, but they couldn’t stop a climbing Me 109 from drilling Horace’s belly as we neared the target. Though the Axis ascender only scored one significant hit, that hit was to our bomb bay door mechanism. When Eightball attempted to open the doors at the start of the bomb run, he found they wouldn’t budge. I think it would be fair to describe the journey back to Foggia as ‘tense’. Harassed by Me 109s over the Adriatic (Shiloh came very close to opening his account. Ball gunner Lord Byte escaped death by inches when his turret was trashed) the collective sigh of relief that was let out when Infinite Horace II, still heavy with HE, touched down safely at Cerignola could have been heard in Rome. Compared to the Rijeka run, Mission 2 was a cakewalk. We watched several blazing Liberators dash themselves against the Apennines during the five-zone trip to Verona, but nestled in the middle of the formation, had a quiet time ourselves. Part of the high group, even the flak batteries ringing the cratered marshalling yard that was our target posed little danger. In the circumstances, the fact that only 20% of our payload fell where it was meant to fall, was more than a little disappointing. The bright spot of the mission occurred as we turned for home. A Zerstörer approaching from 10.30 low, danced through the twining tracer streams of JFS, Lord Byte, and Rorschach617, missed us with its own emissions, then fell to Shiloh’s Ma Deuces moments after streaking past Horace’s tail. We’d only been back a few minutes when Technical Sergeant Someoldguy set up his stepladder and began painting a small black Me 110 outline on the side of the cockpit. The Infinite Horace II story almost ended a couple of minutes into Mission 3. A post-modifier ‘1’ on table G8 sent heavily-laden Horace careering off the end of the runway at Cerignola, the lucky – bearing in mind all that fuel and HE aboard – survivor of a potentially catastrophic take-off accident. Unexpected loss of engine power? Elevator malfunction? Forgotten four-leaf clover? Flight deck wasp? The tables refused to say. Repairs were completed in time for us to join the air armada heading Rome-ward on May 3. In theory a relatively easy two-zone outing, the sky above The Eternal City was alive with Augsburg eagles by the time we turned up. Four Me 109s decided to have a shy at Horace and one attacking from 6 high had the satisfaction of seeing his shells strike aluminium. Controls cables in the tail were chafed and radio operator unacom arrived in the waist to find it pierced by unfamiliar shafts of sunlight. The excitement passed as quickly as it had come and an uneventful return leg gave Eightball and me plenty of time to reflect on another mediocre bombing display (Only 40% of our bombs were on target). Mission 5. Belgrade. Infinite Horace II is eastbound midway between Mostar and the Yugoslavian capital. His fuselage is bullet-gouged in numerous places but his crew are quietly jubilant. The reason for the high morale and the majority of the holes is the pair of crooked smoke pillars behind us. The pillars mark the terminal trajectories of two Fw 190s that underestimated the prowess of nose gunner JFS and ball gunner Lord Byte. I let the mood percolate for a few minutes before announcing over the intercom that we will be descending to 10,000 feet in order to prevent Rorschach617 from losing his extremities to frostbite (the waist heater was shot out during the attack). Everyone knows what the altitude change means. We’ll be in the flak zone come Belgrade. Cantering Mustangs do their best to keep the bandits away on the approach to the target. I’m dimly aware of discouraged Me 109s and thickening flak as we line up for the run. For a horrible moment the insanity of what we’re doing tunnels my vision and stops my breath then something, training perhaps or a sense of responsibility, kicks in and I recover. Press on. Follow Eightball’s instructions. It can’t be long now. The next few minutes are a blur. Did the flak burst hit us a split-second before Eightball released our earth shakers or a split-second after? When the unburdened Horace began rising like an elevator was Engine 3 already riddled with shrapnel and screaming? I can see JB shutting down the runaway and feathering the prop while engineer bsplines calmly assists. I can hear myself asking every member of the crew in turn for injury and damage reports. I can remember listening to the string of ‘OKs’ with mingled relief and disbelief (Shiloh doesn’t admit to his lacerated shoulder until we are halfway home). Apart from that trashed engine all of Horace’s injuries are relatively minor. Flying slivers of steel have bodkinned the nacelles of Engines 2 and 4 here and there, but bsplines can see no signs of deeper issues. Shiloh traces a new tail turret draft to a small jagged hole in the tailplane root, and Rorschach doesn’t like the look of one of the control cable conduits in the waist, but, fingers-crossed, none of these flesh wounds will prevent us getting home. Concerned P-51s watch over us as we flee Serbia. They drive off a series of bandits drawn like vultures to the straggling, slowed Horace. In zone 4 one of the predators, an Me 110, sees an opportunity and commences a curving, climbing head-on attack. Our nose guns begin to chatter as I initiate a turn (Thank goodness Horace is a B-24J rather than one of the earlier front turret-less Liberator variants). Lord Byte’s ball turret Brownings join the chorus. Tadpoles of red fire rush past the windscreen. That evening in the mess, using an empty beer bottle to represent our ship and a smouldering Diamond Joe cigar to represent the doomed Zerstörer, Lord Byte and JFS demonstrate to a small but rapt audience how Infinite Horace II achieved her fourth kill. Behind them Eightball, Rorschach617, bsplines and phuzz noisily punish pool balls while Shiloh and unacom brainstorm some new aspect of their fiendishly complicated dice-based baseball simulation (they’ve been rerunning the 1940 World Series since we arrived in Italy). JB? Amazingly, considering the hubbub, he’s dozing in the armchair next to mine, a battered copy of Moby Dick open in his lap. The room is as relaxed and cheerful as I’ve ever seen it. I guess I’m the only one that knows we’re going to Ploesti tomorrow. *       *       *   This way to the foxer Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit From this site Overwatch Character Guide DOOM’s Best SnapMaps Civilization VI Is Exciting & Aggressive Warcraft: The Beginning review The Witcher 3: Blood And Wine review Overwatch review Article Continues Below Article Continues Below Article Continues Below Article Continues Below Article Continues Below 14 Comments 10/02/2017 at 13:16 Eightball says: Oh boy, I’m really letting the side down here. :x Log in to Reply 10/02/2017 at 13:20 Treners says: While a lot of flare path articles go over my head a bit, I must say I’m loving these AARs.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Book a domestic flight on any of the Big Three U.S. airlines, and you won't be sure whether the seat in front of you has a screen. Some do, while most don't. Eventually, perhaps none will. The proliferation of iPhones, iPads and Android devices, in tandem with increasingly reliable in-flight Wi-Fi, has led to a profound shift by many airlines, which now view entertainment on shorter flights as best delivered wirelessly, without the expense or hassles posed by screens. As with most things on an airplane, the determining factor is weight. Planting a screen in each seat adds pounds, which burns additional fuel. On top of that, the screens have a tendency to break as people poke and punch them — often to the annoyance of the passenger in front of them. Today, the new kid on the block for in-flight entertainment, or IFE, is personal-device entertainment — the ability to stream TV and movies to passenger gadgets from a server on the plane. This video is typically free, although United still charges as much as $7.99 to watch live television channels on planes equipped with DirecTV. "For domestic flights, I really do see the industry trending toward streaming IFE," said Jason Rabinowitz, director of airline research at Routehappy. "It's cheap for airlines to install, there's no wiring, no weight penalty. These systems can be installed virtually overnight, and the costs to maintain these things are virtually nothing." Avoiding obsolescence The airlines ask: Why install seatback monitors that will be obsolete in a few years? Only two national U.S. airlines, JetBlue Airways and Virgin America (neither of which serves Minneapolis-St. Paul), still have seatback screens on all of their aircraft. The rest have a mix of both options. Southwest Airlines deployed streaming content in 2009 and has never purchased a seat with a video screen. "What we really wanted to do was stay away from the seat screen, even back then," said Tara Bamburg, Southwest's manager of mobility, in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi. "We foresaw as much as anyone could that customers are going to continue to travel with their devices." The largest carrier, American Airlines, surprised many in the industry when it recently decided to forgo video screens on 100 new Boeing 737 Max airplanes. American said more than 90 percent of its customers carry a device when they fly, so it just made sense. American also hinted that its future single-aisle aircraft will omit video screens, even though it has 40 Airbus A321s and 737s already in the pipeline that will still have them. "Those phones and tablets are continually upgraded, they're easy to use, and most importantly they are the technology that our customers have chosen," the airline said in an internal note. "So it makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years." And before you even ask, yes: Airlines are also rushing to add power outlets at each seat. American said half of its domestic planes will be so equipped by the end of next year, rising to more than 85 percent by 2021. The juice will be critical as people spend more time surfing, watching movies or both — either on the same device or multiple devices. That sort of terrestrial behavior is rapidly migrating onto airplanes, said Jamie Perry, JetBlue's vice president of marketing. "I watched a basketball game on the screen while doing some work on my laptop while listening to music on my phone," Perry said, describing his routine on a recent JetBlue flight. The airline has said it regularly sees more devices connected to its satellite-based ViaSat Wi-Fi service than the number of passengers on some flights. In June, American selected ViaSat for broadband Wi-Fi on the screenless 737 Max airplanes. Perry said there are 10 to 12 major annual events, such as the Super Bowl or Academy Awards, that make live television "vital" for people who are flying. "There is destination TV, and it doesn't matter how many Hollywood movies you have," he said. Delta hangs on Among the legacy carriers, Delta Air Lines has been the largest champion of domestic video screens, including those it is putting on its new Airbus A321s and Boeing 737-900ERs. But the airline has declined to add screens on shorter-haul MD-80s, MD-90s and Boeing 717s. It hasn't decided if its new Bombardier CS100s will be equipped with video screens when those begin arriving next year, spokeswoman Catherine Sirna said in an e-mail. "Delta is choosing to invest in seatback entertainment in addition to the ability to access content via mobile devices onboard while competitors remove options," she wrote. United Continental Holdings has seatback video on 221 older Boeing 737s and two dozen 757s, about one-third of its mainline fleet. All of its new planes being flown domestically, including the 737-900ER, skip screens in favor of streaming. "We're just seeing the way customers are traveling, and they prefer to use their phone, they prefer to use their iPads, they prefer to use their laptops," United spokesman Jonathan Guerin said. For the long-haul warriors worried about their next 15-hour flight to Hong Kong, calm down: Contrary to domestic flying, international fleets retain seat screens as a staple, due to longer flights. Meal service requires the tray space on which your device often sits and many airlines consider their customized video offerings an integral part of their passenger experience. So leave the spare charger at home.

By VictorReklaitis Markets writer The stock market is showing no signs of quitting this morning, after yesterday’s trifecta of record closes. What to do now? “If you are not already in the market, wait for a better trade,” suggests CrackedMarket’s Jani Ziedins. This is a place to take profits rather than initiate new longs, with so much optimism priced in since Election Day, he says. Yet it’s also “far too dangerous to short for no other reason than ‘we are due for a pullback.’” Another option is placing a few unconventional bets, and RBC analysts are aiming to provide exactly that. The bank’s global equity team has highlighted 26 stocks “where we believe our analysts’ investment conclusions are distinguished from the conventional view.” Their 26 mavericky picks serve as our call of the day, and they’re listed in the RBC table below. Netflix NFLX, +0.47%  , Yelp YELP, -13.64%  , Whole Foods WFM, -0.03%  , Dow Chemical DOW, +1.54% and Air Lease AL, +1.27%  are among the stocks that the analysts view as underappreciated. American Express AXP, +0.38%  , Boeing BA, +1.19%  and Dish Network DISH, +0.13%  are among the names where the consensus isn’t bearish enough, according to RBC’s team. The general take on Netflix and Yelp is that both companies have limited growth prospects, the analysts say. But RBC sees more big gains for the on-demand video giant, thanks to the ongoing shift away from appointment-based TV watching. “The cut-to-the-chase conclusion is that we see Netflix amassing a more than 160MM global subscriber base in 2020,” the analysts write in a note (up from 94 million). For Yelp, they see the online reviews provider “morphing from a local marketing platform to a local marketing AND transactions platform.” Among the possible stocks to short, AmEx has only two ways to go — “neither supporting upside to shares,” the analysts say. The credit-card company can either keep up its marketing spending and miss its profit targets, or it can cut spending and lose market share. RBC Key market gauges Futures for the Dow YMH7, +0.43%  , S&P 500 ESH7, +0.39%  and Nasdaq-100 NQH7, +0.29%  are edging higher. That’s after the Dow DJIA, +0.48%  , S&P SPX, +0.36% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.33% simultaneously scored record closes yesterday, something they last did about two weeks ago. Gold GCH7, -0.14%  is losing ground but still higher for the week. Oil CLH7, +1.60%  is gaining as OPEC output cuts achieve record 90% compliance. See the Market Snapshot column for the latest action. The chart Evan Medeiros Twitter TWTR, -5.06%  tanked after earnings yesterday, but newsletter writer Evan Medeiros has shared the chart above showing where it really could get ugly for the stock. “The line in the sand for Twitter’s stock is clear,” he writes, flagging the $16 level. Speaking of newsletter writers, they are turning disturbingly chipper, as suggested by the bonus chart below that Schwab strategist Liz Ann Sonders has highlighted.

Sears SHLD, +25.63%  bulls (there must be some left) are having their moment, as the ailing retailer’s stock soars 38% premarket after restructuring news. High flyer Nvidia NVDA, -2.37%  is also up after its quarterly report, while Pandora P, +1.82%  looks on track for a down day following disappointing guidance. Mead Johnson Nutrition MJN, +5.62%  is another big premarket winner as the U.K.’s Reckitt Benckiser RB., -2.96%  confirmed it plans to gobble up the baby-food maker in an $18 billion deal. Some of today’s President Trump-related news: He might play nice with Japan’s Shinzo Abe, and the White House is trying to plug leaks after details of a call with Vladimir Putin were released. There is also fresh buzz about national security adviser Michael Flynn possibly discussing Obama’s hacking sanctions with a Russian official. Plus, the president called China’s Xi Jinping and affirmed the “One China” policy. Other China headlines today cover an “unsafe” Sino-American encounter between military aircraft over the South China Sea, as well as Chinese exports topping forecasts.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News BUDGET 2017 Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy Saab offers to manufacture, export Gripen E under Make in India Our Bureau comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet New Delhi, Feb 10:   Apart from its plan to produce the mighty Gripen E fighter jet in India, Swedish defence giant Saab Group also has designs to transform it into a global manufacturing export hub as per the Defence Ministry’s requirements. Saab is already producing camouflage equipment in Gurugram and has set up a research and development (R&D) centre in Hyderabad. It also has a joint venture with Tech Mahindra in Belgaum for providing parts to Airbus and Boeing. “Saab is actually planning to go beyond Make in India. We want to make India a net exporter and provide indigenous capability to the Indian Air Force,” Kent-Ake Molin, Commercial Manager at Saab, said here on Friday. Saab is betting big on India keeping in mind the need of the Indian Air Force to modernise its aging fleet. As a result, the company is eyeing to grab a deal from the IAF for 200 single-engine jet fighters. The Ministry of Defence had floated RFIs in October last year for single-jet fighter planes to be manufactured in India. As a result, the Defence Ministry had sent out letters to three leading companies, out of which Saab was one. Saab could clear the first round. However, the government is also keen that apart from setting up their assembly lines here, the selected company should also seek to sell those aircraft from India. “We are working on the next level of requirement,” he said. Saab is facing a stiff competition with US’ Lockheed Martin that has offered to make its latest version of F-16s in India by shifting the entire assembly line out from US and putting it up here in India. “We have mobilised a robust global supply chain for India. We are not doing a copy and paste of our Sweden’s facility here. The facility we set up here will be new,” Molin highlighted. But he said the manufacturing unit will come up in India only if they are able to win the government’s programme. The company is also prepared to offer all the variants of Gripen to India – Gripen E (single seat), Gripen F (two seat) and Gripen M (maritime).

President Trump added to a string of presidential firsts on Wednesday, and drew fire from ethics lawyers, with a Twitter attack on Nordstrom. The Seattle-based retailer stoked Trump's rage by dropping his daughter Ivanka's clothing and accessory line. The implication, intended or not: Hurt my daughter's business, and the Oval Office will come after you. "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom," the president tweeted. "She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!" The government-led cheerleading for Ivanka Trump's private enterprise didn't end there. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, in an interview Thursday with Fox News from the White House briefing room, encouraged people to "go buy Ivanka's stuff." She boasted that she was giving the brand "a free commercial here." While Trump himself is not subject to the standards of ethical conduct for federal employees, Conway is. Among the rules: An employee shall not use his or her office "for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise." Ivanka Trump does not have a specific role in the White House but moved to Washington with her husband, who is one of Trump's closest advisers. She followed her father's approach on business ties by handing over operating control of her fashion company but retaining ownership of it. Though Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors, ethics experts say this time was different. It involved his daughter's business, which raises conflict-of-interest concerns. White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter" when he posted the tweet and that "he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." The Ivanka Trump flare-up follows revelations that first lady Melania Trump expected to develop "multi-million dollar business relationships" tied to her presence in the White House, according to a lawsuit she filed on Monday. Ethics experts have criticized Trump's plan to separate himself from his sprawling real estate business by handing managerial control to his two adult sons. The experts want him to sell his company. Most modern presidents have sold their financial holdings and put the cash raised in a blind trust whose investments remained unknown to them. Kathleen Clark, a government ethics expert, said the Nordstrom tweet is problematic because other retailers may think twice now about dropping the Ivanka Trump brand for fear of getting criticized publicly by the president. She said it was especially disturbing that Trump retweeted his message on the official White House account. "The implicit threat was that he will use whatever authority he has to retaliate against Nordstrom, or anyone who crosses his interest," said Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. Clark defended the president's right to use his personal Twitter account to express his views, however. She noted that government workers recently set up alt-EPA accounts to criticize the president's policies. "A government employee, even a president, is allowed to tweet in his personal capacity." One of the president's fiercest ethics critics, Norman Eisen, described the tweet differently — a "bullying" tactic beneath the dignity of the president's office. "This is a shot across the bow to everybody who is doing business with Trump or his family," said Eisen, who was President Barack Obama's chief ethics counselor. "It's warning them: Don't withdraw their business." Eisen joined with other legal scholars and lawyers to sue the president last month for allegedly violating a clause in the Constitution that prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments. Though other legal scholars disagree, Eisen said such payments include foreign diplomats staying at Trump's new Washington D.C. hotel and holding events there and at the other Trump venues. Trump and his top aides have repeatedly said that Americans do not care about what Eisen and other ethics critics say. "Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world," Trump wrote on Twitter Nov. 21. Two surveys released in January show that's not entirely the case. A Quinnipiac University poll found that about 60 percent of registered voters were at least somewhat concerned that the president would "veto a law that would be good for the country because it would hurt his business interests." And a Pew Research Center poll found that 57 percent of American adults were at least somewhat concerned that Trump's businesses could "conflict with his ability to serve the country's best interests." Yet Trump seems to have calculated that his base of supporters forgives — and maybe even encourages — his protective bluster about his family businesses. Nordstrom reiterated Wednesday that its decision was based on the brand's performance, not politics. The company said sales of Ivanka Trump items had steadily declined over the past year, particularly in the last half of 2016, "to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now." Retailers drop brands all the time because of poor performance, said brand consultant Allen Adamson. But given a highly charged political environment, perception is reality for loyal Trump fans. "It is clearly hard for Nordstrom to tell the story that it is dropping (the brand) for business reasons," said Adamson, founder of the firm Brand Simple.

(Dan Bates / The Herald) Super Kid Super Kid Monroe homeschooler sharpens his skills in metals classes Melissa Slager Mon Feb 6th, 2017 1:30am News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Johan West, a homeschool student from Monroe, came to Sno-Isle TECH Skills Center for his senior year to take metals classes and has quickly made his mark as one of the program’s top welders. The 17-year-old gave us a tour of the shop and answered some questions. Question: So what brought you here? Answer: I really liked metalwork my whole life, and welding seemed like a good fit. Q: What kind of metalwork have you done? A: I like making knives. Q: How do you do that? A: You buy a lot of machinery that’s really expensive and watch a lot of YouTube videos. And talk to a lot of other knife makers. … A lot of (the knives I make) are hunting and skinning knives. I like the older style ones, with the nice bone or rosewood handles. They have a nice shine and quality to them. Q: So you hunt? A: Yes. I hunt deer, ducks — a lot of things, but those are mainly it. I started hunting when I was 11. That’s when I shot my first deer. Q: And making knives? A: I started playing around with that when I was 8. … It basically started with my grandpa. He was a Boeing machinist. He taught me how to weld, and it started from there. Q: What is it that you like about working with metal in this way? A: It’s creating something — out of a pile of basically scraps — to make something new and useful. Q: So what skills are you adding here at Sno-Isle TECH? A: A lot of welding skills, different types of welding. I’m learning how to fit pipe a little better. … I feel comfortable on all the machines. I know how to work all the machines, so it’s really nice. Q: What projects have you got going on? A: At Sno-Isle, I’m playing around with welding aluminum, which is tricky. At home, I’m building my own shop, so I’m not doing too much at home right now. Q: What’s next for you? A: I hope to go into the welding field and then own my own business as a welder and custom design shop. I might go to Everett Community College, but … I hope to go straight from here into business. Q: You’ve been homeschooled since kindergarten. What’s it like? A: It gives me a lot of freedom. Basically I can get my work done at my own schedule and have time for other things. Q: What else do you do in your free time? A: I like to go fishing with my brother. That’s always fun. We do a lot of things as a family. Q: Do you have any advice for a teen just starting high school, whether it’s a regular or nontraditional approach? A: Definitely go to a trade school. You can still go to college, but if you don’t like college then you at least have a trade to fall back on. It gives you satisfaction to be able to do something with your hands.

X Ryanair looks to tie down deals to expand short-haul dominance O’Leary says when Boeing and Airbus have low-cost, long-haul aircraft ‘we’ll jump on it’ about 17 hours ago Ryanair deals would see passengers book flights to their end destination via the long-haul carriers’ websites but fly European sectors on Ryanair’s jets. Photograph: iStock         Ryanair is closing in on agreements that could see it take control of an even bigger swathe of European short-haul travel. The Dublin-based company is seeking deals with carriers including Norwegian Air Shuttle, Aer Lingus, Alitalia and Deutsche Lufthansa under which its flights would help feed passengers onto their long-haul services. Ryanair would be open to adding frequencies in order to provide sufficient connectivity, and could ultimately replace many short-haul services operated by network carriers, encouraging them to focus exclusively on intercontinental routes, chief executive Michael O’Leary said in an interview. Mr O’Leary cites Aer Lingus’s short-haul business in Dublin to illustrate how the feeder plan would work.The carriers compete directly on 28 services, he said, and while Ryanair would not seek to take over “trunk routes” a deal would allow the IAG unit to forgo unprofitable peripheral operations while connecting to the 85 destinations offered by its discount rival, including Birmingham and Edinburgh. The CEO said he has offered a similar arrangement to Alitalia on routes from Rome and Milan. “The upside for us is in persuading the legacy carriers to stop trying to compete with us on short-haul because it feeds their long-haul,” he said. “Work with us on short-haul, you lose less money, I’ll have less competition.” Brexit not clouding Ryanair’s long-term thinking Ryanair forecasts full-year profits of about €1.325bn Ryanair set to buy further 100 Boeing 737 Max aircraft Summer timetable Ryanair is seeking to seal accords in time for its summer timetable, with the arrangements likely to see passengers book flights to their end destination via the long-haul carriers’ websites but fly European sectors on Ryanair’s jets. Baggage would be transferred automatically, though the agreements are likely to stop short of code-share terms in which airlines sell tickets on each other’s flights as if they were their own. “There’s nothing but upside for the legacy carriers in this except you’ve got to persuade them it’s not some scam,” Mr O’Leary said in Brussels after a meeting of the A4E airline lobby group. ADVERTISEMENT European airlines are grappling with shrinking margins after the low oil price prompted a capacity splurge that has sent ticket prices tumbling. Ryanair said this week that its fares have slumped 16 per cent this winter, and are set to continue falling, making it even tougher for full-service carriers to turn a profit on marginal routes. Of his feed plan, Mr O’Leary said: “It’s a demonstration of how we can feed a legacy carrier. If we can do it in Dublin, why can’t we do it in Italy, why can’t we ultimately do it in Germany with Lufthansa? This is absolutely the way forward for the industry.” Feeder deals With Ryanair aiming to carry 200 million passengers by 2025, up from 117 million last year, Mr O’Leary said that at least 10 per cent of the total, or 20 million clients, were likely to derive from feeder deals. He said his airline has not completely given up on offering long-haul flights of its own, while reiterating that the plan was not high on his list of priorities given the record order backlogs at plane-makers Boeing and Airbus Group. “When Boeing and Airbus have 80 or 100 spare slots for long-haul aircraft that they desperately want to shift at a low cost, we’ll jump on it. But we’re not going to kill ourselves at the moment when their order books are full out to 2020-2021.” Ryanair has also been concerned about American opposition to low-cost flights into the US operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle, Mr O’Leary said, while adding that the Scandinavian carrier now appeared to have established key principles that other airlines could benefit from. Ryanair is separately offering partners the ability to sell tickets via its own web portal as the chief executive looks to boost the company’s online presence and make it what he calls “the Amazon of travel”. – Bloomberg       Topics: Michael O Leary Aer Lingus A4e Airbus Alitalia Bloomberg Boeing Deutsche Lufthansa Iag Lufthansa Norwegian Air Norwegian Air Shuttle Ryanair Birmingham(US.AL) Brussels Dublin(IE) Edinburgh Germany Italy Milano Roma United States Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy No crisis on Greece bailout deal, says euro zone finance chief Work Doing business in China: Meet face to face and mind your Ps and Qs International 1:51 Ireland ready for relaunch as Italy brace for backlash Ireland Wellness weekend at Ashford Castle: more ‘treat’ than ‘retreat’ Sponsored Why a flagging libido doesn’t have to be part of your menopause experience Why buying into the Jaguar lifestyle has never been more affordable WebPort Global speeds up exports for Irish SMEs Suites for my sweet: 10 Irish getaways for Valentine’s ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Image Credit: NASA/MSFC This European space and technology group, MT Aerospace AG, has received additional contracts by the US space technology group, Boeing. The latest contract involves additional development work on the Space Launch System (SLS). Commissioned by the US space agency NASA, SLS is the most powerful super heavy lift launch vehicle to date and will be used on manned and unmanned missions to the moon, Mars and the depths of outer space. MT Aerospace has been developing and fabricating large aluminum segments for the propellant tanks fitted to the SLS main stage since mid- 2013. With a diameter of 8.4 meters and a length of some 65 meters, these tanks hold almost 900 tons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen and are 30 percent larger than the external tank formerly attached to the Space Shuttle.  MT Aerospace AG, a member of the European space and technology group OHB SE (ISIN: DE0005936124, Prime Standard).  http://www.mt-aerospace.de  http://nasa.gov   Topical Tags :  Agencies    Regulatory/Government    Launch    Business Moves    Service Provider      Regional Tags :  Europe    North America                 FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News Israel Aerospace Industries Unveils Export Version of Heron TP SSL Selected by DARPA to Develop a Sort of Space Service Station for Satellites...

Mary Ruth Jacobson 1932 - 2017 Obituary Condolences Flowers Mary Ruth Jacobson July 20, 1932 - February 8, 2017 Visalia Mary Ruth Jacobson was born in Watertown, Wisconsin on July 20, 1932. The oldest of nine children, Mary took to caring for others from a young age. She pursued this passion and graduated from Milwaukee County Hospital School of Nursing in 1953. While in nursing school Mary met Richard "Dick" Jacobson and the two married in Fort Atkinson, WI in 1954. They followed Dick's career with McDonald Douglas (Boeing) to St Louis, MO where Dick worked as an aeronautic engineer and Mary worked as a floor nurse at Deaconess Hospital. While in St Louis, their family grew with a son Brian and daughter Debra. Dick's job took them to the arid dessert of Lancaster, CA where Mary continued her career working at Antelope Valley Hospital and their family grew with the addition of two more daughters, Laura and Sharon. In 1969 the family relocated back to St. Louis and Mary went to work as a school nurse for the Hazelwood School District. Dick and Mary longed to get back to sunny California so they relocated one more time to Visalia in 1980. Mary worked for about 20 years for Tulare County Health Department in the TB clinic, finally retiring in 1999 to pursue her many hobbies and varied interests. From zip-lining in Costa Rica to touring the pyramids in Egypt, Mary had a passion for traveling and her adventures took her all around the world. She was often joined on these trips by her siblings and close friends. Mary had a passion for the arts and she was extraordinarily talented at everything she did from decorating cakes to quilting. She often frequented the symphony and plays, and was an avid painter. Her favorite subjects to paint were scenic images from her travels and her grandchildren. After a short illness, Mary passed away on February 8, 2017. She was preceded in death by her husband Richard, her son Brian (Dana) Jacobson, brother Phillip (Katie) Reuteler, and sister Joanne Reuteler. She is survived by daughters Debra (John) Meyer, Laura (Jeff) Botich, and Sharon (David) Calender, her nine grandchildren Danny (Sarah) Meyer, Erin Meyer, Andy Jacobson, Samantha (Brian) Weimann, Kaily Botich, Tarah Botich, Joel Calender, Jacob Calender, and Jenay Calender, and two great-grandsons Lucas Meyer and Jacob Wiemann. She is also survived by her siblings Jim (Barbara) Reuteler, Sue (John) Behling, Nancy Reuteler, Carol (Bill) McCool, Pat (Bert) Duncan, and Jeanne (Al) Werth. Visitation will be held at the Salser & Dillard Funeral Chapel, Visalia, on February 10, 2017 from 4:00 to 7:00 pm. A celebration of Mary's life will be held on February 11, 2017 at 11:00 am at Christ Lutheran Church, Visalia, where Mary was an active member in the church community for over 35 years.

Sanjeev MiglaniMike Stone Lockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Photo: Bloomberg New Delhi/Washington: US defence firm Lockheed Martin wants to push ahead with plans to move production of its F-16 combat jets to India, but understands President Donald Trump’s administration may want to take a “fresh look” at the proposal. With no more orders for the F-16 from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. Lockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the US. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States. In Lockheed’s case, however, the plan is to build the F-16 to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump’s transition and governance teams as well as the US Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington. “We’ve briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India,” the spokesman said. “We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programs, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with US policy priorities.” India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16 in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. A person close to Lockheed said company officials did not know what the Trump administration planned to do about the proposal to shift F-16 production to India. “They’re following it closely and talking with the White House. But if they don’t move production to India, there’s no way they’ll get the India contract,” the person said. One argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. “Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing,” the person said. No threat to US jobs Lockheed has said that moving F-16 assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16 would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. “We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India,” Randall L. Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India’s biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB’s Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian Air Force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Negotiating arms contracts with India can take years, and industry officials said there was no guarantee Lockheed would win the contract even if it moves production to India. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with US arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long-term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed’s executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. “We want to be prepared, that’s why we started the ground work,” he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India’s Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. “The capability for building components exists here, it’s been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners,” Paranjape said.

AFP In Lockheed's case, however, the plan is to build the F-16 to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump's transition and governance teams as well as the US Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington. "We've briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India," the spokesman said. "We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programmes, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with US policy priorities. "India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16 in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. A person close to Lockheed said company officials did not know what the Trump administration planned to do about the proposal to shift F-16 production to India. "They're following it closely and talking with the White House. But if they don't move production to India, there's no way they'll get the India contract," the person said. One argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. "Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing," the person said. No threat to US jobs Lockheed has said that moving F-16 assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16 would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. "We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India," Randall L Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India's biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB's Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-In-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian Air Force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Negotiating arms contracts with India can take years, and industry officials said there was no guarantee Lockheed would win the contract even if it moves production to India. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with US arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long-term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed's executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. "We want to be prepared, that's why we started the ground work," he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. "The capability for building components exists here, it's been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners," Paranjape said. #Bengaluru#C-130j super hercules#Defence deal#Donald trump#F-16#F-16 block-70#F-35#Gripen#Indianairforce#Lockheed martin#Make in india#Modernisation#Narendra modi#Newstracker#Randall l howard#Reuters#Saab#Tata advanced systems#United states#Us congress Also See Pakistan bans Hafiz Saeed and 38 others from travelling, protests escalate Donald Trump is America's problem, but India's opportunity Rafale deal: Air Force declines RTI plea on releasing details on grounds of confidentiality Trump's 'America First' policy could challenge Modi's 'Make in India' vision: Chinese media Top Stories Uttar Pradesh Election 2017 LIVE: Western UP records 39.43% voter turnout till 1 pm; Mayawati claims BSP will win 1st phase K Pandiarajan: Minister Who Jumped Ship to Rattle Chinnamma's Camp MSG Lion Heart 2 'review': Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh launches another surgical strike on cinema Women scientists in India: What we learnt from a year of lab-hopping across the country Meeting a financial planner for first time?

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) comments WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin’s deal to sell a new round of F-35s at a reduced cost to the Pentagon had little to do with President Donald Trump despite the commander in chief’s boasts to the contrary. The company, one of the largest employers in Fort Worth, Texas, had planned for months to sell the fighter jets for under $100 million apiece, and both supporters and detractors of the most expensive weapons program in the nation’s history say Trump has done little to mitigate costs beyond public statements and social media posts. Trump, who loves to riff about cajoling Fortune 500 CEO’s into doing his bidding, has now positioned himself as the savior of the F-35 fighter jet program run by Lockheed, a past Twitter target. “I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that,” Trump said Monday at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. “And I want to thank Lockheed Martin. And I want to thank Boeing. And I want to thank all of the companies that have really opened up. Opened up and cut their prices.” But in reality the F-35 is years removed from a half decade of the well-publicized cost overruns in the mid 2000s. “Some people call it alternative facts, I call it just flat-out exaggeration,” said Rep. Marc Veasey, a Texas Democrat who supports the F-35 program. “These cuts were already set to be put in place before Donald Trump even became president, and people have been talking about the costs of the F-35 for quite some time,” Veasey said. “The only thing Donald Trump did was spread fear and uncertainty through Fort Worth and cost the company billions of dollars when he made the stock prices go down.” Just days before the November 2016 election, the Pentagon issued a $6.1 billion “unilateral” contract for 57 of the F-35 aircraft, an agreement that locked in Lockheed’s profit margin for a portion of the massive program. Lockheed disagreed with that decision because the government was able to set Lockheed’s margins without the company’s consent. That November contract decreased the cost per plane by 3.7 percent to just over $107 million per plane. “The atrocity is not that he’s (Trump) taking credit for numbers already on paper, it’s that he’s taking credit for people who did really hard work that he would like to fire,” said Richard Aboulafia, a military aircraft analyst with Teal Group, a Northern Virginia based aeronautics analysis firm. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. The recent $600 million cuts to the latest F-35 contract inked by Lockheed are a product of increased orders for the planes, meaning that more demand drives down the unit cost per aircraft, and the cuts have been anticipated for years as Lockheed ramps up production. The planes aren’t just being delivered to the United States. Israel received its first shipment of F-35s in December 2016, and 11 countries are involved in building and testing the aircraft. Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, who heads the F-35 Joint Program Office at the Pentagon, said in December to Breaking Defense before the cuts were announced and Trump took office that he expected the newest order for planes “to come down in price significantly … probably somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent.” The announced $600 million cuts fall in the 6- to 7-percent ballpark Bogdan predicted in December. Lockheed is playing ball with Trump’s recent declarations, saying in a statement last week that “President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price. The agreement was reached in a matter of weeks and represents significant savings over previous contracts. This is a good deal for the American taxpayer, our country, our company and our suppliers.” And Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson announced after meeting with Trump in January that 1,800 jobs will come to Fort Worth in the coming years. “We had the opportunity to talk to him about the F-35 program and I certainly share his views that we need to get the best capability to our men and women in uniform and we have to get it at the lowest possible price,” Hewson told reporters after her meeting in Manhattan. Texas Republican Rep. Kay Granger, a strong advocate of the F-35 program whose Fort Worth district holds the factory that assembles the fighter jet, was unavailable for an interview but in a statement also praised Trump’s role in the negotiations. “A lower-cost F-35 is a win for American taxpayers and for all of our allies and partners around the world who count on this fifth-generation fighter for their national defense,” Granger said in a statement. “I am pleased that the administration and Lockheed Martin came together on an agreement, and I remain proud of the talented workers who live in the 12th District and make the equipment that keeps us safe.” Members of Trump’s party and the companies who rely on federal contracts are playing it safe, said Dan Grazier, a fellow at The Project for Government Oversight, a government watchdog group that opposes the F-35. “Trump is looking for a bunch of quick victories,” Grazier said. “It’s extremely doubtful that Trump had anything to do with cost decreases. Lockheed had been talking about price reductions to the F-35 for months before election.” Grazier remains skeptical of the F-35s long-term viability, arguing that completed F-35s will exceed current costs because they will need to be sent back to the factory to be finished when research and development is completed. However, he acknowledged that the cost per plane has decreased as more are built. “This has been going on for a solid year, almost a solid year before Donald Trump really jumped into the fray on this program,” Grazier said. But there is one way Trump could impact the F-35 and take credit: lift federally mandated spending caps, known as sequestration, that limit military spending. “Back in 2013, we had about 1,000 employees laid off at Bell Helicopter because of the sequester,” Veasey said. “If you really want to start advocating for bringing down the price, I think the one thing that the president can do and take credit for is to get rid of the sequester.” “They (Republicans) control the presidency, control the House, control the Senate, they have the ability to get rid of the sequester and bring even more jobs to Lockheed,” Veasey said. “It doesn’t seem like there’s any movement on that. I’m on the armed services committee and we talk how we can save money on a variety programs, but no one’s talked about the sequester.” ——— HOW THE PENTAGON BUYS F-35S The Pentagon buys F-35s in batches and negotiates with Lockheed on a total price for each batch. As Lockheed ramps up production, the cost per plane goes down. In November, Lockheed was forced to agree to a $6.1 billion contract for ninth batch of 57 F-35 fighter jets in a unilateral contract agreement, putting the price per plane at just over $107 million. In January, Lockheed agreed to a deal for the 10th batch of F-35s for a cost of less than $100 million per plane. There are three variants of the F-35 for each branch of the armed forces. The conventional version of the F-35 the Army uses is cheaper than the F-35s ordered by the Marines and Navy, which have additional capabilities for vertical landings and landing on aircraft carriers. ——— (Star-Telegram staff writer Max Baker contributed to this report.) ——— ©2017 McClatchy Washington Bureau Visit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at www.mcclatchydc.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

An vastly important relationship beyond bilateral ties "The U.S.-China relations are of vital importance and influence not only to themselves, but also to the world as a whole," Ezra Feivel Vogel, professor of the Social Sciences Emeritus at Harvard University, told Xinhua in fluent Mandarin in a recent interview. Trump, one of the U.S. presidents with least public office experience, needs time to get familiar with foreign policy affairs, especially with the complexities of U.S.-China ties, Vogel said. "Personally I think Trump has to choose to cooperate with China on major issues of domestic and global relevance, such as trade, investment and counterterrorism, to name just a few." Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger could agree no more. "I am optimistic that the cooperative way will prevail. Keep in mind that if China and America are in conflict, then the whole world will be divided," he said at an event hosted by the Committee of 100 and the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. "The peace and progress of the world depend on the abilities of the United States and China to respect each other's core interests, and to modify the core interests in order to make cooperation possible," Kissinger said when marking the 50th founding anniversary of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR). Exploring the potential for the U.S. and China to work together, where possible, on the One Belt One Road Initiative could "open windows for regional economic, political and commercial benefits to both counties," said Marc Grossman, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and Vice Chairman of the Cohen Group. Adherence to One-China policy is crucial Many prominent specialists on Chinese affairs have also joined chorus of opposition to Trump's questioning Washington's "one China policy" before taking office. "Every president of both parties since 1971 has accepted this framework, and once that framework is studied, I do not expect it to be overturned ... To make Taiwan the key issue at the beginning of this dialogue is, in my view, unwise and not the most efficient way of proceeding," Kissinger said. Michael Swaine, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called Trump's phone call with Taiwan leader "reckless action." "It would serve absolutely no U.S. interest, and raise many risks, for Trump to entertain such a fantasy," Swaine said. "A needless blunder that foolishly complicates U.S.-China relations fails to advance U.S. interests, and calls into questioning the readiness of the Trump team to manage foreign policy," Avery Goldstein, political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said of Trump's Taiwan call. The Trump administration should not abandon long-standing U.S. policy on the status of Taiwan, warned a bipartisan report issued on Tuesday, calling such a move "exceedingly dangerous." The U.S.-China relations are at a "precarious crossroads" and the two world powers could be on a "collision course," said the report by an expert task force convened by the Asia Society and the University of California San Diego. All-out Trade war with China hurts U.S. itself Even though Trump and his trade team have been talking tough on trade ties with China, Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution,said that an all-out trade war with China would hurt U.S. itself eventually. "That is a situation many of my colleagues and I would not like to see," Prasad said. The U.S. became the largest recipient of booming Chinese outbound FDI in 2016, with 45.6 billion dollars worth of completed acquisitions and greenfield investments, according to a new report by the research firm Rhodium Group released on Dec. 30, 2016. However, the report noted that "the political realities on both sides pose a major downside risk to both pending transactions and new deal flow in coming months." Cumulative Chinese direct investment in the U.S. economy since 2000 exceeds 100 billion dollars, it said. Contrary to what critics say China is stealing U.S. jobs, the rising Asian power is helping create tremendous jobs for Americans. "Just give you a sense of broader impact (of Chinese aviation market) on the U.S. economy. Deliveries to China by Boeing support approximately 150,000 U.S. jobs every year, that's an incredible number," said Raymond L. Conner, vice chairman of Boeing Co., the largest U.S. exporter. Boeing has forecast that in the next 20 years, China will demand 6,810 new aircrafts with a total value of about 1 trillion U.S. dollars. This demand will make China the biggest customer of Boeing commercial airplanes. Chinese customers are expected to take delivery of 30 percent of all Boeing's top-selling 737 models and about 25 percent of all aircraft produced in Washington State and South Carolina, Conner said. Closer people-to-people exchanges enhance bilateral ties. "People-to-people exchanges between the two countries continue to strengthen even at a time we are having difficulties politically," Stephen A. Orlins, President of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, told Xinhua at a reception in New York to raise funds to build a panda pavilion in the city's iconic Central Park on Wednesday. "I believe we'll get to the promising land of a constructive U.S.- China relations in a long term," Orlins said. The host of the Black & White Panda Ball is The Pandas Are Coming to NYC, a nonprofit group spearheaded by U.S. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney together with Wall Street businessman Maurice R. Greenberg, Chinese fashion icon Yue-Sai Kan and billionaire Gristedes supermarket-chain owner John Catsimatidis in 2016. The project has received support from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio and Chinese Consulate General in New York. "Pandas represent joy, love and friendship. It's a symbol of good luck, which our city can use more of," Maloney, who wore a black dress with white polka dots, said to guests at 45 tables in the Skylight Roof at the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel. Three million mainland Chinese visited the United States in 2016, and about 950,000 made a trip to New York. Over 300,000 Chinese students are studying in the U.S. and about 20,000 American students in China, Orlins noted, adding these young people who better understand each other's country will be "our successors" to promote U.S.-China friendship. "That will help create a lasting bond for the two countries no matter what the government does," he said.

Business ViaSat's results mixed for quarter; sets April 25 launch for latest satellite ViaSat: Betting big on satellite broadband ViaSat CEO Mark Dankberg ViaSat CEO Mark Dankberg Mike FreemanContact Reporter Satellite internet provider ViaSat posted mixed financial results for its fiscal third quarter as the Carlsbad company readies to launch its second high bandwidth satellite on April 25. Revenue came in at $381 million, up from $348 million for the same quarter last year. Net income dipped, however, to $4.2 million from $9.7 million a year earlier – in part because of a $34 million increase in research and development costs for work on upcoming satellite projects. On a per share basis, ViaSat earned 8 cents, down from 20 cents a share a year earlier under General Accepted Accounting Principles. Excluding certain charges, ViaSat earned 29 cents per share – surpassing Wall Street analysts’ forecasts of 27 cents. Revenue came up short of analysts’ prediction of $392 million for the quarter. For the first time, the company pinned down a launch date for its 300-gigabit per second ViaSat-2 satellite. It will be shipped next month from Boeing’s Satellite Systems International facility in El Segundo to the Arianespace launch site in French Guiana. Once it launches, it will take a few months to position ViaSat-2 in orbit. The satellite is expected to begin delivering Internet service to customers in the fourth quarter of 2017. Mark Dankberg, ViaSat’s chief executive, said ViaSat-2 will allow the company to offer Internet plans with 50 to 100 megabits per second speeds and much higher data caps – enough to support frequent video streaming. ViaSat’s current plans start at 12 megabits per second and have data caps ranging from 10 to 30 gigabits per month. ViaSat ended the quarter with 675,000 residential Internet subscribers, down slightly year-over-year. But its revenue per subscriber increased to a record $63.11 thanks to more subscribers choosing top-tier, more expensive plans such as its 25 megabit per second Boost offering. In addition to residential Internet, ViaSat also powers satellite in-flight Wi-Fi for some domestic flights from Jet Blue, American Airlines, United Airlines and Virgin America.  It ended the quarter with 555 planes in service. It has more 750 commercial aircraft in backlog for antennas and other gear to enable high-speed in flight Wi-Fi to each passenger onboard. ViaSat also provides communications gear and encryption services to government customers, including the military and Air Force One. Sales in the division are up 10 percent over the same quarter last year, with a backlog of $654 million.  The company’s third business division, commercial networks, posted flat revenue. It makes satellite ground equipment and antennas, among other things. With ViaSat-2 set to launch, the company has already begun work on ViaSat-3, a group of three satellites that will provide global coverage. Each satellite will have 1 terabit per second capacity -- more than three times the bandwidth of ViaSat-2.  The first of these satellites is expected to launch over North America in 2019, followed six months later by the second satellite over Europe. For the first nine months of its fiscal year, ViaSat’s revenue is up 9 percent to $1.14 billion. Earnings excluding certain chargers grew 3 percent to $257 million. ViaSat released results Thursday after markets closed. Its shares ended trading at $66.72 on the Nasdaq exchange.

The deal, which is subject to regulatory clearances, secures 1,700 jobs, mostly in South Yorkshire in the north of England, Britain's largest steelmaker said in a statement on Thursday. The speciality division is one of the world's biggest suppliers for the aerospace industry, with customers including Rolls-Royce, Boeing and Airbus. "This is an important step forward in securing a future for the (speciality) business. Today's news also marks another important step forward in realising a more sustainable future for our Port Talbot-based supply chain in the UK," said Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata Steel UK. The deal will make privately-owned Liberty House one of Britain's largest steel employers with 4,000 workers. The speciality business has the capacity to make 1.1 million tonnes of liquid steel a year from recycled scrap. Reuters On completion of the deal, Tata Steel will employ some 9,000 people in Britain, around half of them based in Port Talbot, Wales, home to Britain's largest steelworks. For every steel job saved, around four jobs are retained in related sectors. UK Business Secretary Greg Clark said, "I look forward to hearing more about (Liberty House's) expansion plan. We want to work with the steel industry to transform and upgrade their sector as part of the (government's) Industrial Strategy." Tata Steel Ltd, India's biggest steelmaker by overall capacity, is in talks to merge its European operations, including its remaining British businesses, with Germany's Thyssenkrupp. The success of the talks hinges on Tata getting regulatory approval to spin off its 15 billion pound pension scheme into a standalone entity, because Thyssenkrupp will not take on the British unit's pension liabilities in the event of a merger. Tata Steel said it was seeking to develop a "structural solution for its UK pension scheme in the coming months", and it was also consulting employees on how to secure a sustainable future for its remaining British business. The steelmaker's British employees have been balloted on closing the pension scheme to future accrual, with vote results due this month. But that is only the first step towards separation of a scheme that has 130,000 members. Liberty House, part of the Gupta Family Group, expressed an interest in buying all of Tata Steel UK last year, before Tata Steel Ltd decided against a sale of the whole business in order to pursue a tie-up with Thyssenkrupp. #Liberty house#Port talbot plant#Tata steel uk#Thyssenkrupp Top Stories Uttar Pradesh Election 2017 LIVE: Western UP records 39.43% voter turnout till 1 pm; Mayawati claims BSP will win 1st phase K Pandiarajan: Minister Who Jumped Ship to Rattle Chinnamma's Camp MSG Lion Heart 2 'review': Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh launches another surgical strike on cinema Women scientists in India: What we learnt from a year of lab-hopping across the country Meeting a financial planner for first time?

With no more orders for the F-16s from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. Lockheed would switch F-16s production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the US. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States. In Lockheed's case, however, the plan is to build the F-16s to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump's transition and governance teams as well as the US Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington. "We've briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India," the spokesman said. "We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programmes, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with US policy priorities." India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16s in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. A person close to Lockheed said company officials did not know what the Trump administration planned to do about the proposal to shift F-16s production to India. "They're following it closely and talking with the White House. But if they don't move production to India, there's no way they'll get the India contract," the person said. One argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. "Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing," the person said. Lockheed has said that moving F-16s assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16s would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. "We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India," Randall L Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India's biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB's Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian air force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Negotiating arms contracts with India can take years, and industry officials said there was no guarantee Lockheed would win the contract even if it moves production to India. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with US arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long-term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed's executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. "We want to be prepared, that's why we started the ground work," he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. "The capability for building components exists here, it's been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners," Paranjape said.This news was published in The Nation newspaper. Read complete newspaper of 10-Feb-2017 here.

With no more orders for the F-16 from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. Lockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Trump has criticised U.S. companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the U.S. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States. In Lockheed's case, however, the plan is to build the F-16 to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump's transition and governance teams as well as the U.S. Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman told Reuters in Washington. "We've briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India," the spokesman said. "We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programs, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with U.S. policy priorities." India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16 in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. A person close to Lockheed said company officials did not know what the Trump administration planned to do about the proposal to shift F-16 production to India. "They're following it closely and talking with the White House. But if they don't move production to India, there's no way they'll get the India contract," the person said. One argument to be made was that moving to India would preserve some component production in the United States. "Twenty-five percent of something is better than zero percent of nothing," the person said. NO THREAT TO U.S. JOBS Lockheed has said that moving F-16 assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16 would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. "We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India," Randall L. Howard, head of F-16 business development, told Reuters ahead of India's biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB's Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian air force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Negotiating arms contracts with India can take years, and industry officials said there was no guarantee Lockheed would win the contract even if it moves production to India. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with U.S. arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long-term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed's executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. "We want to be prepared, that's why we started the ground work," he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. "The capability for building components exists here, it's been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners," Paranjape said.

The President of the United States had launched a Wednesday Twitter attack at Nordstrom after the retailer stopped selling the Ivanka Trump brand. The Seattle-based store had announced February 2 that it would stop selling the first daughter’s shoes and handbags, citing “poor performance.” The 45th President of the United States had blasted “terrible” Nordstrom and accused the company of treating his 35-year-old daughter “unfairly.” My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 A source speaking to Fortune confirmed that Nordstrom stock hardly flinched at the President’s criticism. According to the source, stock prices dipped less than one percent before surging and finishing the day at 4.1 percent. The big retailer’s stock had dropped to $42.47 after the tweet. However, the trade volume of 6,700 shares then surged to over half-a-million shares in a less than five minutes, closing at $44.53 on a day the rest of the market did not do well. Nordstrom’s stock price reaction is an opposing breakaway from previous Trump Twitter targets. The 45th president had taken swipes at Boeing and Lockheed Martin questioning the high costs of purchases from the companies by the Defense Department. Stock prices of these companies had tanked after the 70-year-old politician tweeted his disapproval. Nordstrom's stock closed 4.1 per cent higher after Donald Trump's tweet attacking the company https://t.co/hDozKp0w37 — Financial Times (@FT) February 8, 2017 In January, President Trump had also threatened Toyota in a tweet, warning that he would hit the company with border tax if it went ahead with a car plant in Mexico. Stock prices made available to LA Times, confirmed that the automaker’s stock plummeted to 0.6 percent that day. Stocks that had been targeted by the President before had always recovered. However, traders revealed that none of them had peaked after criticized by the President on social media. Nordstrom stocks declined temporarily, but bounced back in minutes proving that investors were not bothered by Mr. Trump deriding the big-time retailer. Some investors even revealed that they purchased more stock in a strong show of support after Nordstrom announced that it was cutting ties with Ivanka. I just bought Nordstrom's stock. I don't know what they do. I don't care. Drive it up, baby. @realDonaldTrump — Nathan Hale (@NH92276) February 8, 2017 Haven't shopped at #Nordstrom since I was 15 but bought a skirt today. Their stock is UP since dropped Ivanka trash! #DumpTrump #itsworking — Kathy Grayson (@kathygrayson) February 9, 2017 BTW. I bought three shares of @Nordstrom #JWN #stock today. As well as more shares in @Twitter – Twitter is actually a bargain right now. — brian h-k (@hkfamily) February 9, 2017 I'm going to spend some $$$ @Nordstrom at Union Square to show my support. Also I bought a boat load of their stock today. — Greg Martin (@GMPhotoNYC) February 9, 2017 The President in a subsequent tweet had questioned the rationale behind dropping his daughter’s brand and insinuated that it was a political decision. A Nordstrom spokesperson responded to the criticism meted by the President of the United States, insisting that it was purely a business decision and that the businesswoman had been informed of the decision earlier in January. “Sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.” Some observers have slammed the President’s tweets, pointing out that traders might rely on his tweets to carry out sharp practices in the stock market. Others opined that Mr. Trump needed to be more presidential and realize that his words are “parsed to the nth degree, every thought magnified to global significance, no matter how casual or careless.” Former press secretary for George W. Bush, Ari Fleischer said the tweets of the President were “something a father would say…not the type of thing a President of the United States should say.” The official @POTUS account just retweeted Trump’s attack on @Nordstrom. That’s a taxpayer funded account being used to benefit Trump’s kid. pic.twitter.com/vIUPxGze8X — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) February 8, 2017 CNN confirmed that President Trump had sent the tweets slamming Nordstrom from both his personal account and the official @POTUS account. Trump spokesman, Sean Spicer further underlined this conflict of interest when he said the President had the right lead the country and “stand up for his family and applaud their business activities.” Kevin Drum of Mother Jones believes the Nordstrom tweet is another indication of President Trump settling a personal score from his cyber-bullying pulpit. According to him, Nordstrom is not the only retailer that dumped Ivanka’s offerings. Nordstrom sent strongly worded memo criticizing Trump's Muslim travel ban to staff 2 days b/4 dropping Ivanka's line https://t.co/AlBe4rnXge — slone (@slone) February 8, 2017 Other retailers include Neiman Marcus, Shoes, Belk, ShopStyle, Jet, and Gilt, but the President only called out Nordstrom. In a story by the Daily Mail, the company’s three presidents — Peter, Erik, and Blake Nordstrom had circulated a strong-worded memo to employees criticizing Trump’s travel ban on immigrants from seven Muslim countries.

While the part was sourced from Delta’s local engineering office and installed on the plane, a senior manager at the U.S. carrier’s Atlanta base later ordered that it be removed, it claims. “It is sad, in our view, that any airline would deny such standard technical assistance to another carrier based on orders from headquarters that had nothing to do with maintenance or cost, but seem clearly to have been intended to inflict harm on the airline and its customers,” Emirates said in an e-mail. Delta shares parts with other airlines whenever possible through an industry agreement and doesn’t withhold them from any particular carrier, Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said. The item in question was the last spare of its kind in Delta’s Seattle inventory, and company policy requires that it keep the last one on hand in case Delta needs it, Thomas said. “Having the right spare parts in the right places and in ample quantity is critical to ensuring a reliable airline operation for our customers,” Thomas said. Gulf Dispute Delta, together with American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc., is embroiled in a long-running dispute with the three main Gulf carriers after urging the federal government to block their growth on the grounds that they received illegal aid payments -- a suggestion that Emirates, Qatar Airways and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways all reject. The issue may be reignited after U.S. airline representatives met with Donald Trump Thursday, with the president telling them they faced “big league” competition, much of it “subsidized by governments.” Qatar Air Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker branded Delta “wicked” last year after the Doha-based carrier’s first flight to Atlanta with the Airbus Group SE A380 superjumbo was directed to a remote gate at the world’s busiest airport, leaving elderly and infirm passengers to disembark via temporary stairs rather than through the usual air-bridge. At the time, Delta said Qatar Airways was late in trying to secure gates for the A380 flight, which require special gates because of the jet’s size. Delta attempted to accommodate Qatar’s flight, despite the carrier’s tardiness, while making sure it could accommodate its own schedule, a company spokeswoman said in June. Card Payment In the incident this month, Emirates said Delta had refused a credit-card payment for the spare and ordered a local engineering provider to remove it from the 777. Code-share partner Alaska Airlines Inc. eventually came to the rescue by providing the part, leaving the flight to depart 6 hours and 24 minutes late. “Despite this incident, Emirates will continue to render such technical support to other carriers, including Delta, irrespective of whether we agree or disagree with their policy views,” the Gulf company said. Thomas, the Delta spokesman, said it wasn’t immediately clear Thursday why the company originally allowed Emirates to use the part before calling it back.

Jane Lee reports. February 10th 2017 a day ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Kellyanne Conway spruiked Ivanka Trump’s fashion line on live TV. Picture: AP Staff writers and wiresNews Corp Australia Network Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend US President Donald Trump has told Chinese President Xi Jinping his administration will respect the “one China” policy, during a telephone call between the leaders, the Financial Times reports, citing two people familiar with the call. Trump, who was inaugurated last month, said in December the United States did not necessarily have to stick to the “one China” policy, by which Washington acknowledges China’s position that it has sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan. TRUMP LOSES TRAVEL BAN BID Judges involved in legal challenges against Trump’s immigration ban have come under threat prompting tighter security protection for them. CNN reported that while the specific threats are not known, law enforcement is treating them seriously. The US Marshals Service and local police have increased patrols and protective officers to provide security for some of the judges, officials said. Since Trump has taken office he has made verbal criticisms of judges — something that has sparked concern from former law enforcement officials and others. Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 This comes as a federal appeals court in San Francisco has refused to reinstate Trump’s ban on travellers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals wouldn’t block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travellers to enter the US. An appeal to the US Supreme Court is possible. US District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban last week after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit. Government lawyers argued that the ban was a “lawful exercise” of the president’s authority and that the seven countries have raised terrorism concerns. The states said Trump’s executive order unconstitutionally blocked entry based on religion. It didn’t take long for Trump to make his thoughts on the ruling clear. SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Hillary Clinton also seemed to weigh in on the situation, posting this cryptic tweet. 3-0— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 10, 2017 The US Appeals Court has ruled against President Donald Trump and his travel ban. Picture: AFP/MANDEL NGANSource:AFP KELLYANNE SPRUIKS IVANKA’S LABEL TOP White House adviser Kellyanne Conway has been slammed for defending Ivanka Trump’s fashion company after a number of US retailers dumped the brand, citing falling sales. Ms Conway told Fox & Friends on Thursday that Ms Trump is a “successful businesswoman” and people should give the company their business. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff, is what I would tell you ... I’m going to give it a free commercial here: Go buy it today,” she said. A former top official under President Barack Obama has hit back, saying Ms Conway broke the law by telling people in the TV interview to buy Ms Trump’s clothes. Chris Lu highlighted a law which says: “An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives.” This is the federal ethics law that @KellyannePolls just violated cc: @OfficeGovEthics @jasoninthehouse pic.twitter.com/EivJeFd7wY— Chris Lu (@ChrisLu44) February 9, 2017 “This is the federal ethics law that @KellyannePolls just violated,” Mr Lu tweeted, tagging the US Office of Government Ethics and Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. It comes after President Donald Trump launched a Twitter attack against Nordstrom when the retailer dropped his daughter’s clothing and accessory line. His tweet, in which he said his daughter was treated “so unfairly”, drew swift criticism from ethics experts. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 After the dust-up with Nordstrom, employees at US retailers TJ Maxx and Marshalls were told to throw away any signs advertising merchandise from Ms Trump’s retail brand, according to The New York Times. “Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into the runs,” read a note to workers obtained by the newspaper. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded.” Mr Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors. But ethics experts say this time is different because it involves a business run by his daughter — and that raises conflict-of-interest concerns. President Donald Trump lashed out at US retailer Nordstrom after it dumped his daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing line. Picture: AP Photo/Evan VucciSource:AP POPE SEEMINGLY CALLS OUT TRUMP AGAIN POPE Francis has delivered a thinly-veiled rebuke of Mr Trump’s plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico, saying society should not create “walls but bridges”. The pontiff did not refer to the US president by name or directly mention the proposed wall, which Mr Trump has insisted Mexico will pay for. Instead the Argentinian pontiff used his weekly general audience on Wednesday to speak of a Christian calling “to not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil, to overcome evil with good”. Pope Francis has rebuked Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico. Picture: AP Photo/Andrew MedichiniSource:AP He added: “A Christian can never say ‘I’ll make you pay for that’. Never! That is not a Christian gesture. An offence is overcome with forgiveness, by living in peace with everyone.” Last year, in response to an answer about then-candidate Mr Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall, Francis said a man with those views is “not Christian”. He said in an interview last month that he would not form an opinion of Mr Trump until he first had a chance to see specific policies the new US president would implement. As Mr Trump was taking office on January 20, Francis sent a message urging him to be guided by ethical values, saying he must take care of the poor and the outcast during his time in office. JEFF SESSIONS SWORN IN AS ATTORNEY GENERAL Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has been sworn in as US Attorney General, despite protests from the likes of Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was formally silenced for impugning her senator colleague. During an Oval Office ceremony, Mr Trump called Senator Sessions a man of integrity and principal, and someone who has devoted his life to the cause of justice. Senator Sessions was sworn in the morning after the Senate confirmed his nomination following a contentious confirmation process. The Alabama lawmaker resigned his Senate seat shortly after his colleagues approved him on a 52-47 vote that broke largely along partisan lines. Sen. Sessions was the first sitting US senator to endorse Mr Trump. He faced criticism from Democrats, including Senator Warren, over his record on civil rights and immigration. US President Donald Trump (2nd R) watches as Jeff Sessions (L), alongside his wife Mary (2nd L), is sworn in as Attorney General by US Vice President Mike Pence. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Republicans lauded his four decades of public service and his commitment to fairness and the rule of law. Meanwhile, just before the attorney general was sworn in, Mr Trump signed three executive actions related to criminal justice, including an order to have the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to tackle “criminal cartels” that have spread across the nation. Trump announced the executive actions during a swearing-in ceremony for Attorney General Jeff Mr Trump says the plan will attempt to break the backs of criminal cartels. He’s also asking for a task force to reduce violent crime in America and a plan to stop violent crimes against law enforcement officers. He calls it a “shame” what has happened to “truly great” law enforcement officers. TRUMP GOES AFTER MCCAIN OVER YEMEN RAID Mr Trump is going after Republican Senator John McCain for suggesting that last week’s US raid in Yemen wasn’t a success. Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday that Senator McCain “should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!” He added that Senator McCain has “been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in — bogged down in conflict all over the place.” Sen.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Senator McCain said on Wednesday that any operation where a $US75 million ($98.2 million) plane is lost, a Navy SEAL is killed, and there are multiple casualties, including women and children, “cannot be labelled a success.” He is a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war who lost the 2008 presidential election to President Barack Obama. The Arizona Republican won re-election in November. Donald Trump has again lashed out at Republican Senator John McCain. Picture: Mark Wilson/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP TRUDEAU TO VISIT TRUMP IN WASHINGTON DC Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is to meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday. A statement from the Prime Minister’s office said the leaders “look forward to discussing the unique relationship between Canada and the United States of America and how they will continue to work hard for middle-class Canadians and Americans, together.” Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama were more in sync than the Canadian Prime Minister is with Donald Trump. Picture: AFPSource:Supplied More than 75 per cent of Canada’s exports go to the US. Of the 50 US states, 35 count Canada as their leading export market. Mr Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Canada’s foreign minister warned the Trump administration on Wednesday that his country will retaliate if the US applies new tariffs. SUPREME COURT NOMINEE: ‘BAN IS DEMORALISING’ Mr Trump has lashed out at a Democratic senator who revealed that the president’s own Supreme Court nominee had called Mr Trump’s attacks on the judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralising.” The US president last week called a federal judge who temporarily blocked his travel ban a “so-called judge”, before saying the appellate court panel currently considering his executive order was “so political”. Judge Neil Gorsuch, nominated last week to fill a key vacancy on the Supreme Court, criticised Mr Trump’s stance during a meeting with Senator Richard Blumenthal. Mr Trump’s own confirmation team for Judge Gorsuch confirmed those comments. US Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch (right) meets with Senator Richard Blumenthal in Blumenthal's office in Washington, DC. Picture: Alex Wong/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP However Mr Trump lashed out at Senator Blumenthal, questioning his integrity. “Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?” the US president tweeted on Thursday. Senator Blumenthal faced criticism in the past for saying he had served in Vietnam. He served in the Marine Corps Reserves during Vietnam. He apologised in 2010, saying he regretted his misstatements.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Republican former Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is helping with Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation, was at the meeting with the judge and Senator Blumenthal. She issued a statement saying Judge Gorsuch made clear he was not referring to any specific case. But she said the nominee said he finds any criticism of a judge’s integrity and independence to be “disheartening and demoralising.” On Thursday, Ms Conway said Mr Trump was “fully confident” in his Supreme Court nominee. Gorsuch: Trump's Comments on Judiciary 'Demoralizing'2:14 President Trump?s Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch, said he was disappointed in the president?s remarks on the judiciary in a closed-door meeting with Sen.

February 10th 2017 2 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/USA/ SPICER MEANT ORLANDO, NOT ATLANTA, TERROR ATTACK White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer claims he meant to say Orlando when he repeatedly referenced a terror attack in Atlanta during interviews and a press briefing last week. Mr Spicer first referred to an Atlanta attack in an interview on January 29 on ABC’s This Week. He also named the city in reference to a terror attack during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on January 30 and in a press briefing later that day. Mr Spicer told ABC News in an email that he “clearly meant Orlando.” Mr Spicer isn’t the only Trump administration official to refer to a terror attack that never happened. Ms Conway referred to a “Bowling Green Massacre” during an interview with MSNBC last week. She now says she misspoke. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly referred to a terror attack that never happened.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Amazon.com Inc. warned on Friday that government actions to bolster domestic companies over foreign competition could hurt its business, in a potential reference to U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" agenda. In a routine description of regulatory risks in its 2016 annual filing, the world's largest online retailer said "trade and protectionist measures" might hinder its ability to grow. That language has not appeared in Amazon's warning about government regulation in at least the past five annual filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Seattle-based company has cited trade protection in those filings as a risk to its international sales and operations specifically. The new Republican president has made job creation a cornerstone of his policies, threatening to impose tariffs on imports so companies produce and hire within the United States. Republicans in Congress also have a plan to target imports while excluding export revenue from U.S. corporate income tax, known as a border adjustment tax. The proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives has divided corporate America. Major exporters like Boeing Co. have thrown their weight behind it, but a retail association has said it would raise prices for shoppers. It was not clear what kinds of protectionist measures - whether tariffs or other actions - concerned Amazon the most, or from which countries Amazon saw the greatest risk. Amazon so far has declined to comment on Republican lawmakers' border tax plan. It declined comment on the new language in its annual filing, which appeared under the header, "Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business." The filing did not mention the change in leadership of the White House. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo By Jeffrey Dastin Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) warned on Friday that government actions to bolster domestic companies against foreign competition could hurt its business, in a possible reference to U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" agenda. In a routine description of regulatory risks in its 2016 annual filing, the world's largest online retailer said "trade and protectionist measures" might hinder its ability to grow. That language has not appeared in Amazon's warning about government regulation in at least the past five annual filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Seattle-based company has cited trade protection in those filings as a risk to its international sales and operations specifically. The new Republican president has made job creation a cornerstone of his policies, threatening to impose tariffs on imports so companies produce and hire within the United States. Republicans in Congress also have a plan to target imports while excluding export revenue from U.S. corporate income tax, known as a border adjustment tax. The proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives has divided corporate America. Major exporters like Boeing Co (BA.N) have thrown their weight behind it, but a retail association has said it would raise prices for shoppers. It was not clear what kinds of protectionist measures - whether tariffs or other actions - concerned Amazon the most, or from which countries Amazon saw the greatest risk. Amazon so far has declined to comment on Republican lawmakers' border tax plan. It declined comment on the new language in its annual filing, which appeared under the header, "Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business." The filing did not mention the change in leadership of the White House. Separately, Amazon said in the filing that it may face penalties for having delivered consumer products to entities covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, between 2012 and 2016. Products included apparel, consumer electronics, software and books. Amazon said it processed goods worth about $2,400 for an entity controlled or owned by Iran's government, for example.

Karamjit Kaur Aviation Correspondent karam@sph.com.sg Published Feb 11, 2017, 5:00 am SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/4s92 Copy After a fast climb, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways - dubbed "super connectors" for their significant transit traffic - have hit some turbulence. Dubai-based Emirates, the biggest of the three, saw year-on-year profits for the six months to the end of September nosedive by 75 per cent to 786 million dirhams (S$302 million) - after more than four years of solid growth. The numbers are less gloomy for Qatar and Abu Dhabi's Etihad, but the headwinds are just as strong. Emirates and Qatar are expected to record their slowest capacity growth this year, in at least five years. For the first time, Etihad will cut capacity - the number of seats offered multiplied by total distance flown - reports industry think-tank Centre for Aviation. The developments beg the question: Is this the start of the fall of the Middle Eastern airlines and how will that impact other global carriers such as Singapore Airlines (SIA)? Asked what ails his carrier, the chief of one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world said - a tad ironically - that the skies are getting crowded. The industry is extremely competitive, said Emirates president Tim Clark. Falling oil prices have affected the global oil and gas industry and economies in the Middle East, softening the demand for corporate travel. This has hurt the profitability of Middle Eastern carriers. The strength of the US dollar against major global currencies has also impacted revenues for Emirates, for instance. PHOTO: BLOOMBERG This has prompted some governments to turn protectionist to protect domestic carriers, when, in fact, competition and international air connectivity will result in job creation and economic benefits. For years, carriers - the European airlines being the most vocal - have slammed Emirates, Qatar and Etihad for "dumping" capacity. Aggressive expansion by these carriers has created an oversupply of seats which has forced fares down and, in turn, profits and yields for many airlines, including SIA. Flush with cash, the Middle Eastern carriers have enjoyed growing market share and profitability, until now. Falling oil prices since 2014 have dampened the trading landscape. That has affected the global oil and gas industry and economies in the Middle East, softening the demand for corporate travel. The strength of the United States dollar against major global currencies has also impacted revenues for Emirates, for instance. The Centre for Aviation's Will Horton said that while all airlines have been impacted by the slowdown in corporate travel, more unique to the Gulf carriers is the downturn in their point-to-point business following the collapse in oil prices. "Point-to-point traffic at Gulf airlines is around 10 to 30 per cent. While that may seem small, the value was very high," he said. It is cheaper, for example, to buy a Hong Kong-Europe than Hong Kong-Dubai/Abu Dhabi/Doha ticket despite the huge difference in distance. There are two schools of thought when it comes to the future of the Middle Eastern giants. No doubt they feel the pinch from more robust competition from other carriers, but this does not spell doom, said Mr Saj Ahmad, chief consultant at StrategicAero Research . "A better indicator of hitting a peak would be either slower organic growth or a move to curtail deliveries of new jets to rein in capacity. Neither of these two are happening yet," he said. This year, Emirates will still take delivery of more than 20 new aircraft, including Airbus 380s and Boeing 777s. By the end of the year, the airline will have more than 100 A-380s in its fleet. While Etihad will shrink this year, Qatar continues to expand. Last year, it added 14 new destinations to its network and 19 new aircraft to its fleet, taking the count to 192. The airline is also preparing to launch a new business-class seat next month. Endau Analytics' Shukor Yusof has a conflicting view. "The growth that we have seen at Emirates over the years is not sustainable. There will come a point when their A-380s will hamper progress, instead of supporting growth," he said. Within three to five years, a huge fleet of A-380s could put the airline at risk, financially and operationally. Despite a grand debut a decade ago in SIA colours, the four-engined A-380 is not popular with many airlines that are unable to fill the huge plane in order to reap its operating benefits. For SIA, Cathay Pacific and other international carriers, a slowdown in the Middle East market is certainly good news if overall capacity falls. Still, challenges remain. On Tuesday, SIA reported a 35.6 per cent drop in profits for the three months from October to December. At the operating level, it was slightly better, with profits up 1.7 per cent. The future will be challenging for SIA amid tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns, as well as aggressive pricing by competitors. Loads and yields for the passenger and cargo businesses are seen to remain under pressure. On the plus side, an expanding, fuel-efficient Airbus 350 fleet will help SIA grow with better operating economics. The airline has ordered 67 of the planes, which started arriving last year. Integration between Scoot and Tigerair will continue as SIA moves to position the group to capture a bigger share of the budget travel market for short- and long-haul flights. Even with the slowdown in the Middle East, Emirates, Qatar and Etihad will continue to be formidable foes. New challenges will also come from Chinese carriers that have been growing aggressively in recent years. To stay a key player, SIA will have to work harder to improve its operating margins and seek new opportunities in existing and new markets. Equally, if not more important, the airline must listen to its customers and tailor its products and services accordingly, and keep staff happy so that they can continue to provide the quality service that SIA has built its reputation on.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo By Jeffrey Dastin Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) warned on Friday that government actions to bolster domestic companies against foreign competition could hurt its business, in a possible reference to U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" agenda. In a routine description of regulatory risks in its 2016 annual filing, the world's largest online retailer said "trade and protectionist measures" might hinder its ability to grow. That language has not appeared in Amazon's warning about government regulation in at least the past five annual filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, the Seattle-based company has cited trade protection in those filings as a risk to its international sales and operations specifically. The new Republican president has made job creation a cornerstone of his policies, threatening to impose tariffs on imports so companies produce and hire within the United States. Republicans in Congress also have a plan to target imports while excluding export revenue from U.S. corporate income tax, known as a border adjustment tax. The proposal in the U.S. House of Representatives has divided corporate America. Major exporters like Boeing Co (BA.N) have thrown their weight behind it, but a retail association has said it would raise prices for shoppers. It was not clear what kinds of protectionist measures - whether tariffs or other actions - concerned Amazon the most, or from which countries Amazon saw the greatest risk. Amazon so far has declined to comment on Republican lawmakers' border tax plan. It declined comment on the new language in its annual filing, which appeared under the header, "Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business." The filing did not mention the change in leadership of the White House. Separately, Amazon said in the filing that it may face penalties for having delivered consumer products to entities covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, between 2012 and 2016. Products included apparel, consumer electronics, software and books. Amazon said it processed goods worth about $2,400 for an entity controlled or owned by Iran's government, for example. "We do not plan to continue selling to these accounts in the future," Amazon said. "Our review is ongoing and we are enhancing our processes designed to identify transactions associated with individuals and entities covered by the (act)."

The Dublin-based company is seeking deals with carriers including Norwegian Air Shuttle, Aer Lingus, Alitalia and Deutsche Lufthansa under which its flights would help feed passengers onto their long-haul services. Ryanair would be open to adding frequencies in order to provide sufficient connectivity and could ultimately replace many short-haul services operated by network carriers, encouraging them to focus exclusively on intercontinental routes, Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary in an interview. "The upside for us is in persuading the legacy carriers to stop trying to compete with us on short-haul because it feeds their long-haul," he said. "Work with us on short haul, you lose less money, I'll have less competition." Ryanair is seeking to seal accords in time for its summer timetable, with the arrangements likely to see passengers book flights to their end destination via the long-haul carriers' websites, but fly European sectors on the Irish company's jets. Baggage would be transferred automatically, though the agreements are likely to stop short of code-share terms, in which airlines sell tickets on each other's flights as if they were their own. "There's nothing but upside for the legacy carriers in this, except you've got to persuade them it's not some scam," O'Leary said in Brussels after a meeting of the A4E airline lobby group. European airlines are grappling with shrinking margins after the low oil price prompted a capacity splurge that's sent ticket prices tumbling. Ryanair said this week that its fares have slumped 16 percent this winter and are set to continue falling, making it even tougher for full-service carriers to compete on marginal routes. Shares of Ryanair traded 1.2 percent lower as of 9:33 a.m. Friday. They fell 3.8 percent Monday when the company disclosed the price decline and an 8 percent drop in fiscal third-quarter earnings. O'Leary cites Aer Lingus's short-haul business in Dublin to illustrate how the feeder plan would work. The carriers compete directly on 28 services, he said, and while Ryanair wouldn't seek to take over "trunk routes" a deal would allow the IAG SA unit to forgo unprofitable peripheral operations while connecting to the 85 destinations offered by its discount rival, including Birmingham and Edinburgh. The CEO said he has offered a similar arrangement to Alitalia on routes from Rome and Milan. "It's a demonstration of how we can feed a legacy carrier," he said. "If we can do it in Dublin, why can't we do it in Italy, why can't we ultimately do it in Germany with Lufthansa? This is absolutely the way forward for the industry." With Ryanair aiming to carry 200 million passengers by 2025, up from 117 million last year, O'Leary said that at least 10 percent of the total, or 20 million clients, are likely to derive from feeder deals. He added that the carrier is ready to expand its fleet by converting options for 100 more Boeing Co. 737 Max 200 jets into firm orders later this year in a deal worth $11.3 billion before discounts. O'Leary said his airline hasn't completely given up on offering long-haul flights of its own, while reiterating that the plan is low on his list of priorities given the record order backlogs at planemakers Boeing and Airbus Group. "When Boeing and Airbus have 80 or 100 spare slots for long-haul aircraft that they desperately want to shift at a low cost, we'll jump on it," he said. "But we're not going to kill ourselves at the moment when their order books are full out to 2020-2021." Ryanair has also been concerned about American opposition to low-cost flights into the U.S. operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, O'Leary said, while adding that the Scandinavian carrier appears now to have established key principles that other airlines can benefit from. Ryanair is separately offering partners the ability to sell tickets via its own web portal as the CEO looks to boost the company's on-line presence and make it what he calls "the Amazon of travel."   Ryanair planes at Dublin Airport on Nov. 25, 2016.

The 300-acre site will be built on land that previously hosted a trio of Atlas rocket launch pads. The latest version of the Atlas now flies from Launch Complex 41. Blue Origin leased Launch Complex 36 A and B, as well as Launch Complex 11, in 2015. Some of NASA's most historic missions were launched from Complex 36, including the Pioneer, Surveyor and Mariner spacecraft in the 1960s and 1970s. The pads were operational from 1962 to 2002. Basically, all that remains of the original launch complexes is a dome-shaped white circle, site of the blockhouse where the launch team was based during countdowns and liftoffs, said Blue Origin's Scott Henderson, director of Orbital Launch Operations. RELATED: Inside Jeff Bezos' Secret Blue Origin Rocket Factory Blue Origin, which leased the land in 2015, plans to build a launch pad for its reusable New Glenn orbital rockets, an integration and refurbishment facility, and a test stand for the rockets' BE-4 engines. The BE-4, a liquid oxygen and methane-powered engine, also will be sold to United Launch Alliance, which is developing a next-generation Atlas rocket known as Vulcan. ULA is a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The new launch complex will be Blue Origin's second major construction project at the Cape. In May, the Kent, Washington-based firm broke ground on a 750,000 square-foot plant near NASA's Kennedy Space Center where it will manufacture and assemble the New Glenn rockets. Blue Origin expects to begin flying the boosters around 2020. "By the end of the year we will be fast and furious into production," Henderson said. New Glenn is a follow-on program to the company's suborbital New Shepard launch system, a reusable rocket and capsule designed to fly payloads and passengers to about 62 miles above the planet. Test flights with crewmembers aboard are expected to begin this year. WATCH VIDEO: Who Owns the International Space Station? Originally published on Seeker.

Kenya Airways is ending the controversial contract with a global consultancy firm which has cost it a staggering Sh2.3 billion in ten months. Instead, the airline will hire the consultant, McKinsey of US, when it is needed as opposed to the previous arrangement where the firm had permanently set up shop at the airline. Mckinsey, one of the world’s biggest restructuring consultants, were brought in to steer the airline through cost-cutting and to re-engineer its revenue streams so it could begin making money again. It signed with Kenya Airways a consultancy contract widely criticised as lopsided and considered the most expensive in Kenya’s corporate history. Analysts argued the airline was not getting value for the huge costs. Yesterday, explaining the decision to pull out of the arrangement, the airline’s chairman, Mr Michael Joseph, said: “It was a two-year contract but at the end of the first year we have decided to change it because we think we have done what we need to do.” He added: “There were about 400 initiatives that were started by the company. The fee was based on cost savings or revenues increases. That we have received by mutual agreements to stop.” ALSO READ: Kenya Airways seeks to win back engineers, CEO search continues Even though management had continued to defend the deal, Invoices seen by The Standard on Saturday show that Kenya Airways had paid the consultancy firm about Sh2.3 billion in only ten months ending November, 2016. Massive payments The massive payments were being made at a time when the airline was fighting to remain afloat by sacking its staff and selling off some of its aircraft, having reported losses of more than Sh50 billion in two years. Kenya Airways has paid Mckinsey Sh43 million every week since March last year. Insiders said the consultancy bills — settled in dollars — were hurting KQ’s cash flow. Michael Joseph One of the most recent payments was on November 2016, where Mckinsey was paid Sh52million or ($525,000) for that week. Mr Joseph, who oversaw the exit negotiations, explained that the fees had been based on cost savings achieved under the firm guidance or increases in revenues but declined to say if he thought the fee was excessive. “Was it worth it? That is still to be determined but I said when I was coming on board that we would review the contract and that is what we have done,” said Mr Joseph, who as CEO built Safaricom into one of Africa’s biggest companies. ALSO READ: New rental income tax is killing our investments, developers tell KRA On his part, the airlines Chief Executive, Mr Mbuvi Ngunze, defended the contract saying his team came on board when the airline was going through severe turbulence. “They were willing to stake their name on KQ’s turnaround plan and they brought credibility to the process,” Mr Ngunze said. In addition to the weekly fees, the company also billed the airline for various services, among them performance and professional fees. For instance, invoice number 127CM dated September 19, 2016 of Sh43.5 million ($435,000) was received by the airline for “implementation stage weekly fees”. Similar invoices were entered in March, April, May through to September. On August 14, the firm sent in a Sh46.4 million invoice for professional fees. Similar fees were entered for December, January and February. There were about 40 different invoices entered in the period. The single-largest invoice was in July and September when it billed Sh290 million and Sh600 million as performance-based fees. McKinsey was brought in after the airline made cumulative losses of Sh52 billion in the last two years, throwing the national carrier into its biggest financial distress in the last decade. ALSO READ: KQ revival plan in perfect take-off as passenger numbers up McKinsey officially set up shop in Nairobi in 2014 and had become a favourite of blue chip companies and rich parastatals. The New York-based firm was hired by East African Breweries Limited (EABL) to advise on efficient movement of products from its Ruaraka factory to distributors and on to retailers across the country. Local companies The firm has worked for the National Bank of Kenya (NBK), KCB and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), among other local companies. Mr Joseph, defended the joint venture between KLM and KQ which some of the airline’s critics, especially its pilots, claim was to the airline’s disadvantage . “Right now KLM is the best partner for us in terms of the route structure. The benefit is to KQ because KLM flies more routes and sells more tickets. We get revenues from the countries we don’t fly to into the joint venture. In the end, we benefit,” Joseph said. He conceded there was ‘some room for improvement’ in the partnership. KLM, for instance, no longer had veto powers over the choice of the the airline’s chief executive or any other members of the senior team. According to the joint venture, revenues from routes flown by both airlines from East Africa (Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya), to, Amsterdam, Paris London and other European destinations were put into the joint venture. “As an example, KLM sells more tickets originating from Nairobi than KQ because many of the tickets bought here go to other destinations belonging to KLM that KQ cannot fly to,” he said.

But KLM takes away more money from the joint venture on costs given that it has more expensive planes than KQ. What is left is now divided into two equal half’s between them. “They have two members on the board because they have 24 or 25 per cent of the shares just like the government has two members for the 28 per cent of the shares. One board member for every 10 per cent shares and that is it,” he said. Joseph added that the airline only uses some of the KLM staff in its management. Currently there are two new executives in the top management seconded to Kenya Airways. There other employees in other lower levels of the airline. In a bid to stem the losses, the airline has had to take painful decisions and had to sell some of its assets to free up money to meet its daily obligations. So far, it has fired almost 100 employees in its restructuring plan known as “Operation Pride” and it is preparing for the second phase of sackings that will see off another batch of employees. The airline said it had stopped mass sackings. The company put up for sale a prime plot in Embakasi and has also sold parking slots at Heathrow Airport. It has also sold a number of planes and leased others. Since March this year, the company sub-leased two Boeing 787 and three Boeing 773 aircraft as part of the turnaround initiatives aimed at increasing its liquidity. The airline is also shaking up its management, with replacements both at the board and the senior management levels. The end to the process will be the exit of Ngunze. Those who have left include its long-serving finance director Alex Mbugua and former chief operating officer and fleet director Rick Sine. Others who have exited include Gerard Clarke (commercial director) and Alban Mwendar (human resources director). ALSO READ: KRA now goes after firm in Sh5b health scam for tax evasion Technical staff The exits were given momentum by a series of pilot strikes since October last year. The airline is also facing persistent pressure from pilots who want a complete overhaul of the management team. The airline has also lost between 60 and 70 technical staff in the engineering unit to competitors, especially to Middle East carriers. The airline said the final forensic audit by Deloitte will be submitted to the board but it has been acting on the findings. The explosive report had shown that the airline lost billions of shillings from ticket sales, sale of aircraft and has some money stuck in foreign countries due to currency blocking. “There were nine different reports and we have taken steps where necessary. We have to involve the board and shareholders,” Joseph said. He declined to give the number of people who have faced some action due to the findings of the report but indicated that they are less than ten. The firm said there were some errors in the report by Deloitte which have now been rectified after consultation. “It was a smoke screen. There were some things in the report that were not true but there were others that were true,” Joseph said.

The Ex-Im bank, as it's called, assists U.S. companies' overseas business by doing things such as guaranteeing loans for foreign buyers of U.S. products, or insuring transactions. The agency takes on credit risks that private companies, including banks, aren't willing to accept. Republican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, a vocal critic of the bank, is maintaining his opposition, a spokesperson said Friday. Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who co-sponsored a bill with Amash to abolish the bank, also said Friday that it should be repealed. And the conservative advocacy group Heritage Action reiterated that it believes the bank should be dismantled. More than 90 lawmakers have previously opposed the bank, according to a list compiled by the group. "The Export-Import Bank is little more than a corporate welfare agency," Heritage Action said in a statement Friday. Supporters of Ex-Im point out that such banks exist in one form or another among most developed nations, and U.S. companies would be at a disadvantage without the bank when they're bidding against rivals from Europe, China and elsewhere for overseas deals. Trump's position on the bank shifted over the course of his presidential campaign. Initially, he rejected the bank, calling it "excess baggage" in a 2015 interview with National Journal. But he later appeared to soften that stance and said last spring that he would make his position clear soon. "Ex-Im is a key competitive issue for our U.S. workforce and the 1.5 million American workers in our supply chain nationwide." -Dennis Muilenburg, CEO, Boeing On Thursday, two Democratic senators said that Trump indicated he would support the bank following a lunch with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In addition, they said Trump promised to fill two vacant seats on the bank's board, which in the meantime is barred from financing deals of more than $10 million. "I specifically talked with the president about the need to get the Export-Import Bank up and running," Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota said. "It's great news he agreed." Controversy over whether Congress should renew the bank's charter forced it to shut down for several months in 2015. The opposition was led by conservative Republicans — including South CarolinaRep. Mick Mulvaney, who has been nominated by Trump to serve as head of the Office of Management and Budget. A spokesperson for Mulvaney did not respond to a request for comment. Last year, the Ex-Im bank said it authorized $5 billion in deals that drove $8 billion worth of exports. It also estimated it supported 52,000 jobs and returned $284 million to the Treasury. Though the bank said that 90 percent of its authorizations are for small businesses, Boeing is one of its biggest beneficiaries. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg has urged the administration to support the bank and fill the vacant board positions. "Ex-Im is a key competitive issue for our U.S. workforce and the 1.5 million American workers in our supply chain nationwide," the company said in a statement. "Ex-Im bank plays an important role in supporting American competitiveness and U.S. manufacturing by leveling the playing field for manufacturers and their suppliers."

News Business Business News What happened when Sweden tried six-hour working days Participants felt healthier, happier, had more energy and were more productive - so why has the trial stopped with no plans to revive it? Ben Chapman Friday 10 February 2017 18:45 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Stockholm, capital of Sweden. The country is the best place for an expat family to raise children, a new survey has shown Ola Ericson/imagebank.sweden.se A six-hour working day with full-time wages sounds like a dream for most people, but for a group of 70 Swedish nurses it has been a reality for the past two years. They were part of a trial aimed at testing the benefits of less work, which has gained huge attention around the world. But is the nine to five really going to be a thing of the past? The results of the trial released so far are encouraging. Nurses working shorter hours took less sick days, felt healthier and were more productive. They also said they were 20 per cent happier on average and had more energy at work and in their spare time. This allowed them to arrange 85 per cent more physical activities with elderly residents, the study found. Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, who has now gone back to eight-hour shifts, told the BBC: “I feel that I am more tired than I was before.” Read more Sweden’s six-hour working day is ‘too expensive’ and could be scrapped “During the trial all the staff had more energy. I could see that everybody was happy.” Despite the positive results there was one big problem: the cost. The city of Gothenburg spent £12m kronor (£1.1m) on the trial, largely because it had to hire 17 extra nurses to cover the lost hours. Even in Sweden, famed for its generous welfare state, this is apparently too much to bear. “Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive,” Daniel Bernmar, a Left Party councillor who has backed the Gothenburg pilot scheme said. “It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating." Read more Sweden scraps six hours work day despite improved staff wellbeing Sweden’s six-hour working day is ‘too expensive’ and could be scrapped Six-hour days 'make workers happier and more productive' Six-hour working day 'boosts productivity and makes people happier' While it may have captured many headlines, as well as the attention of overworked people around the globe, the idea of a six hour working day has struggled to gain widespread political support in Sweden. The Left Party is the only party in the country that backs shorter working hours and won just 6 per cent of the vote in the last general election.  Attempts to prove the economic efficiency of reduced hours have produced inconclusive so far. A handful of trials in the 1990s and 2000s were scrapped due to a lack of definitive data.  Another recent Swedish trial at a retirement home in the town of Umeå found that sick leave actually rose, from 8 per cent to 9.3 per cent. One success has come at Toyota’s Swedish service centre where shifts were cut in 2003, sparking an immediate boost to productivity and increased profits. The company has kept the shorter hours ever since. If a six-hour day isn’t catching on in Sweden, with its famously generous welfare system and emphasis on work-life balance, there seems little hope for workers in “Anglo Saxon” economies like the UK. But some companies have taken up the idea. Liverpool-based Agent Marketing first trialled shorter days for two months in early 2016.  Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Rex 32/32 Speaking to The Independent, Agent’s managing director Paul Corcoran said: “There were loads of really great benefits. People were refreshed and more creative. It was good for effectiveness and efficiency.” Clients also noticed the happiness of the employees which helped win business, Corcoran said. Agent stuck rigidly to the six hour format at first which led to some impressive changes. Corcoran said one hour meetings have been cut to fifteen minutes because of the imperative to save time. But he added: “There were challenges surrounding it. Surprisingly it sometimes actually brought about more stress, because people feel they’ve got to get their work done more quickly in order to go earlier,” Corcoran said. Eventually, the company settled for a compromise - every Friday is a six hours and employees can each choose another shorter day each week. The other three are normal business hours. But the benefits have remained, with happier, more productive employees, Corcoran said. The company also provides meditation, pilates and a monthly massage to all staff. But even this seemingly perfect workplace can’t avoid commercial realities.  “In the end, the most important thing is getting the work done for our clients otherwise we’ll be doing zero hour working days because we would have no clients,” Corcoran said.

Mr Bayburd, what is the underlying value behind the agreement signed? Does that imply that Russia and Georgia, which do not practically maintain diplomatic relations, are entering into a new phase of normalizing relations? Russia and Georgia, as countries not having diplomatic relations, are trying through this and the Geneva meeting, etc., to attain a certain outcome. In 2016, the trade turnover between the two countries was about US $1 billion. This testifies to the fact that despite the tense situation, the ruling authorities in Georgia are seeking reconciliation and normalization of trade relations, which is absolutely right. But as opposed to the Georgian authorities, Russia does not quite pursue the right policies in relation to the neighbor. What is wrong about the Russian policies? Is Georgia the only side offering concessions? There is a precondition ruling out any talks on Georgia’s lost territories; however, there is also a society in Georgia, which has its own demands. Russia does not even lift visas for Georgian citizens, notwithstanding the fact that Georgia applied the measure to Russian citizens several years ago. As a matter of fact, Russia too, has its own problems – sanctions, etc. But it has to pursue soft policies in relation to a country which is its neighbor.   You say the Georgian authorities conduct more flexible policies. Anyway, they are giving effect to an agreement concluded under Saakashvili back in 2011. So it wasn’t practically effective for six years ... Yes, but Russia was claimed to have occupied 20% of Georgia then. And that’s something Russia does not want to even hear about. So that too, is a possible cause.   The same agreement contains a clause proposing negotiations without any mention of the two territories’ status or any other precondition. So what’s the price for which Georgia concluded the agreement with Russia? There are numerous treaties – also the one signed in 2008 - but nobody actually pays attention to them. Other negotiations are now under way, as they are trying to reach an outcome, but those concessions and every other measure must not be unilateral. Russia too, must make certain concessions, at least a little bit.   Betghehem Arabyan Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 13:31 • 11/02 Deadly earthquake in southern Philippines kills four 13:22 • 11/02 FA increases investment in anti-doping program 13:16 • 11/02 Serzh Sargsyan congratulate Iranian leaders on Islamic Revolution anniversary 13:11 • 11/02 Turkey’s Erdogan backs referendum on presidential power 13:03 • 11/02 Trump urges Iran’s Rouhani ‘to be careful’ 12:58 • 11/02 Mont Blanc pays homage to Johannes Kepler with $1.5 million pen 12:48 • 11/02 Zhoghovurd: Statistics reveals increasing capital flow from Armenia 12:17 • 11/02 Nagorno-Karabakh reports intensive Azerbaijani ceasefire violations 12:03 • 11/02 Trump considering new travel ban 20:34 • 10/02 Georgia, Russia to upgrade trade relations after launch of Abkhazia-South Ossetia corridor – politician 19:30 • 10/02 French farmer fined for aiding migrants 19:13 • 10/02 German court upholds ban insulting Erdogan 18:40 • 10/02 Erdogan signals reinstatement of death penalty after constitutional referendum 18:25 • 10/02 Jackie Kennedy rejected British suitor's marriage proposal, letters reveal 18:07 • 10/02 Russia expects no policy change in Armenia after parliament polls – ambassador 18:02 • 10/02 German court upholds ban on poem insulting Erdoğan 17:41 • 10/02 Hundreds of thousands rally in Iran against Trump, chant 'Death to America' 17:29 • 10/02 Iranian, Armenian FMs mark 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations 17:15 • 10/02 Moscow to ‘help approximate positions’ on Karabakh - ambassador 17:00 • 10/02 Disney to buy most of Euro Disney 16:47 • 10/02 Alex Textile company to create 350 jobs 16:35 • 10/02 Tsarukyan vows to restore ‘social justice' and 'public confidence’ 16:02 • 10/02 Katy Perry back with new single 'Chained to the Rhythm' 15:51 • 10/02 Ukraine to see visa liberalization with EU before summer – Juncker 15:36 • 10/02 Oil prices up on 90% compliance on OPEC output deal 15:24 • 10/02 Gagik Tsarukyan back to his post as Prosperous Armenia leader 15:22 • 10/02 Rule of Law party stops activities 15:04 • 10/02 Estimated projects in nature protection worth US $420m – minister   14:45 • 10/02 Kenya's Jepchirchir breaks half marathon world record 14:27 • 10/02 Prince's music is coming to streaming services 14:14 • 10/02 Football: Mkhitaryan wins January goal of month 13:53 • 10/02 Lasting settlement of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in Armenia’s interests - Lukas Gasser 13:42 • 10/02 We need efforts to make Armenia tourism brand – Swiss ambassador 13:09 • 10/02 Nagorno-Karabakh dismisses Azerbaijan’s 'disinformation campaign' 13:02 • 10/02 Armenia needs to be perceived as stable country - Lukas Gasser 12:53 • 10/02 Peru exp-president may face arrest 12:45 • 10/02 George and Amal Clooney expecting twins - reports 12:27 • 10/02 Turkey, US agree to boost cooperation 12:12 • 10/02 Armenian CEC chairman promises awareness-raising campaign 11:11 • 10/02 Zhoghovurd: Civil Contract refutes negotiations on alliance 10:25 • 10/02 Azerbaijan commits more ceasefire violations 09:52 • 10/02 Hraparak: President finds original solution to campaign office head problem 09:25 • 10/02 MRI pioneer and Nobel laureate Sir Peter Mansfield dies 09:10 • 10/02 Seven killed in Bali village landslide in Indonesia 08:48 • 10/02 Trump loses appeal court bid to reinstate travel ban 20:10 • 09/02 Armenia, Iran to expand insurance cooperation 19:20 • 09/02 Armenia’s defense minister, German ambassador discuss bilateral cooperation 18:43 • 09/02 Electronic voter registration to be tested at local elections in Armenia 18:00 • 09/02 EU decides against visa validation at Turkish ports for Greek islands 17:22 • 09/02 Merkel seeks to ramp up failed asylum seeker deportations 17:03 • 09/02 Azerbaijan ready for new meeting over Nagorno-Karabakh – Mammadyarov 16:50 • 09/02 Twitter reports slowest quarterly revenue growth 16:37 • 09/02 Coca-Cola reports seventh straight drop in quarterly revenue 16:21 • 09/02 Archaeologists discover New Dead Sea Scrolls cave 16:10 • 09/02 Armenia recalling its ambassador to Belarus means no ambassador to any country – Alexander Iskandaryan 15:59 • 09/02 Michael Jackson estate in £800 million tax battle due to star’s uncontrollable spending habit 15:47 • 09/02 Tokyo 2020 Olympic medals to be made from old phones 15:36 • 09/02 Womb with a view!

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News BUDGET 2017 Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio BLink Agri Business Logistics Macro Economy Policy US to India: Speed up talks on defence foundational pacts Nayanima Basu comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Reuters US Defence Secretary James Mattis PTI Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar Parrikar, US Defence Secretary discuss the issue over phone New Delhi, February 9:   The US has asked India to “expedite” the talks on concluding two foundational defence agreements in an effort to strengthen military ties between both countries even as American aero-defence firms are eyeing the Indian market to make huge investments under the ‘Make in India’ programme. The issue was discussed during a telephonic conversation between the new US Secretary of Defence James Mattis and Minister of Defence Manohar Parrikar that took place late Wednesday evening, sources told BusinessLine. US has been asking India to complete the ongoing negotiations on concluding the two foundational pacts, out of which one has already been signed. These two pacts are Communication and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). So far India has signed only one of out of the three American defence foundational agreements. It is called the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), which is a tweaked version of the Logistics Services Agreement (LSA). This was signed in 2016 and it stipulates exchange of logistics support and supplies. However, the LEMOA is yet to be implemented by India, which is causing concern in the US, according to sources. “It will be helpful if India and US are able to sign all three foundational agreements otherwise it makes things more challenging. So the overall feeling is progress should be made in the foundational pacts,” said Benjamin Schwartz, Director for Aerospace and Defense, US-India Business Council (USIBC). The phone-call between both defence heads also assumes significance as it happened just days before the ‘Aero India’ show starts in Bengaluru from February 14-18 in which American defence firms are participating in large numbers, especially the jet makers Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which are eyeing to sell their fighter planes to the Indian Air Force. India was also seeking an assurance from the US that it plans to continue with the defence deals that were being discussed with the previous Obama administration. “In their first conversation, Secretary Mattis committed to build upon the tremendous progress in bilateral defence cooperation made in recent years, underscoring the strategic importance of the US-India relationship and India’s role in advancing global peace and security,” said the Pentagon Press Secretary Jeff Davis. Defence exports from US to India have already reached $15 billion. US has recently made the required changes in its export control laws for easier transfer of technology and defence equipment between both countries thereby recognising India as a ‘Major Defence Partner’.

Cooper hijacking Image Credit: Courtesy: FBIA police identikit shows how authorities believe the suspect may have looked. More than four decades later, three amateur scientists think they may have found evidence that would narrow down Cooper’s identity to that of an aerospace engineer. Published: 19:10 February 10, 2017 LAT   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE LOS ANGELES It was “one of the longest and most exhaustive investigations” in FBI history — and to this day remains the only unsolved skyjacking in the United States. In 1971, a well-dressed passenger hijacked a Northwest Orient flight, demanded $200,000 (equivalent to $1.2 million or Dh4.4 million in 2017) and later escaped by parachuting out of the back of the plane with the ransom money. But who exactly was “D.B. Cooper,” the mysterious man who managed to pull off the heist and disappear without a trace? More than four decades later, three amateur scientists think they may have found evidence that would narrow down Cooper’s identity to that of an aerospace engineer or a manager. The scientists, working for a group called Citizen Sleuths, said they have been analysing particles found on a clip-on necktie that Cooper left on his seat — 18E — before jumping out of the plane. To the naked eye, the piece of fabric was a nondescript black tie from J.C. Penney. But to the modern-day scientists, the tie was an “incredibly fortunate” piece of evidence in the investigation. “A tie is one of the only articles of clothing that isn’t washed on a regular basis,” reads a section on the Citizen Sleuths website devoted solely to the tie. “It picks up dirt and grime just like any other piece of clothing, but that accumulation never truly gets ‘reset’ in the washing machine. Each of those particles comes from something and somewhere and can tell a story if the proper instruments like electron microscopes are used.” Using a powerful electron microscope, the scientists say, they have identified more than 100,000 particles of “rare earth elements” on the tie, including Cerium, Strontium sulphide and pure titanium, according to the Associated Press. Of those, titanium was the most notable. “Titanium was a rare metal in 1971 and this makes it extremely unlikely it is a post-event contamination,” Citizen Sleuths notes on its site, which lays out in painstaking detail all of the findings from the case. “Its presence constrains Cooper to a limited number of managers or engineers in the titanium field that would wear ties to work.” ‘Engineer or manager’ At the time, they noted, the element was used extensively by the military in aircraft and helicopters. Scientists think he may have worked at Boeing, which at the time happened to be developing a Super Sonic Transport plane that used those elements, Tom Kaye, a lead researcher with Citizen Sleuths, told King 5 News. “The tie went with him into these manufacturing environments, for sure, so he was not one of the people running these [manufacturing machines],” Kaye told the news station. “He was either an engineer or a manager in one of the plants.” He added that the group was asking anyone from the public with information to contact researchers through the Citizen Sleuths website. “Someone may be able to look at those particles and say, ‘Oh my gosh, I know what that means having those particles on the tie,’” Kaye told the news station. The mystery began on November 24, 1971, when a nondescript man going by the name of Dan Cooper purchased a one-way ticket from Portland, Oregon, to Seattle directly from the Northwest Orient Airlines counter on the day of the flight. He used cash to pay for his ticket, then boarded the plane. Authorities later described him as someone in his mid-40s, dressed as an “executive” in a suit, a white shirt and what probably is the now-infamous black tie. The agency’s official summary of how the hijacking unfolded reads like the plot of a Hollywood thriller from another era: “He ordered a drink — bourbon and soda — while the flight was waiting to take off. A short time after 3pm, he handed the stewardess a note indicating that he had a bomb in his briefcase and wanted her to sit with him. “The stunned stewardess did as she was told. Opening a cheap attach case, Cooper showed her a glimpse of a mass of wires and red coloured sticks and demanded that she write down what he told her. Soon, she was walking a new note to the captain of the plane that demanded four parachutes and $200,000 in twenty-dollar bills. “When the flight landed in Seattle, the hijacker exchanged the flight’s 36 passengers for the money and parachutes. Cooper kept several crew members, and the plane took off again, ordered to set a course for Mexico City. “Somewhere between Seattle and Reno, a little after 8pm, the hijacker did the incredible: He jumped out of the back of the plane with a parachute and the ransom money. The pilots landed safely, but Cooper had disappeared into the night and his ultimate fate remains a mystery to this day.” The FBI pursued hundreds of leads. No body or parachute was ever found, but in 1980, a boy digging near the Columbia River found three bundles of $20 bills whose serial numbers matched the money Cooper had demanded. — Los Angeles Times More from USA Rain Enhancement Science winner files patent The titanium clue...

(YouTube) Join us on the new C-Pop podcast where Taylor and Jessilyn discuss, debate and sometimes deride pop culture with a strong sense of humor and a focus on Christ. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com. For years, the liberal media have given Bill Nye a platform to rant about his liberal views, and now Netflix will give him an entire show.  Nye, "The Science Guy," is one of the media's favorite global-warming alarmists. He will star in a new Netflix show called Bill Nye Saves the World which will debut in the Spring of 2017. Variety's TV Editor Laura Prudom reported that the show will attempt to refute religious leaders and politicians who espouse "anti-scientific claims." Nye told Variety each episode will take on "complex scientific issues facing us today" such as "vaccinations, genetically modified foods and climate change." CNN, NBC, MSNBC, CBS and ABC have all had Nye on to bash creationism theory or to hype the threat of man-made global warming. During a blizzard in Jan. 2015, he told MSNBC viewers the "storm is connected to climate change" and said those who would use a snowstorm to dispute global warming were "unglued." In 2010, he even labeled Americans who are skeptical of climate change "unpatriotic." Bashing creationists, Nye has said that skepticism of evolution is an "extraordinary world view. And as I say, by extraordinary, I mean obviously wrong." Unsurprisingly, Nye has also denied the existence of God altogether (though he said 100 percent certainty isn't possible), but what may be surprise some people is that he is not a scientist. "The Science Guy's" education is actually a degree in engineering. He worked as an engineer for Boeing and performed stand-up comedy before gaining the nickname "The Science Guy" and earning national fame with the Disney show Bill Nye the Science Guy. Nye is also the CEO of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit that seeks to empower the "world's citizens to advance space science and exploration." "With the right science and good writing, we'll do our best to enlighten and entertain our audience. And, perhaps we'll change the world a little," Nye said of the new show.

Speaking to the news agency TASS, Ivan Volynkin said his country increased attention to the unsettled conflict especially after the April blitzkrieg. “After the April 2016 four-day war along the Nagorno-Karabakh Line of Contact (which, notably, was halted thanks to Russia’s timely intervention), the co-chairing countries [of the OSCE Minsk Group] have undertaken a range of steps towards normalizing the situation,” he said, citing the subsequent summits in Vienna, Austria and St Petersburg, Russia. Meantime the diplomat admitted that none of the agreements reached at the high-level talks (deployment of investigative mechanisms along the frontline and expansion of the OSCE observers’ mission in the conflict zone) was implemented. Volynkin also highlighted the late December escalations along Armenia’s north-eastern border with Azerbaijan. “An Armenian serviceman died then; also, an Azerbaijani soldier committing an offensive action was killed on Armenia’s territory.”  “All Russia wants is to return peace and stability to the South Caucasus. We see no alternative to a peaceful settlement. In collaboration with our partners in the Minsk Group, we will continue the joint efforts towards approximating the sides’ positions,” he added.

The Hamburg court upheld its injunction issued in May banning re-publication of particular parts of the poem, which comedian Jan Boehmermann recited on television last March. The case soured already tense relations between Germany and Turkey at a time when the European Union was looking to Ankara for support in tackling the migrant crisis. The crux of the legal arguments centered on the right to artistic freedom with the personal rights of Erdoğan, the court has said. In its May order, the court marked 18 of the poem’s 24 verses as “abusive and defamatory” and banned them.  “The court found that artistic freedom is unconditional but not unbounded,” the court said in its ruling on Feb. 10. “Satire that is secured under artistic freedom could be forbidden when it touches on the core area of personal freedom.” However, explaining why some verses should be allowed, the court said freedom of expression remained paramount. “The court stresses that the plaintiff, as a head of state, must accept heavy criticism, as freedom of expression arises from the special need to criticize power,” the court said, explaining its decision to allow re-publication of some verses.  In October, prosecutors in the city of Mainz dropped a separate investigation into Boehmermann. Chancellor Angela Merkel had been widely criticised for allowing investigators to pursue the case against the comedian. The German cabinet last month agreed to rescind a section of the criminal code prohibiting insults against foreign leaders.

They carried "Death to America" banners and effigies of Trump, while a military police band played traditional Iranian revolutionary songs. State TV showed footage of people stepping on Trump's picture in a central Tehran street. Marchers carried the Iranian flag and banners saying: "Thanks Mr. Trump for showing the real face of America." "America and Trump cannot do a damn thing. We are ready to sacrifice our lives for our leader", a young Iranian man told state TV in a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Last week, Trump put Iran "on notice" in reaction to a Jan. 29 Iranian missile test and imposed fresh sanctions on individuals and entities. Iran said it will not halt its missile program.

News Business Business Comment Robert the Rail Regulatory Engine is late again Thomas's pal likes to chug around like he's important but if he actually did his job the railways would be in a better state  James Moore @JimMooreJourno Friday 10 February 2017 15:40 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Choo choo! Another imagining of what it might be like if Thomas worked for the privatised railways PA “Choo choo,” Thomas the Privatised Franchise Tank Engine tooted cheerily.

He was a relentlessly cheerful soul.  Gordon reflected that he could really use Thomas’s determined refusal to let the state of Britain’s privatised railways get him down. It might help to keep him away from the whisky that he quietly chugged out of the Fat Controller’s sight.  But on this day, he wasn’t feeling very tolerant. He’d been left stranded at the station after a near riot had broken out over ticketing and over crowding. Pushed to the limit, his passengers had staged a sit down strike leaving him stranded at the station.

He’ll be along in a jiffy.” Gordon sighed again. It frustrated him that Thomas, having come from a series of books aimed at pre schoolers, had to be talked to as if he was one to get the point across.  “Thomas, Robert is a Rail Regulation Engine,” he said. “The clue is in the name. There’s only one thing you can be sure of with Rail Regulation Engines: They’re always late. Like a lot of trains these days, come to think about it.” “But, but, I saw Robert this morning. He said they’d sent mystery shoppers out all over Sodor and found out  lots of people were buying the wrong tickets from the machines and paying too much. He’s told me he's determined to get this ticketing malarky sorted! He’s written a firm letter to the rail company and told it he’s very cross and this has to be sorted out.” “You’re finished for the day now, right?” Gordon asked, looking at his watch. It was lunchtime. For some reason, Thomas never seemed to have to work the sort of hours his friends put in.   “Yes.” “OK, pull into the siding, and see what happens.” Thomas did as he was asked, keeping up a cheery monologue that he hoped might improve Gordon’s mood. Gordon just wished he’d taken the risk of stashing the nice bottle of aged Lagavulin he’d squirrelled away in his cab.  Late in the afternoon, Robert chugged lazily into the station: “Hullo chaps, what seems to be the problem here then?” Gordon explained what had happened and why he was sitting on the station surrounded by press people with cameras and besuited officials from the rail company, all jostling for position as Primrose the PR woman held court. She had, of course, told Gordon to keep quiet if he knew what was good for him because his employment contract banned him from talking to the media.  “There’s no need for these passengers to make a fuss really,” she said. “The Rail Delivery Group is trialling a system that will ensure passengers get the cheapest fare when they use our ticket machines.” “Yes,” Robert called over. “And we’ll send out our mystery shoppers again to keep an eye and promise to write a really cross letter if it doesn’t work.” Slowly, the passengers started to file off Gordon. They’d made their protest and they’d had enough. It wasn’t long before the trains were chugging back to the sheds where Thomas excitedly told all his friends the news.  Business picture of the day 32 show all Business picture of the day 1/32 Lettuce crisis hits those who love it most: hungry British sea turtles - Friday February 10 The UK’s vegetable crisis has not only gripped the country’s supermarkets and healthy eaters, but also a bale of 12 hungry green sea turtles in aquariums across the country.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Kellyanne Conway prior to a forum at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge. (AP Photo) The White House has "counseled" a top aide to President Donald Trump after she promoted Ivanka Trump's fashion line during a national cable television appearance from the White House. But House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz says that's not enough, calling what Kellyanne Conway did "wrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable." The Utah Republican congressman said he will join with Democratic Oversight Leader Elijah Cummings to ask the Office of Government Ethics to review the matter. Chaffetz also said he will write a formal letter to the White House lodging his irritation. He said White House press secretary Sean Spicer's remark that Conway has been "counseled" doesn't go far enough. "It needs to be dealt with," he said in an interview with The Associated Press. It's the first time during the young administration that Chaffetz has questioned an ethical matter. Speaking later to Utah lawmakers, Chaffetz added: "Of course I'm going to call that out. My job is not to be a cheerleader for the president." The ethics dustup began Wednesday with the president himself. Reacting to news that a department store had dropped his daughter's line of clothing and accessories, Trump tweeted — and retweeted from the official presidential account — that Ivanka Trump had been treated "so unfairly by @Nordstrom." Ivanka Trump does not have a specific role in the White House but moved to Washington with her husband, Jared Kushner, who is one of Trump's closest advisers. She followed her father's approach on business ties by handing over operating control of her fashion company but retaining ownership of it. In a Thursday morning interview with Fox News from the White House briefing room, Conway urged people to "go buy Ivanka's stuff," boasting that she was giving the brand "a free commercial here." While Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are not subject to ethical regulations and laws for federal employees, Conway, who is a counselor to the president, is. Among the rules: An employee shall not use his or her office "for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise." "For whatever reason, the White House staff evidently believes that they are protected from the law the same way the president and vice president are," said Stuart Gilman, a former special assistant to the director of Office of Government Ethics. He called Conway's comments "unbelievable" and said they risk wrecking the U.S.'s reputation around the world as a model for government employee ethics. Midday Thursday, the Office of Government Ethics sent out a series of tweets saying the office has seen an "extraordinary" response from people emailing, calling and submitting information online about "recent events." The office advises federal employees on such issues but is not an enforcement agency; enforcement falls to Congress, the General Accounting Office, the FBI, various inspectors general and others, OGE noted on Twitter. Ultimately, it is up to Trump to punish employees for ethics infractions. In addition to the House Oversight Committee, two liberal-funded government watchdog groups pounced on Conway's comments, filing ethics violation complaints with the Office of Government Ethics. "Conway's action reflects an ongoing careless disregard of the conflicts of interest laws and regulations by some members of the Trump family and Trump administration," said Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also lodged a complaint. Spicer said Wednesday that Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter" when he posted the tweet and that "he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." Ethics lawyers had a different interpretation. The implication, intended or not: Hurt my daughter's business, and the Oval Office will come after you. "This is a shot across the bow to everybody who is doing business with Trump or his family," said Norman Eisen, who was President Barack Obama's chief ethics counselor. "It's warning them: Don't withdraw their business." Trump's son Donald Jr. tweeted a link Thursday to a story on the Breitbart conservative news website saying that women across the country are cutting up their Nordstrom cards and planning boycotts after the decision to drop his sister's brand. Though Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors, ethics experts say this time was different because it involved his daughter's business, raising conflict-of-interest concerns. Ethics experts have criticized Trump's plan to separate himself from his sprawling real estate business by handing managerial control to his two adult sons. The experts want him to sell his company. Most modern presidents have sold their financial holdings and put the cash raised in a blind trust whose investments remained unknown to them. Eisen joined with other legal scholars and lawyers to sue the president last month for allegedly violating a clause in the Constitution that prohibits government officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments. Trump and his top aides have repeatedly said that Americans do not care about what Eisen and other ethics critics say. "Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world," Trump wrote on Twitter Nov. 21. Nordstrom reiterated Wednesday that its decision to drop Ivanka Trump's brand was based on its performance, not politics. The company said sales of her items had steadily declined over the past year, particularly in the last half of 2016, "to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now."

News Business Business News Plumber wins legal battle for workers' rights in landmark case for gig economy Self-employed workers such as those who work for Uber, Deliveroo and other gig economy jobs could also be entitled to sick pay and other benefits after the ruling Ben Chapman Friday 10 February 2017 16:58 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Many self-employed contractors like Gary Smith could be entitled to sick pay and other workers’ rights XP A plumber has won a legal battle for employment rights that could have implications for thousands of workers across Britain’s booming gig economy.  The Court of Appeal ruled that Gary Smith, who worked for Pimlico Plumbers for six years until 2011, was entitled to basic rights such as sick pay even though he was technically self-employed. Mr Smith claimed he was dismissed following a heart attack and sued Pimlico for sick pay.  Read more Uber’s latest legal hit sends a message to the global sharing economy The case is the latest of several that have scrutinised the relationship between independent contractors and companies such as Uber, Deliveroo and parcel delivery firm Hermes. This is the highest UK court so far to consider such a case and could mean greater protections for thousands of independent contractors working job-to-job with little security and limited employment rights. The number of gig economy jobs has surged in recent years but campaigners have said it leaves many with no guarantee of earnings and no protection if they cannot work. In some cases workers claim they have been paid less than minimum wage. Natalie Razeen at Russell-Cooke said: “Self-employment was once seen as a sign of having successfully established oneself and of finally being able to pursue one’s ambitions on one’s own terms. “However, the advent of the ‘gig’ economy has meant that many of those now classified as self-employed are not necessarily ‘living the dream’. “In fact it can be quite the opposite, as the truly self-employed will not enjoy basic rights such as the right not to suffer discrimination. They may therefore find it difficult to rely on the businesses they contract with providing flexibility when it is needed.” Jonathan Chamberlain, partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, said the ruling was the latest to examine business models “which seek to control people as if they were employees but pay them as if they were not. “Once again, the so-called 'self-employed' have been found to be workers,” Mr Chamberlain said, warning that as long there is disparity in pay, tax and legal protections between different forms of employment, businesses will continue to take advantage. The judgment is a “wake-up call for employers reliant on independent contractors as an integral part of their businesses”, according to Naeema Choudry, partner at Eversheds Sutherland. Judges warned that the ruling would not necessarily be applicable to all workers in similar positions.

Scottish Power announced standard energy prices will increase by an average of 7.8 per cent from 31 March, adding an extra £86 a year to a typical customer’s bill, according to the company. Electricity prices will increase by an average of 10.8 per cent, while gas prices will go up by an average of 4.7 per cent. Read more Npower to increase energy prices by 9.8 per cent from mid-March Scottish Power said around 1.1 million, or a third of its customers, will be affected by the price hike. “This price change follows months of cost increases that have already led to significant rises in fixed price products that now unfortunately have to be reflected in standard prices,” said Colin McNeill, UK retail director for Scottish Power. Separately on Friday, British Gas owner Centrica said that the freeze that it is implementing had been made possible “despite increases in external costs”.

The people it impacts are paying too much for their energy anyway because they’re on standard tariffs. If anything it’ll make them less likely to switch and save,” she added.

News Business Business Comment Brexit: Not just Bundesbank that should fear regulation-lite City of London after UK leaves the EU Financial services is an industry that attracts sharks, and could cause damage beyond these shores if the UK tries to follow the lead of Singapore James Moore @JimMooreJourno Friday 10 February 2017 11:43 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The City of London Getty Pah. Well of course the Germans would say that the UK won’t be the gateway to Europe after Brexit and then go on to issue dire warnings about the dangers of freeing the City of London from the shackles of its Euro-chains.  They’ll be the losers as the good ship Britannia steams alongside Donald Trump’s aircraft carrier into a glorious Anglo Saxon de-regulated future with their financial titans standing proud over all. That is how I imagine the average Brexiteer would respond to the reported comments of Bundesbank executive board member Andreas Dombret at a meeting of German businesses and banks fixed up by the Boston Consulting Group.  Read more Brexit will put British patients at 'back of the queue' for new drugs Tim Cook met PM and said the UK would be 'just fine' post Brexit London's status as 'gateway to Europe' at stake, warns top regulator Mr Dombret is to have said that even if banking rules were equivalent, the UK would still be miles away from the single market. No kidding. And that London’s role as the gateway to Europe will end. No kidding (x2).  However, he also made a very important point, namely that it would be a profoundly dangerous move for the UK to attempt to become Europe’s offshore Singapore by slashing tax and regulation.  There is a very real danger of that happening, indeed Prime Minister Theresa May has talked about the UK becoming an enormous tax haven if Europe doesn’t play nice. No doubt cuts to regulation would follow. Insurance companies have already been buttonholing anyone who cares to listen to them in an attempt to get Europe’s Solvency 2 regulations scrapped.  No one with any sense will, and the problem they have at the moment is that, while I might not always agree with him, few would argue that the boss of the Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, is anything other than sensible.  The trouble is, the Government has proved quite willing to elbow aside sensible watchdogs who become troublesome, particularly when they perform their roles in a way that the Chancellor of the day finds inconvenient. That is how Mr Bailey got his job in the first place. His predecessor Martin Wheatley was a mite too hawkish for the City’s taste. So the former occupant of Number 11 Downing Street, George Osborne, opted not to renew his contract.  We should have learned by now that treating the City with a light touch is a dangerous road down which to travel. It was tried by the old Financial Services Authority, and guess which of the West’s big economies took the biggest hit from the financial crisis? Clue: It wasn’t Germany.  Unfortunately, we have become conditioned to business types, and their favourite politicos, growling about red tape and regulation as if they were spawned from the pit of economic hell.  However, those who are willing to think about things, rather than simply relying on in the sort of knee jerk reactions Brexiteers like to indulge in, will be aware that lots of regulations are very necessary.  The ban on lead in petrol, a substance that when I was young was allowed to poison the brains of children living near major roads, is a regulation. The right to return shoddy goods to where you bought them from comes via a regulation The requirement to admit health inspectors to the restaurant that gave you norovirus comes from a regulation. The list goes on, and on, and on.

BERND THISSEN/AFP/Getty Images 3/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The financial crisis should have taught us that. The crises and the scandals that went before it should have taught us that.  They also should have taught us that, however much we might like to sit on our island gazing into our collective navels, this country is part of an interconnected world.  A rule-lite UK has the potential to spread its problems around that world if things go wrong. That’s not something to be proud of, by the way, or to be used as a threat. But it is what the UK appears set upon doing and it's not just the Bundesbank that has cause to be concerned.

News Business Business News Brexit latest: Trade deficit narrows in December while manufacturing jumps Exports of goods to non-EU countries jumped by 7.4 per cent while manufacturing and construction output also increased by more than expectations Josie Cox, Ben Chu Friday 10 February 2017 17:48 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online The ONS said that exports of goods to non-EU countries increased by £1.1bn in December Bloomberg The pound rose against the US dollar on Friday after data showed that the UK’s trade deficit in goods and services narrowed in December and industrial output rose more than expected. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that the deficit fell to £3.3bn in the final month of the year, helped by a sizeable increase in exports to countries outside the European Union. Read more UK economy grows more than expected in final quarter of 2016 Exports of goods to non-EU countries jumped £1.1bn - or 7.4 per cent - to £15.4bn. Total goods exports grew 4.4 per cent, outstripping imports growth of 1.4 per cent. For the final quarter of 2016, the trade deficit narrowed to £8.6bn, down considerably from the previous quarter's £14.1bn deficit. Over the three months imports were up 10.4 per cent, while imports grew just 0.3 per cent. The figures show net trade made a large contribution to GDP growth in the final quarter after being a drag in the previous three months. The ONS report lifted sterling 0.1 per cent to above $1.25 as traders priced in a higher possibility of an earlier interest rate rise from the Bank of England. The pound has fallen by 12 per cent since the UK in June last year voted to leave the EU and Friday’s figures suggest sterling’s slump might be beginning to help exporters. "This suggests that some support may be starting to come from the weakened pound," said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. But other economists were still sceptical of a near term benefit. "We continue to expect the boost to net trade from sterling’s depreciation to be modest, given that the threat of trade barriers will dissuade many firms from investing to export more, and the lack of domestically-produced substitutes for the goods that the UK currently imports," said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Meanwhile, industrial production grew by 1.1 per cent in December, while the manufacturing component increased by 2.1 per cent - a significantly better performance than the consensus of City analysts.

BERND THISSEN/AFP/Getty Images 3/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

News World Americas Donald Trump could privatise ‘obsolete’ air traffic control in bid to improve transport infrastructure President promises to roll back government regulations and reduce business tax Joan Lowy, David Koenig Friday 10 February 2017 10:48 GMT Click to follow The Independent US President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with airline executives in the State Dining Room of the White House Evan Vucci/AP President Donald Trump has told airline and airport executives that he is interested in privatising America's air traffic control system and improving the nation's airports and roads, which he called obsolete.  Trump also promised to roll back government regulations and said he will announce a plan in the next three weeks to reduce taxes on businesses. But he sounded sceptical about raising fees that airline passengers pay to fund airport improvements.  One issue was notably absent during the White House meeting - Trump's executive order to temporarily ban travel to the US from seven mostly-Muslim countries. Airline leaders had criticised the order, which a federal appeals court refused to reinstate after it was suspended by a lower-court ruling.  Airline and airport executives who emerged from the White House meeting called it a positive session.  Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly told Trump the best way to help airlines would be to “modernise the air traffic control system.” He complained that money spent on the system has not improved it.  Read more Trump finally address major tensions with China in overdue phonecall “I hear we're spending billions and billions of dollars, it's a system that's totally out of whack,” Trump said.  Some airline executives and Republicans in Congress have proposed privatising air traffic control because they say the Federal Aviation Administration has moved too slowly on modernisation and would benefit by being removed from the uncertain congressional budget process. Other lawmakers oppose reducing Congress' oversight of aviation, and business and private aircraft owners worry their costs will go up.  Nick Calio, president of Airlines for America, the trade group that represents most major airlines but not Delta, said Trump was “extraordinarily positive” when airline executives urged him to spin off air traffic control operations from the Federal Aviation Administration and place them under the control of a private, nonprofit corporation.  While Trump supported modernising the air traffic system, he did not explicitly endorse privatisation, said another participant, Kevin Burke, president of Airports Council International-North America.  Unlike the US, most countries separate air traffic control duties from their aviation-safety agencies. But it is unusual to actually privatise air traffic operations. Canada is an exception.  Republican congressman Bill Shuster, chairman of the House transportation committee, introduced legislation to privatise the system last year. The bill stalled, however, after running into opposition from other top lawmakers and business-jet owners, who fear that the private corporation's board would be dominated by airlines, and that they would lose access to larger airports and pay a larger share of the system's costs.  The privatisation effort has the backing of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, although other FAA unions are opposed.  The FAA said it has spent $7.5 billion on modernising air traffic control in the last seven years, resulting in $2.7 billion in benefits to passengers and airlines. It predicts it will produce much larger benefits over the next 13 years.  Trump, who once ran his own airline, pledged to help the airlines deliver “the greatest service” with minimum delays and at the lowest cost. He compared infrastructure in the United States unfavourably with other countries.  “Our airports used to be the best, now they're at the bottom of the rung,” he said. “We have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports, we have obsolete trains, we have bad roads. We're going to change all of that.”  Airport officials told Trump they'd like to increase the fee airline passengers pay airports as part of their tickets so that the money could help with modernisation. Airlines oppose an increase, and Trump said he doesn't like raising fees, participants said.  Airlines were partly deregulated in 1978 but must still work closely with government. They complain about recent regulations including fees that raise ticket prices, and rules on how they can advertise fares and what information they must disclose to the public.  American, Delta and United and their unions are appealing to Washington for help in blocking competition from Middle Eastern carriers that they say are unfairly subsidised by their governments, letting them offer artificially low fares. That issue came up only briefly on Thursday, with Trump saying he wants “to make life good” for foreign airlines too.  “They come with big investments,” Trump said. “In many cases those investments are made by their governments, but they are still big investments.”  Earlier this week White House press secretary Sean Spicer praised the economic impact of Norwegian Air, which is basing pilots in the US and ordering US-made planes from Boeing. The US airlines and their unions say Norwegian and the Middle Eastern carriers threaten American jobs.  Trump's travel ban never came up, Spicer said. Protests against last month's order clogged airports, and airlines struggled to comply with the requirement to ban some of their passengers from traveling.  The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March Getty 2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House Getty Images 3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.

United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz, who was at the session with Trump, has also criticised the order.  Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former American executive, said airline leaders were wise not to bring up the subject on Thursday.  “They are in a business which requires a lot of 'go along to get along' with government agencies,” Mann said. “They want to try to make nice.”  AP More about: Donald Trump air traffic control Southwest Airlines Aviation Muslim Travel Ban privatisation infrastructure Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) equipped with a test re-entry vehicle. A team of Air Force Global Strike Command Airmen from the 91st Missile Wing conducted the test launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. GT221 Task Force commander major Neil Copenhaver said: “I am exceedingly proud of the maintainers and operators from the 91st Missile Wing, including those that supported this mission from the onset. "This Task Force worked flawlessly alongside the absolute professionals from the 576 FLTS to make this mission a success. “Promoting the deterrence, assurance and strike capability of the Minuteman III, along with the insight it provides to force readiness, could not be done without the dedication, professionalism and teamwork of the men and women throughout the 91st Missile Wing.” The testing was aimed at validating the operational capability of the ICBM system. The re-entry vehicle, comprising a telemetry package used for operational testing, travelled approximately 4,200 miles to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Built by Boeing, Minuteman III is a ground-based strategic deterrent designed to replace the USAF's LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBM weapon system. Expected to enter operational service in 2027, the missile will remain in service through 2075. "The testing was aimed at validating the operational capability of the ICBM system." Prior to the latest test, the USAF conducted the test launch of the missile in September last year. The test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, by providing data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent. The data collected from test launches will be used by the ICBM community, including the US Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and US Strategic Command for continuing force development evaluation.

Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online,” Conway said. 23 hours ago 30,186 Views 75 Comments Share295 Tweet Email Senior Trump aide, Kellyanne Conway. Image: Carolyn Kaster AP/Press Association Images A KEY AIDE to Donald Trump was facing possible investigation yesterday after pitching the clothing line of the president’s daughter Ivanka on television. Top lawmakers from both camps denounced it as a major ethics breach and urged “disciplinary action.” Speaking with the White House seal clearly visible over her shoulder, Kellyanne Conway gave Ivanka Trump’s clothing a rave review during a Fox interview early yesterday, urging shoppers to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” “This is just a wonderful line,” she said. “I own some of it. I fully – I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.” Conway was clearly channeling the anger expressed a day earlier by the president himself, when he tweeted that Ivanka had been “treated so unfairly” by Nordstrom, an upscale department store chain that dropped her fashion brand.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Source: Donald J. Trump/Twitter But to Washington traditionalists, Conway’s direct pitch from the White House for a product line sold by the president’s child seemed a jaw-dropping – and possibly illegal – misuse of presidential prestige. Democrat Elijah Cummings and Republican Jason Chaffetz – both lawmakers on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which Chaffetz chairs – led calls for Conway to face rebuke. “Conway’s statements clearly violate the ethical principles for federal employees and are unacceptable,” the congressmen said in a letter to the federal ethics chief, Walter Shaub, requesting that he recommend “appropriate disciplinary action” against her. “What she did was wrong, wrong, wrong,” said Chaffetz on Twitter. What she did was wrong, wrong, wrong. Here is our bi-partisan letter to the White House and OGE. #Donteverdothis https://t.co/zqeYhcttMB— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) February 9, 2017 Source: Jason Chaffetz/Twitter The Office of Government Ethics, which Shaub heads, separately said it had been “receiving an extraordinary volume of contacts from citizens about recent events.” Without mentioning Conway by name, it said it was reaching out to the appropriate government agencies who would decide whether to pursue the matter – the established protocol when the OGE learns of “possible ethics violations.” ‘The law is clear’ Conway said the Trump team was “aware” of the lawmakers’ letter and was “reviewing that internally.” She also told Fox News she had spoken with the president about the incident and that he “supports me 100 percent.” “All I can say, at some point in your life, you ought to have a boss who treated me the way that the president is treating me today.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump’s aide had been “counseled” over the issue, without providing more detail. “Kellyanne Conway’s White House Infomercial,” as it was dubbed in a scathing New York Times editorial, again fanned debate over the unprecedented level to which the new president – despite his protestations to the contrary – has mixed politics, business and family, raising questions about conflicts of interest. For Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group which filed a separate complaint, “the law is clear” on such matters. “This is just another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president’s family and supporters.” Boycott calls Since his election in November, Trump has targeted a series of American multinationals by name (General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed and others) for moving production overseas or for allegedly overcharging the government. But his tweet targeting Nordstrom marked the first time he had complained directly about the business interests of one of his adult children. The tweet appeared both on Trump’s personal account and on that of the presidency, @POTUS. Conway with Trump on inauguration day. Source: Evan Vucci AP/Press Association Images The Nordstrom group, with 350 stores in the United States and Canada, has repeatedly denied any political motive to its dropping of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line, saying it was motivated purely by “performance” considerations. Sales had fallen, particularly in last year’s second half. But products carrying a Trump brand, including Ivanka’s, have been boycotted by critics of the new president, leading to his complaint of a political motivation behind Nordstrom’s move. TJX Companies, which operates the clothing store chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls, told AFP it had instructed store employees no longer to display Ivanka Trump products separately. “The communication we sent to TJ Maxx and Marshalls in the US instructed stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor,” a spokesperson told AFP. © – AFP, 2017 Read: Trump attacks ‘terrible’ Nordstrom for dropping Ivanka’s clothing line Read: City mayor confirms there was no massacre at Bowling Green Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

PHOTO: REUTERS US aviation investigators are probing an incident in which a private plane and Donald Trump’s aircraft flew closer than was permitted. The private plane was able to get within two nautical miles of the Florida-bound Air Force One — a distance which is closer than permitted. The planes reportedly flew so close that the “pilots could see each other”, according to sources cited by ABC News.  The encounter occurred on February 3 as Trump flew to Palm Beach International Airport. Trump’s private jet or Air Force One — which is better? Sources told Fox News that there was no risk of collision because the planes were flying parallel to each other. Both planes were also in constant contact with the air traffic control. The incident took place despite special safety precautions in place. When Air Force One is in flight, secret service agents work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) supervisors and monitor threats. Other flights are often diverted or delayed so as to create extra space around the presidential carrier. The FAA declined to comment, saying they were investigating the incident. The National Transportation Safety Board holds authority to examine aviation incidents and was also notified. Boeing wins contract to build new Air Force One presidential jets Air Force One is unlike most aircraft. It has special shielding that would prevent the plane’s components from being destroyed. The plane also has a special communications package that allows the president to receive classified information while in flight. Air Force One boasts a conference room, gym and flares to avoid heat-seeking missiles. It has room for a 102 people and also features a built-in medical centre to monitor the health of the president.

He then joined Virgin Nigeria as a Captain on the B737 Classic. He later became the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). He was responsible for managing the entire Nigerian Airspace and succeeded in laying the foundation for a performance base airspace. He worked in collaboration with other parastatals in the aviation industry (NCAT, Nigeria Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to implement the total radar coverage on the Nigeria Airspace (TRACON). He designed the blue print of capacity building by organizing training for the Air Traffic Controllers and Engineers in the United States. This position in charge of safety of The Nigerian Airspace allowed him to have an insight into safety critical areas of the aeronautical industry including airports management and meteorological services. Captain Sanusi has a blend of best American training and vast experience in African operation. He later joined Arik as a Captain on the Boeing 737-NG and became a Trainer, Chief Pilot and now Vice President Flight Operations of the biggest airline in West and Central Africa. Sanusi’s appointment may lead to the profitability of the airline as reports indicate that AMCON may have lost about N25 billion for taking over the debts of Aero Contractors The airline stopped operations on September 1, 2016 due to lack of operational funds and the inability to pay for maintenance costs of its aircraft taken out for checks. But it resumed on December 21 with two Boeing B737-500, one Bombardier Dash 8-300 and it is expected to bring in and deploy more aircraft for service. On February 28 last year, AMCON appointed Mr. Tunde Fagbemi as receiver manager briefly before Akinkuotu was appointed the CEO. Industry sources expressed optimism that Aero would bounce back with effective and efficient management.

Donald Trump’s latest Twitter wrath may have backfired. On Wednesday morning, the Tweeter-in-Chief took to his favorite social-media platform to criticize Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s eponymous collection, a decision the retailer said last week was due to poor sales. After widespread coverage of Nordstrom’s decision, Trump’s fingers apparently couldn’t be silent any longer. At 10:51 a.m. ET Wednesday, Trump tweeted his reaction: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person – always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” At 10:55 a.m., Nordstrom’s stock price (which opened at $42.33) dipped to $42.50, down 62 cents from a high of $43.12 roughly an hour before. The dip only proved to be temporary, however, as the stock started climbing again just five minutes later. By the 4 p.m. close Wednesday, Nordstrom’s stock had climbed to $44.53, up $1.75 from the previous day’s close of $42.78. “I wondered [during the dip] if perhaps his supporters had rallied around the wound on the Trump kingdom,” says David Wolfe, creative director of the New York-based retail analysis firm The Doneger Group. “It certainly shows how hyper-sensitive the stock market can be.” Likely also key to the closing price is the updated statement Nordstrom released just before 4 p.m.: “To reiterate what we’ve already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance. Over the past year and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point that it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now. We’ve had a great relationship with the Ivanka Trump team, we’ve had open conversations with them over the past year to share what we’ve seen, and Ivanka was personally informed of our decision in early January.” Nordstrom’s stock price ultimately should be credited to the retailer’s overall performance and not the impact of one tweet, says Sahir Anand, vp research and principal retail analyst for Chicago-based Ensemble IQ/EKN Research. “If you look at retail as a whole, 2016 was not such a good year for department stores in the U.S., but Nordstrom was one of the real bright spots,” he says. “They’re a gold standard of customer service, and they’ve figured out the ideal combination of bricks and clicks. They’ve shown that they make smart decisions based on financial responsibilities, and not by an individual or a particular event. These decisions aren’t based on personalities.” Wolfe agrees. “The products Ivanka Trump’s company has produced have been fine, but not exceptional,” he says. “I’ve been in this business for more than 50 years, and every time, these decisions boil down simply to whether the merchandise sells or not. I know I’ve seen a lot of it at off-price stores, which is not a sign of success.” This isn’t the first time Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to express dissatisfaction with a company: Boeing, Lockheed-Martin and Toyota likewise have experienced the aftereffects of a Trump tweet. This is, however, the first time he’s retweeted from his personal account to his @POTUS account, an action that sparked ethics questions of whether it could be a potential conflict for the president to use a taxpayer-funded Twitter account to comment on a publicly traded company doing business with his daughter. MSNBC analyst and former Tennessee congressman Harold Ford, Jr., addressed the conflict-of-interest issue Wednesday afternoon by asking, “Does he have an investment in this business? That raises the real red flags.” Anand says smart companies know how to handle such tweets, whether they come from Trump or any disgruntled consumer. “Every major company is attuned to social analytics and social sensibility these days,” he says. “It’s almost like a war-room mentality, but that’s what brand management requires in these times.” Ultimately a range of factors is always going to impact a stock price, says Anand. His advice to Nordstrom and others? Ride out the tweetstorm. “Retail is an extremely tough business that depends on consumer confidence, but a brand should be judged on customer satisfaction and fiduciary responsibility,” he says. “The stock market should not judge a brand based on a tweet.” FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Laurie Brookins THRnews@thr.com @thr Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2017 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

CLARY By AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE, WASHINGTON, United States, Feb 9 – A key aide to Donald Trump was facing possible investigation after pitching the clothing line of the president’s daughter Ivanka on television, with top lawmakers from both camps denouncing a major ethics breach and urging “disciplinary action.” Speaking with the White House seal clearly visible over her shoulder, Kellyanne Conway gave Ivanka Trump’s clothing a rave review during a Fox interview early Thursday, urging shoppers to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” “This is just a wonderful line,” she said. “I own some of it.

For Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group which filed a separate complaint, “the law is clear” on such matters. “This is just another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president’s family and supporters.” – Boycott calls – US President Donald Trump tweeted that Ivanka had been “treated so unfairly” by Nordstrom, the upscale department store chain that dropped her line © AFP/File / NICHOLAS KAMM Since his election in November, Trump has targeted a series of American multinationals by name (General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed and others) for moving production overseas or for allegedly overcharging the government. But his tweet targeting Nordstrom marked the first time he had complained directly about the business interests of one of his adult children. The tweet appeared both on Trump’s personal account and on that of the presidency, @POTUS. The Nordstrom group, with 350 stores in the United States and Canada, has repeatedly denied any political motive to its dropping of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line, saying it was motivated purely by “performance” considerations. Sales had fallen, particularly in last year’s second half. But products carrying a Trump brand, including Ivanka’s, have been boycotted by critics of the new president, leading to his complaint of a political motivation behind Nordstrom’s move. TJX Companies, which operates the clothing store chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls, told AFP on Thursday it had instructed store employees no longer to display Ivanka Trump products separately. “The communication we sent to TJ Maxx and Marshalls in the US instructed stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor,” a spokesperson told AFP.

News Business Business News Condom maker Reckitt Benckiser agrees to buy baby food firm Mead Johnson for $16.6bn UK consumer goods giant makes brands including Dettol, Strepsils and French's mustard Paul Jarvis Friday 10 February 2017 09:17 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Nurofen is one of Reckitt Benckiser's biggest brands Reuters Reckitt Benckiser agreed to buy Mead Johnson Nutrition for $16.6bn (£13.3bn), taking the UK consumer-products maker into the baby-food market for the first time and increasing its presence in Asia. The maker of hundreds of household-name brands including Dettol and Cillit Bang will pay $90 a share in cash, it said in a statement Friday, the same price it indicated when it announced it was holding advanced negotiations on the deal 1 February. Reckitt Benckiser said it expects £200m in cost savings by the end of the third year after the purchase. The deal will add to per-share earnings in first full year and will be “double-digit accretive” by the third year, it said. Read more Reckitt Benckiser Tops FTSE 100 Gainers After Confirming $16.7 Billion Mead Johnson Approach Mead Johnson provides a means of stoking growth at Reckitt Benckiser, whose sales are advancing at the slowest pace in more than five years amid tough conditions in Europe and emerging markets like Brazil. The US maker of Enfamil will add annual sales of about $3.7 billion, about half of which comes from Asia. Some analysts say a counter-offer is possible, with the likes of Danone and Nestle having long been regarded as potential suitors. Mead Johnson fell 1.1 per cent to $83.05 in New York trading on Thursday.

The company has proven able to enter and thrive in new categories before, as it did when it acquired Durex condom maker SSL International Plc in 2010. And it already has a toe in the nutrition business from its 2012 purchase of Schiff Nutrition, which makes Omega-3 supplements and joint-pain pills. With a 10 per cent share of the baby-food market, Mead Johnson trails Nestle and Danone globally, though it’s second only to Nestle in Asia, the biggest market. Baby food will likely be one of Asia’s fastest-growing food categories, even as the industry contends with near-term headwinds, Bloomberg Intelligence noted in December.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The Dublin-based company is seeking deals with carriers including Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, Aer Lingus, Alitalia SpA and Deutsche Lufthansa AG under which its flights would help feed passengers onto their long-haul services. Ryanair would be open to adding frequencies in order to provide sufficient connectivity and could ultimately replace many short-haul services operated by network carriers, encouraging them to focus exclusively on intercontinental routes, Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary in an interview. “The upside for us is in persuading the legacy carriers to stop trying to compete with us on short-haul because it feeds their long-haul,” he said. “Work with us on short haul, you lose less money, I’ll have less competition.” Ryanair is seeking to seal accords in time for its summer timetable, with the arrangements likely to see passengers book flights to their end destination via the long-haul carriers’ websites, but fly European sectors on the Irish company’s jets. Baggage would be transferred automatically, though the agreements are likely to stop short of code-share terms, in which airlines sell tickets on each other’s flights as if they were their own. ‘Not Some Scam’ “There’s nothing but upside for the legacy carriers in this, except you’ve got to persuade them it’s not some scam,” O’Leary said in Brussels after a meeting of the A4E airline lobby group. European airlines are grappling with shrinking margins after the low oil price prompted a capacity splurge that’s sent ticket prices tumbling. Ryanair said this week that its fares have slumped 16 percent this winter and are set to continue falling, making it even tougher for full-service carriers to compete on marginal routes. Shares of Ryanair traded 1.2 percent lower at 14.27 euros as of 9:33 a.m. Friday. They fell 3.8 percent Monday when the company disclosed the price decline and an 8 percent drop in fiscal third-quarter earnings. O’Leary cites Aer Lingus’s short-haul business in Dublin to illustrate how the feeder plan would work. The carriers compete directly on 28 services, he said, and while Ryanair wouldn’t seek to take over “trunk routes” a deal would allow the IAG SA unit to forgo unprofitable peripheral operations while connecting to the 85 destinations offered by its discount rival, including Birmingham and Edinburgh. The CEO said he has offered a similar arrangement to Alitalia on routes from Rome and Milan. ‘Way Forward’ “It’s a demonstration of how we can feed a legacy carrier,” he said. “If we can do it in Dublin, why can’t we do it in Italy, why can’t we ultimately do it in Germany with Lufthansa? This is absolutely the way forward for the industry.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up With Ryanair aiming to carry 200 million passengers by 2025, up from 117 million last year, O’Leary said that at least 10 percent of the total, or 20 million clients, are likely to derive from feeder deals. He added that the carrier is ready to expand its fleet by converting options for 100 more Boeing Co. 737 Max 200 jets into firm orders later this year in a deal worth $11.3 billion before discounts. O’Leary said his airline hasn’t completely given up on offering long-haul flights of its own, while reiterating that the plan is low on his list of priorities given the record order backlogs at planemakers Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE. “When Boeing and Airbus have 80 or 100 spare slots for long-haul aircraft that they desperately want to shift at a low cost, we’ll jump on it,” he said. “But we’re not going to kill ourselves at the moment when their order books are full out to 2020-2021.” Ryanair has also been concerned about American opposition to low-cost flights into the U.S. operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, O’Leary said, while adding that the Scandinavian carrier appears now to have established key principles that other airlines can benefit from. Ryanair is separately offering partners the ability to sell tickets via its own web portal as the CEO looks to boost the company’s on-line presence and make it what he calls “the Amazon of travel.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP) Multimedia   ·   User Galleries   ·   News in Pictures Send us your pictures  ·  Send us your stories What To Read Next {{item.title}} Related Links Trump outburst on daughter’s behalf blurs business and politics Brand Melania Trump Media fact-checking more aggressive under Trump Washington - A key aide to Donald Trump was facing possible investigation on Thursday after pitching the clothing line of the president's daughter Ivanka on television, with top lawmakers from both camps denouncing a major ethics breach and urging "disciplinary action". Speaking with the White House seal clearly visible over her shoulder, Kellyanne Conway gave Ivanka Trump's clothing a rave review during a Fox interview early Thursday, urging shoppers to "go buy Ivanka's stuff". "This is just a wonderful line," she said. "I own some of it. I fully - I'm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online." Conway was clearly channelling the anger expressed a day earlier by the president himself, when he tweeted that Ivanka had been "treated so unfairly" by Nordstrom, an upscale department store chain that dropped her fashion brand. Reaction But to Washington traditionalists, Conway's direct pitch from the White House for a product line sold by the president's child seemed a jaw-dropping - and possibly illegal - misuse of presidential prestige. Democrat Elijah Cummings and Republican Jason Chaffetz - both lawmakers on the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which Chaffetz chairs - led calls for Conway to face rebuke. "Conway's statements clearly violate the ethical principles for federal employees and are unacceptable," the congressmen said in a letter to the federal ethics chief, Walter Shaub, requesting that he recommend "appropriate disciplinary action" against her. "What she did was wrong, wrong, wrong," said Chaffetz on Twitter. The Office of Government Ethics, which Shaub heads, separately said it had been "receiving an extraordinary volume of contacts from citizens about recent events". Without mentioning Conway by name, it said it was reaching out to the appropriate government agencies who would decide whether to pursue the matter - the established protocol when the OGE learns of "possible ethics violations". 'The law is clear' Conway said the Trump team was "aware" of the lawmakers' letter and was "reviewing that internally". She also told Fox News she had spoken with the president about the incident and that he "supports me 100 percent". "All I can say, at some point in your life, you ought to have a boss who treated me the way that the president is treating me today." White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump's aide had been "counselled" over the issue, without providing more detail. "Kellyanne Conway's White House Infomercial," as it was dubbed in a scathing New York Times editorial, again fanned debate over the unprecedented level to which the new president - despite his protestations to the contrary - has mixed politics, business and family, raising questions about conflicts of interest. For Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group which filed a separate complaint, "the law is clear" on such matters. "This is just another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president's family and supporters." Boycott calls Since his election in November, Trump has targeted a series of American multinationals by name (General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed and others) for moving production overseas or for allegedly overcharging the government. But his tweet targeting Nordstrom marked the first time he had complained directly about the business interests of one of his adult children. The tweet appeared both on Trump's personal account and on that of the presidency, @POTUS. The Nordstrom group, with 350 stores in the United States and Canada, has repeatedly denied any political motive to its dropping of Ivanka Trump's clothing line, saying it was motivated purely by "performance" considerations. Sales had fallen, particularly in last year's second half. But products carrying a Trump brand, including Ivanka's, have been boycotted by critics of the new president, leading to his complaint of a political motivation behind Nordstrom's move. TJX Companies, which operates the clothing store chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls, told AFP on Thursday it had instructed store employees no longer to display Ivanka Trump products separately. "The communication we sent to TJ Maxx and Marshalls in the US instructed stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor," a spokesperson told AFP.

With no more orders for the F-16 from the Pentagon, Lockheed plans to use its Fort Worth, Texas plant instead to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to. Lockheed would switch F-16 production to India, as long as the Indian government agrees to order hundreds of the planes that its air force desperately needs. Trump has criticised US companies that have moved manufacturing overseas and which then sell their products back to the US. In his first few weeks in office, he has pushed companies, from automakers to pharmaceutical firms, to produce more in the United States. In Lockheed’s case, however, the plan is to build the F-16 to equip the Indian Air Force, and not sell them back into the United States. Lockheed said it has been talking to Trump’s transition and governance teams as well as the US Congress for several months on its plans, including the proposed sale of F-16 planes to India, a spokesman said in Washington. “We’ve briefed the Administration on the current proposal, which was supported by the Obama Administration as part of a broader cooperative dialogue with the Government of India,” the spokesman said. “We understand that the Trump Administration will want to take a fresh look at some of these programmes, and we stand prepared to support that effort to ensure that any deal of this importance is properly aligned with US policy priorities.” India is expected to spend $250 billion on defence modernisation over the next decade, analysts say, and there is concern that a veto on making the F-16 in India would not only hit Lockheed, but also threaten other military contracts to come up in India for Boeing, Northrop and Raytheon. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the plan to build the plane in India. Lockheed has said that moving F-16 assembly to India would create 200 engineering jobs in the United States to help support the production line in India. It has also said that about 800 workers in the United States making the non-Lockheed parts for the F-16 would keep their jobs if construction shifts to India. “We are offering to make the F-16 Block-70 aircraft with a local partner in India. This is an offer exclusive to India,” Randall L Howard, head of F-16 business development, said ahead of India’s biggest air show beginning in Bengaluru next week. In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB’s Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Lords urged to support Brexit bill after MPs vote Sasikala stakes claim, OPS exudes confidence → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent WhatsApp Oman’s top app but women swear by Instagram New blow to Trump’s travel ban Iranians march against Trump ‘threats’ on revolution day Remove Iraq from travel ban list, PM tells US president Read More ...

Michael Theodore Mordaunt created multiple MySpace and Facebook profiles, using an image of a young teenage boy on a surfboard, to contact underage girls from Feb. 25, 2009, through Jan. 15, 2014, Deputy District Attorney Bobby Taghavi said. Mordaunt sought and received sexually explicit photos from multiple girls and carried on sexually charged conversations with some of the girls, Taghavi said. Mordaunt was charged in July 2014 with multiple sex crimes involving girls 12 to 16 years old, according to Taghavi. Mordaunt pleaded guilty to 30 felony counts for charges including luring of a child with intent to commit a specified crime, lewd or lascivious acts with a minor, child pornography and meeting a minor to commit lewd conduct, according to court records. Mordaunt, who was working in information technology for Boeing in Seal Beach, was scheduled to be sentenced March 20.

Published: 05:48 February 10, 2017 AFP   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Washington: A key aide to Donald Trump was facing possible investigation Thursday after pitching the clothing line of the president’s daughter Ivanka on television, in apparent contravention of ethics rules. Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings led calls for Kellyanne Conway to face rebuke after she urged shoppers to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff,” in reference to the first daughter’s fashion brand. “This appears to be a textbook violation of government ethics laws and regulations enacted to prevent the abuse of an employee’s government position,” the lawmaker said in a letter to a Congressional ethics panel. Conway could face investigation by the Office of Inspector General. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump’s aide had been “counselled” over the issue, without providing more detail. Earlier Thursday Conway gave Ivanka Trump’s clothing a rave review during an interview with the Fox network, with the White House seal clearly visible over her left shoulder. “This is just a wonderful line,” she said. “I own some of it. I fully - I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.” Conway was clearly channeling the anger expressed a day earlier by the president himself, when he tweeted that Ivanka had been “treated so unfairly” by Nordstrom, the upscale department store chain that dropped her line. “Terrible,” he added. But to Washington traditionalists, Conway’s direct pitch from the White House for a product line sold by the president’s child seemed a jaw-dropping use of presidential prestige. “The law is clear” said Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group which filed a separate complaint. “This is just another example of what looks like a disturbing pattern of this administration acting to benefit the businesses of the president’s family and supporters.” The message from the White House again fanned debate over the unprecedented level to which the new president - despite his protestations to the contrary - has mixed politics, business and family, raising questions about conflicts of interest. The Office of Government Ethics said its website, phones and email system were “receiving an extraordinary volume of contacts from citizens about recent events.” Without mentioning Conway by name, it said it was reaching out to the appropriate government agencies who would decide whether to pursue the matter - the established protocol when the OGE learns of “possible ethics violations.” Boycott calls Since his election in November, Trump has targeted a series of American multinationals by name (General Motors, Ford, Boeing, Lockheed and others) for moving production overseas or for allegedly overcharging the government. But this was the first time he had complained directly about the business interests of one of his adult children. The tweet appeared both in Trump’s personal feed and on that of the official presidential Twitter account, @POTUS. After Trump’s tweet, shares in Nordstrom briefly dropped but soon began to rise. Toward midday on Thursday, the company’s stock was trading up nearly seven percent over its closing price from two days earlier. The Nordstrom group, with 350 stores in the United States and Canada, has repeatedly denied any political motive to its dropping of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line, saying it was motivated purely by “performance” considerations. Sales had fallen, particularly in last year’s second half. But products carrying a Trump brand, including Ivanka’s, have been boycotted by critics of the new president, leading to his complaint of a political motivation behind Nordstrom’s move. TJX Companies, which operates the clothing store chains TJ Maxx and Marshalls, told AFP on Thursday it had instructed store employees no longer to display Ivanka Trump products separately. “The communication we sent to TJ Maxx and Marshalls in the US instructed stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor,” a spokesperson told AFP.

In India, the F-16 is up against SAAB's Gripen combat aircraft, which the Swedish firm has also offered to make locally, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drives a Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic aerospace industry and reduce costly imports. The Indian government is expected to decide this year on which company will build a single-engine fighter plane, in collaboration with a local partner. A defence official said the process was at a very early stage. The Indian air force alone needs 200-250 fighters over the next 10 years, its former chief Arup Raha said before he left office in December. Defence ties between India and the United States have grown rapidly, with US arms sales of more than $4 billion in 2012-15, mostly under government-to-government foreign military sales, upstaging long term supplier Russia and even Israel. Lockheed's executive director for international business development, Abhay Paranjape, said his team has met with representatives from 40 defence and aviation firms in India to help build the ancillary network for the aircraft assembly programme. "We want to be prepared, that's why we started the ground work," he said, adding Lockheed has also scouted possible factory sites in India. Lockheed has a joint venture with India's Tata Advanced Systems Ltd to make airframe components for the C-130J Super Hercules transport plane and the S-92 helicopter. "The capability for building components exists here, it's been proven with the C-130s. The challenge now is to pick the right partners," Paranjape said.

Trump signaled support for the Export-Import Bank, a small but controversial government agency that subsidizes American exporters, the Democrats say. For years, Republicans in Congress and their allies have taken aim at the agency, which they say represents the epitome of government intervention in the free market. Opposition to Ex-Im was a rallying cry for tea party activists and a litmus test for conservatives in Congress. Trump himself called the bank unnecessary. But on Thursday, the president told lawmakers he wants the Ex-Im Bank to continue subsidizing exports, said two Democrats who met with him, Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joseph Manchin III (W.Va.). "I favor it. I want to get it done, get it working," Manchin recalled Trump saying Thursday. "He said, 'I had not been in that position. I changed that position once I understood the disadvantage we were at in competing globally and what it means to the jobs here in America.' " Heitkamp offered a similar account of the meeting. Later Thursday, a White House spokeswoman declined to confirm that account. "There are multiple options on the table, but I don’t have any more specific details," said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters. The Export-Import bank helps U.S. exporters sell their products abroad but has been unable to act for over a year due to opposition from GOP lawmakers. The bank's significance for the federal government's bottom line and for the U.S. economy overall is relatively small in terms of dollars, but conservative lawmakers have made the bank into a symbol of what they say is Washington's cozy — and wasteful — relationship with big business. "This is a profound debate we are having," House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said in 2015, arguing that the bank's operations should be suspended. "It is about what kind of economy we are going to have," he added. Supporting the bank would be consistent with Trump's general view that Washington must act to help American manufacturing compete internationally, a governing philosophy that has set him at odds with Republican free-market orthodoxy. Conservative lawmakers shut down the bank for five months in 2015. Congress eventually reopened the bank, but for months, it has been unable to offer guarantees worth more than $10 million because there are only two people on the bank's board. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) has prevented Congress from confirming new members. Trump pledged to nominate another member to the board, according to Heitkamp. A third member would establish a quorum, allowing regular lending to resume. "It’s great news he agreed and said he would nominate someone to serve on the Ex-Im Bank Board very soon so the agency — which has been stalled for a year — can fully function and keep supporting American workers and small businesses," the senator said in a statement. If Trump does follow through on what the Democrats say is his position on the Ex-Im Bank, it would represent a change of mind for the president that will put him at odds with Republicans in Congress. Many of them have denounced the bank's lending as undue interference in the free market and called for its termination. Early in the presidential campaign, Trump suggested he was against the bank. "I don’t like it because I don’t think it’s necessary," Trump told Bloomberg in 2015. He called the bank "feather bedding" for "a few companies — and these are companies that can do very well without it." Last year, however, Trump was ambivalent, saying that corporate leaders were persuading him of the bank's importance. "The standard conservative thought is to reject it," Trump said in that interview. The bank subsidizes exports by offering direct loans as well as credit guarantees to foreign companies buying American products. The bulk of the loans subsidize a few major companies. Fifty-seven percent of the bank's lending went to five corporations in 2013, according to an analysis by economist Veronique de Rugy. Boeing alone received $8.3 billion in guarantees and other support, de Rugy found — about a third of the total. "It’s just the principle," said Simon Lester, an attorney at the libertarian Cato Institute. "It’s such a pure example of the problem that we see, even though the amounts are not as high as other programs out there," he added. "You don’t need the government to fund Boeing on its export sales." Proponents argue that foreign countries have similar public lenders of their own, and that as long as the Export-Import Bank is crippled, U.S. firms will be at a disadvantage. "If international customers of tractors, turbines, airplanes or satellites can’t get financing from the United States, they’ll simply take their business elsewhere to one of the dozens of other countries with similar export-credit assistance," Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said last year.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in weather TJX enters Ivanka Trump clothing line fray Thursday Feb 9, 2017 at 8:00 PM Feb 9, 2017 at 8:44 PM Jonathan Phelps @JPhelps_MW FRAMINGHAM — T.J. Maxx and Marshalls still carry Ivanka Trump's clothing line, but a directive for stores to move the clothes onto general merchandise racks and throw out promotional signs is sparking interest across the country. The move comes as President Donald Trump blasted the luxury department store Nordstrom Wednesday morning for dropping his 35-year-old daughter's clothing and accessory line.     "My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!," Trump tweeted from his personal account, @realDonaldTrump.  My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by@Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)February 8, 2017 TJX Companies, headquartered in Framingham, operates T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods stores.  The New York Times this week reported on a note sent to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls store employees telling them to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump products. "Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into” the racks where most products hang, the note, obtained by the New York Times, said. "All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded." Erika Tower, a spokeswoman for TJX, said in a statement Thursday the company aims "to offer a merchandise mix that gives our customers a choice in what they may want to purchase." The store is constantly changing its selection.  "From time to time, we communicate with our stores about how to handle merchandise. The communication we sent instructed stores to mix this line of merchandise into our racks, not to remove it from the sales floor," she wrote in the statement.  Though President Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors, ethics experts say this time was different. It involved his daughter’s business, which raises conflict-of-interest concerns. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, in an interview with Fox News from the White House briefing room Thursday, encouraged people to "go buy Ivanka’s stuff." She boasted that she was giving the brand "a free commercial here." While Trump himself is not subject to the standards of ethical conduct for federal employees, Conway is. Among the rules: An employee shall not use his or her office "for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise."  White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was responding to an "attack on his daughter" when he posted the tweet and that "he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success." On Wednesday, Nordstrom reiterated that its decision was based on the brand’s performance, not politics. The company said sales of Ivanka Trump items had steadily declined over the past year, particularly in the last half of 2016, "to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now." As of Thursday afternoon, the president has not tweeted about T.J. Maxx or Marshalls.  Materials from the Associated Press and WCVB-TV, a Daily News partner, was used in this report.  Jonathan Phelps can be reached at 508-626-4338 or jphelps@wickedlocal.com.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump told airline and airport executives Thursday that he is interested in privatizing America's air traffic control system and improving the nation's airports and roads, which he called obsolete. Trump also promised to roll back government regulations and said he will announce a plan in the next three weeks to reduce taxes on businesses. But he sounded skeptical about raising fees that airline passengers pay to fund airport improvements. One issue was notably absent during the White House meeting — Trump's executive order to temporarily ban travel to the U.S. from seven mostly-Muslim countries. Airline leaders had criticized the order, which a federal appeals court refused to reinstate Thursday after it was suspended by a lower-court ruling. Airline and airport executives who emerged from the White House meeting called it a positive session. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly told Trump the best way to help airlines would be to "modernize the air traffic control system." He complained that money spent on the system has not improved it. "I hear we're spending billions and billions of dollars, it's a system that's totally out of whack," Trump said. Some airline executives and Republicans in Congress have proposed privatizing air traffic control because they say the Federal Aviation Administration has moved too slowly on modernization and would benefit by being removed from the uncertain congressional budget process. Other lawmakers oppose reducing Congress' oversight of aviation, and business and private aircraft owners worry their costs will go up. Nick Calio, president of Airlines for America, the trade group that represents most major airlines but not Delta, said Trump was "extraordinarily positive" when airline executives urged him to spin off air traffic control operations from the Federal Aviation Administration and place them under the control of a private, nonprofit corporation. While Trump supported modernizing the air traffic system, he did not explicitly endorse privatization, said another participant, Kevin Burke, president of Airports Council International-North America. Unlike the U.S., most countries separate air traffic control duties from their aviation-safety agencies. But it is unusual to actually privatize air traffic operations. Canada is an exception. Republican congressman Bill Shuster, chairman of the House transportation committee, introduced legislation to privatize the system last year. The bill stalled, however, after running into opposition from other top lawmakers and business-jet owners, who fear that the private corporation's board would be dominated by airlines, and that they would lose access to larger airports and pay a larger share of the system's costs. The privatization effort has the backing of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, although other FAA unions are opposed. The FAA said it has spent $7.5 billion on modernizing air traffic control in the last seven years, resulting in $2.7 billion in benefits to passengers and airlines. It predicts it will produce much larger benefits over the next 13 years. Trump, who once ran his own airline, pledged to help the airlines deliver "the greatest service" with minimum delays and at the lowest cost. He compared infrastructure in the United States unfavorably with other countries. "Our airports used to be the best, now they're at the bottom of the rung," he said. "We have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports, we have obsolete trains, we have bad roads. We're going to change all of that." Airport officials told Trump they'd like to increase the fee airline passengers pay airports as part of their tickets so that the money could help with modernization. Airlines oppose an increase, and Trump said he doesn't like raising fees, participants said. Airlines were partly deregulated in 1978 but must still work closely with government. They complain about recent regulations including fees that raise ticket prices, and rules on how they can advertise fares and what information they must disclose to the public. American, Delta and United and their unions are appealing to Washington for help in blocking competition from Middle Eastern carriers that they say are unfairly subsidized by their governments, letting them offer artificially low fares. That issue came up only briefly on Thursday, with Trump saying he wants "to make life good" for foreign airlines too. From Wilson to Trump: 100 years of election front pages Twists and turns in 2 minutes: Election night rewind Melania Trump ... before she was first lady-in-waiting "They come with big investments," Trump said. "In many cases those investments are made by their governments, but they are still big investments." Earlier this week White House press secretary Sean Spicer praised the economic impact of Norwegian Air, which is basing pilots in the U.S. and ordering U.S.-made planes from Boeing. The U.S. airlines and their unions say Norwegian and the Middle Eastern carriers threaten American jobs. Trump's travel ban never came up, Spicer said. Protests against last month's order clogged airports, and airlines struggled to comply with the requirement to ban some of their passengers from traveling. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said in a letter to employees that the Trump order "does not affect the values that this company is built upon — those of diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance." Parker missed the meeting with Trump — he stayed home in Dallas for a previously scheduled meeting with 1,600 employees. United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz, who was at the session with Trump, has also criticized the order. Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former American executive, said airline leaders were wise not to bring up the subject on Thursday. "They are in a business which requires a lot of 'go along to get along' with government agencies," Mann said. "They want to try to make nice." ___ Koenig reporting from Dallas. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that the CEO of American Airlines did not attend the meeting.

PTI Simran Sodhi & Mukesh Ranjan Tribune News Service New Delhi, February 9 The Rajya Sabha today saw repeated adjournments and was unable to function as the Opposition raised objections to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks made a day earlier. In the Lok Sabha too, the Congress today staged a walkout during Zero Hour in protest against the chair’s ruling of not allowing its floor leader Mallikarjun Kharge from raising the party’s objection to Modi’s “raincoat” remark against his predecessor Manmohan Singh. In the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition parties were particularly agitated over the remarks the PM made with reference to former Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Indira Gandhi, alleging Modi used “abusive” and “insulting” language. The members demanded an apology from the PM over his remarks. The House was first adjourned till noon and then till 2 pm. Congress’ Anand Sharma said Rule 238 disallowed use of offensive expression during a debate. “Prime Minister yesterday insulted the memory of Indira Gandhi. He has dragged political debate to a new low… he was abusive… we will oppose him,” he said. CPM leader Sitaram Yechury gave a notice under Rule 267 over the Prime Minister’s reference to late Communist leader Jyotirmoy Basu during his speech of Wednesday but the Chair rejected it. The Congress was joined in by the CPM and JD(U) saying they were not given an opportunity to seek clarifications during the debate yesterday despite Chairman Hamid Ansari citing precedence and tradition of the House that gave members the right to seek such response after Prime Minister or a minister’s statement. But it was not just the Congress members who were agitated but AIADMK counterparts also entered the well of the House demanding that Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao should discharge his Constitutional duty by swearing in VK Sasikala as Chief Minister without wasting any further time.  In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Sumitra Mahajan ruled that the matter relating to the other House could not be raised amid noisy scene created by members of the treasury benches. Congress members first trooped into the Well raising slogans “Prime Minister mafi mango (PM should apologise)” and “Prime Minister shame, shame...” and then walked out of the House. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar was also heard saying the issue could not be raised in the Lok Sabha. However, Kharge, before being cut by the Speaker, said, whatever Mr Modi has said about Dr Singh is not good for parliamentary democracy. He also noted that what the Prime Minister had said was an insult to the country. Taking a dig at Manmohan, Modi had said he knew the art of taking bath wearing a raincoat as there were many scams during his government, but he remained untainted. Earlier, the ongoing power struggle in Tamil Nadu was also played out in the Lok Sabha with AIADMK members disrupting proceedings by raising slogans apparently supporting VK Sasikala as the next Chief Minister. The Speaker asked them to raise the issue during Zero Hour and later adjourned the proceedings for nearly 20 minutes till 11.30 am. 74 missing defence men ‘in Pak custody’ Seventy-four missing defence personnel are believed to be in Pakistan's custody but whose presence has not been acknowledged so far by that country, the government said. Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh said the government has raised the matter with the Pakistan Government on numerous occasions, including at high levels.

Terminals at 4 ports for cruise tourism To boost cruise tourism, the government has developed terminals at four major ports — Mumbai, Mormugao, New Mangalore and Cochin — and also allowed foreign vessels to call without licence from the Director General of Shipping, Parliament was informed on Thursday.

From left are, Deborah Ale Flint, executive director of Los Angeles World Airports; Trump; and UPS President of US operations Myron Gray. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press) By Joan Lowy and David Koenig | AP By Joan Lowy and David Koenig | AP February 9 at 7:12 PM WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told airline and airport executives Thursday that he is interested in privatizing America’s air traffic control system and improving the nation’s airports and roads, which he called obsolete. Trump also promised to roll back government regulations and said he will announce a plan in the next three weeks to reduce taxes on businesses. But he sounded skeptical about raising fees that airline passengers pay to fund airport improvements. One issue was notably absent during the White House meeting — Trump’s executive order to temporarily ban travel to the U.S. from seven mostly-Muslim countries. Airline leaders had criticized the order, which a federal appeals court refused to reinstate Thursday after it was suspended by a lower-court ruling. Airline and airport executives who emerged from the White House meeting called it a positive session. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly told Trump the best way to help airlines would be to “modernize the air traffic control system.” He complained that money spent on the system has not improved it. “I hear we’re spending billions and billions of dollars, it’s a system that’s totally out of whack,” Trump said. Some airline executives and Republicans in Congress have proposed privatizing air traffic control because they say the Federal Aviation Administration has moved too slowly on modernization and would benefit by being removed from the uncertain congressional budget process. Other lawmakers oppose reducing Congress’ oversight of aviation, and business and private aircraft owners worry their costs will go up. Nick Calio, president of Airlines for America, the trade group that represents most major airlines but not Delta, said Trump was “extraordinarily positive” when airline executives urged him to spin off air traffic control operations from the Federal Aviation Administration and place them under the control of a private, nonprofit corporation. While Trump supported modernizing the air traffic system, he did not explicitly endorse privatization, said another participant, Kevin Burke, president of Airports Council International-North America. Unlike the U.S., most countries separate air traffic control duties from their aviation-safety agencies. But it is unusual to actually privatize air traffic operations. Canada is an exception. Republican congressman Bill Shuster, chairman of the House transportation committee, introduced legislation to privatize the system last year. The bill stalled, however, after running into opposition from other top lawmakers and business-jet owners, who fear that the private corporation’s board would be dominated by airlines, and that they would lose access to larger airports and pay a larger share of the system’s costs. The privatization effort has the backing of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, although other FAA unions are opposed. The FAA said it has spent $7.5 billion on modernizing air traffic control in the last seven years, resulting in $2.7 billion in benefits to passengers and airlines. It predicts it will produce much larger benefits over the next 13 years. Trump, who once ran his own airline, pledged to help the airlines deliver “the greatest service” with minimum delays and at the lowest cost. He compared infrastructure in the United States unfavorably with other countries. “Our airports used to be the best, now they’re at the bottom of the rung,” he said. “We have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports, we have obsolete trains, we have bad roads. We’re going to change all of that.” Airport officials told Trump they’d like to increase the fee airline passengers pay airports as part of their tickets so that the money could help with modernization. Airlines oppose an increase, and Trump said he doesn’t like raising fees, participants said. Airlines were partly deregulated in 1978 but must still work closely with government. They complain about recent regulations including fees that raise ticket prices, and rules on how they can advertise fares and what information they must disclose to the public. American, Delta and United and their unions are appealing to Washington for help in blocking competition from Middle Eastern carriers that they say are unfairly subsidized by their governments, letting them offer artificially low fares. That issue came up only briefly on Thursday, with Trump saying he wants “to make life good” for foreign airlines too. “They come with big investments,” Trump said. “In many cases those investments are made by their governments, but they are still big investments.” Earlier this week White House press secretary Sean Spicer praised the economic impact of Norwegian Air, which is basing pilots in the U.S. and ordering U.S.-made planes from Boeing. The U.S. airlines and their unions say Norwegian and the Middle Eastern carriers threaten American jobs. Trump’s travel ban never came up, Spicer said. Protests against last month’s order clogged airports, and airlines struggled to comply with the requirement to ban some of their passengers from traveling. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said in a letter to employees that the Trump order “does not affect the values that this company is built upon — those of diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance.” Parker missed the meeting with Trump — he stayed home in Dallas for a previously scheduled meeting with 1,600 employees. United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz, who was at the session with Trump, has also criticized the order. Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former American executive, said airline leaders were wise not to bring up the subject on Thursday. “They are in a business which requires a lot of ‘go along to get along’ with government agencies,” Mann said. “They want to try to make nice.” ___ Koenig reporting from Dallas. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that the CEO of American Airlines did not attend the meeting.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) AP American Airlines pilots say CEO should've met with Trump By DAVID KOENIG AP Airlines Writer Feb 10, 2017 Updated 9 hrs ago 0 Evan Vucci Southwest CEO Gary Kelly speaks during a meeting between President Donald Trump and airline executives in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) DALLAS (AP) — The head of the pilots' union at American Airlines is blasting the carrier's CEO for skipping a meeting with President Donald Trump to attend a company event in Dallas. Union President Dan Carey said Friday that CEO Doug Parker missed a chance to talk to Trump about issues confronting airline workers, including the threat from fast-growing foreign competitors. "For our airline's CEO to say 'no thanks' to President Trump flat-out amazes me," Carey said. Parker said he needed to attend an event Thursday for 1,600 employees, where he stressed the importance of managers taking care of their workers. He said he made sure that other CEOs talked to Trump about the industry's agenda, including modernizing the air traffic control system and reducing taxes and regulation. The CEOs of Delta, United, Southwest, Alaska and JetBlue attended the White House meeting. Carey's union, the Allied Pilots Association, and the larger Air Line Pilots Association, are targeting Norwegian Air, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways. The unions and big U.S. airlines say those foreign carriers avoid labor laws or get huge subsidies from their governments that let them expand and threaten jobs at U.S. airlines. That subject came up only briefly Thursday, and it did not go well for the U.S. airlines. Trump praised the big investments that foreign airlines make in the U.S. — an apparent reference to hiring U.S.-based crews and ordering planes made by Chicago-based Boeing — even if the money comes from their governments. None of the CEOs challenged him on the issue. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

The Minuteman is an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, capable of carrying nuclear warheads. U.S. Air Force officials say the operational launch was conducted to verify the missile's capability as a nuclear deterrent. Prior to the launch, the missile was taken from a silo at Minot AFB and reassembled at Vandenberg. The launch was conducted by Airmen from the 91st Missile Wing. The ICBM was fitted with a re-entry vehicle, and traveled approximately 2,200 miles to a test range near the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The Minuteman III is operated by the Air Force Global Strike Command as an part of an effort to discourage the use of nuclear weapons against the United States. The Air Force says it has 450 Minuteman III missiles in its arsenal. The Boeing-built weapon weighs over 79,000 pounds, has an effective range of 5,218 nautical miles, and reaches speeds of approximately 15,000 miles-per-hour.

Life Travel Trump shows interest in privatizing air traffic control Originally published February 10, 2017 at 10:15 am In meeting that included Alaska Airlines CEO, president calls America’s system “totally out of whack.” Share story By JOAN LOWY and DAVID KOENIG Associated Press WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump told airline and airport executives Thursday that he is interested in privatizing America’s air traffic control system and improving the nation’s airports and roads, which he called obsolete.

Photo Credit: Air Canada Air Canada announces black to the future colour scheme By Terry Haig | english@rcinet.ca Friday 10 February, 2017 , No Comments ↓ Share Canada’s national airline is changing its logo and its livery. Call it a new twist to an old look, one that was pretty much dropped nearly a quarter-century ago because too many people said Air Canada logo looked way too much a hockey puck. On Thursday, the company unveiled a new look. It’s adding black–big time–to the traditional red-and-white colour scheme on its fleet of 300 planes. Tails, engines and undersides as well as the Air Canada lettering on the side of planes will be now be black while the red maple leaf will be on the fin. Staff uniforms will move from predominantly blue and red to black. Some older Canadian travellers have likely have seen shades of this scheme before. Prior to an overhaul 24 years ago, Air Canada’s maple leaf in a circle logo was known by the French word for hockey puck, or “rondelle.” The rondelle was replaced by a simple maple leaf. Air Canada is currently upgrading its fleet with 83 new planes from Boeing and Bombardier. All will arrive with Air Canada’s new colours. The airline introduced the makeover at events in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.

Business & Tech Eamonn Farrell, RollingNews 10:45 10 Feb 2017 Joseph Conroy 23 hours ago Ryanair is reported to be "closing in" on deals which would see it consolidate its dominant position in Europe's short-haul travel market. It is believed to be working on agreements with major European airlines, including Aer Lingus, Norwegian Air, Lufthansa and Alitalia according to Bloomberg, which would see RA provide short-haul feeder flights for its rivals' long-haul services. "The upside for us is in persuading the legacy carriers to stop trying to compete with us on short-haul because it feeds their long-haul ... Work with us on short haul, you lose less money, I’ll have less competition," CEO Michael O'Leary commented. This could lead to customers booking a flight with one of these carriers through the legacy brand's website, while Ryanair would operate the short-haul part of the trip, bringing flyers to these companies' long-haul hubs. Michael O'Leary argues that this would be a 'win win' agreement. "There’s nothing but upside for the legacy carriers in this, except you’ve got to persuade them it’s not some scam," he added, speaking in Brussels. He cited the example of RA and Aer Lingus competing on tight-margin routes for Dublin as an example of a situation where working together could allow both companies to play to their strengths. Commenting on transatlantic services he reiterated his stance that the airline will stick to short haul flights in the coming years, until, "Boeing and Airbus have 80 or 100 spare slots for long-haul aircraft that they desperately want to shift at a low cost." If that situation arises the company will "jump" at the opportunity. 10:45 10 Feb 2017 Joseph Conroy 23 hours ago 4 Related articles Craft beer collaboration boosts Jameson sales La La Land gamble saves studio's year Poor performances don't affect Manchester United's results Donald Trump tweet could land him in legal difficulties most popular latest sport Ryanair could soon be facing less competition Tusla 'apologising fully' to Maurice McCabe Rangers announce manager Mark Warburton has resigned Guinness PRO12 Results: Wins for Munster and Ulster site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Subscribe free to our newsletters via your Email Address SPACE DAILY SPACE WAR TERRA DAILY ENERGY NEWS MARS DAILY GPS DAILY SEED DAILY WIND DAILY DISASTER NEWS SOLAR ENERGY MEDICAL NEWS NUCLEAR NEWS OIL & GAS NEWS BIO FUEL DAILY JAPAN NEWS Looking to the future: Russia, US mull post-ISS cooperation in space by Staff Writers Moscow (Sputnik) Feb 10, 2017 NASA and Roscosmos have been involved in joint projects since 1993, and before that, NASA worked with the Soviet space program. NASA may have to book seats for American astronauts on Russian Soyuz spaceships in 2018. Radio Sputnik discussed the issue with John Logsdon, Professor Emeritus of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University. "The relationship between NASA and the former Soviet Union goes back a long way with the highlight being the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz project. But with Russia taking over, the two countries basically merged their space programs with the launch of the ISS, which has proven very successful," Professor Logsdon said. When asked which of the joint US-Russian projects on the ISS he saw as the most important, he said that the mere fact that the US and Russia are the chief partners, along with Europe, Japan and Canada, in managing the space outpost is the real achievement. "The hardware is provided by the United States, by Russia, by Canada, Japan and Europe, astronauts and cosmonauts from all the partner countries are there," Dr. Logsdon continued. Mentioning the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), NASA and Roscosmos have agreed to build together for the ISS, John Logsdon said that Mr. Bigelow, who had been trying for years to put private inflatable modules in orbit, had finally managed to do so using Russian launch vehicles. "Now they want to take a small, room-size inflatable module and attach it to one of the ISS' docking ports to see if it can be used to live in and conduct scientific experiments." When asked whether the lunar reconnaissance orbital telescope, used since 2009, has brought any tangible results, Dr. Logsdon said that people now know the exact location of water on the Moon's surface. "The idea is that in the dark craters of the Moon, at the North and South Poles, there are deposits of water, which could eventually be used as a rocket fuel. Speaking about future cooperation between NASA and Roscosmos, Dr. Logsdon said that because the ISS will eventually be decommissioned as its hardware will eventually run out, Russia and the US will have to agree when exactly this is going to happen. "They have agreed to operate this station through at least 2024. Russia wants to separate its modules from the ISS and make them the core of its new space station and if that happens, it would be an interesting development," Dr. Logsdon noted. "I think the toughest issue of our future cooperation is what to do about the continuity on the ISS and what Russia, the US and other partners are going to do in the vicinity of or even on the surface of the Moon in the 2020s and 2030s." When asked if he expected any changes in this cooperation under President Trump, John Logsdon mentioned Trump's stated desire to work closely with Russia on a wide variety of issues. "He hasn't really addressed his policy with respect to space yet so how he will configure that to include Russia as a future partner is still up in the air," Dr. Logsdon added. NASA is already using Russian space rockets, but plans to switch to US ships. Earlier, in 2016, NASA announced it won't be working with Russia's Roscosmos space agency any more to transport its people to the ISS. NASA's Associate Administrator for the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate, William Gerstenmaier, told journalists in October that NASA had no such plans and hopes to begin delivering astronauts to the International Space Station via Boeing and SpaceX ships this year. However, neither will be ready until late 2018 at best. Despite NASA's eagerness to ditch Russian transport ships, cooperation continued in other areas. For instance, the agencies agreed on building a Bigelow Expandable Activity Module for the ISS together. The agencies previously worked together on projects like the Mars Odyssey satellite, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter telescope, and the Curiosity rover. NASA and Roscosmos have been involved in joint projects since 1993, and before that, NASA worked with the Soviet space program.

The three justices on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday against immediately reinstating President Donald Trump's travel ban, which temporarily suspended the nation's refugee program and immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries that have raised terrorism concerns. Here's a look at the justices and their questioning during arguments in the case this week: WILLIAM CANBY Canby rarely hears cases anymore. Now 85, he told the Associated Press two years ago that he felt sharp and healthy, but didn't want to risk a job hazard that federal judges with lifetime appointments face: age-related mental decline. So it was unusual for the judge to hear oral arguments over the Trump travel ban. Canby a former U.S. Air Force lieutenant and Peace Corps worker in Africa who was appointed to the 9th Circuit by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 is known to have a polite and respectful courtroom demeanor. He encourages attorneys to have interests outside the law and told a reporter in 2005 he was running two to three miles before starting his day. He has written extensively about Native American law. Among his more high-profile decisions was a 1988 ruling declaring the U.S. Army's ban on gay soldiers unconstitutional and a 2000 decision that said the PGA Tour is covered by federal disability law and must provide a cart to golfer Casey Martin. During oral arguments, he challenged the administration's justification for the ban. Later, Canby appeared to come to the rescue of the attorney challenging the ban when another judge was grilling him about what evidence he had that the travel ban was motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment. Canby asked the attorney who had the legal burden of showing the likelihood of succeeding on their arguments in the case. The attorney responded that that burden was on the administration. RICHARD CLIFTON Clifton, nominated to the 9th Circuit by George W. Bush in 2001, is the second judge from Hawaii to serve on the 9th Circuit. He grew up in the Midwest, but moved to Hawaii to clerk for another 9th Circuit judge after graduating from Yale Law School in 1975. He is still based there. Clifton, 66, was a lawyer for the Hawaii Republican Party, but has described himself as not having a pronounced political philosophy. He handled business and commercial litigation for a prominent Hawaii law firm and had never served as a judge before joining the 9th Circuit. He received nearly unanimous support for his nomination in the U.S. Senate. At his confirmation hearing, California Rep. Christopher Cox described Clifton as a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, Cub Scout den leader, and dedicated husband and father who had some important credentials for being an appeals court judge: He refereed youth soccer. Since joining the court, Clifton has ruled in favor of a Los Angeles ordinance that required hotel operators to open their guest registries at the demand of police and called for a harsher prison sentence for a terrorist who plotted to blow up Los Angeles International Airport. Of the three judges who heard arguments over the travel ban, Clifton had the toughest questions for the attorney representing the two states Washington and Minnesota challenging it. He asked what evidence the attorney had that the president's travel ban was motivated by religious prejudice. At one point, Clifton pressed him, "Do I have to believe everything you allege and say, `Well, that must be right." But Clifton also grilled the administration's attorney, asking him whether he denied statements by Trump about banning Muslims. The attorney said he didn't. MICHELLE FRIEDLAND At 44, Friedland is one of the two youngest federal appeals judges in the country. President Barack Obama appointed her in 2014, and during her confirmation hearing she received support from both parties. Friedland was born in California and attended school in New Jersey, where her father worked as the president of a clothing company and her mother was a writing instructor and freelancer, according to Friedland's 2000 wedding announcement in The New York Times. She graduated with honors from Stanford University, studied at Oxford University on a Fulbright Scholarship and then got her law degree at Stanford University. She later clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. In private practice, she represented major clients, including Berkshire Hathaway, Boeing and the University of California. She was recognized along with a handful of other members of her firm by the California Bar Association for pro-bono work defending the constitutionality of California's ban on sexual orientation "conversion therapy." She also represented same-sex couples challenging California's gay-marriage ban. With less than three years on the appeals court, a full picture of Friedland's judicial philosophy has yet to emerge, some legal scholars say. Of the three judges at Tuesday's hearing, she appeared to be the most sympathetic to Washington state's case, repeatedly questioning the Justice Department's lawyer over the basis for the travel ban: "Have you offered any evidence to support this need you're describing for the executive order, or are you really arguing that we can't even ask about whether there's evidence because this decision is non-reviewable?"

Evan Vucci AP Photo 1 of 2 i By JOAN LOWY and DAVID KOENIG Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON President Donald Trump told airline and airport executives Thursday that he is interested in privatizing America's air traffic control system and improving the nation's airports and roads, which he called obsolete. Trump also promised to roll back government regulations and said he will announce a plan in the next three weeks to reduce taxes on businesses. But he sounded skeptical about raising fees that airline passengers pay to fund airport improvements. One issue was notably absent during the White House meeting — Trump's executive order to temporarily ban travel to the U.S. from seven mostly-Muslim countries. Airline leaders had criticized the order, which a federal appeals court refused to reinstate Thursday after it was suspended by a lower-court ruling. Airline and airport executives who emerged from the White House meeting called it a positive session. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly told Trump the best way to help airlines would be to "modernize the air traffic control system." He complained that money spent on the system has not improved it. "I hear we're spending billions and billions of dollars, it's a system that's totally out of whack," Trump said. Some airline executives and Republicans in Congress have proposed privatizing air traffic control because they say the Federal Aviation Administration has moved too slowly on modernization and would benefit by being removed from the uncertain congressional budget process. Other lawmakers oppose reducing Congress' oversight of aviation, and business and private aircraft owners worry their costs will go up. Nick Calio, president of Airlines for America, the trade group that represents most major airlines but not Delta, said Trump was "extraordinarily positive" when airline executives urged him to spin off air traffic control operations from the Federal Aviation Administration and place them under the control of a private, nonprofit corporation. While Trump supported modernizing the air traffic system, he did not explicitly endorse privatization, said another participant, Kevin Burke, president of Airports Council International-North America. Unlike the U.S., most countries separate air traffic control duties from their aviation-safety agencies. But it is unusual to actually privatize air traffic operations. Canada is an exception. Republican congressman Bill Shuster, chairman of the House transportation committee, introduced legislation to privatize the system last year. The bill stalled, however, after running into opposition from other top lawmakers and business-jet owners, who fear that the private corporation's board would be dominated by airlines, and that they would lose access to larger airports and pay a larger share of the system's costs. The privatization effort has the backing of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, although other FAA unions are opposed. The FAA said it has spent $7.5 billion on modernizing air traffic control in the last seven years, resulting in $2.7 billion in benefits to passengers and airlines. It predicts it will produce much larger benefits over the next 13 years. Trump, who once ran his own airline, pledged to help the airlines deliver "the greatest service" with minimum delays and at the lowest cost. He compared infrastructure in the United States unfavorably with other countries. "Our airports used to be the best, now they're at the bottom of the rung," he said. "We have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports, we have obsolete trains, we have bad roads. We're going to change all of that." Airport officials told Trump they'd like to increase the fee airline passengers pay airports as part of their tickets so that the money could help with modernization. Airlines oppose an increase, and Trump said he doesn't like raising fees, participants said. Airlines were partly deregulated in 1978 but must still work closely with government. They complain about recent regulations including fees that raise ticket prices, and rules on how they can advertise fares and what information they must disclose to the public. American, Delta and United and their unions are appealing to Washington for help in blocking competition from Middle Eastern carriers that they say are unfairly subsidized by their governments, letting them offer artificially low fares. That issue came up only briefly on Thursday, with Trump saying he wants "to make life good" for foreign airlines too. "They come with big investments," Trump said. "In many cases those investments are made by their governments, but they are still big investments." Earlier this week White House press secretary Sean Spicer praised the economic impact of Norwegian Air, which is basing pilots in the U.S. and ordering U.S.-made planes from Boeing. The U.S. airlines and their unions say Norwegian and the Middle Eastern carriers threaten American jobs. Trump's travel ban never came up, Spicer said. Protests against last month's order clogged airports, and airlines struggled to comply with the requirement to ban some of their passengers from traveling. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said in a letter to employees that the Trump order "does not affect the values that this company is built upon — those of diversity, inclusiveness and tolerance." Parker missed the meeting with Trump — he stayed home in Dallas for a previously scheduled meeting with 1,600 employees. United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz, who was at the session with Trump, has also criticized the order. Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former American executive, said airline leaders were wise not to bring up the subject on Thursday. "They are in a business which requires a lot of 'go along to get along' with government agencies," Mann said. "They want to try to make nice." ___ Koenig reporting from Dallas.
